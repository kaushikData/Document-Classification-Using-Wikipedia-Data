'''Al-Lawatia''' ({{lang-ar|اللواتية}}, sing. Lawati) is an ethnocultural group primarily based in the province of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Oman]].

==Origins==
The Lawatis originate from Muttrah in Muscat, and India, and they are [[Khoja]], of [[Sindhi people | Sindhi]] origin. Most Lawatis converted to [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] in the 19th century from [[Ismaili]] Shia Islam following a dispute regarding the legitimacy of the [[Aga Khan]]'s leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.bh/books?id=B8wnEtH8oDgC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=lawatia+origins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dj6pU_qgFOjE0QWirIGIDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lawatia%20origins&amp;f=false Transnational Shia Politics: Religious and Political Networks in the Gulf. By Laurence Louër. pg 147.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics and role in the Persian Gulf==
The majority of Lawatis reside in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], the capital of Oman, but some live on the coast of [[Al-Batina]]. Some Lawati families reside elsewhere in the [[Persian Gulf]] region such as the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Kuwait]].

Traditionally, Al-Lawatia have been known as prominent merchants on the coasts of [[Muttrah]] which lies 2 kilometers of Muscat. They have worked in the [[incense]] ({{lang|ar|بخور}}), jewelry and clothes business as well as in general trade. The community occupies a gated quarter of Muttrah known as ''Sur al-Lawatia''. The quarter still boasts attractive houses with a unique Islamic architectural view and a large mosque known as ''Al-Rasul Al-Aadam Mosque'' or ''The Greatest Prophets Mosque'' in reference to [[Muhammad]]. The Sur has seen a major exodus in recent decades as Lawatis have moved to more modern neighborhoods as a result of increasing development, the availability of facilities and growing wealth and business of the community. Another great historic monument built by the tribe is ''Al-Zahra Mosque'' in the UAE, which was built nearly 300 years ago &lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Al-Lawati, Jawad bin Jaafar bin Ibrahim Al-Khabouri. The Omani Role in the Indian Peninsula: The Role of Bani Sama Ibn Loaey (Al-Lawatia). Muscat, Oman: Dar Al-Nubala, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and notable families==

The first historical mention of the Lawatis is said to have been by the Omani historian [[Ibn Ruzayq]], who said that notables of the community greeted the first ruler of the currently ruling [[Al Said]] dynasty on his arrival to Muscat in the 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ruzayq, Humaid. Al-Deya’a Al-Shay’e Bil Lama’an, Muscat ({{lang|ar|الضياء الشائع باللمعان – ابن رزيق}})&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one Lawati family can be documented through [[United Kingdom|British]] records as existing in Oman since the 1700s, those were the first group came to serve the British crown

Perhaps one of the most notable political families from the Al-Lawati tribe is Al-Abdulateef family, with names such as Al Hajj Baqer Abdulateef Fadel and Ali Abdulateef Fadel spearheading the tribe into prominence in the early 20th Century. Al Hajj Baqer, one of the pioneer merchants in Muttrah and well-respected public figure, lead the tribe as the Lawati sheikh, he enjoyed a strong relationship with the ruling [[Al Said]] house particularly Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]]. It is widely known that he privately aided the [[Omani]] government's efforts in expelling the Saudi contingents from [[Al Buraimi]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ar|قدوة الفقهاء والعارفين السيد حسين العالم بن أسد الله الموسوي: سيرة حياته الربانية وشرح سياحاته العرفانية - تقي بن السيد حسين الموسوي}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Al-Muscati surname of some families in [[Kuwait]] and Bahrain suggests that they were Muscati immigrants, and are believed to be of Lawati origin. Some Al-Muscati families live in Oman today. They are Lawatis who obtained their surname during the period when they immigrated and lived in Kuwait, before they went back to Oman in the late seventies.
Today there are many families and clans within the Lawati tribe including Al-Abdulateef, Al-Nadwani, Al-Saleh, Al-Khabouri, Al-Wardy, Al-Kokar, Dara, Al-Habib and Al-Najwani in Oman. In the U.A.E Al-Lawati families include: Al-Sajwani, Al-Issa, Al-Shalwani, Al-Yousef, Jafar Ali, Al-Aboodi, AL-Kashwani, Al-Buqellah, Al-Fiqerani and Fadhlani. Today there are between 5,000 to 10,000 Lawatis living in Oman.

==Religion==
Verbal history indicates that at one point they were [[Muslim]] Shia in various branches. They now follow the Twelver Shia Islam. Consequently, the new adopted doctrine of [[Twelver]]/Jaafari grew within the Lawati tribe and the different branches were not accepted. Hence, some retracted while others detached from the community. However, most present-day Lawatis are known to be Twelver Shia Muslims. And with the process of mingling with the other groups, few Lawatis brought up through mixed marriages either following mixed Shia/[[Sunni]] or Shia/[[Ibadhi]] traditions. However, Laurence Louër, in his book ''Transnational Shia Politics: Religious and Political Networks in the Gulf'', mentions a different theory of the religious origins of Al-Lawati. According to this theory, the Lawatis were [[Khoja|Khoja Ismailis]] who migrated to Oman from [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (in present-day Pakistan) in the 19th century, before converting to Twelver Shi'ism following a dispute with the [[Aga Khan|leadership of the community]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Louër (2008) Transnational Shia Politics: Religious and Political Networks in the Gulf. Columbia University Press, pp. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|Luwati language}}
The native mother language of Al-Lawaties (Sn. ''Khojo'', Pl. ''[[Khoja]]'') is [[Luwati language]] which is called in their own tongue as (''[[Khojki]]''). This idiom is [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically]] and morphologically related to the [[Sindhi language]]; a branch of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] tree. As it also shares common similarities with other spoken languages of the other ethnic groups in Oman (presumed ethnically to be of the same origin) e.g. [[Zadjali]] (''Jadgali''), [[Maimani]] and [[Al Saigh]]. Elderlies were fluent in both the written and the spoken ''[[Khojki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Salman, Amel &amp; Kharusi, Nafla S. (2012)  ‘The Sound System of Lawatiyya’, Journal of Academic and Applied Studies May Vol. 2(5), pp. 36- 44, {{ISSN|1925-931X}}, available online @ www.academians.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic]] as a first language of Oman and all Arabia, is also held tightly by Al-Lawaties in parallel with their mother tongue language [[Khojki]].  However, the trend now within this community is to abandon their own native language and more people of the young generation are found not to know how to write nor speak it, most Lawatis today are not as fluent in Kojki as their ancestors as they consider Arabic their mothertongue with Kojki and English relegated to secondary languages.

'''Alice Crimmins''' (born 1939) is an American woman who was charged with killing her two children, 5-year-old Eddie and 4-year-old Alice Marie, known as Missy, who went missing on July 14, 1965.&lt;ref name=DailyNews&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title='Sexpot' trial tale: Crimmins custody fight in 1960s ends in death|author=Bovsun, Mara|date=June 26, 2011|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/sexpot-trial-tale-crimmins-custody-fight-1960s-ends-death-article-1.132749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 15, 2012|author=Amper, Susan|title=Did She or Didn’t She?: The Case of Alice Crimmins 47 years later|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/blogs/2012/06/did-she-or-didnt-she-the-case-of-alice-crimmins-47-years-later-susan-amper-femme-fatale-crime-scene-just-plain-awful|work=Criminal Element}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Tru TV]] |title=The Alice Crimmins Case |date=2012 |author=Noe, Denise |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/crimmins/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alice Marie's body was found that day, and Eddie Jr.'s was found five days later. In 1971, she was convicted of murder of her son and manslaughter of her daughter. In November 1977, she was released on parole.&lt;ref name="murderpedia.org"&gt;http://murderpedia.org/female.C/c/crimmins-alice.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The killing of her children==

Her children, Eddie Jr., age 5, and Missy, age 4, disappeared from their garden apartment in [[Kew Gardens Hills]] on July 14, 1965. She reported to the police that her children were missing. Some days after that, Missy was found strangled. Later, Eddie was also found dead, but identifying the cause of his death was impossible.&lt;ref name="murderpedia.org"/&gt;

No physical evidence was found which could connect her to the murders. Nevertheless, she was put on trial and found guilty in May 1968.

No evidence could be found tying anyone to the deaths.  Crimmins was followed and [[Covert listening device|covertly recorded]] by the [[New York Police Department]] for two years, before finally being charged and going to trial in 1968.&lt;ref name=DailyNews/&gt; She was found guilty and sent to prison, later released on appeal, recharged and found guilty again in 1971, overturned in 1973, reinstated and reincarcerated in 1975.&lt;ref name=DailyNews/&gt; She was paroled in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/anniversaryarchive/anniversary99/been_doin/tb_an_doin03.html Queens Tribune, The Crimmins Affair, Forgotten Queens History. accessed 31 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302022500/http://www.queenstribune.com/archives/anniversaryarchive/anniversary99/been_doin/tb_an_doin03.html |date=2 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crimmins trial has been compared by some in the media to the [[Casey Anthony]] trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Shaughnessy, Patrice|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title=From Casey Anthony to Alice Crimmins moms on trial mesmerize|date=June 30, 2011|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/casey-anthony-alice-crimmins-moms-trial-mesmerize-article-1.132336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=Before Casey Anthony, There Was Alice Crimmins...|authorlink=Paul LaRosa|date=July 14, 2011|author=LaRosa, Paul|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-larosa/before-casey-anthony-ther_b_898417.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Belgium|Belgians]] aged 12 and above are issued with an [[identity card]] ({{lang-nl|Identiteitskaart}}, {{lang-fr|Carte d’identité}}, {{lang-de|Personalausweis}}). Belgians aged 15 and above are required to always carry it with them unless they are within 200m of their home. (Foreigners must at all times be able to provide identification, either a [[passport]], or an identity document issued by another EU member state.)  Holders who are Belgian citizens are also entitled to use the card for international travel within [[Europe]] (except to [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]) as well as to [[Egypt]], [[French overseas territories]], the [[Gambia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090214214414/http://www.gambiaembassy.be/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Montserrat]] (max. 14 days), [[Turkey]] and on organized tours to [[Jordan]] (through Aqaba airport) and [[Tunisia]] in lieu of a [[Belgian passport]].

==Use within Belgium==

Belgians are required to carry the identity card and to show their identity cards when requested by:
* police;
* certain government agencies; or
* authorised bus and train personnel.

==Physical appearance==
All fields on the card are bilingual (English in combination with either Dutch, French or German) and the heading "Belgium / Identity card" in all four languages. The used language (and the one used first in the heading) depends on the official language of the place of residence (per the Belgian [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language areas]]), unless the residence is a [[List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels municipality]], in which case the holder may choose between French or Dutch, or a [[Municipalities with language facilities|municipality with language facilities]], in which case the holder may choose between French or Dutch, or French or German, depending on the local language facilities.

The cards are in credit card format ([[ISO/IEC 7810|ID1]]) and contain a 3-line machine-readable strip on the back starting with IDBEL.
The card holds the following information:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belgium.be/eportal/application?languageParameter=nl&amp;pageid=contentPage&amp;docId=2956#anchor_1 Elektronische identiteitskaart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Photograph]] of the bearer's face
* Names of the holder (Surname and first two given names, initials of further given names)
*[[Belgian nobility|Nobility title]] (if applicable)
* Date and place of birth
* Sex
* Nationality: ''BELG''/''BELGE'' (Belgian)
* ID card number, 12 digits in the form ''xxx-xxxxxxx-yy''. The check-number ''yy'' is the [[remainder]] of the division of ''xxxxxxxxxx'' by 97. Note that if the calculated remainder is equal to 0, the check-number ''yy'' is reset to 97.
* Validity period 6 years (for holders aged 12 to 18 years),10 years (for holders aged 18 to 75) or 30 years (for holders aged over 75)
* Signature
* Identification number of the National Register (each individual is issued a unique number for administration purposes). This number consists of 11 digits of the form ''yy.mm.dd-xxx.cd'' where ''yy.mm.dd'' is the birthdate of the person, ''xxx'' a sequential number (odd for males and even for females) and ''cd'' a check-digit.
* Place of issue

If the holder wishes, the following info will also be mentioned on the card:
* Marital status

Before 2005, the ID did not contain a [[integrated circuit|chip]], and the address of the holder was printed on the card. Currently, this is written only on the chip.

The ID card may be used as a travel document within most of Europe and several other countries (see above)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.be/nl/travel/reiswijsReisDocDetail.asp?TEXTID=21693 Reis Wijs - Reisdocumenten - Identiteitskaart&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian consulates still issue old style ID cards (105 x 75&amp;nbsp;mm, validity 10 years) to Belgian citizens who are permanently residing in their jurisdiction and who choose to be registered at the consulate (which is strongly advised).

The Cost depending on the Commune/Consulate is approximately 20.50 Euros (2015) with a 5 Year Validity

The '''Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal''' was a case of [[child sexual abuse]]s involving a  number of children and employees at [[Casa Pia]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] state-run institution for the education and support of poor children and under-age [[orphan]]s.&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"&gt;Giles Tremlett, [https://www.theguardian.com/child/story/0,7369,1356110,00.html Portugal rocked by child abuse scandal], Sunday 21 November 2004, [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Portuguese Judiciary Police ([[Polícia Judiciária]]) officials estimate that more than 100 boys and girls&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"/&gt; of the 4,600 pupils enrolled in Casa Pia at the time, including some deaf and mute, may have been sexually abused throughout several decades. The scandal involved several prominent men, including TV presenter [[Carlos Cruz (television presenter)|Carlos Cruz]], former Casa Pia governor Manuel Abrantes, and former [[UNESCO]] ambassador Jorge Ritto.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g38Za0GoiD6C0Bh-6wAWvvTXtdeQD9I0IO603 | title = 7 defendants convicted in Portugal sex abuse trial | agency = Associated Press | date = 3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial is one of the longest running in Portuguese history, lasting more than five years, with testimony from more than 800 witnesses and experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11179026 | title = Six men jailed for Portugal child sex abuse | publisher = BBC | date = 3 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2010, [[Carlos Cruz (television presenter)|Carlos Cruz]], Carlos Silvino, Hugo Marçal, Manuel Abrantes, Ferreira Diniz and Jorge Ritto were convicted and sentenced to up to eighteen years in prison due to crimes occurring in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was the first time an institutional sex abuse scandal had been taken to court in Portugal.

==First revelations==
Portuguese Judiciary Police ([[Polícia Judiciária]]) first accused the caretaker of a Casa Pia state-run children's home in 1981 of raping dozens of children over a period of 30 years, even though some reports of abuse pre-date the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]].  Police accused the perpetrators of supplying children to men from Portugal and other countries, including to some prominent public figures in Portugal.&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"/&gt; However, these early allegations did not result in any legal action.

==Second revelations==
The scandal of  alleged [[sexual abuse]] at the state-run Casa Pia orphanages resurfaced when several former orphanage children came forward with accusations of abuse. The accusations linked some politicians, diplomats, and media celebrities—all of whom were alleged to have conspired in a paedophilia ring that had operated for decades. The scandal broke in September 2002 when the mother of one alleged victim, known as Joel, complained of abuse by staff at a Casa Pia house.&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"/&gt;

Former Casa Pia children came forward to publicly accuse several personnel of sexual abuse. The weekly magazine Visão reported that a Portuguese diplomat, Jorge Ritto, was removed from his post as consul in [[Stuttgart]] (1969–1971) after German authorities complained to Lisbon about his involvement with an under-age boy in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Vieira, VISÃO (Portuguese magazine) number 508, {{Nowrap|28 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accused were diplomat Jorge Ritto, [[Carlos Cruz (television presenter)|Carlos Cruz]] (a Portuguese television presenter), Carlos Silvino (a.k.a. Bibi,  an employee of Casa Pia and a former pupil in the institution), Ferreira Diniz (a physician from Lisbon), Hugo Marçal (a lawyer who represented Carlos Silvino in the early stages of the process) and among other individuals, a marine archaeologist.&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"/&gt;

Secretary of State for Labor and Training from 1999 to 2001, [[Paulo Pedroso]], who was responsible for the Casa Pia homes, which care for some 4,600 children at 10 centers around Portugal, was suspected of 15 cases of sexual violence against minors, which allegedly took place between 1999 and 2000. His case was also subsequently dropped.&lt;ref name="Casa Pia Scandal"/&gt; In September 2008, a Portuguese court ordered the state to pay 100,000 euros ($140,000) to the ex-minister Paulo Pedroso, on the grounds that he was wrongly detained on paedophilia charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=1008036 Casa Pia: Paulo Pedroso ganha acção contra o Estado]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Socialist Party leader at the time, [[Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues]], who was a close personal friend of [[Paulo Pedroso]], offered to undergo police questioning after "he had learned of plans to implicate him in the [Casa Pia] scandal". The weekly paper [[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]] published a report on 25 May 2003, from four children who said they saw Ferro Rodrigues at locations where sexual abuse was taking place. The paper said there was no evidence he was personally involved and the Attorney General José Souto de Moura insisted he was not a suspect. Ferro Rodrigues took legal action against those who said they saw him at locations where sexual abuse was taking place. Rodrigues has said, "I want it to be clear: our fight will be serene but determined and it is and will only be directed at those who are responsible for this defamation, whatever their objective is."

The Prime Minister at the time, [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]], whose Social Democratic Party ousted the Socialists in March 2002, promised to bring life and honor back into the Casa Pia children's homes and allow new director Catalina Pestana to reform the institution. As a result, several senior staff of Casa Pia were fired after the 2002 revelations. However, Pestana told parliament and the media, as late as 2007, that there may still be paedophiles in the Casa Pia system. She also criticised the legal changes made after the start of the trial, which she claims were made in order to help those who were present to court.&lt;ref name="Catalina Pestana's criticism"&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=13&amp;id_news=299987 Casa Pia: Catalina Pestana diz que não quis criticar juizes], {{Nowrap|17 October 2007}}, [[Diário Digital]]&lt;/ref&gt; These controversial legal changes were partially reverted just before the sentence in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.asjp.pt/2010/08/30/caso-de-pedofilia-obrigou-politicos-a-alterar-as-leis/ Caso de pedofilia obrigou políticos a alterar as leis], Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casa Pia abuse scandal has had the effect of raising public awareness of sexual abuse of children. The number of incidents reported to Portuguese police has soared after the scandal has been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Catarina Guerreiro, [http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.asp?idCanal=9&amp;id=108844 Menores: triplicou número de queixas de pedofilia na PJ CASA PIA FAZ DISPARAR DENÚNCIAS DE ABUSO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303031058/http://www.correiodamanha.pt/noticia.asp?idCanal=9&amp;id=108844 |date=3 March 2008 }}, [[Correio da Manhã]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and trial==
The Casa Pia child sex abuse trial started in 2004. In 2004, as an [[arguido]] involved in the trial, Carlos Cruz published a book of personal reflections, ''Preso 374''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-989-555-085-2}}; Publisher: Oficina do Livro&lt;/ref&gt; The final allegations, formerly scheduled for 20 October 2008 in [[Lisbon]] were postponed several times. The [[Portuguese legal system|country's justice system]], often accused of being excruciatingly slow, is believed by some opinion makers such as journalists and Catalina Pestana (former head of Casa Pia), to be vulnerable to external pressures of well-connected personalities and the possibility of corrupting external interference has been considered a real danger, according to those critics.&lt;ref name="Catalina Pestana's criticism"/&gt;  They feared that even if Carlos Silvino (the Casa Pia driver), whose initial trial had been twice postponed, is found guilty, better-connected abusers might go free.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1307441 Casa Pia: Catalina Pestana alega que julgamento se arrasta porque era preciso esperar por "leis mais brandas"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015000704/http://ultimahora.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1307441 |date=15 October 2007 }}, {{Nowrap|13 October 2007}}, [[Público (Portugal)|Público]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 2010, [[Carlos Cruz (television presenter)|Carlos Cruz]] (seven years), Carlos Silvino (eighteen years), Hugo Marçal (six years, two months), Manuel Abrantes (five years, nine months), Ferreira Diniz (seven years) and Jorge Ritto (six years, eight months) were convicted on charges of paedophilia and other crimes occurring in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="convictions"&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20100904024611/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1654446 Tribunal dá 17 crimes como provados], [[Diário de Notícias]] (3 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The full ruling, which allegedly runs to nearly 2,000 pages, was due to be released on 8 September 2010.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; However, it was delayed several times due to a [[Microsoft Word]] glitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20100912041921/http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1660098 Até a Microsoft foi dar uma ajuda à juíza da Casa Pia], [[Diário de Notícias]] (11 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/09/12/0217248/Child-Abuse-Verdict-Held-Back-By-MS-Word-Glitch Child Abuse Verdict Held Back By MS Word Glitch], [[Slashdot]] (12 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September 2010 the full ruling containing the verdict was released. According to chief prosecutor Miguel Matias, the victims were pleased with the outcome.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; The court ruling was hailed as a victory by those fighting for Casa Pia children's rights in Portugal, such as Pedro Namora, a former pupil at Casa Pia and now a lawyer who publicly supported the victims, and Catalina Pestana, who was head of Casa Pia during the period when some of the cases were made public in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herald.thedailyherald.com/international/4-international/7724-portuguese-court-finds-6-guilty-of-child-abuse.html Portuguese court finds 6 guilty of child abuse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716230626/http://herald.thedailyherald.com/international/4-international/7724-portuguese-court-finds-6-guilty-of-child-abuse.html |date=16 July 2011 }}, [[The Daily Herald (St. Maarten)|The Daily Herald]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chalio''' / '''Chaliho''' also called '''Chaliho Sahib''' is a forty-day-long festival celebrated by [[Hindu]] [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] community. &lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Chaliho/ Chaliho festival] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20130218051616/http://www.festivalsofindia.in/Chaliho/ |date=February 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MAH-PUN-sindhis-celebrate-chalio-festival-2272672.html Sindhis celebrate Chalio festival]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d/&gt;

==Background==

Mirkshah, a [[Muslim]] ruler of [[Sindh]] had ordered to convert all Hindu Sindhis to Islam or face persecution. Hindu representatives asked for forty days time from the ruler to give their reply.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

The frightened Hindus of Sindh prayed to their river God [[Varuna]] to come and help them. For forty days, they underwent penance. They neither shaved or wore new clothes, praying and fasting and singing songs in the praise of God Varuna. They beseeched him to save them from the hands of their persecutor.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

On the fortieth day, a voice was heard from Heaven: "Fear not, I shall save you from the wicked Mirkshah. I shall come down as a mortal and take birth in the womb of Mata Devki in the house of Ratanchand Lohano of Nasarpur". Ratanchand Lohano was a Hindu belonging to [[Lohana]] cast.

All the Sindhis were relieved and rejoiced at this [[Akashvani (term)|akashvani]]. Later, [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Dariyalal]] (Jhulelal) was born as announced to the named couple, who taught a lesson to Mirkshah &amp; his Muslim Followers and saved the Hindus from Mirkshah &amp; his Muslim Followers.sindhi's started to worship jhulelal bhagwan, with full faith and devotion they started to keep 40 days fasting which is known as chalio saheb. those who are keeping this fast they follow some rituals such as they are not using tadka in any dish, not cutting nails and hair for 40 days.living purely simple life.on the last day they are performing pujas offering earthen pot to DARRIYA[RIVER] offering akho [raw rice sugar flowers] to darriya.sindhi keep this fast to avoid non veg evevn gaflic and onion they perform the puja of bahrono saheb 

==Festival==

The 40-day-long festival is observed every year in months of July to August, dates vary according to [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt; This is a thanks-giving celebration in honor of Varuna Deva and [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]] for listening to their prayers.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

To keep this tradition alive, all [[Hindu]] [[Sindhis|Sindhi]], even today, celebrate the event by keeping forty days of penance.

The observe following rules for forty days:&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;[http://www.thesindhuworld.com/chaliho.html Sindhi Festivals &gt; Chaliho] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425020539/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/chaliho.html |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sindhis make a symbolic representation of their God Jhulelal in each and every household of theirs, which is known as [[Bahrana Sahib]].

Behind is an earthen pot with a coconut in it, covered with cloth, flowers, leaves and Idol of God Jhulelal.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalsofindia.in/chetichand/ |title=Cheti Chand &amp;#124; Sindhi Festivals &amp;#124; Chaliho Sahab &amp;#124; Baharana Sahib &amp;#124; Festivals |publisher=Festivalsofindia.in |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d/&gt; A sweet dish named ''akho'', made from rice and sugar is offered during morning prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mywebastrologer.com/chaliho.asp |title=Chaliho, Chaliho Festival, Festival of Chaliho in India |publisher=Mywebastrologer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830031249/http://www.mywebastrologer.com/chaliho.asp |archivedate=2012-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For forty days they worship it and offer [[prasad]] and sing [[aarti]] to Bahrana Sahib.

'''Chinese Indonesians''' ([[Indonesia language|Indonesian]]: ''Orang Indonesia keturunan Tionghoa'') or (in Indonesia) simply '''Tionghoa''' ({{lang-zh|中华}}), are [[Indonesians]] descended from various [[Zhonghua minzu|Chinese ethnic groups]], primarily the [[Han Chinese]].

Chinese people have lived in the Indonesian archipelago since at least the 13th century. Many came initially as sojourners (temporary residents), intending to return home in their old age.{{sfn|Wang Gungwu, 'Sojourning: the Chinese experience in Southeast Asia', in Anthony Reid, ed., ''Sojourners and settlers: histories of Southeast Asia and the Chinese'' (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1996, pp.1-9}} Some, however, stayed in the region as [[economic migrants]]. Their population grew rapidly during the colonial period when workers were contracted from their home provinces in southern China. [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians]] has occurred since the start of Dutch colonialism in the region, although government policies implemented since 1998 have attempted to redress this. Resentment of ethnic Chinese economic aptitude grew in the 1950s as [[Native Indonesians|native Indonesian]] merchants felt they could not remain competitive. In some cases, government action propagated the stereotype that ethnic Chinese-owned [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] were corrupt. Although the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] severely disrupted their business activities, reform of government policy and legislation removed a number of political and social restrictions on Chinese Indonesians.

The development of local Chinese society and culture is based upon three pillars: clan associations, ethnic media, and Chinese-language schools.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=74}}{{sfn|Hoon|2006|p=96}} These flourished during the period of [[Chinese nationalism]] in the final years of China's [[Qing Dynasty]] and through the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; however, differences in the objective of nationalist sentiments brought about a split in the population. One group supported political reforms in China, while others worked towards improved status in local politics. The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]  government (1967–1998) dismantled the pillars of ethnic Chinese identity in favor of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policies as a solution to the "Chinese Problem".

The Chinese Indonesian population of [[Sumatra]] accounts for nearly half of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than [[Native Indonesians|Indonesia's indigenous population]],{{sfn|Heidhues|2001|pp=164–165}} significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the [[population pyramid]], as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations in the second half of the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to neighbouring Singapore and Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/world/asia/an-ethnic-chinese-christian-breaking-barriers-in-indonesia.html|title=An Ethnic Chinese Christian, Breaking Barriers in Indonesia|author=Joe Cochrane|publisher=The New York Times|date=22 November 2014|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.{{sfn|Cunningham|2008|p=104}}

== Classification ==
The term "Chinese Indonesian" has never been clearly defined, especially for the period before 1900. There was no Indonesian identity or nationality before the 20th century. The ethno-political category [[Han Chinese]] was also poorly defined before the rise of modern Chinese nationalism in the late 19th century. At its broadest, the term "Chinese Indonesian" is used refer to anyone from, or having an ancestor from, the present-day territory of China. This usage is problematic because it conflates Han Chinese with other ethnic groups under Chinese rule. For instance, Admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433), who led several Chinese maritime expeditions into Southeast Asia, was a Muslim from Yunnan and was not of Chinese ancestry, yet he is generally characterized as "Chinese". This broad use is also problematic because it prioritizes a line of descent from China over all other lines and may conflict with an individual's own self-identity. Indonesia's president [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] (1940-2009) is widely believed to have some Chinese ancestry, but he did not regard himself as Chinese. 

Some narrower uses of the term focus on culture, defining as "Chinese Indonesian" those who choose to prioritize their Chinese ancestry, especially those who have Chinese names or follow aspects of Chinese religion or culture. Within this cultural definition, a distinction has commonly been made between [[peranakan]] and [[totok]] Chinese. Peranakan were generally said to have mixed Chinese and local ancestry and to have developed a hybrid culture that included elements from both Chinese and local cultures. Totoks were generally said to be first-generation migrants and to have retained a strong Chinese identity.

Other definitions focus on the succession of legal classifications that have separated "Chinese" from other inhabitants of the archipelago. Both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] (from 1815) applied complex systems of ethnic classification to their subjects, based on religion, culture and place of origin. Chinese Indonesians were sometimes classified as "Natives", sometimes as "Chinese", sometimes as "Foreign Orientals", a category that included Arabs, Indians and Siamese&lt;ref&gt;C. Fasseur, ‘Cornerstone and Stumbling Block: Racial Classification and the Late Colonial State in Indonesia’, in Robert Cribb (ed.), The Late Colonial State in Indonesia: political and economic foundations of the Netherlands Indies, 1880-1942 (Leiden: KITLV, 1994), pp. 31-56.&lt;/ref&gt;. After independence, the community was divided between those who accepted Indonesian citizenship and those who did not. Under the New Order of President [[Suharto]], citizens of Chinese descent were formally classified as "Indonesian citizens of foreign descent" (''Warga Negara Indonesia keturunan asing''). In public discourse they were distinguished from [[native Indonesians]] as "non-native" (''non-pribumi'' or ''non-pri'').

The first recorded movement of people from China into [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] was the arrival of [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] forces under [[Kublai Khan]] that culminated in the [[Mongol invasion of Java|invasion of Java]] in 1293. Their intervention hastened the decline of the classical kingdoms such as [[Singhasari]] and precipitated the rise of the [[Majapahit]] empire.{{sfn|Reid|2001|p=17}}

[[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] traders from the eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and [[Malaysia]] in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner [[Zheng He]], who commanded [[Treasure voyages|several expeditions to southeastern Asia]] between 1405 and 1430. In the book ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', his translator [[Ma Huan]] documented the activities of the Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men.{{sfn|Ma|2005|p=115}} These traders settled along the northern coast of [[Java]], but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population.{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=796}} Between 1450 and 1520, the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago.{{sfn|Reid|1999|p=52}} The [[The Portuguese in Indonesia (1512–1850)|Portuguese]] made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century.{{sfn|Reid|2001|p=33}} Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 [[Junk (ship)|junks]] a year. Several years later silver began flowing into the region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including the pepper port of [[Banten]].{{sfn|Reid|1999|p=52}}

Some Chinese traders avoided [[Portuguese Malacca]] after it fell to the Portuguese in the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|1511 Capture of Malacca]].{{sfn|Guillot|Lombard|Ptak|1998|p=179}} Many Chinese, however, cooperated with the Portuguese for the sake of trade.{{sfn|Borschberg|2004|p=12}} Some Chinese in [[Java]] assisted in Muslim attempts to reconquer the city using ships.

By the time the Dutch arrived in the early 17th century, major Chinese settlements existed along the north coast of Java. Most were traders and merchants, but they also practiced agriculture in inland areas. The Dutch contracted many of these immigrants as skilled artisans in the [[History of Jakarta|construction of Batavia (Jakarta)]] on the northwestern coast of Java.{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=796}} A recently created harbor was selected as the new headquarters of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''{{lang|nl|Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie}}'', VOC) in 1609 by [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]]. It grew into a major hub for trade with China and India. Batavia became home to the largest Chinese community in the archipelago and remains so in the 21st century.{{sfn|Heidhues|1999|p=152}} Coen and other early [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies|Governors-General]] promoted the entry of Chinese immigrants to new settlements "for the benefit of those places and for the purpose of gathering spices like [[clove]]s, [[nutmeg]], and mace".{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=9}} The port's Chinese population of 300–400 in 1619 had grown to at least 10,000 by 1740.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=7}} The Dutch Company ruled migrant ethnic groups in Batavia using 'officers' drawn from each community, usually with the title [[Kapitan Cina|''kapitan'']] or ''majoor''. These officers had a high degree of authority over their community and undertook negotiations between the community and the Company authorities.&lt;ref&gt; Leonard Blusse and Chen Menghong, "Introduction", in Leonard Blusse and Chen Menghong, ''The Archives of the Kong Koan of Batavia'' (Leiden: Brill, 2003), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dutch colonial rule saw the beginning of anti-Chinese policies, including killings and ghettoization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Glionna  |first=John M. |date=July 4, 2010 |title=In Indonesia, 1998 violence against ethnic Chinese remains unaddressed |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/04/world/la-fg-indonesia-chinese-20100704 |work=Los Angeles Times |location=Jakarta, Indonesia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of those who settled in the archipelago had already severed their ties with the mainland and welcomed favorable treatment and protection under the Dutch.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=8}} Some became "revenue farmers", middlemen within the corporate structure of the VOC, tasked with collecting [[tariff|export–import duties]] and managing the harvest of natural resources;{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=10}} although this was highly profitable, it earned the enmity of the ''pribumi'' population. Others worked as [[opium]] farmers.{{sfn|Reid|2007|pp=44–47}} Following the [[1740 Batavia massacre]] and [[Java War (1741—1743)|ensuing war]], in which the Chinese rebelled against the Dutch,{{sfn|Setiono|2003|pp=125–137}} the Dutch attempted to place a quota on the number of Chinese who could enter the Indies. [[Xiamen|Amoy]] was designated as the only immigration port to the archipelago, and ships were limited to a specified number of crew and passengers depending on size. This quota was adjusted at times to meet demand for overseas workers, such as in July 1802 when sugar mills near Batavia were in need of workers.{{sfn|Hellwig|Tagliacozzo|2009|p=168}}

Chinese who married local Javanese women and converted to Islam created a distinct Chinese Muslim [[Peranakan]] community in Java.&lt;ref name="Ooi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keat Gin Ooi|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA1057&amp;lpg=PA1057#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-770-2|pages=1057–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese rarely had to convert to Islam to marry Javanese [[abangan]] women but a significant amount of their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts.&lt;ref name="ReidAlilunas-Rodgers1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Reid|author2=Kristine Alilunas-Rodgers|title=Sojourners and Settlers: Histories of Southeast China and the Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFIGVqZ9ZKsC&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2446-4|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means.

When the VOC was nationalized on 31 December 1799, many freedoms the Chinese experienced under the corporation were eliminated by the Dutch government. Among them was the Chinese monopoly on the salt trade which had been granted by the VOC administration.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=11}} An 1816 regulation introduced a requirement for the indigenous population and Chinese traveling within the territory to obtain a travel permit. Those who did not carry a permit faced arrest by security officers. The Governor-General also introduced a resolution in 1825 which forbade "foreign Asians in Java such as [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[Bugis|Buginese]] and Chinese" from living within the same neighborhood as the native population.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=12}} Following the costly [[Java War]] (1825–1830) the Dutch introduced a new agrarian and cultivation system that required farmers to "yield up a portion of their fields and cultivate crops suitable for the European market". Compulsory cultivation restored the economy of the colony, but ended the system of revenue farms established under the VOC.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=13}}

Behind them on the wall are hanging posters containing various diagrams.|The first Dutch Chinese Schools were established in 1892 following a split in curriculum from the native population.]]

The Chinese were perceived as temporary residents and encountered difficulties in obtaining land rights. Europeans were prioritized in the choice of plantation areas, while colonial officials believed the remaining plots must be protected and preserved for the indigenous population. Short-term and renewable leases of varying lengths{{efn|According to {{harvtxt|Heidhues|2001|p=179}}, the length of the leases depended on the location. Bangka had 25-year leases, while several areas offered 50-year leases.}} were later introduced as a temporary measure, but many Chinese remained on these lands upon expiration of their contracts and became squatters.{{sfn|Heidhues|2001|p=179}} In the second half of the 19th century the colonial government began experimenting with the idea of an "[[Dutch Ethical Policy|Ethical Policy]]" to protect the indigenous population, casting the Chinese as the "foremost enemy of the state". Under the new policy, the administration increased restrictions on Chinese economic activities, which they believed exploited the native population.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=14}}

In western [[Borneo]], the Chinese established their first major mining settlement in 1760. Ousting Dutch settlers and the local Malay princes, they joined into a new republic known as [[Lanfang Republic|Lanfang]]. By 1819, they came into conflict with the new Dutch government and were seen as "incompatible" with its objectives, yet indispensable for the development of the region.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|p=16}} The [[Bangka–Belitung Islands]] also became examples of major settlements in rural areas. In 1851, 28 Chinese were recorded on the islands and, by 1915, the population had risen to nearly 40,000 and fishing and tobacco industries had developed. [[Coolie]]s brought into the region after the end of the 19th century were mostly hired from the [[Straits Settlements]] owing to recruiting obstacles that existed in China.{{sfn|Phoa|1992|pp=17–18}}

=== Divided nationalism (1900–1949) ===

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Tiong hoa hwe Kwan school in Soengailiat TMnr 60048700-edit.png|thumb|left|alt=Two men stand on the porch of a single story building behind an open gate lined with bushes|Chinese-language school owned by the Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan in [[Sungailiat]], Bangka]]
The Chinese revolutionary figure [[Sun Yat-sen]] visited southeast Asia in 1900,{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=5}} and, later that year, the socio-religious organization [[Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:中華|中華]] [[:wikt:會館|會館]]}}), also known as the Chinese Association, was founded. Their goal was to urge ethnic Chinese in the Indies to support the revolutionary movement in China. In its effort to build Chinese-speaking schools the association argued that the teaching of the English and Chinese languages should be prioritized over Dutch, to provide themselves with the means of taking, in the words of [[Phoa Keng Hek]], "a two or three-day voyage (Java–[[Singapore]]) into a wider world where they can move freely" and overcome restrictions of their activities.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|pp=3, 10}} Several years later, the Dutch authorities abandoned its segregation policies, abolished travel permits for the ethnic Chinese, and allowed them to freely move throughout the colony. The 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the 1912 founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] coincided with a growing Chinese–nationalist movement within the Indies.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=5}}

Although there was no recognizable [[Nationalism|nationalist movement]] among the indigenous population until 1908, Dutch authorities feared that nationalist sentiments would spread with the growth of ethnically mixed associations, known as ''[[kongsi]]''. In 1911, some Javanese members of the Kong Sing association in [[Surakarta]] broke away and clashed with the ethnic Chinese. This incident led to the creation of [[Sarekat Islam]], the first organized popular nationalist movement in the Indies. Indigenous groups saw the Chinese nationalist sentiment as "haughty", leading to mutual antagonism.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=6}} The anti-Chinese sentiment spread throughout Java in 1918 and led to violent attacks orchestrated by members of Sarekat Islam on the ethnic Chinese in [[Kudus, Kudus|Kudus]].{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=7}} Following this incident, the [[Left-wing nationalism|left-wing]] Chinese nationalist daily ''[[Sin Po]]'' called on both sides to work together to improve living conditions because it considered most ethnic Chinese, like most of the indigenous population, to be poor.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|pp=10–11}}

[[File:IndonesiaRaya-SinPo1928.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An document containing nine lines of musical scales with their accompanying lyrics. The words "Sin Po" and "Indonesia" are at the top of the document.|Early draft of the ''[[Indonesia Raya]]'', later adopted as a national anthem, in a 1928 weekly edition of the ''Sin Po'' newspaper{{sfn|Setiono|2003|pp=449–450}}]]
''Sin Po'' first went into print in 1910 and began gaining momentum as the leading advocate of Chinese political nationalism in 1917. The ethnic Chinese who followed its stream of thought refused any involvement with local institutions and would only participate in politics relating to mainland China.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|p=xv}} A second stream was later formed by wealthy ethnic Chinese who received an education at Dutch-run schools. This Dutch-oriented group wished for increased participation in local politics, Dutch education for the ethnic Chinese, and the furthering of ethnic Chinese economic standing within the colonial economy. Championed by the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|Volksraad]]'s Chinese representatives, such as [[Hok Hoei Kan]], [[Loa Sek Hie]] and [[Phoa Liong Gie]], this movement gained momentum and reached its peak with the Chung Hwa Congress of 1927 and the 1928 formation of the Chung Hwa Hui party, which elected Kan as its president. The editor-in-chief of the ''Madjallah Panorama'' news magazine criticized ''Sin Po'' for misguiding the ethnic Chinese by pressuring them into a Chinese-nationalist stance.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|p=33}}

In 1932, pro-Indonesian counterparts founded the {{lang|id|Partai Tionghoa Indonesia}} to support absorption of the ethnic Chinese into the Javanese population and support the call for [[Self-determination|self-government]] of Indonesia. Members of this group were primarily {{lang|id|peranakan}}.{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|p=50}} This division resurfaced at the end of the period of [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] (1942–1945).{{sfn|Suryadinata|1997|p=70}} Under the occupation ethnic Chinese communities were attacked by Japanese forces, in part owing to suspicions that they contained sympathizers of the [[Kuomintang]] as a consequence of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. When the Dutch returned, following the end of World War II, the chaos caused by advancing forces and retreating revolutionaries also saw radical Muslim groups attack ethnic Chinese communities.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=7}}

Although revolutionary leaders were sympathetic toward the ethnic Chinese, they were unable to stop the sporadic violence. Those who were affected fled from the rural areas to Dutch-controlled cities, a move many Indonesians saw as proof of pro-Dutch sentiments.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=8}} There was evidence, however, that Chinese Indonesians were represented and participated in independence efforts. Four members of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPK) were Chinese: [[Liem Koen Hian]], [[Oey Tiang Tjoei]], [[Oey Tjong Hauw]] and [[Tan Eng Hoa]]. [[Yap Tjwan Bing]] was the sole Chinese member of the [[Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence]] (PPKI).{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=6}} [[Ong Eng Die]] became a government minister in the Indonesian Republic.

=== Loyalty in question (1950–1966) ===
The Netherlands relinquished its territorial claims in the archipelago (with the exception of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]) following the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|1949 Round Table Conference]], which is the same year that the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to Taiwan, allowing the [[Communist Party of China]] to take control of mainland China. Most Chinese Indonesians considered a communist China less attractive than a newly independent Indonesia, but in the archipelago their loyalties were questioned. Ethnic Chinese born in the Dutch East Indies whose parents were [[Domicile (law)|domiciled]] under Dutch administration were regarded as citizens of the new state according to the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', or "right of the soil".{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=8}} However, Chinese law considered a person as a Chinese citizen according to the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', or right of blood. This meant that all Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent were also claimed as citizens by the People's Republic of China. After several attempts by both governments to resolve this issue, Indonesia and China signed a [[Sino-Indonesian Dual Nationality Treaty|Dual Nationality Treaty]] on the sidelines of the 1955 [[Asian–African Conference]] in [[Bandung]]. One of its provisions was the ability to renounce Chinese citizenship for those who wished to solely remain Indonesian citizens.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=9}}

As many as 390,000 ethnic Chinese, two-thirds of those with rightful claims to Indonesian citizenship renounced their Chinese status when the treaty came into effect in 1962.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=9}} On the other hand, an estimated 60,000 ethnic Chinese students left for the People's Republic of China in the 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=336}} The first wave of students were almost entirely educated in Chinese-language schools, but were not able to find opportunities for tertiary education in Indonesia. Seeking quality scientific professions, they entered China with high hopes for their future and that of the mainland.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=337}} Subsequent migrations occurred in 1960 as part of a repatriation program and in 1965–1966 following a series of [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|anti-communist violence]] that also drew anger toward the ethnic Chinese. As many as 80 percent of the original students who entered the mainland eventually became refugees in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=336}} During China's [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), [[Red Guards]] questioned the loyalty of the returned overseas Chinese because of their foreign connections.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=357}} They were attacked as "imperialists", "capitalists", "spies", "half-breeds", and "foreign devils".{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=337}}As most had grown up in an urban environment they were sent to the countryside, told to "rebel against their own class background", and eventually lost contact with their families.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=350}}

In 1959, following the introduction of soft-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule through [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy]], the Indonesian government and military began placing restrictions on [[Alien (law)|alien]] residence and trade. These regulations culminated in the enactment of [[PP 10/1959|Presidential Regulation 10]] in November 1959, banning retail services by non-indigenous persons in rural areas. Ethnic Chinese, [[Arab Indonesians|Arab]], and Dutch businessmen were specifically targeted during its enforcement to provide a more favorable market for indigenous businesses.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=11}} This move was met with protests from the Chinese government and some circles of Indonesian society. Javanese writer [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]] later criticized the policies in his 1961 book ''[[Hoakiau di Indonesia]]''. An [[Racial integration|integrationist]] movement, led by the Chinese-Indonesian organisation [[Baperki]] (''{{lang|id|Badan Permusjawaratan Kewarganegaraan Indonesia}}''), began to gather interest in 1963, including that of President [[Sukarno]]. However, a series of attacks on ethnic Chinese communities in [[West Java]] in May proved it to be short-lived, despite the government's condemnation of the violence.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=13}} When Baperki was branded a communist organization in 1965 the ethnic Chinese were implicated by association; this was exacerbated in the public mind by the People's Republic of China's communism. As many as 500,000 people, the majority of them Javanese [[Abangan]] Muslims and Balinese Indonesians but including a minority of several thousand ethnic Chinese, were killed in [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|the anti-communist purge]]{{efn|{{harvtxt|Purdey|2006|p=14}} writes that, as ethnic Chinese constituted two percent of Indonesia's population at the time, a similar number of Chinese Indonesians may have been killed in the purges.

=== Managing the "Chinese Problem" (1967–1998) ===
[[File:Old Indonesian Peng family.jpg|thumb|1967 photo of a Chinese-Indonesian family of Hubei ancestry]]
{{see also|Legislation on Chinese Indonesians}}
When the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government of General [[Suharto]] came into power in 1966–1967, it introduced a political system based only on the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] (five principles) ideology. To prevent the ideological battles that occurred during Sukarno's presidency from resurfacing, Suharto's "Pancasila democracy" sought a depoliticized system in which discussions of forming a cohesive ethnic Chinese identity were no longer allowed.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=15}} A government committee was formed in 1967 to examine various aspects of the "[[Chinese Problem]]" (''{{lang|id|Masalah Cina}}'') and agreed that forced emigration of whole communities was not a solution: "The challenge was to take advantage of their economic aptitude whilst eliminating their perceived economic dominance."{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=20}} The semi-governmental Institute for the Promotion of National Unity (''{{lang|id|Lembaga Pembina Kesatuan Bangsa}}'', LPKB) was formed to advise the government on facilitating assimilation of Chinese Indonesians. This process was done through highlighting the differences between the ethnic Chinese and the indigenous ''[[Native Indonesians|pribumi]]'', rather than seeking similarities. Expressions of Chinese culture through language, religion, and traditional festivals were banned and the ethnic Chinese were pressured to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]].{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=21}}{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=27}}

During the 1970s and 1980s, Suharto and his government brought in Chinese Indonesian businesses to participate in the economic development programs of the New Order while keeping them highly vulnerable to strengthen the central authority and restrict political freedoms. Patron–client relationships, mainly through the exchange of money for security, became an accepted norm among the ethnic Chinese as they maintained a social contract through which they could claim a sense of belonging in the country. A minority of the economic elite of Indonesian society, both those who were and were not ethnic Chinese, secured relationships with Suharto's family members and members of the military for protection, while small business owners relied on local law enforcement officials.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=21}} Stereotypes of the wealthy minority became accepted as generalized facts but failed to acknowledge that said businessmen were few in number compared to the small traders and shop owners. In a 1989 interview conducted by scholar Adam Schwarz for his book ''A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia's Search for Stability'', an interviewee stated that, "to most Indonesians, the word 'Chinese' is synonymous with corruption".{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=22}} The economic role of the ethnic Chinese was contradictory because it did not translate to acceptance of their status in the greater society.

Anti-Chinese sentiment gathered intensity through the 1990s. President Suharto gathered the most powerful businessmen—mostly Chinese Indonesians—in a nationally televised 1990 meeting at his private ranch, calling on them to contribute 25 percent of their shares to [[cooperative]]s. Commentators described the spectacle as "good theatre", as it only served to reinforce resentment and suspicion of the ethnic Chinese among the indigenous population. Major riots broke out in [[Situbondo]] (October 1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (December 1996), and [[Rengasdengklok]] (January 1997).{{sfn|Purdey|2006|pp=23–24}}

When Suharto entered his seventh term as president, following an uncontested election on 10 March 1998, Indonesian students began a series of major demonstrations in protest of the New Order regime which continued for weeks and culminated in the [[Trisakti shootings|shootings of four students]] by security forces at [[Trisakti University]] in May.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|pp=106–107}} The incident sparked [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|major violence]] in several cities during 12–15 May.

Suharto unexpectedly resigned on 21 May 1998, one week after he returned from a [[Group of 15]] meeting in [[Cairo]], which took place during the riots.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=106}} The reform government formed by his successor [[B. J. Habibie]] began a campaign to rebuild the confidence of Chinese Indonesians who had fled the country, particularly businessmen. Along with one of his envoys [[James Riady]], son of financial magnate [[Mochtar Riady]], Habibie appealed to Chinese Indonesians seeking refuge throughout East Asia, Australia, and North America to return and promised security from various government ministries as well as other political figures, such as [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] and [[Amien Rais]]. Despite Habibie's efforts he was met with skepticism because of remarks he made, as Vice President and  as President, which suggested that the message was insincere.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=175}} One special envoy described Chinese Indonesians as the key to restoring "badly needed" capital and economic activity, prioritizing businessmen as the target of their pleas. Others, including economist [[Kwik Kian Gie]], saw the government's efforts as perpetuating the myth of Chinese economic domination rather than affirming the ethnic Chinese identity.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=176}}

Symbolic reforms to Chinese Indonesian rights under Habibie's administration were made through two Presidential Instructions. The first abolished the use of the terms "''[[Native Indonesians|pribumi]]''" and "non-''pribumi''" in official government documents and business. The second abolished the ban on the study of [[Mandarin Chinese]]{{efn|Suharto's government had banned Mandarin-language schools in July 1966 {{harv|Tan|2008|p=10}}. Mandarin-language press and writings were severely limited that year. {{harv|Setiono|2003|p=1091}} According to {{harvtxt|Tan|2008|p=11}}, many families taught Mandarin to their children in secret.}} and reaffirmed a 1996 instruction that abolished the use of the SBKRI to identify citizens of Chinese descent. Habibie established a task force to investigate the May 1998 violence, although his government later dismissed its findings.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=179}} As an additional legal gesture Indonesia ratified the 1965 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] on 25 May 1999.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=180}} In 2000 the newly elected President Wahid abolished the ban on public displays of Chinese culture and allowed Chinese traditions to be practised freely, without the need of a permit. Two years later President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared that the [[Chinese New Year]] (''{{lang|id|Imlek}}'') would be marked as a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] from 2003.{{sfn|Setiono|2003|p=1099}} In addition to Habibie's directive on the term "pribumi", the legislature passed a new citizenship law in 2006 defining the word ''[[wikt:asli#Indonesian|asli]]'' ("indigenous") in the [[Constitution of Indonesia|Constitution]] as a natural born person, allowing Chinese Indonesians to be eligible to run for president. The law further stipulates that children of foreigners born in Indonesia are eligible to apply for Indonesian citizenship.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2008|p=12}}

The post-Suharto era saw the end of discriminatory policy against Chinese Indonesians. Since then, numbers of Chinese Indonesians began to take part in the nation's politics, government and administrative sector. The [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] presidency (2004–2014) saw the first female Chinese Indonesian minister [[Mari Elka Pangestu]] as Minister of Trade (2004-2011) and Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy (2011-2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Indonesia, US collaborate to develop creative industry | date = 5 May 2014 | work = Antara News | url = http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/93891/indonesia-us-collaborate-to-develop-creative-industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Chinese Indonesian in Indonesian politics is [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]] or popularly known as Ahok. Former Regent of East Belitung (2005–2006) and the first Governor of [[Jakarta]] (2014–2017) of Chinese descents.

However, discrimination and prejudice have continued and risen. On 15 March 2016, for instance, Indonesian Army General Surya Prabowo commented that the incumbent governor of Jakarta, [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], should "know his place lest the Indonesian Chinese face the consequences of his action". This controversial comment was considered to hearken back to previous violence against the Indonesian Chinese.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title=Sustaining anti-Chinese sentiment in Jakarta |date=18 March 2016 |url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2016/03/18/sustaining-anti-chinese-sentiment-in-jakarta/ |publisher=Australia National University |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

{{see also|Chinese emigration}}
Chinese immigrants to the Indonesian archipelago almost entirely originated from [[Han Chinese|ethnic Han]] groups of what are now the [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] provinces in southern China, areas known for their regional diversity.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=101}} Large numbers of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, live in Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Gernet|1996|p=6}} Nearly all Chinese Indonesians are either [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descendants of these early immigrants or new immigrants born in mainland China.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=97}}

As the first group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] of southern Fujian became the dominant immigrant group until the middle of the 19th century. Their maritime–mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, [[Central Java|Central]] and [[East Java]] and the western coast of [[Sumatra]]. [[Teochew people|Teochews]], southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the [[Riau Archipelago]], and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not well represented.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=102}}

The [[Hakka people|Hakka]], unlike the Hokkien and the Teochew, originate from the mountainous inland regions of Guangdong and do not have a maritime culture.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=102}} Owing to the unproductive terrain of their home region, the Hakka emigrated out of economic necessity in several waves from 1850 to 1930 and were the poorest of the Chinese immigrant groups. Although they initially populated the mining centers of western Borneo and [[Bangka Island]], Hakkas became attracted to the rapid growth of Batavia and [[West Java]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=103}}

[[Cantonese people]], like the Hakka, were well known throughout Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely directed toward the [[tin]] mines of Bangka, off the east coast of Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled artisans, the Cantonese benefited from close contact with Europeans in Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java about the same time as the Hakka but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities, they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=103}}

Indonesia's [[Indonesian population census, 2000|2000 census]] reported 2,411,503 citizens (1.20 percent of the total population) as ethnic Chinese.{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=77}} used the 31 published volumes of data on the 2000 census and reported 1,738,936 ethnic Chinese citizens, but this figure did not include their population in 19 provinces. Space restrictions in the census publication limited the ethnic groups listed for each province to the eight largest. {{Harvtxt|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=23}} improved upon this figure by calculating directly from the raw census data.}} An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, who may not be able to pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=76}} Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=74}} It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998,{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=75}} as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.

Past estimates on the exact number of Chinese Indonesians relied on the 1930 Dutch East Indies census, which collected direct information on ethnicity.{{sfn|Heidhues|1999|p=151}} This census reported 1.23 million self-identified ethnic Chinese living in the colony, representing 2.03 percent of the total population, and was perceived to be an accurate account of the group's population.{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=20}} Ethnic information would not be collected again until the 2000 census and so was deduced from other census data, such as language spoken and religious affiliation, during the intermediate years.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=73}} In an early survey of the Chinese Indonesian minority, anthropologist [[G. William Skinner]] estimated that between 2.3 million (2.4 percent) and 2.6 million (2.7 percent) lived in Indonesia in 1961.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=97}} Former foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] provided a figure of 5 million in a report published in the ''[[Harian Indonesia]]'' daily in 1973.&lt;ref name="Adam Malik" /&gt; Many media and academic sources subsequently estimated between 4 and 5 percent of the total population as ethnic Chinese regardless of the year.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=73}} Estimates during the 2000s have placed the figure between 6 and 7 million,&lt;ref name="Johnston 3 March 2005" /&gt; and the [[Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission]] of the Republic of China estimated a population as high as 7.67 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ebooks.lib.ntu.edu.tw/1_file/ocac/31/Indonesia.pdf |title=印尼 2005 年華人人口統計推估 |website=ebooks.lib.ntu.edu.tw |date=October 2006 |language=Chinese |accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2010 population census, 22.3 percent of Chinese Indonesians lived in the capital city of [[Jakarta]], located on the island of Java. When the island's other provinces—[[Banten]], West Java, Central Java, [[Yogyakarta]], and East Java—are included, this population accounted for around half (51.8 percent) of all Chinese Indonesians.&lt;ref name="census 2010"/&gt; This data doesn't count the number of ethnic Chinese that have foreign citizenship. 8.15 percent of West Kalimantan's population is ethnic Chinese, followed by Bangka–Belitung Islands (8.14 percent), Riau Islands (7.66 percent), Jakarta (6.58 percent), North Sumatra (5,75 percent), Riau (1.84 percent). In each of the remaining provinces, Chinese Indonesians account for 1 percent or less of the provincial population.{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=27}} Most Chinese Indonesians in North Sumatra lived in the provincial capital of [[Medan]]; they are one of major ethnic groups in the city with the Bataks and Javanese people, but in the province, they constituted only a small percentage because of the relatively large population of the province, the sizeable Chinese population also presence in [[Binjai]], [[Tanjungbalai (Town)|Tanjungbalai]] and [[Pematangsiantar]] city.{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=26}} Bangka–Belitung, West Kalimantan, and Riau are grouped around the hub of ethnic Chinese economic activity in [[Singapore]] and, with the exception of Bangka–Belitung, these settlements existed long before Singapore's founding in 1819.{{sfn|Heidhues|1999|p=160}}

The ethnic Chinese population in Indonesia grew by an average of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant decrease in the number of Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s.{{sfn|Heidhues|1999|p=151}} The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their [[population pyramid]] had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in [[total fertility rate]]s. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age.{{sfn|Suryadinata|Arifin|Ananta|2003|p=80}} It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian population in 2000 constitutes the generation that experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=28}}

According to the last 2010 population census, the self-identified Chinese Indonesian population is 2,832,510. There is a growth of 17.5% from 2000 census.

=== Emigrant communities ===
{{main article|Overseas Indonesian}}
New migrants began moving from Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries to more industrialized regions around the world in the second half of the 20th century. Although these migrants possessed a Chinese heritage, they were often not identified as such; this trend has continued into the modern day.{{sfn|McKeown|2005|p=73}} There have been several independent estimates made of the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. [[James Jupp]]'s ''The Australian People'' encyclopedia estimated that half of over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities.{{sfn|Penny|Gunawan|2001|p=440}} In New Zealand, many migrants reside in the suburbs of [[Auckland]] after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.{{sfn|Walrond|2009}}

Australian scholar [[Charles Coppel]] believes Chinese Indonesian migrants also constitute a large majority of returned overseas Chinese living in Hong Kong. Though it is impossible to accurately count this number, news sources have provided estimates ranging from 100,000 to 150,000,{{efn|The estimate of 100,000 was published in ''[[Asiaweek]]'' on 3 June 1983}} while the estimate of 150,000 was published in the ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Standard]]'' on 21 December 1984. {{Harv|Coppel|2002|p=356}}.

Of the 57,000 Indonesians living in the United States in 2000, one-third were estimated to be ethnic Chinese.{{sfn|Cunningham|2008|p=106}} Locally knowledgeable migrants in [[Southern California]] estimate that 60 percent of [[Indonesian American]]s living in the area are of Chinese descent. Their families usually resided in Indonesia for several generations and may have intermarried with "pribumi".{{sfn|Cunningham|2008|p=95}} In Canada, only a minority of the emigrant Chinese Indonesian community speak Chinese. Although families are interested in rediscovering their ethnic traditions, their Canadian-born children are often reluctant to learn either Indonesian or Chinese.{{sfn|Nagata|1999|p=725}}

== Society ==

Each pair has a red colored bar on the left and a pink colored bar on the right.|Population estimates of the ''peranakan'' (shown in red) and ''totok'' (in pink) throughout the 20th century{{sfn|Suryadinata|1984|p=96}}]]
{{quote|1=It may be stated as a general rule that if a given area of Indonesia was settled by Chinese in appreciable numbers prior to this [20th] century, Chinese society there is in some degree dichotomous today. In one sector of the society, adults as well as children are Indonesia-born, the orientation toward China is attenuated, and the influence of the individual culture is apparent. In the other sector of the society, the population consists of twentieth-century immigrants and their immediate descendants, who are less acculturated and more strongly oriented toward China. The significance and pervasiveness of the social line between the two sectors varies from one part of Indonesia to another.|2=[[G. William Skinner]]|3="The Chinese Minority", ''Indonesia'' pp. 103–104}}

Scholars who study Chinese Indonesians often distinguish members of the group according to their racial and sociocultural background: the "''totok''" and the "''peranakan''". The two terms were initially used to racially distinguish the pure-blooded Chinese from those with mixed ancestry. A secondary meaning to the terms later arose that meant the "''totok''" were born in China and anyone born in Indonesia was considered "''peranakan''".{{efn|{{Harvtxt|Dawis|2009|p=77}} cited a presentation by Charles Coppel at the 29th International Congress of Orientalists for information on the initial usage of the two terms. {{Harvtxt|Skinner|1963|pp=105–106}} further noted that ''{{lang|id|totok}}'' is an Indonesian term specifically for foreign-born immigrants but is extended to include the descendants oriented toward their country of origin. ''{{lang|id|Peranakan}}'', on the other hand, means "children of the Indies".}} Segmentation within "''totok''" communities occurs through division in speech groups, a pattern that has become less apparent since the turn of the 20th century. Among the indigenized "''peranakan''" segmentation occurs through social class, which is graded according to education and family standing rather than wealth.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=110}}

=== Gender and kinship ===
{{See also|Chinese Indonesian surname|Peranakan Chinese}}
[[Kinship]] structure in the "''totok''" community follows the [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]], and [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] traditions of Chinese society, a practice which has lost emphasis in "''peranakan''" familial relationships. Instead, kinship patterns in indigenized families have incorporated elements of [[Matrilocal residence|matrilocal]], [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]], and [[Matriarchy|matrifocal]] traditions found in Javanese society. Within this community, both sons and daughters can inherit the family fortune, including ancestral tablets and ashes.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=77}} Political, social, and economic authority in "''peranakan''" families is more evenly distributed between the two genders than in "''totok''" families. Kin terms do not distinguish between maternal and paternal relatives and [[polygyny]] is strongly frowned upon. Western influence in "''peranakan''" society is evidenced by the high proportion of childless couples. Those who did have children also had fewer of them than "''totok''" couples.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=107}}

Despite their break from traditional kinship patterns, "''peranakan''" families are closer to some traditional Chinese values than the "''totok''". Because the indigenized population have lost much of the connection to their ancestral homes in the coastal provinces of China, they are less affected by the 20th-century modernization patterns that transformed the region. The "''peranakan''" have a stricter attitude toward divorce, though the separation rates among families in both segments are generally lower than other ethnic groups. [[Arranged marriage]]s are more common in "peranakan" families, whose relationships tend to be more [[Nepotism|nepotistic]]. Secularization among the "totok" meant that their counterparts carry out ancestral rituals to a higher degree, and "peranakan" youth tend to be more religious. Through education provided by high-quality Catholic and Protestant schools, these youth are much more likely to convert to Christianity.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=108}}

In the 21st century, the conceptual differences of "''totok''" and "''peranakan''" Chinese are slowly becoming outdated as some families show a mixture of characteristics from both cultures.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=80}} [[Interracial marriage]] and cultural assimilation often prevent the formation a precise definition of Chinese Indonesians in line with any simple racial criterion. Use of a [[Chinese surname]], in some form or circumstance, is generally a sign of cultural self-identification as ethnic Chinese or alignment with a Chinese social system.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=97}}

===Identity===

Ethnic Chinese in the 1930 Dutch East Indies census were categorized as foreign orientals, which led to separate registration.{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=20}} Citizenship was conferred upon the ethnic Chinese through a 1946 citizenship act after Indonesia became independent, and it was further reaffirmed in 1949 and 1958. However, they often encountered obstacles regarding the legality of their citizenship. Chinese Indonesians were required to produce an [[Proof of Citizenship of the Republic of Indonesia|Indonesian Citizenship Certificate]] (''{{lang|id|Surat Bukti Kewarganegaraan Republik Indonesia}}'', SBKRI) when conducting business with government officials.{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=805}} Without the SBKRI, they were not able to make passports and [[Indonesian identity card|identity cards]] (''{{lang|id|Kartu Tanda Penduduk}}'', KTP); register birth, death, and marriage certificates; or register a business license.{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=806}} The requirement for its use was abolished in 1996 through a presidential instruction which was reaffirmed in 1999, but media sources reported that local authorities were still demanding the SBKRI from Chinese Indonesians after the instructions went into effect.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=179}}

Other terms used for identifying sectors of the community include ''{{lang|id|[[:wikt:peranakan|peranakan]]}}'' and ''{{lang|id|totok}}''. The former, traditionally used to describe those born locally, is derived from the root [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] word ''{{lang|id|[[:wikt:anak|anak]]}}'' ("child") and thus means "child of the land". The latter is derived from [[Javanese language|Javanese]], meaning "new" or "pure", and is used to describe the foreign born and new immigrants.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=1}} A significant number of Chinese Indonesians also live in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong; they are considered part of the population of "returned overseas Chinese" ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:歸|歸]] [[:wikt:國|國]] [[:wikt:華僑|華僑]]}}).{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=357}} To identify the varying sectors of Chinese Indonesian society, Tan contends they must be differentiated according to nationality into those who are citizens of the host country and those who are [[Alien (law)|resident aliens]], then further broken down according to their cultural orientation and social identification.{{sfn|Kahin|1991|p=119}} In her doctoral dissertation, Aimee Dawis notes that such definitions, based on cultural affinity and not nation of origin, have gained currency since the early 1990s, although the old definition is occasionally used.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|pp=78–82}}

Sociologist [[Mely G. Tan]] asserts that scholars studying ethnic Chinese emigrants often refer to the group as a "monolithic entity": the [[overseas Chinese]].{{sfn|Kahin|1991|p=119}} Such treatment also persists in Indonesia; a majority of the population referred to them as ''{{lang|id|orang Cina}}'' or ''{{lang|id|orang Tionghoa}}'' (both meaning "Chinese people", {{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:中華|中華]] [[:wikt:人|人]]}}), or ''{{lang|id|hoakiau}}'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:華僑|華僑]]}}).{{efn|The latter two terms are derived from the [[Hokkien]] Chinese. Sociologist [[Mely G. Tan]] argued that these terms "only apply to those who are alien, not of mixed ancestry, and who initially do not plan to stay in Indonesia permanently" {{Harv|Kahin|1991|p=119}}. She also noted that the terms ''{{lang|id|Cina}}'' (''{{lang|id|Tjina}}'' in older orthography) and ''{{lang|jv|Cino}}'' (''{{lang|id|Tjino}}'') carry a derogatory meaning to earlier generations of immigrants, especially those living on the island of Java. {{Harvtxt|Dawis|2009|p=75}} noted this connotation appears to have faded in later generations.}} They were previously described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] literature as the Indonesian Chinese, but there has been a shift in terminology  as the old description emphasizes the group's Chinese origins, while the more recent one, its Indonesian integration.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2004|p=viii}} Aimee Dawis, citing prominent scholar [[Leo Suryadinata]], believes the shift is "necessary to debunk the stereotype that they are an exclusive group" and also "promotes a sense of nationalism" among them.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=xxii}}

Members of the "totok" community are more inclined to be entrepreneurs and adhere to the practice of ''[[guanxi]]'', which is based on the idea that one's existence is influenced by the connection to others, implying the importance of business connections.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=78}} In the first decade following Indonesian independence their business standing strengthened after being limited to small businesses in the colonial period. By the 1950s virtually all [[Retailing|retail stores]] in Indonesia were owned by ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, whose businesses ranged from selling [[Grocery store|groceries]] to construction material. Discontentment soon grew among indigenous merchants who felt unable to compete with ethnic Chinese businesses.&lt;ref name="Tempo 2007" /&gt; Under pressure from indigenous merchants, the government enacted the [[Benteng program]] and [[PP 10/1959|Presidential Regulation 10 of 1959]], which imposed restrictions on ethnic Chinese importers and rural retailers. Ethnic Chinese businesses persisted, owing to their integration into larger networks throughout Southeast Asia, and their dominance continued despite continuous state and private efforts to encourage the growth of indigenous capital.{{sfn|Robison|1986|p=272}} Indonesian Chinese businesses are part of the larger [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.&lt;ref name="Weidenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government policies shifted dramatically after 1965, becoming more favorable to economic expansion. In an effort to rehabilitate the economy, the government turned to those who possessed the capability to invest and expand corporate activity. Ethnic Chinese capitalists, called the ''{{lang|id|cukong}}'', were supported by the military, which emerged as the dominant political force after 1965.{{sfn|Robison|1986|p=272}} Indigenous businessmen once again demanded greater investment support from the government in the 1970s, but legislative efforts failed to reduce ethnic Chinese dominance.{{sfn|Robison|1986|p=275}} In a 1995 study published by the East Asia Analytical Unit of Australia's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], approximately 73 percent of the [[market capitalization]] value of [[Public company|publicly listed companies]] (excluding foreign and state-owned companies) were owned by Chinese Indonesians. Additionally, they owned 68 percent of the top 300 [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] and nine of the top ten private sector groups at the end of 1993.{{sfn|East Asia Analytical Unit|1995|p=41}} This figure propagated the general belief that ethnic Chinese—then estimated at 3 percent of the population—controlled 70 percent of the economy.&lt;ref name="BusinessWorld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mead 28 June 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmetzer 18 March 1998" /&gt; Although the accuracy of this figure was disputed, it was evident that a [[Income inequality metrics|wealth disparity]] existed along ethnic boundaries. The image of an economically powerful ethnic Chinese community was further fostered by the government through its inability to dissociate itself from the [[patronage]] networks.{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=43}} The [[Fuzhou people|Hokchia]] group dominated the ethnic Chinese business scene during the Suharto government, although other groups emerged after 1998.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2008|p=11}}

The top five conglomerates in Indonesia prior to the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]—the [[Salim Group]], [[Astra International]], the [[Sinar Mas Group]], [[Gudang Garam]], [[Sampoerna]] and the [[Lippo Group]]—were all owned by ethnic Chinese, with annual sales totaling [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]112 trillion (US$47 billion).{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=147}} When the crisis finally hit the country, the rupiah's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations. Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed. Over the next several years, other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts.{{sfn|Chua|2008|pp=72–73}} Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] arrangements established under the New Order;{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=75}} however, plans for reform proved too optimistic. When President B.&amp;nbsp;J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen, the rupiah's value plunged 5 percent.{{efn|Habibie said in the interview, "If the Chinese community doesn't come back because they don't trust their own country and society, I cannot force [them], nobody can force them. [...] Do you really think that we will then die? Their place will be taken over by others." {{Harv|Suryadinata|1999|p=9}}.}} This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies, and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans.{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=88}} Most were initially fearful of democratization, but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society for the first time in the nation's history.{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=114}}{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=116}} Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces, and economic reforms created a freer market.{{sfn|Chua|2008|p=142}}

=== Political activity ===
Between the 18th and early 20th centuries, ethnic Chinese communities were dominated by the "peranakan" presence.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=105}} This period was followed by the growth of "totok" society. As part of a [[Sinicization|resinicization]] effort by the indigenized ethnic Chinese community, a new pan-Chinese movement emerged with the goal of a unified Chinese political identity. The movement later split in the 1920s when "peranakan" elites resisted the leadership of the "totok" in the nationalist movement, and the two groups developed their own objectives.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=79}} When it became apparent that unification was being achieved on "totok" terms, "peranakan" leaders chose to align their community with the Dutch, who had abandoned the segregation policies in 1908. The two communities once again found common ground in opposition to the invading Japanese when the occupying forces treated all Chinese groups with contempt.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=109}}

The issue of nationality, following independence, politicized the ethnic Chinese and led to the formation of [[Baperki]] in 1954, as the first and largest Chinese Indonesian mass organization. Baperki and its majority "peranakan" membership led the opposition against a draft law that would have restricted the number of ethnic Chinese who could gain Indonesian citizenship. This movement was met by the Islamic [[Masyumi Party]] in 1956 when it called for the implementation of [[affirmative action]] for indigenous businesses.{{sfn|Purdey|2006|p=9}} During the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1955|1955 legislative election]], Baperki received 178,887 votes and gained a seat on the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR). Later that year, two Baperki candidates were also [[Indonesian Constituent Assembly election, 1955|elected]] to the [[Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia|Constitutional Assembly]].{{sfn|Suryadinata|2002|p=133}}

Ethnic-based political parties were banned under the government of President Suharto, leaving only the three indigenous-dominated parties of [[Golkar]], the [[United Development Party]] (PPP), and the [[Indonesian Democratic Party]] (PDI). The depoliticizing of Indonesian society confined ethnic Chinese activities to the economic sector. Chinese Indonesian critics of the regime were mostly "peranakan" and projected themselves as Indonesians, leaving the ethnic Chinese with no visible leaders.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2002|p=133}} On the eve of the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1999|1999 legislative election]], after Suharto's resignation, the news magazine ''[[Tempo (Indonesia magazine)|Tempo]]'' conducted a survey of likely Chinese Indonesian voters on their political party of choice for the election. Although respondents were able to choose more than one party, 70 percent favored the [[Indonesian Democratic Party&amp;nbsp;– Struggle]] (PDI–P), whose image of a nationalist party was considered favorable toward the ethnic Chinese. The party also benefited from the presence of economist [[Kwik Kian Gie]], who was well respected by both ethnic Chinese and non-ethnic-Chinese voters.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2002|pp=127–128}}

New ethnic political parties such as the Chinese Indonesian Reform Party (''{{lang|id|Partai Reformasi Tionghoa Indonesia}}'', PARTI) and the Indonesian Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Party (''{{lang|id|Partai Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Indonesia}}'', PBI) failed to garner much support in the 1999 election. Despite this result, the number of Chinese Indonesian candidates standing in national election increased from fewer than 50 in 1999 to almost 150 in 2004.&lt;ref name="Tjhin 21 December 2008" /&gt; Of the 58 candidates of Chinese descent who ran for office as representatives from Jakarta in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]], two won seats.&lt;ref name="The Jakarta Post 12 June 2009" /&gt;

== Culture ==
=== Language ===
Four major Chinese-speech groups are represented in Indonesia: [[Hokkien]] (Southern Min; Min Nan), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]]. In addition to these, the [[Teochew people]] speak [[Teochew dialect|their own dialect]] that has some degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Hokkien]]. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin.{{sfn|Skinner|1963|p=102}} There were an estimated 2.2 million [[native speaker]]s of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of [[Southern Min]] varieties (including [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]); 640,000 [[Hakka]] speakers; 460,000 [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the [[Eastern Min]] varieties (including [[Fuzhou dialect]]). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the [[Indonesian language]].{{sfn|Lewis|2005|p=391}}

Many of the Chinese living in capital city [[Jakarta]] and other towns located in Java are not fluent in Chinese languages, due to New Order's banning of Chinese languages, but those who are living in non-Java cities especially in Sumatra and Kalimantan can speak Chinese and its dialects fluently. The Chinese along the North-Eastern coast of Sumatra, especially in [[North Sumatra]], [[Riau]], [[Riau Islands]] and [[Jambi]] are predominantly Hokkien (Min Nan) speakers, and there are also two different variants of Hokkien being used, such as [[Medan Hokkien]], which is based on the Zhangzhou dialect and [[Riau Hokkien]], which is based on the Quanzhou dialect. There are also Hokkien speakers in Java, Sulawesi and Kalimantan (Borneo). Meanwhile, the Hakkas are the majority in [[Aceh]], [[Bangka-Belitung]] and [[West Kalimantan]] north of Pontianak. Some Hakkas also live in parts of Java. The [[Cantonese people]]s mainly living in big cities like Jakarta, [[Medan]], [[Batam]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]]. The Teochew people become the majority in [[West Kalimantan]] especially in Central to Southern area such as [[Ketapang]], Kendawangan and [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], as well as in Riau Islands. There are some Fuzhounese speakers in [[East Java]], especially in [[Surabaya]].

Many Indonesians, including the ethnic Chinese, believe in the existence of a dialect of the [[Malay language]], Chinese Malay, known locally as ''{{lang|id|Melayu Tionghoa}}'' or ''{{lang|id|Melayu Cina}}''. The growth of "peranakan" literature in the second half of the 19th century gave rise to such a variant, popularized through ''[[silat]]'' (martial arts) stories translated from Chinese or written in Malay and Indonesian. However, scholars argue it is different from the mixture of spoken [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and Malay that is perceived to be "spoken exclusively by ethnic Chinese".{{efn|Indonesian scholar [[Dede Oetomo]] believed "the term 'Chinese Malay' is really a misnomer. There may be a continuity between 'Chinese Malay' and modern [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially because the former was also used in the written discourse of members of ethnic groups besides the Chinese in the colonial period and well into the postindependence era" {{Harv|Kahin|1991|p=54}}.}}

{{quote|[E]xcept for a few loan words from Chinese, nothing about 'Chinese Malay' is uniquely Chinese. The language was simply low, bazaar Malay, the common tongue of Java's streets and markets, especially of its cities, spoken by all ethnic groups in the urban and multi-ethnic environment. Because Chinese were a dominant element in the cities and markets, the language was associated with them, but government officials, Eurasians, migrant traders, or people from different language areas, all resorted to this form of Malay to communicate.|Mary Somers Heidhues|''The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas''{{sfn|Heidhues|1999|p=154}}
}}

Academic literature discussing Chinese Malay commonly note that ethnic Chinese do not speak the same dialect of Malay throughout the archipelago.{{sfn|Kahin|1991|p=55}} Furthermore, although the Dutch colonial government first introduced the Malay [[orthography]] in 1901, Chinese newspapers did not follow this standard until after independence.{{sfn|Kahin|1991|p=61}} Because of these factors, the ethnic Chinese play a "significant role" in the development of the modern Indonesian language as the largest group during the colonial period to communicate in a variety of Malay dialects.{{sfn|Kahin|1991|p=65}}

By 2018 the numbers of Chinese Indonesians studying Standard Mandarin increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tan-Johannes, Grace|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/families/article/2160779/three-reasons-more-chinese-indonesians-are-learning-mandarin-and|title=Why more Chinese Indonesians are learning Mandarin, and nurturing their children’s sense of belonging to Chinese culture|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2018-08-23|accessdate=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
Chinese cultural influences can be seen in local Chinese Malay literature, which dates back to the late 19th century. One of the earliest and most comprehensive works on this subject, [[Claudine Salmon|Claudine Salmon's]] 1981 book ''Literature in Malay by the Chinese of Indonesia: A Provisional Annotated Bibliography'', lists over 3,000 works. Samples of this literature were also published in a six-volume collection titled ''{{lang|id|Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia}}'' ("Chinese Malay Literature and the Indonesian Nation").{{sfn|Tan|2005|p=806}}

[[Kho Ping Hoo]] or Asmaraman Sukowati Kho Ping Hoo  is a beloved Indonesian author of [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] ethnicity. He is well known in Indonesia for his martial art fiction set in the background of China or [[Java]]. During his 30 years career, at least 120 stories has been published (according to [[Leo Suryadinata]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} However, ''[[Forum (Indonesian magazine)|Forum]]'' magazine claimed at least Kho Ping Hoo had 400 stories with the background of China and 50 stories with the background of Java.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Media ===
All Chinese-language publications were prohibited under the assimilation policy of the Suharto period, with the exception of the government-controlled daily newspaper ''[[Harian Indonesia]]''.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=3}} The lifting of the Chinese-language ban after 1998 prompted the older generation of Chinese Indonesians to promote its use to the younger generation; according to Malaysian-Chinese researcher of the Chinese diaspora, Chang-Yau Hoon, they believed they would "be influenced by the virtues of Chinese culture and [[Confucianism|Confucian values]]".{{sfn|Hoon|2006|p=113}} One debate took place in the media in 2003, discussing the Chinese "mu yu" ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:母語|母語]]}}, "mother tongue") and the Indonesian "guo yu" ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[:wikt:國語|國語]]}}, "national language").{{sfn|Hoon|2006|p=113}} [[Nostalgia]] was a common theme in the Chinese-language press in the period immediately following Suharto's government. The rise of China's political and economic standing at the turn of the 21st century became an impetus for their attempt to attract younger readers who seek to rediscover their cultural roots.{{sfn|Hoon|2006|p=114}}

During the first three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned most, if not all, movie theaters in cities throughout the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 with the arrival of the three [[Wong brothers]] from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s.{{sfn|Sen|2006|p=121}} These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined [[Miscegenation|inter-ethnic relations]] as a main theme.{{sfn|Sen|2006|p=123}} The later ban on the public use of Chinese language meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because of an agreement between importers and the film censor board.{{sfn|Dawis|2009|p=14}}

There is little scholarly work devoted to the religious life of Chinese Indonesians. The 1977 French book ''{{lang|fr|Les Chinois de Jakarta: Temples et Vie Collective}}'' ("The Chinese of Jakarta: Temples and Collective Life") is the only major study to assess ethnic Chinese religious life in Indonesia.{{sfn|Coppel|2002|p=256}} The Ministry of Religious Affairs grants official status to six religions: [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]], [[Roman Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholicism]], [[Protestantism in Indonesia|Protestantism]], [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hinduism]], [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism in Indonesia|Confucianism]]. A 2006 civil registration law does not allow Indonesians to identify themselves as a member of any other religion on their identity cards.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor" /&gt;

According to the census data, almost 80 percent of Chinese Indonesians are Buddhist or Catholic .{{sfn|Ananta|Arifin|Bakhtiar|2008|p=30,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/opinion/in-indonesia-the-chinese-go-to-church.html}} With the exception of Chinese-Filipinos, Chinese Indonesians tend to be more Christian than other Chinese ethnic groups of Southeast Asia due to a complex of historical reasons. Throughout the 20th century [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]] and culture was forbidden and persecuted in Indonesia, forcing many Chinese to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Lindsey-Pausacker&gt;Tim Lindsey, Helen Pausacker. ''Chinese Indonesians: Remembering, Distorting, Forgetting''. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2005. {{ISBN|9812303030}}. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of conversions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, and the number of ethnic Chinese Christians during this period quadrupled. The second wave followed after the government withdrew Confucianism's status as a recognized religion in the 1970s. [[Suharto]] endorsed a systematic campaign of eradication of Confucianism.&lt;ref name=Lindsey-Pausacker/&gt; As the result, many Chinese in [[Jakarta]] and other parts in [[Java Island|Java island]] are mostly Christian, meanwhile in non-Java cities like [[Medan]], [[Pontianak]] and other parts in [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] island are still adherent to Buddhism, and some of them still practising Taoism, Confucianism and other traditional Chinese belief.&lt;ref name="AFP 7 February 2008" /&gt;

In a country where nearly 90 percent of the population are Muslims, the ethnic Chinese Muslims form a small minority of the ethnic Chinese population. The 2010 census reckoned that 3.6% of Chinese Indonesians were followers of Islam.&lt;ref name=2010census/&gt; Associations such as the Organization of Chinese Muslims of Indonesia (''{{lang|id|Persatuan Islam Tionghoa Indonesia}}'', PITI) had been in existence in the late 19th century. PITI was re-established in 1963 as a modern organization, but occasionally experienced periods of inactivity.{{sfn|Ma|2005|p=120}} The [[Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia]] (''{{lang|id|Majelis Tinggi Agama Khonghucu Indonesia}}'', MATAKIN) estimated that 95 percent of Confucians are ethnic Chinese; most of the remaining 5 percent are ethnic [[Javanese people|Javanese]] converts.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor" /&gt; Although the government has restored Confucianism's status as a recognized religion, many local authorities do not abide by it and have refused to allow ethnic Chinese from listing it as a religion on their identity cards.{{sfn|Suryadinata|2008|p=10}} Local officials remained largely unaware that the civil registration law legally allowed citizens to leave the religion section on their identity cards blank.&lt;ref name="Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor" /&gt;

Various forms of Chinese architecture exist throughout Indonesia with marked differences between urban and rural areas and among the different islands.{{sfn|Pratiwo|2007|p=74}} Architectural developments by the Chinese in Southeast Asia differ from those in mainland China. By blending local and European (Dutch) design patterns, numerous variations of fusion styles emerged.{{sfn|Widodo|2007|p=69}} Chinese architecture in Indonesia has manifested in three forms: [[Temple (Chinese)|religious temples]], study halls, and houses.{{sfn|Pratiwo|2007|p=74}} Cities during the colonial period were divided into three racial districts: European, oriental (Arabs, Chinese, and other Asians), and indigenous. There usually were no physical boundaries among the zones, except for rivers, walls, or roads in some cases. Such legal boundaries promoted high growths in [[urban density]] within each zone, especially in the Chinese quarters, often leading to poor environmental conditions.{{sfn|Widodo|2007|p=60}}

Early settlers did not adhere to traditional architectural practices when constructing houses, but instead adapted to living conditions in Indonesia. Although the earliest houses are no longer standing, they were likely built from wood or bamboo with [[Thatching|thatched roofs]], resembling indigenous houses found throughout Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. More permanent constructions replaced these settlements in the 19th century.{{sfn|Pratiwo|2007|p=75}} Segregation policies under the Dutch forbade the use of European architectural styles by non-European ethnic groups. The ethnic Chinese and other foreign and indigenous groups lived according to their own cultures. Chinese houses along the north coast of Java were renovated to include Chinese ornamentation.{{sfn|Pratiwo|2007|p=76}} As racial segregation eased at the turn of the 20th century, the ethnic Chinese who had lost their identity embraced European culture and began removing ethnic ornaments from their buildings. The policies implemented by the New Order government which prohibited the public display of Chinese culture have also accelerated the transition toward local and Western architecture.{{sfn|Pratiwo|2007|p=77}}

Chinese culinary culture is particularly evident in [[Indonesian cuisine]] through the Hokkien, Hakka, and Cantonese [[loanword]]s used for various dishes.{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=154}} Words beginning with ''{{lang|id|bak}}'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:肉|肉]]}}) signify the presence of meat, e.g. ''{{lang|id|bakpau}}'' ("[[Baozi|meat bun]]"); words ending with ''{{lang|id|cai}}'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:菜|菜]]}}) signify vegetables, e.g. ''{{lang|id|pecai}}'' ("[[Chinese cabbage|Chinese white cabbage]]") and ''{{lang|id|[[cap cai]]}}''.{{sfn|Tan|2002|pp=155–156}} The words ''{{lang|id|mi}}'' or ''{{lang|id|mie}}'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|[[wikt:麵|麵]]}}) signify [[noodle]] as in ''{{lang|id|[[mi goreng]]}}''.

Most of these loanwords for food dishes and their ingredients are Hokkien in origin, and are used throughout the Indonesian language and [[vernacular]] speech of large cities. Because they have become an integral part of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as [[nasi goreng]], [[lumpia]], and [[Bakpia Pathok|bakpia]] can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the [[staple food]] of most of the country.{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=158}} Among ethnic Chinese families, both ''peranakan'' and ''totok'', pork is generally preferred as meat;{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=157}} this is in contrast with traditional [[Indonesian cuisine]], which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol levels]] and heart disease.{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=158}}

In a 1997 restaurant listing published by the English-language daily ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'', which largely caters to [[expatriate]]s and middle class Indonesians, at least 80 locations within the city can be considered Chinese out of the 10-page list. Additionally, major hotels generally operate one or two Chinese restaurants, and many more can be found in large shopping centers.{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=160}} Upscale Chinese restaurants in Jakarta, where the urban character of the ethnic Chinese is well established, can be found serving delicacies such as [[shark fin soup]] and [[bird's nest soup]].{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=154}} Food considered to have healing properties, including ingredients in [[traditional Chinese medicine]], are in high demand.{{sfn|Tan|2002|p=168}}

They are also commonly known by the [[DuPont]] brand name '''[[Freon]]'''. The most common representative is [[dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs have been widely used as [[refrigerants]], propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to [[ozone depletion]] in the upper [[atmosphere]], the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]], and they are being replaced with other products such as [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110526125911/http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change "Climate Change."] The White House. 6 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[R-410A]]) and R-134a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mironov | first1 = O.

== Structure, properties and production ==
{{Main|Organofluorine chemistry}}
As in simpler [[alkanes]], carbon in the CFCs bonds with [[tetrahedral]] symmetry. Because the fluorine and chlorine atoms differ greatly in size and effective charge from hydrogen and from each other, the methane-derived CFCs deviate from perfect tetrahedral symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Siegemund, Günter ''et al.'' (2002) "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical properties of CFCs and HCFCs are tunable by changes in the number and identity of the [[halogen]] atoms. In general, they are volatile but less so than their parent alkanes. The decreased volatility is attributed to the molecular polarity induced by the [[halide]]s, which induces intermolecular interactions. Thus, methane boils at −161&amp;nbsp;°C whereas the fluoromethanes boil between −51.7 (CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and −128&amp;nbsp;°C (CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants. The CFCs are far less flammable than methane, in part because they contain fewer C-H bonds and in part because, in the case of the chlorides and bromides, the released halides quench the free radicals that sustain flames.

The densities of CFCs are higher than their corresponding alkanes. In general, the density of these compounds correlates with the number of chlorides.

CFCs and HCFCs are usually produced by halogen exchange starting from chlorinated methanes and ethanes. Illustrative is the synthesis of chlorodifluoromethane from [[chloroform]]:
:HCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HF → HCF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 2 HCl
The brominated derivatives are generated by free-radical reactions of the chlorofluorocarbons, replacing C-H bonds with C-Br bonds. The production of the [[anesthetic]] [[halothane|2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane]] ("halothane") is illustrative:
:CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHBrCl + HBr

==Reactions==
The most important reaction{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} of the CFCs is the [[photochemical reaction|photo-induced scission]] of a C-Cl bond:
:CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F → CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;
The chlorine atom, written often as Cl&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;, behaves very differently from the chlorine molecule (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The radical Cl&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt; is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Ozone absorbs UV-B radiation, so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. [[Bromine]] atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.

==Applications==
CFCs and HCFCs are used in a variety of applications because of their low toxicity, reactivity and flammability. Every permutation of fluorine, chlorine and hydrogen based on methane and ethane has been examined and most have been commercialized. Furthermore, many examples are known for higher numbers of carbon as well as related compounds containing bromine. Uses include [[refrigerants]], [[blowing agent]]s, propellants in medicinal applications and degreasing solvents.

Billions of kilograms of chlorodifluoromethane are produced annually as precursor to [[tetrafluoroethylene]], the monomer that is converted into [[Teflon]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Rossberg, M. et al.

==Classes of compounds, nomenclature==
*Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): when derived from methane and ethane these compounds have the formulae CCl&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4−m&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6−m&lt;/sub&gt;, where m is nonzero.
*Hydro-chlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs): when derived from methane and ethane these compounds have the formula CCl&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4−m−n&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6−x−y&lt;/sub&gt;, where m, n, x, and y are nonzero.
* and [[bromofluorocarbon]]s have formulae similar to the CFCs and HCFCs but also include bromine.
*Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): when derived from methane, ethane, [[propane]], and [[butane]], these compounds have the respective formulae CF&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4−m&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6−m&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8−m&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10−m&lt;/sub&gt;, where m is nonzero.

=== Numbering system ===
{{Main|refrigerant#Refrigerants by class}}

A special numbering system is used for fluorinated alkanes, prefixed with Freon-, R-, CFC- and HCFC-, where the rightmost value indicates the number of fluorine atoms, the next value to the left is the number of hydrogen atoms ''plus'' 1, and the next value to the left is the number of carbon atoms ''less'' one (zeroes are not stated), and the remaining atoms are [[chlorine]].

Freon-12, for example, indicates a methane derivative (only two numbers) containing two fluorine atoms (the second 2) and no hydrogen (1-1=0). It is therefore CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another equation that can be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take the numbering and add 90 to it. The resulting value will give the number of carbons as the first numeral, the second numeral gives the number of hydrogen atoms, and the third numeral gives the number of fluorine atoms. The rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -&gt; 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it gives the number of carbon atoms of the molecule.

[[Freon]]s containing bromine are signified by four numbers. [[Isomer]]s, which are common for ethane and propane derivatives, are indicated by letters following the numbers :

==History==
[[Carbon tetrachloride]] (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used in fire extinguishers and glass "anti-fire grenades" from the late nineteenth century until around the end of [[World War II]]. Experimentation with chloroalkanes for fire suppression on military [[aircraft]] began at least as early as the 1920s. ''[[Freon]]'' is a trade name for a group of CFCs which are used primarily as [[refrigerant]]s, but also have uses in fire-fighting and as propellants in [[aerosol can]]s. Bromomethane is widely used as a fumigant. Dichloromethane is a versatile industrial solvent.

The Belgian scientist [[Frédéric Swarts]] pioneered the synthesis of CFCs in the 1890s. He developed an effective exchange agent to replace chloride in carbon tetrachloride with fluoride to synthesize CFC-11 (CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F) and CFC-12 (CCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

In the late 1920s, [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] improved the process of synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[methyl chloride|chloromethane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low [[boiling point]], low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the [[American Chemical Society]], Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle&lt;ref&gt;Bellis, Mary.

(2001) ''Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the Twentieth-Century World'' New York: Norton, xxvi, 421 pp. (as reviewed in the ''[http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/ej/jpe/volume_9/1101bess.html Journal of Political Ecology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328013401/http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/ej/jpe/volume_9/1101bess.html |date=2004-03-28 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial development and use===
[[File:CFCs.svg|thumb|300px]]
During [[World War II]], various chloroalkanes were in standard use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with [[Bromotrifluoromethane|Halon 1301]] was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while [[Bromochlorodifluoromethane|Halon 1211]] was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with [[warship]]s, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.

By the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the [[ozone layer]]. The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.

===Regulation===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Since the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the [[Ozone depletion|ozone layer]]. After the development of his [[electron capture detector]], [[James Lovelock]] was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a [[mole fraction]] of 60 [[parts per trillion|ppt]] of CFC-11 over [[Ireland]]. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by [[Sherry Rowland]] and [[Mario Molina]] who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features—their low reactivity— is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper [[stratosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Bing-Sun|last2=Chiou|first2=Chung-Biau|title=The Relationship of Meteorological and Anthropogenic Factors to Time Series Measurements of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CH3CCl3 Concentrations in the Urban Atmosphere|journal=Atmospheric Environment|date=October 2008|volume=42|issue=33|page=7707|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.05.042|bibcode=2008AtmEn..42.7706L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once in the stratosphere, the sun's [[ultraviolet]] radiation is strong enough to cause the [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the C-Cl bond.

[[:File:Future ozone layer concentrations.gif|Animated version]].]]

By 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over [[Antarctica]], diplomats in [[Montreal]] forged a treaty, the [[Montreal Protocol]], which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 [[European Community]] nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in [[London]] and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by the year 2000. By the year 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.

Because the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled "Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances". UNEP estimates that between 16,000–38,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf "Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322071146/http://www.mea-ren.org/files/publications/Illegal%20Trade%20in%20ODS.pdf |date=2012-03-22 }}.

Yonhap News Agency. 23 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many banned CFC producing products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. In 2018 public attention was drawn to the issue, that at an unknown place in east Asia an estimated amount of 13.000 metric tons annually of CFCs have been produced since about 2012 in violation of the protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozonkiller: Ein verbotener Stoff in der Atmosphäre - WELT|periodical=welt.de|publisher=|url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article176426312/Ozonkiller-Ein-verbotener-Stoff-in-der-Atmosphaere.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-05-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozone hole-forming chemical emissions increasing and mysterious source in East Asia may be responsible|periodical=independent.co.uk|publisher=|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/ozone-hole-chemicals-cfc-increase-mystery-source-east-asia-antarctica-a8354481.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-05-18|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.

By the time of the [[Montreal Protocol]], it was realised that deliberate and accidental discharges during system tests and maintenance accounted for substantially larger volumes than emergency discharges, and consequently halons were brought into the treaty, albeit with many exceptions.

====Regulatory gap====
While the production and consumption of CFCs are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, emissions from existing banks of CFCs are not regulated under the agreement. In 2002, there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of CFCs in existing products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol cans and others.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Nick ''et al.''

====Regulation and DuPont====
In 1978 the United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans, the beginning of a long series of regulatory actions against their use. The critical DuPont manufacturing patent for Freon ("Process for Fluorinating Halohydrocarbons", U.S. Patent #3258500) was set to expire in 1979. In conjunction with other industrial peers DuPont formed a lobbying group, the "Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy," to combat regulations of ozone-depleting compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Desombre, E.R., 2000: Domestic Sources of International Environmental Policy: Industry, Environmentalists, and U.S. Power. MIT Press. SBN: 9780262041799. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 DuPont, with new patents in hand, reversed its previous stance and publicly condemned CFCs.&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;"Ethics of Du Pont's CFC Strategy 1975–1995", Smith B. ''Journal of Business Ethics'', Volume 17, Number 5, April 1998, pp. 557–568(12)&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont representatives appeared before the [[Montreal Protocol]] urging that CFCs be banned worldwide and stated that their new HCFCs would meet the worldwide demand for refrigerants.&lt;ref name="Ethics"/&gt;

===Phasing-out of CFCs===&lt;!-- don't change name, it is used as direct jump-address--&gt;
Use of certain chloroalkanes as solvents for large scale application, such as dry cleaning, have been phased out, for example, by the [[Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control|IPPC]] directive on [[greenhouse gas]]es in 1994 and by the [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOC) directive of the [[European Union|EU]] in 1997. Permitted chlorofluoroalkane uses are medicinal only.

Bromofluoroalkanes have been largely phased out and the possession of equipment for their use is prohibited in some countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, from 1 January 2004, based on the [[Montreal Protocol]] and guidelines of the European Union.

Production of new stocks ceased in most (probably all) countries in 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} However many countries still require aircraft to be fitted with halon fire suppression systems because no safe and completely satisfactory alternative has been discovered for this application. There are also a few other, highly specialized uses. These programs recycle halon through "halon banks" coordinated by the Halon Recycling Corporation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halon.org/ Welcome to the Halon Corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919000942/http://www.halon.org/ |date=2009-09-19 }}.

===Development of alternatives for CFCs===
Work on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] ozone were published.

The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are less stable in the lower atmosphere, enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the [[stratosphere]] and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref name=prin/&gt; One of these compounds, [[HFC-134a]], is now used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the USA and many other countries, as they have excellent thermodynamic properties and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures.

One of the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf "Greenpeace, Cool Technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160041/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/china/en/campaigns/stop-climate-change/climate-friendly-cooling/cool-technologies-part-1.pdf |date=2008-07-06 }}.

==Environmental impacts==
As previously discussed, CFCs were phased out via the [[Montreal Protocol]] due to their part in ozone depletion. However, the atmospheric impacts of CFCs are not limited to its role as an active ozone reducer. This anthropogenic compound is also a [[greenhouse gas]], with a much higher potential to enhance the greenhouse effect than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Infrared absorption bands trap heat from escaping earth's atmosphere. In the case of CFCs, the strongest of these bands are located in the spectral region 7.8–15.3&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] &lt;ref name="Rothman L.S. et 42 alia, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothman|first=L|title=The HITRAN 2008 molecular spectroscopic database|journal=Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer|year=2009|volume=100|issue=9–10|pages=533–572|doi=10.1016/j.jqsrt.2009.02.013|bibcode=2009JQSRT.110..533R|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/Download/HITRAN2008.pdf|last2=Gordon|first2=I.E.|last3=Barbe|first3=A.|last4=Benner|first4=D.Chris|last5=Bernath|first5=P.F.|last6=Birk|first6=M.|last7=Boudon|first7=V.|last8=Brown|first8=L.R.|last9=Campargue|first9=A.|last10=Champion|first10=J.-P.|last11=Chance|first11=K.|last12=Coudert|first12=L.H.|last13=Dana|first13=V.|last14=Devi|first14=V.M.|last15=Fally|first15=S.|last16=Flaud|first16=J.-M.|last17=Gamache|first17=R.R.|last18=Goldman|first18=A.|last19=Jacquemart|first19=D.|last20=Kleiner|first20=I.|last21=Lacome|first21=N.|last22=Lafferty|first22=W.J.|last23=Mandin|first23=J.-Y.|last24=Massie|first24=S.T.|last25=Mikhailenko|first25=S.N.|last26=Miller|first26=C.E.|last27=Moazzen-Ahmadi|first27=N.|last28=Naumenko|first28=O.V.|last29=Nikitin|first29=A.V.|last30=Orphal|first30=J.|display-authors=29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403015701/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/Download/HITRAN2008.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – referred to as an atmospheric window due to the relative transparency of the atmosphere within this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramanathan|first=V|title=Greenhouse Effect Due to Chlorofluorocarbons: Climatic Implications|journal=Science, New Series|year=1975|volume=190|issue=4209|pages=50–52|jstor=1740877|doi=10.1126/science.190.4209.50 |bibcode=1975Sci...190...50R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of CFC bands and the unique susceptibility of the atmosphere, at which the compound absorbs and emits radiation, are two factors that contribute to CFCs' "super" greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan 2009 37–50"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramanathan|first=V|author2=Y.

Conversely, the low concentration of CFCs allow their effects to increase linearly with mass.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan 2009 37–50"/&gt;

==Tracer of ocean circulation==
Because the time history of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively well known, they have provided an important constraint on ocean circulation. CFCs dissolve in seawater at the ocean surface and are subsequently transported into the ocean interior. Because CFCs are inert, their concentration in the ocean interior reflects simply the convolution of their atmospheric time evolution and ocean circulation and mixing.

Using CFCs or SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as a tracer of ocean circulation allows for the derivation of rates for ocean processes due to the time-dependent source function.

====Partial pressure and ratio dating techniques====
The age of a water parcel can be estimated by the CFC partial pressure (pCFC) age or SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; partial pressure (pSF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) age. The pCFC age of a water sample is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;pCFC = \frac{[CFC]}{F(T,S)}&lt;/math&gt;

where [CFC] is the measured CFC concentration (pmol kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and F is the solubility of CFC gas in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity.&lt;ref name=WarnerWeiss&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warner | first1 = M.

where F = solubility expressed in either mol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or mol kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; atm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,
T = absolute temperature,
S = salinity in parts per thousand (ppt),
a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and b&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are constants to be determined from the least squares fit to the solubility measurements.&lt;ref name=BuWarner /&gt; This equation is derived from the integrated [[Van 't Hoff equation]] and the logarithmic Setchenow salinity dependence.&lt;ref name=BuWarner /&gt;

It can be noted that the solubility of CFCs increase with decreasing temperature at approximately 1% per degree Celsius.&lt;ref name=Fine/&gt;

Once the partial pressure of the CFC (or SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is derived, it is then compared to the atmospheric time histories for CFC-11, CFC-12, or SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in which the pCFC directly corresponds to the year with the same.  The difference between the corresponding date and the collection date of the seawater sample is the average age for the water parcel.&lt;ref name=Fine/&gt; The age of a parcel of water can also be calculated using the ratio of two CFC partial pressures or the ratio of the SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; partial pressure to a CFC partial pressure.&lt;ref name=Fine/&gt;

==Safety==
According to their material safety data sheets, CFCs and HCFCs are colorless, volatile, toxic liquids and gases with a faintly sweet ethereal odor. Overexposure at concentrations of 11% or more may cause dizziness, loss of concentration, central nervous system depression and/or [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. Vapors displace air and can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces. Although non-flammable, their combustion products include hydrofluoric acid, and related species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refrigerants.com/msds/r12.pdf Material Safety Data Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208072612/http://refrigerants.com/msds/r12.pdf |date=2011-02-08 }}. National Refrigerants&lt;/ref&gt;
Normal occupational exposure is rated at 0.07% and does not pose any serious health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WHO |title=Fully Halogenated Chlorofluorocarbons |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc113.htm#SectionNumber:1.8 |publisher=International Programme on Chemical Safety |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505185051/http://inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc113.htm#SectionNumber:1.8 |archivedate=2012-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coconuco''' also known as '''Guambiano''' is a [[dialect cluster]] of [[Colombia]] spoken by the [[Guambiano]] indigenous people. Though the three varieties, Guambiano, moribund Totoró, and the extinct Coconuco, are traditionally called languages, Adelaar &amp; Muysken (2004) believe that they are best treated as a single language.

Totoro may be extinct; it had 4 speakers in 1998 out of an ethnic population of 4,000. Guambiano, on the other hand, is vibrant and growing.

Coconucan was for a time mistakenly included in a spurious [[Paezan languages|Paezan]] language family, due to a purported "Moguex" (Guambiano) vocabulary that turned out to be a mix of Páez and Guambiano (Curnow 1998).

== Phonology ==
The Guambiano inventory is as follows (Curnow &amp; Liddicoat 1998:386).

A '''concept of operations''' (abbreviated '''CONOPS''', '''CONOPs''',&lt;ref name="hhsde"/&gt; or '''ConOps'''&lt;ref name="hhs"/&gt;) is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed [[system]] from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system like a [[Business requirements|business requirements specification]] or [[stakeholder requirements specification (StRS)]]. It is used to communicate the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] system characteristics to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|title=Concept of Operations (ConOps)|publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2008-06-22|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611232934/http://www3.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|archive-date=2009-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CONOPS are widely used in the military, governmental services and other fields.

A CONOPS generally evolves from a [[concept]] and is a description of how a set of [[capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] may be employed to achieve desired [[objective (goal)|objective]]s or [[End States|end state]].&lt;ref name="hhsde"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |title=CONOPS |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2008-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408092628/http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standard was ''1362-1998 - IEEE Guide for Information Technology - System Definition - Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document'' that was superseded by the document ''29148-2011 - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering''.
Then came the 2012 AIAA revision proposal ''Guide: Guide to the Preparation of Operational Concept Documents (ANSI/AIAA G-043A-2012) (Revision of G-043-1992)'', and today we have ''ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes''.

In the field of joint [[military operations]], a CONOPS in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] terminology is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.&lt;ref name="JP5-0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|title=Joint Publication 5-0; Joint Operation Planning|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903220959/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP1-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|title=Joint Publication 1-02; Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CONOPS may also be used or summarized in system acquisition [[DODAF]] descriptions such as the [[Operational_View#High-Level_Operational_Concept_Graphic|OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic]]&lt;ref name="dodaf slides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/DODAF/DoD_EA_Conf_SAR_DoDAF_in_Action.ppt|title=DODAF in Action|format=PPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
Concept of Operations documents can be developed in many different ways, but usually share the same properties. In general, a CONOPS will include the following:&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/ppl/concept_of_operations.html|title=Concept of Operations|year=2008|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statement of the [[goal]]s and [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the system
* [[Strategy|Strategies]], tactics, [[policy|policies]], and constraints affecting the system
* [[Organization]]s, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders
* Clear statement of [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]] and [[authority|authorities]] delegated
* Specific [[Business operations|operational]] [[Business process|process]]es for fielding the system
* Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system

A CONOPS should relate a [[narrative]] of the process to be followed in [[Implementation|implementing]] a system. It should define the roles of the stakeholders involved throughout the process. Ideally it offers clear [[methodology]] to realize the goals and objectives for the system, while not intending to be an implementation or transition plan itself.&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;

A CONOPS Standard is available to guide the development of a CONOPS document.&lt;ref name="ieeestd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1362-1998_desc.html|title=IEEE Std 1362-1998 IEEE Guide for Information Technology—System Definition—Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document|publisher=IEEE Standards Association|accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=5966380
|title=IEEE Std 29148-2011 - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Standard is structured around [[information systems]], but the standard may be applied to other complex systems as well.

During the 1990s the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) adopted [[CompStat]], [[Broken windows theory|broken windows]] policing and other strategies in a major effort to reduce crime. The city's dramatic drop in crime has been variously attributed to a number of factors including these policing tactics, the end of the crack epidemic, the [[Roe v. Wade|legalization of abortion]] approximately 18 years earlier&lt;ref name="Johnson 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karmen 2000"/&gt; and the decline of lead poisoning of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kevin Drum |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline |title=America's Real Criminal Element: Lead |work=Mother Jones |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===19th century===

[[Organized crime]] has long been associated with New York City, beginning with the [[Forty Thieves (New York gang)|Forty Thieves]] and the [[Roach Guards]] in the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] in the 1820s.

In 1835, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' was established by [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.]], who helped revolutionize journalism by covering stories that appeal to the masses including crime reporting. When [[Helen Jewett]] was murdered on April 10, 1836, Bennett did innovative on-the-scene investigation and reporting and helped bring the story to national attention.&lt;ref name="NYPDACityAndItsPolice"/&gt;

[[Peter Cooper]], at request of the [[New York City Council|Common Council]], drew up a proposal to create a police force of 1,200 officers.  The state legislature approved the proposal on May 7, 1844, and abolished the [[Watchman (law enforcement)|nightwatch]] system.&lt;ref name="lankevich-p84"/&gt; Under Mayor [[William Havemeyer]], the police force reorganized and officially established itself on May 13, 1845, as the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD). The new system divided the city into three districts, and set up courts, magistrates, clerks, and station houses.&lt;ref name="lankevich-p84"/&gt;

====High-profile murders====

=====Murder of Helen Jewett=====
{{Main|Helen Jewett}}
[[Helen Jewett]] was an upscale [[New York City]] [[prostitution|prostitute]] whose 1836 [[murder]], along with the subsequent trial and [[acquittal]] of her alleged killer, Richard P. Robinson, generated an unprecedented amount of media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources are used:

=====Murder of Mary Rogers=====
{{Main|Mary Rogers}}

The murder of [[Mary Rogers]] in 1841 was heavily covered by the press, which also put the spotlight on the ineptitude and corruption in the city's watchmen system of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="NYPDACityAndItsPolice"&gt;{{cite book |title=NYPD: A City and Its Police |last=Lardner |first=James |first2=Thomas |last2=Reppetto |publisher=Owl Books |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, New York City's population of 320,000 was served by an archaic force, consisting of one night watch, one hundred city marshals, thirty-one constables, and fifty-one police officers.&lt;ref name="lankevich-p84"&gt;{{cite book |title=American Metropolis: A History of New York City |last=Lankevich |first=George L. |publisher=NYU Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-5186-5 |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Murder of Benjamin Nathan=====
{{Main|Benjamin Nathan}}

[[Benjamin Nathan]], patriarch of one of the earliest [[Sephardic Jew]]ish families to emigrate to New York, was found bludgeoned to death in his rooms in the [[Fifth Avenue Hotel]] on the morning of July 28, 1870. Police initially suspected one of the family's servants, mostly [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]]; later on Nathan's profligate son Washington was mentioned in the newspapers as a possible suspect (since [[Albert Cardozo]], a relative by marriage, interfered in the investigation). However, no one was ever indicted and the case remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="Benjamin Nathan murder"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nathan-Kazis |first=Benjamin |title=A Death in the Family |url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/23461/a-death-in-the-family |newspaper=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]] |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Riots====

=====1863 draft riots=====
{{Main|New York City draft riots}}
The [[New York City draft riots]] in July 1863&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Draft Riots in New York, July 1863: The Metropolitan Police, Their Services During Riot |author=Barnes, David M. |publisher=Baker &amp; Godwin |year=1863 |pages=5–6, 12}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Riot|violent disturbances]] in [[New York City]] that were the culmination of working-class discontent with new laws passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] that year to [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] men to fight in the ongoing [[American Civil War]]. The riots remain the largest civil insurrection in American history (with 119-120 fatalities) aside from the Civil War itself.&lt;ref name="foner"&gt;Foner, E. (1988). ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877'', The New American Nation series, pp. 32–33, New York: Harper &amp; Row; {{ISBN|0-06-093716-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was forced to divert several regiments of militia and volunteer troops from following up after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] to control the city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, primarily ethnic [[Irish people|Irish]], resenting particularly that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 ($5,555 in 2014 dollars) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h249.html "The Draft in the Civil War"], u-s-history.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypress.com/article-6235-the-draft-riots-part-ii.html William Bryk, "The Draft Riots, Part II"], ''New York Press'' blogpost, August 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially intended to express anger at the draft, the protests turned into a race riot, with white rioters, mainly but not exclusively [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants,&lt;ref name="foner"/&gt; attacking black people wherever they could be found. At least 11 black people are estimated to have been killed. The conditions in the city were such that Major General [[John E. Wool]], commander of the [[Department of the East]], stated on July 16 that, "[[Martial law]] ought to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it."&lt;ref name="wool"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/woolor.htm |title=Maj. Gen. John E. Wool Official Reports for the New York Draft Riots |accessdate=August 16, 2006 |work=Shotgun's Home of the American Civil War blogsite}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military did not reach the city until after the first day of rioting, when mobs had already ransacked or destroyed numerous public buildings, two Protestant churches, the homes of various abolitionists or sympathizers, many black homes, and the Colored Orphan Asylum at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;

=====Other riots=====
In 1870, the [[Orange Riots]] were incited by Irish Protestants celebrating the [[Battle of the Boyne]] with parades through predominantly Irish Catholic neighborhoods. In the resulting police action, 63 citizens, mostly Irish, were killed.&lt;ref name="StreetJustice"&gt;{{cite book |title=Street Justice: A History of Police Violence in New York City |last=Johnson |first=Marilynn S. |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tompkins Square Riot (1874)|Tompkins Square Riot]] occurred on January 13, 1874 when police violently suppressed a demonstration involving thousands of people in [[Tompkins Square Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=Michael Allen |title=The Orange Riots: Irish Political Violence in New York City, 1870–1871 |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1993 |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cleanup list|section|date=July 2018}}

High-profile crimes include:

====1900s–1950s====
* April 14, 1903 — The dismembered and mutilated body of Benedetto Madonia, who had last been seen the day before eating with several high-ranking figures in the [[Morello crime family]], the city's first dominant [[American Mafia|Mafia]] organization, is found in an [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] barrel, the most notorious of that era's [[Barrel Murders]]. After the NYPD arrested several members of the family tied to a local counterfeiting ring. Inspector [[George W. McClusky]], hoping to compel their cooperation through [[public humiliation]], had officers walk them through the streets of [[Little Italy]] in handcuffs to police headquarters, a forerunner of the [[perp walk]] that has since become a common practice in the city. It backfired, as the men were hailed as heroes by the [[Italian American|Italian immigrant]] community they were paraded past. Charges against all defendants were later dropped for lack of evidence, and the killing remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="1903 barrel murder"&gt;{{cite web|last=Black|first=Jon|title=The Barrel Murder|url=http://www.gangrule.com/events/the-barrel-murder-1903|publisher=GangRule.com|date=2015|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 25, 1906 – [[Stanford White]] is shot and killed by [[Harry Kendall Thaw]] at what was then [[Madison Square Gardens]]. The murder would soon be dubbed "The Crime of the Century".
* June 19, 1909 – The strangled body of [[Elsie Sigel]], granddaughter of Civil War Union general [[Franz Sigel]], 19, is found in a trunk in the [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] apartment of Leon Ling, a waiter at a Chinese restaurant, ten days after she was last seen leaving her parents' apartment to visit her grandmother. Evidence found in the apartment established that Ling and Sigel had been romantically involved, and he was suspected of the killing but never arrested. No other suspects have ever been identified.
* August 9, 1910 – Reformist Mayor [[William Jay Gaynor]] is shot in the throat in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] by former city employee James Gallagher. He eventually dies in September 1913 from a heart attack.
* July 4, 1914 – [[Lexington Avenue explosion]]: Four are killed and dozens injured when dynamite, believed to have been accumulated by anarchists for an attempt to blow up [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] [[Kykuit|mansion]], goes off prematurely in a seven-story apartment building at 1626 Lexington Avenue.&lt;ref name="NYT_1914-07-05"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/07/05/archives/exploded-in-apartment-occupied-by-tarrytown-disturbers-only-one.html |title=Exploded in Apartment Occupied by Tarrytown Disturbers. Only One Escaped Alive |date=July 5, 1914 |work=[[The New York Times]] |quote=A large quantity of dynamite, which the police and certain friends of the leaders of the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I. W. W.]] believe was being made into a bomb to be used in blowing up John D.

* June 11, 1920 – [[Joseph Bowne Elwell]], a prominent [[auction bridge]] player and writer, was shot in the head early in the morning in his locked Manhattan home. Despite intense media interest, the crime was never solved (one confession to police was dismissed because the man who made it was of dubious sanity). The case inspired the development of the [[Locked room mystery|locked-room murder]] subgenre of [[detective fiction]], when [[Ellery Queen]] realized that the intense public fascination with the case indicated that there was a market for fictional takes on the story.
* September 16, 1920 – The [[Wall Street bombing]] kills 38 at "the precise center, geographical as well as metaphorical, of financial America and even of the financial world." [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] were suspected ([[Sacco and Vanzetti]] had been indicted just days before) but no one was ever charged with the crime.
* November 6, 1928 – [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish gangster]] [[Arnold Rothstein]], 46, an avid gambler best remembered for his alleged role [[Black Sox scandal|fixing]] the [[1919 World Series]], died of gunshot wounds inflicted the day before during a Manhattan business meeting. He refused to identify his killer to police. A fellow gambler who was believed to have ordered the hit as retaliation for Rothstein's failure to pay a large debt from a recent poker game (Rothstein in turn claimed it had been fixed) was tried and acquitted. No other suspects have ever emerged.
* August 6, 1930 – The disappearance of [[Joseph Force Crater]], an Associate Justice of the New York Supreme Court. He was last seen entering a New York City taxicab. Crater was declared legally dead in 1939. His mistress Sally Lou Ritz (22) disappeared a few weeks later.
* December 24, 1933 – [[Leon Tourian]], 53, primate of the Eastern Diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in America, is stabbed to death by several armed men while performing [[Christmas Eve]] services. All were arrested and convicted the following summer. The killing was motivated by political divisions within the church; the ensuing [[schism]] persists. 
* March 19, 1935 – The arrest of a shoplifter inflames racial tensions in [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] and escalates to [[Harlem Riot of 1935|rioting and looting]], with three killed, 125 injured and 100 arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/newyork/laic/episode6/topic4/e6_t4_s3-ra.html |title=Pbs Kids . Big Apple History |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 28, 1937 – [[Veronica Gedeon]], 20, a model known for posing in lurid illustrations for pulp magazines, is brutally murdered along with her mother and a boarder in her mother's [[Long Island City]] home. Sculptor [[Robert George Irwin]], who left a telltale soap sculpture at the scene, was eventually arrested after a nationwide manhunt fed by widespread media coverage of the case, said to be the most intense since the [[Stanford White]] murder, which capitalized by Gedeon's risque professional work. After doubts about his sanity surfaced during trial, he was sentenced to life in prison.
* November 16, 1940 – "Mad Bomber" [[George Metesky]] plants the first bomb of his 16-year campaign of public bombings.
* January 11, 1943 – [[Carlo Tresca]], an [[Italian American]] labor leader who led opposition to [[Italian Fascism|Fascism]], [[Stalinism]] and Mafia control of unions, was shot dead at a Manhattan intersection during the night. Given the enemies he had made and their propensity for violence, the list of potential suspects was long; however, the investigation was incomplete and no one was ever officially named. Historians believe the mostly likely suspect was mobster [[Carmine Galante]], later acting boss of the [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno family]], seen fleeing the scene, who had likely acted on the orders of a Bonanno underboss and Fascist sympathizer Tresca had threatened to expose.&lt;ref name="Carlo Tresca"&gt;{{cite news |title=Who Hired the Assassin? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/02/books/who-hired-the-assassin.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 1988 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |first=Alfred |last=Kazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* August 1, 1943 – A [[race riot]] erupts in [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] after a black soldier is shot by the police and rumored to be dead. The incident touches off a simmering brew of racial tension, unemployment, and high prices to a day of rioting and looting. Several looters are shot dead, about 500 people are injured, and another 500 arrested.
* March 8, 1952 – A month after helping police find bank robber [[Willie Sutton]], 24-year-old clothing salesman [[Arnold Schuster]] is fatally shot outside his Brooklyn home. An extensive investigation failed to identify any suspects, though police came to believe that either the [[Gambino crime family]] or Sutton's associates had ordered Schuster killed. Schuster's family filed a lawsuit against the city, which led to a landmark ruling by the state's [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] that the government has a duty to protect anyone who cooperates with the police when asked to do so.
* October 25, 1957 — Mafia boss [[Albert Anastasia]] was shot dead while getting a shave at a Manhattan barbershop. As with many organized-crime killings, it remains officially unsolved.

====1960s====
* January 27, 1962 — The [[French Connection]] drug bust nets {{convert|112|lb}} of [[heroin]] hidden inside a car shipped from France, with an estimated street value of $112 million, the biggest drug haul in U.S. history at that point. The work of detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]] leading up to it was later the subject of ''[[The French Connection (book)|The French Connection]]'' by [[Robin Moore]], which formed the basis for the influential, Oscar-winning [[The French Connection (film)|1971 film of the same name]].
* May 18, 1962 – Two NYPD detectives were killed in a gun battle with robbers at the Boro Park Tobacco store in Brooklyn, the first time two NYPD detectives died in the same incident since the 1920s. The resulting manhunt brings in the perpetrators, including [[Jerry Rosenberg]], who after being spared the death penalty would become one of America's best-known [[jailhouse lawyer]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT Rosenberg obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sewell |title=Jerry Rosenberg, Jailhouse Lawyer, Dies at 72 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/nyregion/02rosenberg.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case also led to controversy over the [[perp walk]], in which freshly arrested suspects are paraded in front of the media: Rosenberg filed a federal lawsuit over prejudicial remarks made by a detective during his, and another detective, [[Albert Seedman]], was briefly demoted in response to outrage over a picture of him holding up the head of the other suspect, Tony Dellernia, for photographers who missed the perp walk. 
* August 28, 1963 – The [[Career Girls Murders]]: Emily Hoffert and Janet Wylie, two young professionals, are murdered in their [[Upper East Side]] apartment by an intruder. Richard Robles, a young white man, was ultimately apprehended in 1965 after investigators erroneously arrested and forced a false confession from a black man, George Whitmore, who was completely innocent of the crime. Whitmore was compelled to wrongfully spend many years incarcerated, but he was eventually released after his innocence was established, while Robles remains in prison as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evesmag.com/wyliehoffert.htm |title=The Wylie-Hoffert Career Girl Murders |publisher=Evesmag.com |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 13, 1964 – [[Kitty Genovese]] is stabbed 82 times in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]], [[Queens]] by Winston Moseley. The crime is witnessed by numerous people, none of whom aid Genovese or call for help. The crime is noted by psychology textbooks in later years for its demonstration of the [[bystander effect]], though an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in February 2004 indicated that many popular conceptions of the crime were wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldkewgardens.com/kitty_genovese-005.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112031/http://www.oldkewgardens.com/kitty_genovese-005.html |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moseley died in prison in 2016.

* May 21, 1971 – Two [[NYPD]] officers, Waverly Jones and Joseph Piagentini, are gunned down in ambush by members of the [[Black Liberation Army]] in [[Harlem]]. The gunmen, Herman Bell and Anthony Bottom, still in prison as of 2012, were rearrested in jail in connection with the 1971 killing of a San Francisco police officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/24/COPKILLED.TMP]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805004657/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F01%2F24%2FCOPKILLED.TMP |date=August 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* April 7, 1972 – Mobster [[Joe Gallo]] is gunned down at Umberto's Clam House in [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. The incident serves as the inspiration for the [[Bob Dylan]]'s epic "Joey" recorded in 1975.
* [[1972 Harlem mosque incident]]: On April 14, two NYPD officers responded to an apparent call for assistance from a detective at a [[Harlem]] address that turned out to be a [[mosque]] used by the [[Nation of Islam]]. What happened when they got there is still unclear, but both officers were seriously beaten, and one, Philip Cardillo, was shot. He died of the wounds six days later. Political pressures on the administration of Mayor [[John Lindsay]] from the city's black community led to compromises that resulted in the incident never being fully investigated; Lindsay and police commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]] were notably absent from Cardillo's funeral, at which another high-ranking officer publicly resigned in protest. The incident alienated many rank and file police officers and had a lasting effect on racial tensions in the city.{{paragraph}}&lt;!--
  --&gt;Louis 17X Dupree, director of the mosque's school, was eventually tried for Cardillo's murder. After the first jury deadlocked, he was acquitted at a second trial because of the compromised and incomplete evidence; he has subsequently served time in different Southern states on other charges. Officially the case remains unsolved; investigators who reopened the case in the late 2000s claim the FBI is withholding information about informants it had in the mosque at the time.
* August 22, 1972 – [[John Wojtowicz]] and Salvatore Natuarale hold up a Brooklyn bank for 14 hours, in a bid to get cash to pay for Wojtowicz's gay lover's sex change operation. The scheme fails when the cops arrive, leading to a tense 14-hour standoff. Natuarale is killed by the police at JFK Airport. The incident served as the basis for the 1975 film ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]''.
* December 1972 — The police department discloses that around {{convert|200|lb}} of heroin, much of it seized in the [[French Connection]] busts a decade earlier, has been stolen from evidence lockers over a period of several months and replaced with [[cornstarch]] by someone who signed in under false names and nonexistent badge numbers. Several detectives were suspected of complicity in the thefts; in 2009 Brooklyn mobster [[Anthony Casso]], serving 455 years in federal prison, intimated that he knew who had stolen the drugs.&lt;ref name="Anthony Casso story"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blumenthal |first=Ralph |title=Mobster Makes Offer on French Connection Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/nyregion/22french.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 22, 2009 |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 3, 1973 – The body of 29-year-old teacher [[Roseann Quinn]] is discovered, with multiple stab wounds, in her [[Upper West Side]] apartment after she failed to show up for the first day of classes in the new year. John Wayne Wilson, a man she had picked up at nearby bar on [[New Year's Eve]], was later arrested and charged with the murder, but killed himself in jail before he could be tried. The incident inspired the 1975 novel ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'', the source for [[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|the 1977 film of the same name]] starring [[Diane Keaton]].
* April 28, 1973 — Clifford Glover, a 10-year-old black resident of [[Jamaica, Queens]], was shot and killed by police officer Thomas Shea while running from an unmarked car, which he thought was a robbery attempt. Shea was charged with murder, the first time an NYPD officer had been so charged for a killing in the line of duty in 50 years. He claimed that he saw a gun, a claim contradicted by ballistic evidence that showed Glover had been shot from behind. Race riots broke out following his acquittal the following year.&lt;ref name="Clifford Glover shooting"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dwyer |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Dwyer (journalist) |title=A Police Shot to a Boy's Back in Queens, Echoing Since 1973 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/nyregion/fired-at-queens-boy-fatal-1973-police-shot-still-reverberates.html|newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired the opening verse of [[The Rolling Stones]]'s song [[Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)]].

* July 13, 1977 – Dominick Ciscone, a 17-year-old aspiring mobster, is shot and killed while hanging out with friends on Smith Street in the [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, the only homicide to occur during [[New York City blackout of 1977|that year's blackout]]. Police investigate several local parties Ciscone was known to have had disputes with, but do not identify any supects. Despite several promising anonymous tips to police around the killing's 20th anniversary in 1997, it remains unsolved as of 2017.&lt;ref name="Dominick Ciscone"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Brad|title=The mystery behind the only murder during the 1977 NYC blackout|url=https://nypost.com/2017/06/03/the-mystery-behind-the-only-murder-during-the-1977-nyc-blackout/amp/|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=June 3, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-planned robbery was at the time the largest cash theft ever in the United States, and remains the largest theft ever at the airport. It was masterminded by members of the [[Lucchese crime family]], including [[Henry Hill]] and [[Tommy DeSimone]], who had pulled off the [[Air France robbery]] at the airport nine years earlier. Tensions among the gang over how to divide the money, and some members' failure to keep a low profile in the wake of the crime led to the deaths or disappearances of 10 of those involved over the next few months. Many of the killings are believed to have been committed or ordered by Lucchese soldier [[James Burke (gangster)|Jimmy Burke]], though no one was ever arrested and charged (not least because many died first). The crime and its aftermath have been dramatized in the films ''The 10 Million Dollar Robbery'', ''[[The Big Heist]]''—and ''[[GoodFellas]]'', [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1991 adaptation of [[Wiseguy (book)|Hill's memoirs]]. In 2014 [[Vincent Asaro]], a 78-year-old Bonnano family capo, was indicted on charges of receiving money from the robbery and conspiring in it. He was acquitted the following year, the only person ever tried in connection with the crime. 
* May 25, 1979 – Six-year-old [[Etan Patz]] vanishes after leaving his [[SoHo]] apartment to walk to his school bus alone.

===Wall Street frauds===
{{Main|Wall Street}}
[[Wall Street]] has become synonymous with financial interests, often used negatively.&lt;ref name=twsJanN112&gt;{{cite news |author=Robert Kuttner |title=Zillions for Wall Street, Zippo for Barack's Old Neighborhood |work=The Huffington Post |date=August 22, 2010 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/zillions-for-wall-street-_b_690541.html |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] from 2007 to 2010, Wall Street financing was blamed as one of the causes, though most commentators blame an interplay of factors. The U.S. government with the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars, but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated,&lt;ref name=twsJanN112/&gt; and was criticized by journalists as well as the public. Analyst [[Robert Kuttner]] in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' criticized the bailout as helping large Wall Street firms such as Citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as Chicago's [[ShoreBank]].&lt;ref name=twsJanN112/&gt; One writer in the ''Huffington Post'' looked at FBI statistics on robbery, fraud, and crime and concluded that Wall Street was the "most dangerous neighborhood in the United States" if one factored in the $50 billion [[fraud]] perpetrated by [[Bernie Madoff]].&lt;ref name=twsJanN213&gt;{{cite news |author=B.

Many complained that the resulting [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were "overly burdensome."&lt;ref name=twsJanO54&gt;{{cite news |author=Daniel Altman |title=Other financial centers could rise amid crisis |publisher=The New York Times: Business |date=September 30, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/worldbusiness/30iht-glob01.1.16579561.html |accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest groups seeking favor with [[Washington, D.C.|Washington lawmakers]], such as car dealers, have often sought to portray their interests as allied with ''Main Street'' rather than ''Wall Street'', though analyst Peter Overby on ''[[National Public Radio]]'' suggested that car dealers have written over $250 billion in consumer loans and have real ties with ''Wall Street''.&lt;ref name=twsJanN411&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Overby |title=Car Dealers May Escape Scrutiny Of Consumer Loans |publisher=NPR |date=June 24, 2010 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128068332 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[United States Treasury]] bailed out large financial firms, to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation's economy, there was tremendous negative political fallout, particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees.&lt;ref name=twsJanN313&gt;{{cite news |title=Hard Times, But Big Wall Street Bonuses |publisher=CBS News |date=November 12, 2008 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/12/earlyshow/main4595179.shtml |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyst William D.

[[File:60 Wall Street building.jpg|thumb|right|US headquarters of [[Deutsche Bank]] on Wall Street in 2010.]]
But chief banking analyst at [[Goldman Sachs]], Richard Ramsden, is "unapologetic" and sees "banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy."&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt; Ramsden believes "risk-taking is vital" and said in 2010:

{{quote|text=You can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail, in which there's no leverage. But there would be a cost. There would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation.|Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs, 2010.&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt;}}

Others in the financial industry believe they've been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians. For example, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly told President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010 that he felt like a [[piñata]], "whacked with a stick" by "hostile politicians".&lt;ref name=twsJanO12a/&gt;

The financial misdeeds of various figures throughout American history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole, and include names such as [[William Duer (Continental Congressman)|William Duer]], [[James Fisk (financier)|Jim Fisk]] and [[Jay Gould]] (the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as modern figures such as [[Bernard Madoff]] who "bilked billions from investors".&lt;ref name=twsJanN413/&gt;

In addition, images of Wall Street and its figures have loomed large. The 1987 [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' created the iconic figure of [[Gordon Gekko]] who used the phrase "greed is good", which caught on in the cultural parlance.&lt;ref name=twsJanN514/&gt; According to one account, the Gekko character was a "straight lift" from the real world junk-bond dealer [[Michael Milken]],&lt;ref name=twsJanO15a/&gt; who later pleaded guilty to felony charges for violating securities laws. Stone commented in 2009 how the movie had had an unexpected cultural influence, not causing them to turn away from corporate greed, but causing many young people to choose Wall Street careers because of that movie.&lt;ref name=twsJanN514&gt;{{cite news |author=Tim Arango |title=Greed Is Bad, Gekko.

Wall Street firms have, however, also contributed to projects such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] as well as done food programs in [[Haiti]] and trauma centers in [[Sudan]] and rescue boats during floods in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=twsJanN111&gt;{{cite news |author=Emily Wax |title=Wall Street Greed?

William Morrow/HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Malcolm Gladwell]] provides a different explanation in his book ''[[The Tipping Point]]''; he argues that crime was an "epidemic" and a small reduction by the police was enough to "tip" the balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/ |title=The Tipping Point |access-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729063844/http://gladwell.com/the-tipping-point/ |archive-date=July 29, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that widespread exposure to lead pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline?page=1 |title=America's Real Criminal Element: Lead |first=Kevin |last=Drum |work=Mother Jones |date=January–February 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gang violence====
[[File:NYC NYPD Times Square.jpg|thumb|right|An NYPD vehicle stationed in [[Times Square]].]]

In the 20th century, notorious New York-based [[mobster]]s [[Arnold Rothstein]], [[Meyer Lansky]], and [[Lucky Luciano]] made headlines.  The century's later decades are more famous for Mafia prosecutions (and prosecutors like [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]]) than for the influence of the [[Five Families]].

Violent [[gang]]s such as the [[Black Spades]] and the [[Westies]] influenced crime in the 1970s.

The [[Bloods]], [[Crips]] and [[MS-13]] gangs of [[Los Angeles]] arrived in the city in the 1980s, but gained notoriety when they appeared on [[Rikers Island]] in 1993 to fight off the already established [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] gang.

[[Chinese people|Chinese]] gangs were also prominent in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], notably [[Ghost Shadows]] and [[Flying Dragons (gang)|Flying Dragons]].

From the 1990s till their 2013 arrest by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in a sting operation, an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] gang led by [[Mendel Epstein]] and Martin Wolmark kidnapped and tortured a number of Jewish men from [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and [[Midwood, Brooklyn]] in troubled marriages to force them into granting [[Get (divorce document)|religious divorces]] to their wives, some of whom Epstein charged up to $100,000 to commit the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;(December 14, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/nyregion/rabbi-sentenced-for-role-in-divorce-coercion-ring.html "Rabbi Sentenced for Role in Divorce-Coercion Ring"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subway crime====

Crime on the [[New York City Subway]] reached a peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the city's subway having a crime rate higher than that of any other mass transit system in the world.&lt;ref name="nyc subway in the 1970s"&gt;nycsubway.org—[http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_New_York_Transit_Authority_in_the_1970s The New York Transit Authority in the 1970s]&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}}, the subway has a record-low crime rate, as crime started dropping in the '90s, a trend that continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/150780/transit-police--subway-crime-more-likely-during-daytime--manhattan-has-most-incidents |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131003184421/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/150780/transit-police--subway-crime-more-likely-during-daytime--manhattan-has-most-incidents |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2013 |title=Transit Police: Subway Crime More Likely During Daytime, Manhattan Has Most Incidents |work=[[NY1]] |first=Tina |last=Redwine |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/154724/more-transit-police-officers-combat-increase-in-subway-crime |title=More Transit Police Officers Combat Increase In Subway Crime |work=[[NY1]] |first=Tina |last=Redwine |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129223728/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/154724/more-transit-police-officers-combat-increase-in-subway-crime |archivedate=January 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various approaches have been used to fight crime. A 2012 initiative by the MTA to prevent crime is to ban people who commit one in the subway system from entering it for a certain length of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/158315/mta-proposes-to-ban-those-who-commit-subway-crimes-from-riding-system |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131003184455/http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/transit/158315/mta-proposes-to-ban-those-who-commit-subway-crimes-from-riding-system |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 3, 2013 |title=MTA Proposes To Ban Those Who Commit Subway Crimes From Riding System |work=[[NY1]] |first=Tina |last=Redwine |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] ordered an increase in the Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the hours at which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.), the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, crime rates decreased, as extensively reported by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chaiken |first=Jan M.|last2=Lawless |first2=M. |last3=Stevenson |first3=K.A.|title=The Impact of Police Activity on Crime |journal=RAND Corporation |year=1974 |url=http://www.rc.rand.org/pubs/reports/R1424/ |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a consequence of the city's 1976 fiscal crisis, service had become poor and crime had gone up, with crime being announced on the subway almost every day. Additionally, there were 11 "crimes against the infrastructure" in open cut areas of the subway in 1977, where TA staff were injured, some seriously. There were other rampant crimes as well. For example, in the first two weeks of December 1977, "Operation Subway Sweep" resulted in the arrest of over 200 robbery suspects. Passengers were afraid of crime, fed up with long waits for trains that were shortened to save money, and upset over the general malfunctioning of the system. The subway also had many dark subway cars.&lt;ref name="nyc subway in the 1970s"/&gt; Further compounding the issue, on July 13, 1977, a [[New York City blackout of 1977|blackout]] cut off electricity to most of the city and to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]].&lt;ref name="nyc subway in the 1970s"/&gt; Due to a sudden increase of violent crimes on the subway in the last week of 1978, police statistics about crime in the subway were being questioned. In 1979, six murders on the subway occurred in the first two months of the year, compared to nine during the entire previous year. The [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] was known to be frequented by muggers, so in February 1979, a group headed by [[Curtis Sliwa]] began unarmed patrols of the {{NYCS service|4}} train during the night time, in an effort to discourage crime. They were known as the [[Guardian Angels]], and would eventually expand their operations into other parts of the five boroughs. By February 1980, the Guardian Angels' ranks numbered 220.&lt;ref&gt;"The Subway Savages," New York Daily News, January 1, 1980, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1979, Mayor [[Ed Koch]] asked the city's top law enforcement officials to devise a plan to counteract rising subway violence and to stop insisting that the subways were safer than the streets. Two weeks after Koch's request, top TA cops were publicly requesting Transit Police Chief [[Sanford Garelik]]'s resignation because they claimed that he had lost control of the fight against subway crime. Finally, on September 11, 1979, Garelik was fired, and replaced with Deputy Chief of Personnel [[James B. Meehan]], reporting directly to City Police Commissioner [[Robert McGuire]]. Garelik continued in his role of chief of security for the MTA.&lt;ref name="nyc subway in the 1970s"/&gt; By September 1979, around 250 felonies per week (or about 13,000 that year) were being recorded on the subway, making the crime rate the most of any other mass transit network anywhere in the world. Some police officers supposedly could not act upon [[quality of life]] crimes, and were only to look for violent crimes.

Among other problems the following were included:

{{Quote|Transit police radios and the [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] radios transmitted at different frequencies, and if additional help above ground was needed, it could not be summoned because no one above ground would hear the request. Subway patrols were also rigidly scheduled, and it wasn't long before felons (and even the general riders) knew exactly when police would be on their train, or at particular stations. The public perception at the time was that the war on subway crime was failing. In October of 1979, additional decoy and undercover units were deployed in the subway.&lt;ref name="nyc subway in the 1970s"/&gt;}}

Meehan had claimed to be able to, along with 2,300  police officers, "provide sufficient protection to straphangers", but Sliwa had brought a group together to act upon crime, so that between March 1979 and March 1980, felonies per day dropped from 261 to 154. However, overall crime grew by 70% between 1979 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;"65 cent fare considered in talks on coping with subway crime," New York Times, September 27, 1980, page A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[IRT Pelham Line]] in 1980, a sharp rise in window-smashing on subway cars caused $2 million in damages; it spread to other lines during the course of the year. When the broken windows were discovered in trains that were still in service, they needed to be taken out of service, causing additional delays; in August 1980 alone, 775 vandalism-related delays were reported.&lt;ref&gt;"Smashed windows: vandals New Kick," New York Daily News, October 14, 1980, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Vandalism of subway cars, including windows, continued through the mid-1980s; between January 27 and February 2, 1985, 1,129 pieces of glass were replaced on subway cars on the {{NYCS|1}}, {{NYCS|6}}, {{NYCS|CC}}, {{NYCS|E}}, and [[K (Eighth Avenue Local)|K]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;"Vandals on the Rails," New York Daily News, February 17, 1985, Brooklyn section, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, bus transfers, sold on the street for 50 cents, were also sold illegally, mainly at subway-to-bus transfer hubs.&lt;ref&gt;"Illegal Transfers Costing TA $1.2M," New York Daily News, December 21, 1984, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Koch even proposed to put a subway court in the Times Square subway station to speed up arraignments, as there were so many subway-related crimes by then. Meanwhile, high-ranking senior City Hall and transit officials considered raising the fare from 60 to 65 cents to fund additional transit police officers, who began to ride the subway during late nights (between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.) owing to a sharp increase in crime in 1982. Operation High Visibility, commenced in June 1985, had this program extended to 6 a.m., and a police officer was to be present on every train in the system during that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Cops Are Night Riders," New York Daily News, front page picture caption, June 6, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 1982, MTA Chairman Richard Ravitch told the business group Association for a Better New York, that he would not let his teenage sons ride the subway at night, and that even he, as the subway chairman, was nervous riding the trains.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fear Hits Home: Ravitch Kin Are Not Night Riders," New York Daily News, January 21, 1982, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The MTA began to discuss how the issue could be the ridership issue could be fixed, but by October 1982, mostly due to fears about transit crime, poor subway performance and some economic factors, ridership on the subway was at extremely low levels matching 1917 ridership.&lt;ref&gt;"Subway Ridership Hits 65 Year Low," New York Daily News, October 1, 1982, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Within less than ten years, the MTA had lost around 300 million passengers, mainly because of fears of crime. In July 1985, the [[Citizens Crime Commission of New York City]] published a study showing this trend, fearing the frequent robberies and generally bad circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |author=Citizens Crime Commission of New York City |author2=Regional Plan Association |title=Downtown Safety Security and Economic Development (Paperback) |booktitle=Downtown Safety Security and Economic Development |pages=148 |publisher=Downtown Research &amp; Development |year=1986 |location=New York, NY, USA |url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL2741748M/Downtown_safety_security_and_economic_development |accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ''[[Fixing Broken Windows]]'' policy, which proposed to stop large-profile crimes by prosecuting quality of life crimes, was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;

To attract passengers, the TA tried to introduce the "[[JFK Express|Train to the Plane]]", a service staffed by a [[transit police]] officer 24/7. This was discontinued in 1990 due to low ridership and malfunctioning equipment.

In 1989, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority asked the transit police (then located within the NYCTA) to focus on minor offenses such as fare evasion. In the early nineties, the NYCTA adopted similar policing methods for [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]]. When in 1993, [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] and Police Commissioner [[Howard Safir]] were elected to official positions, the Broken Windows strategy was more widely deployed in New York under the rubrics of "zero tolerance" and "quality of life". Crime rates in the subway and city dropped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Wolff |first=Craig |title=Subway Crime Declining, New Transit Figures Show |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY, USA |date=November 12, 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/12/nyregion/subway-crime-declining-new-transit-figures-show.html |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting ''[[New York Magazine]]'' to declare "The End of Crime as We Know It" on the cover of its edition of August 14, 1995.

Two cases in 2011 – those of Bob Oliva and Ernie Lorch – have both centered in highly ranked youth [[basketball]] programs sponsored by churches of different [[religious denomination|denominations]]. In early 2011, Oliva, a long-time basketball coach at [[Christ The King Regional High School]], was accused of two cases of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Zengerle, Jason, [http://nymag.com/news/sports/bob-oliva-2011-3/index1.html "The Sins of the Coach"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, March 20, 2011.

===Nightlife legislation===
{{Main|Nightlife legislation in New York City}}

In New York City, legislation was enacted in 2006, affecting many areas of nightlife. This legislation was in response to a number of murders which occurred in the New York City area, some involving nightclubs and bouncers. The city council introduced four pieces of legislation to help combat these problems, including ''Imette's Law'', which required stronger background checks for bouncers. Among the legislative actions taken were the requirement of ID scanners, security cameras, and independent monitors to oversee problem establishments.

It also enacted the following plan:
* Create a city Office of Nightlife Affairs.
* Find ways to get more cops to patrol outside clubs and bars.
* Combat underage drinking and the use of fake IDs.
* Foster better relationship among club owners, the NYPD and the [[New York State Liquor Authority]]
* Raise age limit for admittance into a club or bar from 16 to 18 or 21.
* Develop a public-awareness campaign urging patrons to be safe at night.
* Examine zoning laws to help neighborhoods that are flooded with clubs and bars.

A new guideline booklet, ''NYPD and Nightlife Association Announce "Best Practices'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.nyccouncil.info/pdf_files/newswire/99_101807_nightlife.pdf |format=PDF |title=NYPD and Nightlife Association Announce 'Best Practices' |publisher=New York City Council |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unveiled on October 18, 2007. This voluntary rule book included a 58-point security plan drafted in part by the New York Nightlife Association, was further recommended by Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly|Ray Kelly]] and Speaker [[Christine Quinn]]. Security measures included cameras outside of nightclub bathrooms, a trained security guard for every 75 patrons and weapons searches for everyone, including celebrities entering the clubs. The new regulation resulted in stricter penalties for serving underage persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 19, 2007 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/10/19/2007-10-19_nightclub_murders_give_rise_to_58point_s-3.html/ |title=Nightclub murders give rise to 58-point security plan |work=Daily News |location=New York |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022045129/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/10/19/2007-10-19_nightclub_murders_give_rise_to_58point_s-3.html |archivedate=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Cops_Celebs_should_get_no_special_treatment_at_nightspots/10419.html/ |title=NYC clubs agree with police: Even celebs should be screened |publisher=WorldNow eyewitness News WPRI.com |accessdate=2007-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020034714/http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Cops_Celebs_should_get_no_special_treatment_at_nightspots/10419.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--nightlifesecurity1018oct18,0,4298012.story/ |title=NYC clubs agree with police: Even celebs should be screened |work=Newsday |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Club Enforcement Initiative''' was created by the NYPD in response to what it referred to as "a series of high-profile and violent crimes against people who visited city nightclubs this year", mentioning the July 27 rape and [[murder of Jennifer Moore]].

==Administration==

===Mayors===
Crime in New York City was high in the 1980s during the Mayor [[Edward I.

During the administration of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] (1994–2001), there was a precipitous drop in crime in his first term, continuing at a slower rate in both his second term and under Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (2002–2013).

Scholars differ on the causes of the precipitous decline in crime in New York City (which also coincided with a nationwide drop in crime which some have termed the "Great American Crime Decline").&lt;ref name="Causes"&gt;Matt Ford, [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/what-caused-the-crime-decline/477408/ What Caused the Great Crime Decline in the U.S.?], ''The Atlantic'' (April 15, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 paper, economist Jessica Reyes attributes a 56% drop in nationwide violent crime in the 1990s to the removal of lead (a [[neurotoxin]] that causes cognitive and behavioral problems) from gasoline.&lt;ref name="Causes"/&gt; The [[Brennan Center for Justice]] has estimated that between 0-5% of the drop in crime in the 1990s may be attributed to higher employment; 5-10% of the drop may be attributed to income growth; and 0-10% of the drop from increased hiring of police officers.&lt;ref name="Causes"/&gt; Economists [[Steven Levitt]] and [[John J.

====Rudy Giuliani====
[[File:Rudy Giuliani.jpg|thumb|Rudy Giuliani]]
In [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s first term as mayor the [[New York City Police Department]], under Giuliani appointee Commissioner [[Bill Bratton]], adopted an aggressive enforcement and deterrence strategy based on [[James Q. Wilson]]'s [[Broken Windows]] research. This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, and aggressive "squeegeemen," on the principle that this would send a message that order would be maintained and that the city would be "cleaned up."

At a forum three months into his term as mayor, Giuliani mentioned that freedom does not mean that "people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do and how you do it".&lt;ref name="Raceforcityhall"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bearak |first=Barry| author-link =Barry Bearak |last2=Fisher |first2=Ian| author2-link =Ian Fisher (journalist) |title=RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey |newspaper=The New York Times |page=8 |date=October 19, 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html?pagewanted=8 |accessdate=October 24, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani also directed the New York City Police Department to aggressively pursue enterprises linked to organized crime, such as the [[Fulton Fish Market]] and the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center|Javits Center]] on the West Side ([[Gambino crime family]]). By breaking mob control of solid waste removal, the city was able to save businesses over {{nowrap|$600 million}}.

In 1994, in one of his first initiatives, Bratton instituted [[CompStat]], a comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically to identify emerging criminal patterns and chart officer performance by quantifying apprehensions. CompStat gave precinct commanders more power, based on the assumption that local authorities best knew their neighborhoods and thus could best determine what tactics to use to reduce crime. In turn, the gathering of statistics on specific personnel aimed to increase accountability of both commanders and officers. Critics of the system assert that it instead creates an incentive to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samoa.istat.it/Eventi/sicurezza/relazioni/Langan_rel.pdf |title=The Remarkable Drop in Crime in New York City |accessdate=December 5, 2006 |last=Langan |first=Patrick |last2=Durose |first2=Matthew |date=October 21, 2004 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208091401/http://samoa.istat.it/Eventi/sicurezza/relazioni/Langan_rel.pdf |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from the [[Kennedy School of Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joinrudy2008.com/biography/default.aspx JoinRudy2008 :: Missing Controller] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120205038/http://www.joinrudy2008.com/biography/default.aspx |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani continued to highlight crime reduction and law enforcement as central missions of his mayoralty throughout both terms.  These efforts were largely successful.&lt;ref name="samoa.istat.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samoa.istat.it/Eventi/sicurezza/relazioni/Langan_rel.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208091401/http://samoa.istat.it/Eventi/sicurezza/relazioni/Langan_rel.pdf |archivedate=December 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, concurrent with his achievements, a number of tragic cases of abuse of authority came to light, and numerous allegations of civil rights abuses were leveled against the NYPD. Giuliani's own Deputy Mayor, [[Rudy Washington]], alleged that he had been harassed by police on several occasions. More controversial still were several police shootings of unarmed suspects,&lt;ref&gt;Saxakali, [http://www.saxakali.com/CommunityLinkups/NYC%20Police%20Killings%201999.htm ''"NYC POLICE SHOOTINGS 1999"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000830022741/http://saxakali.com/CommunityLinkups/NYC%20Police%20Killings%201999.htm |date=August 30, 2000 }}, July 9, 2000.

In a case less nationally publicized than those of Louima and Diallo, unarmed bar patron [[Patrick Dorismond]] was killed shortly after declining the overtures of what turned out to be an undercover officer soliciting illegal drugs. Even while hundreds of outraged [[New York City|New Yorkers]] protested, Giuliani staunchly supported the [[New York City Police Department]], going so far as to take the unprecedented step of releasing Dorismond's "extensive criminal record" to the public,&lt;ref&gt;[[CNN]], [http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/US/03/18/nypd.protest/ ''"Giuliani, New York police under fire after shooting of unarmed man"''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407202255/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/US/03/18/nypd.protest/ |date=April 7, 2013 }}, March 19, 2000.

While many New Yorkers accused Giuliani of racism during his terms, former mayor Ed Koch defended him as even-handedly harsh: "Blacks and Hispanics ... would say to me, 'He's a racist!' I said, 'Absolutely not, he's nasty to everybody'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17440557/site/newsweek/page/6/ Rudy Giuliani: Master of Disaster – Newsweek: International Editions – MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403092156/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17440557/site/newsweek/page/6/ |date=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of credit Giuliani deserves for the drop in the crime rate is disputed. He may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress. Crime rates in New York City started to drop in 1991 under previous mayor [[David Dinkins]], three years before Giuliani took office.&lt;ref name="samoa.istat.it"/&gt; A small but significant nationwide drop in crime also preceded Giuliani's election, and continued throughout the 1990s. Two likely contributing factors to this overall decline in crime were federal funding of an additional 7,000 police officers and an improvement in the national economy. But many experts believe changing demographics were the most significant cause.&lt;ref&gt;Greene ''Crime Delinquency'' .1999; 45: 171–187 [http://cad.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/45/2/171 ''"Zero Tolerance: A Case Study of Police Policies and Practices in New York City"'']. Retrieved December 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have pointed out that during this time, murders inside the home, which could not be prevented by more police officers, decreased at the same rate as murders outside the home. Also, since the crime index is based on the FBI crime index, which is self-reported by police departments, some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the FBI does not quantify.&lt;ref&gt;"Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani" by Wayne Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some analyses, the crime rate in New York City fell even more in the 1990s and 2000s than nationwide and therefore credit should be given to a local dynamic: highly focused policing.  In this view, as much as half of the reduction in crime in New York in the 1990s, and almost all in the 2000s, is due to policing.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin E. Zimring, ''The Great American Crime Decline'' Oxford, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opinions differ on how much of the credit should be given to Giuliani; to Bratton; and to the current Police Commissioner, [[Raymond W. Kelly|Ray Kelly]], who had previously served under Dinkins and criticized aggressive policing under Giuliani.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Mac Donald, The Manhattan Institute, [http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_ny_cops.html ''"New York Cops: Still the Finest"'']. Retrieved December 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those crediting Giuliani for making New York safer were several other cities nationwide whose police departments subsequently instituted programs similar to Bratton's [[CompStat]].&lt;ref&gt;Josh Feit, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=3509 ''"Crime Pays: City Council Reviews Curious Federal Grant to Fight Crime"''], March 29, 2000.

Neighborhoods that were once considered dangerous are now much safer. Violent crime in the city has dropped by three quarters in the twelve years ending in 2005 with the murder rate at its lowest then level since 1963 with 539 murders that year, for a murder rate of 6.58 per 100,000 people, compared to 2,245 murders in 1990.&lt;ref name=grad13/&gt;  The murder rate continued to drop each year since then. In 2012, there were 414 murders, mainly occurring in the outlying, low income areas of NYC. In 2014, there were 328 murders, the lowest number since the introduction of crime statistics in 1963. Among the 182 U.S. cities with populations of more than 100,000, New York City ranked 136th in overall crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zeranski |first=Todd |title=How Safe is New York City?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, as part of Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s gun control efforts, the city approved new legislation regulating handgun possession and sales. The new laws established a gun offender registry, required city gun dealers to inspect their inventories and file reports to the police twice a year, and limited individual handgun purchases to once every 90 days. The regulations also banned the use and sale of kits used to paint guns in bright or fluorescent colors, on the grounds that such kits could be used to disguise real guns as toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/index.php/public-safety/220-new-yorks-gun-battle |title=New York's Gun Battle |publisher=Gothamgazette.com |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, along with Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]], Bloomberg co-founded [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]].&lt;ref name="MAIG-PR131219"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns And Moms Demand Action To Join Forces, Unite A National Movement To Protect Communities And Save Lives |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/12/19/6013494/mayors-against-illegal-guns-and.html |newspaper=Sacramento Bee |date=December 19, 2013 |type=Press Release |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232604/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/12/19/6013494/mayors-against-illegal-guns-and.html |archivedate=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BloombergMeninoWSJOp&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bloomberg |first1=Michael R. |last2=Menino |first2=Thomas M. |date=June 30, 2008 |title=Some Gun Rules We Can All Agree On |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB121478283640414407 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York |type=Opinion |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033612/https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB121478283640414407 |archive-date=February 20, 2018 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A December 2013 press release by the group said the bipartisan coalition included over 1,000 mayors.&lt;ref name="MAIG-PR131219" /&gt; As mayor, Bloomberg increased the mandatory minimum sentence for illegal possession of a loaded handgun, saying: "Illegal guns don't belong on our streets and we're sending that message loud and clear.

===Police commissioners===
Two of the most influential police commissioners of New York City, [[Raymond Kelly]] and [[William Bratton]], helped to greatly reduce the city's crime rate.

====Ray Kelly====
[[File:Ray Kelly Shankbone 2010 NYC.jpg|thumb|Ray Kelly]]
On October 16, 1992, David Dinkins appointed [[Raymond Kelly]] 37th [[New York City Police Commissioner|Police Commissioner of the City of New York]]. The national decline in both violent crime and property crime began in 1993, during the early months of Raymond Kelly's commissionership under Dinkins. At the time a firm believer in community policing, Kelly helped spur the decline in New York by instituting the Safe Streets, Safe City program, which put thousands more cops on the streets, where they would be visible to and able to get to know and interact with local communities. As the 37th Commissioner, he also pursued quality of life issues, such as the [[squeegee man|"squeegee men"]] that had become a sign of decay in the city. The murder rate in New York city had declined from its 1990 mid-Dinkins-administration historic high of 2,254 to 1,927, when Kelly left in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/crime/20011130/4/226 | Julia Vitullo-Martin, The New And Old Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, ''The Gotham Gazette'', Nov. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to plummet even more steeply under Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg.

The decline continued when Kelly returned as 41st Commissioner under Mayor Bloomberg in 2002–2013. As commissioner of the NYPD under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Kelly had often appeared at outreach events such as the Brooklyn's annual West Indian Day Parade, where he was photographed playing the drums and speaking to community leaders. Bloomberg and Kelly, however, continued to place heavy reliance on the [[CompStat]] system, initiated by Bill Bratton and since adopted by police departments in other cities worldwide. The system, while recognized as highly effective in reducing crime, also puts pressure on local precincts to reduce the number of reports for the seven major crimes while increasing the number of lesser arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ortega |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/graham_raymans.php |title=Tony Ortega, "Graham Rayman's 'NYPD Tapes' Series Wins Gold Keyboard, NY Press Club's Highest Award", ''Village Voice'', May 16, 2011 |work=The Village Voice |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217084905/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/graham_raymans.php |archivedate=December 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men continued and indeed stepped up Mayor Giuliani's controversial [[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|stop-and-frisk policy]], which is considered by some to be a form of racial profiling. In the first half of 2011 the NYC police made 362,150 such arrests, constituting a 13.5 percent increase from the same period in 2010, according to WNYC radio (which also reported that 84 percent of the people stopped were either black or Latino, and that "nine out 10 stops did not result in any arrest or ticket.") According to New York State Senator [[Eric Adams (politician)|Eric Adams]],  "Kelly was one of the great humanitarians in policing under David Dinkins. I don't know what happened to him that all of a sudden his philosophical understanding of the importance of community and police liking each other has changed. Sometimes the expeditious need of bringing down crime numbers bring out the worst in us. So instead of saying let's just go seek out the bad guy, we get to the point of, 'Let's go get them all.' If Kelly can't philosophically change, then we need to have a leadership change at the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pillifant |first=Reid |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/09/3271979/gentleman-commissioner-why-nypd-controversies-never-seem-touch-ray-k |title=Reid Pillifant, "The Gentleman Commissioner: Why NYDP Controversies Never Seem to Touch Ray Kelly", ''Capital New York'', Sept. 7, 2011 |publisher=Capitalnewyork.com |date=September 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Bloomberg, Commissioner Kelly also revamped New York City's Police Department into a world-class [[counter-terrorism]] operation, operating in conjunction with the CIA. Prior to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] there were fewer than two dozen officers working on terrorism full-time; ten years later there were over 1,000. One of Kelly's innovations was his unprecedented stationing of New York City police detectives in other cities throughout the world following terrorist attacks in those cities, with a view to determining if they are in any way connected to the security of New York. In the cases of both the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|March 11, 2004, Madrid bombing]] and the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]] and [[July 21, 2005 London bombings]], NYPD detectives were on the scene within a day to relay pertinent information back to New York. An August 2011 article by the Associated Press reported the NYCPD's extensive use of undercover agents (colloquially referred to as "rakers"&lt;ref&gt;"The AP investigation revealed that the NYPD built databases of everyday life in Muslim neighborhoods, cataloguing where people bought their groceries, ate dinner and prayed. Plainclothes officers known as "rakers" were dispatched into ethnic communities, where they eavesdropped on conversations and wrote daily reports on what they heard, often without any allegation of criminal wrongdoing,"— [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57320665/law-on-nypds-side-in-muslim-intel-program/ "Law on NYPD's side in Muslim intel program?" ''CBS News'', November 8, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; and "mosque crawlers"&lt;ref&gt;"Police have also used special informants, dubbed "mosque crawlers," to monitor weekly sermons and activity inside of mosques — even when there's no evidence of wrongdoing, the AP said." —[https://web.archive.org/web/20111116152633/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110824/manhattan/nypd-spying-on-muslim-communities-with-help-of-cia-report-says Jill Colvin, "NYPD Spying on Muslim Communities with Help of CIA, Report Says", ''DNA Info Manhattan Local'', August 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;) to keep tabs, even build databases, on stores, restaurants, mosques. and clubs. NYPD spokesman Paul Browne denied that police trawled ethnic neighborhoods, telling the AP that officers only follow leads. He also dismissed the idea of "mosque crawlers," saying, "Someone has a great imagination."&lt;ref name="Colvin August 24, 2011"&gt;Colvin (August 24, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Mother Jones'' columnist Adam Serwer, "The FBI was reportedly so concerned about the legality of the NYPD's program that it refused to accept information that came out of it."&lt;ref&gt;See Pillifant  (2011) and [http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/09/60-minutes-hearts-nypd-commissioner-ray-kelly Adam Serwer, "60-Minutes Hearts NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly", ''Mother Jones'', Sept. 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie Caproni, the FBI's general counsel, told the AP that the FBI is barred from sending agents into mosques looking for leads outside of a specific investigation and said the practice would raise alarms. "If you're sending an informant into a mosque when there is no evidence of wrongdoing, that's a very high-risk thing to do," she was quoted as saying. "You're running right up against core constitutional rights. You're talking about freedom of religion."&lt;ref name="Colvin August 24, 2011"/&gt;

Under Mayor Bloomberg, Kelly's NYPD also incurred criticism for its handling of the protests surrounding the [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity|2004 Republican National Convention]], which resulted in the City of New York having to pay out millions in settlement of lawsuits for false arrest and civil rights violations, as well as for its rough treatment of credentialed reporters covering the 2011 [[Occupy Wall Street]] demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/opinion/police-and-the-press.html |title=Police and the Press |date=November 26, 2011 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2007, it was announced that a [[Rikers Island]] inmate offered to pay an undercover police officer posing as a hit man to behead Kelly as well as bomb police headquarters in retaliation for the controversial police shooting of [[Sean Bell shooting incident|Sean Bell]].&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;

====Bill Bratton====
[[File: Bill Bratton at the seminar on his new book Collaborate or Perish! Lessons for Politics, Business and Public Services.jpg|thumb|Bill Bratton]]
[[William Bratton]] became the chief of the [[New York City Transit Police]] in 1990. In 1991 the Transit Police gained national accreditation under Bratton. The Department became one of only 175 law-enforcement agencies in the country and only the second in New York State to achieve that distinction. The following year it was also accredited by the [[New York (state)|State of New York]], and by 1994, there were almost 4,500 uniformed and civilian members of the Department, making it the sixth largest police force in the United States. Bratton had left the NYC Transit Police returning to Boston in 1992 to head the Boston Police Department, one of his long-time ambitions. In 1994, Bratton was appointed the 38th Commissioner of the NYPD by Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]]. He cooperated with Giuliani in putting the [[broken windows theory]] into practice. He had success in this position and introduced the [[CompStat]] system of tracking crimes, which proved successful in reducing crime in [[New York City]] and is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-murder-rate-on-pace-to-drop-to-1950s-levels-1514420267 |title=New York City Murder Rate on Pace to Drop to 1950s Levels |first=Zolan |last=Kanno-Youngs |date=December 27, 2017 |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=August 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new tax surcharge enabled the training and deployment of around 5,000 new better-educated police officers, police decision-making was devolved to precinct level, and a backlog of 50,000 unserved warrants was cleared. Bratton resigned in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/nyregion/bratton-resignation-behind-scenes-squabbling-behind-amicable-departure.html |work=The New York Times |title=The Bratton Resignation: Behind the Scenes; Squabbling Behind the Amicable Departure |date=March 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/27/nyregion/bratton-resignation-overview-bratton-quits-police-post-new-york-gains-over-crime.html?pagewanted=2 'The Bratton Resignation'] — ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2013, New York City mayor-elect [[Bill de Blasio]] named Bratton as New York City's new Police Commissioner to replace [[Raymond Kelly]] after de Blasio's swearing-in on January 1, 2014. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that at Bratton's swearing-in on January 2, 2014, the new Police Commissioner praised his predecessor [[Raymond Kelly]], but also signaled his intention to strike a more conciliatory tone with ordinary New Yorkers who had become disillusioned with policing in the city: "We will all work hard to identify why is it that so many in this city do not feel good about this department that has done so much to make them safe — what has it been about our activities that have made so many alienated?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/nyregion/bratton-stands-before-police-force-with-a-mandate-for-change.html |work=The New York Times |first1=J.

==In certain locations==
The boroughs of [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]] have historically had low crime rates compared to [[The Bronx]] and [[Manhattan]].

===The Bronx===
[[File:BrokenPromises JohnFekner.jpg|thumb|right|Burned-out building, Charlotte Street]]
The Bronx, specifically the [[South Bronx]], had some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas. However, its image as a poverty-ridden area developed in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/auth/checkbrowser.do?ipcounter=1&amp;cookieState=0&amp;rand=0.9697244443316492&amp;bhcp=1 |title=LexisNexis® Academic }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White flight]], [[landlord]] abandonment, economic changes, demographics, and the construction of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] all contributed to the borough's decay in the decades since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Caro"/&gt;

The [[Cross Bronx Expressway]], completed in 1963, was a part of [[Robert Moses]]'s urban renewal project for New York City. The expressway is now known to have been a factor in the extreme urban decay seen by the borough in the 1970s and 1980s. Cutting through the heart of the South Bronx, the highway displaced thousands of residents from their homes, as well as several local businesses. The neighborhood of [[East Tremont, Bronx|East Tremont]], in particular, was completely destroyed by the Expressway. Others have argued that the construction of such highways have not harmed communities.&lt;ref name="Caro"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert Caro |last=Caro |first=Robert A. |title=[[The Power Broker|The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the fall of New York]] |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1974 |isbn=0-394-48076-7}}, p. 893-894&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CrossBronx&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/cross-bronx/ |title=Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95, I-295 and US 1) |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The already poor and working-class neighborhoods were at further disadvantage by the decreasing property value, in combination with increasing vacancy rates. Racially charged tension, during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, further contributed to middle-class flight and the decline of many neighborhoods. As a result of new policies demanding that, for racial balance in schools, children be bused into other districts, parents who worried about their children attending the demographically adjusted schools often relocated to the suburbs, where this was not a concern. Some neighborhoods were considered undesirable by homeowners in the late 1960s and the area's population began decreasing. In addition, post World War II, [[rent control]] policies have been proposed by one author as contributing to the decline, by giving building owners little motivation to keep up their properties.&lt;ref name=CrossBronx/&gt; New York mayor, [[John Lindsay]] (1966–1973), suggested that lack of education and high unemployment, limited the housing options for the remaining low income tenants and that this prompted the reduced upkeep by landlords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a_NZVrnYic |title=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, while desirable housing options were scarce, vacancies further increased. In the late 1960s, by the time the city decided to consolidate welfare households citywide, the vacancy rate of homes in southern Bronx was already the highest of any place in the city.

The 1970s brought New York City's financial crisis,&lt;ref&gt;US President [[Gerald Ford]]'s administration denied New York City a bailout, whereupon the city's government faced shutdown until an insurance company made an emergency loan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[urban decay]],&lt;ref&gt;Businesses typical of wholesome communities closed or moved, property value fell, and apartment buildings were burned and abandoned—their reputable landlords collected insurance money—or were sold to thrifty or, it seemed, miserly landlords.&lt;/ref&gt; soaring crime rates, and [[white flight]].&lt;ref&gt;Mainly American whites, including Jews, the gentrified classes fled.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, significant poverty reached as far north as [[Fordham Road]]. Around this time, the Bronx experienced some of its worst instances of [[urban decay]]. The media attention brought the Bronx, especially its southern half, into common parlance nationwide.

The phrase "The Bronx is burning," attributed to [[Howard Cosell]] during a Yankees World Series game in 1977, refers to the arson epidemic caused by the total economic collapse of the South Bronx during the 1970s. During the game, as ABC switched to a generic helicopter shot of the exterior of [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], an uncontrolled fire could clearly be seen burning in the ravaged South Bronx surrounding the park.

The early 1970s saw South Bronx property values continue to plummet to record lows. A progressively [[vicious cycle]] began where large numbers of tenements and multi-story, multi-family apartment buildings (left vacant by white flight) sat abandoned and unsaleable for long periods of time, which, coupled with a stagnant economy and an extremely high unemployment rate, produced a strong attraction for criminal elements such as [[street gangs]], which were exploding in number and beginning to support themselves with large-scale [[drug dealing]] in the area. Abandoned property also attracted large numbers of [[squatters]] such as the [[indigent]], [[drug addicts]] and the [[mentally ill]], who further lowered the borough's quality of living. This trend also made the crime rate in the area go to record highs. The massive citywide spending cuts also left the few remaining building inspectors and fire marshals unable to enforce living standards or punish code violations. This encouraged slumlords and absentee landlords to neglect and ignore their property and allowed for gangs to set up protected enclaves and lay claim to entire buildings, which then spread crime and fear of crime to nearby unaffected apartments in a [[domino effect]]. Police statistics show that as the crime wave moved north across the Bronx, the remaining white tenants in the South Bronx (mostly elderly Jews) were preferentially targeted for violent crime by the influx of young, minority criminals because they were seen as easy prey; this became so common that the street slang terms "crib job" (meaning how elderly residents were as helpless as infants) and "push in" (meaning what would now be called a [[home invasion|home invasion robbery]]) were coined specifically in reference to them.&lt;ref name=Rooney58&gt;{{cite book |last=Rooney |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Rooney (author) |title=Organizing the South Bronx |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |year=1995 |page=58 |isbn=0-7914-2210-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6m4Y_1rrTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local South Bronx residents themselves also burned down vacant properties in their own neighborhoods. Much of this was reportedly done by those who had already worked stripping and burning buildings for pay: the ashes of burned down properties could be sifted for salable scrap metal. Other fires were caused by unsafe electrical wiring, fires set indoors for heating, and random vandalism associated with the general crime situation. Flawed HUD and city policies also encouraged local South Bronx residents to burn down their own buildings. Under the regulations, Section 8 tenants who were burned out of their current housing were granted immediate priority status for another apartment, potentially in a better part of the city. After the establishment of the (then) state-of-the-art [[Co-op City]], there was a spike in fires as tenants began burning down their Section 8 housing in an attempt to jump to the front of the 2- to 3-year-long waiting list for the new units.&lt;ref name=Rooney57&gt;{{cite book |last=Rooney |first=Jim |authorlink=Jim Rooney (author) |title=Organizing the South Bronx |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |year=1995 |page=57 |isbn=0-7914-2210-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6m4Y_1rrTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; HUD regulations also authorized lump-sum aid payments of up to $1000 to those who could prove they had lost property due to a fire in their Section 8 housing. HUD employees were supposed to investigate these claims to verify they weren't fraudulent, but they did very little investigation. Some HUD employees and social services workers were accused of turning a blind eye to suspicious fires, or even advising tenants on how to take advantage of HUD policies. According to reports, on multiple occasions, firefighters arrived at tenement fires only to find all the residents waiting calmly outside with all their possessions.

By the time of Cosell's 1977 commentary, dozens of buildings were being burnt in the South Bronx every day, sometimes whole blocks at a time, and usually far more than the fire department could respond to. This left the area perpetually blanketed in a pall of smoke. Firefighters from the period reported responding to as many as seven fully involved structure fires in a single shift, too many to even bother returning to the station house between calls. The local police precincts—already struggling and failing to contain the massive wave of drug and gang crime invading the Bronx—had long since stopped bothering to investigate the fires, as there were too many to track. During this period, the NYPD's 41st Precinct Station House at 1086 Simpson Street became famously known as "[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]" as it struggled to deal with the overwhelming surge of violent crime, which for the entirety of the 1970s (and part of the early 1980s) made South Bronx the murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and arson capital of America.

The Bronx entered 1980 as urban decay's very portrait. Trailing the New York City financial crisis that in 1975 nearly closed the city's government—an insurance company bailed out the city once the [[White House]] refused to help—was [[New York City blackout of 1977|New York City's 1977 blackout]], which triggered massive looting that bankrupted stores.&lt;ref name=carlisle/&gt; Many Bronx neighborhoods, resembling rubble by 1979, went aflame, while apartment buildings were abandoned or else sold to lesser landlords amid severe, rapid [[urban decay]].&lt;ref name=carlisle&gt;Rodney P Carlisle, ''Handbook to Life in America'', Volume IX: ''Contemporary America, 1970 to the Present'' (New York: [[Facts On File]], 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=p21s0h_J5VIC&amp;pg=PT81&amp;dq=New+York+Bronx#v=twopage pp 68–70].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gonzalez, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/nyregion/23bronx.html?pagewanted=all "Faces in the rubble"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sterbenz&gt;Christina Sterbenz, [http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-used-to-be-a-terrifying-place-photos-2013-7 "New York City used to be a terrifying place"], ''[[Business Insider]]'', July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail reporter, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2512365/A-ride-1980s-New-York-Amazing-photographs-New-York-City-subway-30-years-ago.html "Life on the rails: Fascinating photographs of the New York City subway as it was 30 years ago"], ''[[Daily Mail]]'' (''[[Daily Mail]]'', UK), November 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and its high schools became notorious as the city's worst,&lt;ref&gt;John N Gardner &amp; Betsy O Barefoot, ch 10 "Lehman College of the City University of New York", pp 219–42, in Betsy O Barefoot ''et al'', eds, ''Achieving and Sustaining Institutional Excellence for the First Year of College'' (San Francisco: [[Jossey-Bass|Jossey–Bass]], 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=KFqay4a14ewC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=urban+decay+high+schools+Bronx p 219].&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[crack epidemic]] struck,&lt;ref name=sterbenz/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlap-Johnson-pp49-50"&gt;Eloise Dunlap &amp; Bruce D Johnson, "The setting for the crack era: Macro forces, micro consequences (1960–1992)", pp 45–59, in Marilyn D McShane &amp; Franklin P Williams III, eds, ''Drug Use and Drug Policy'' (New York &amp; London: Garland Publishing, 1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2vl4OivSufUC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=New+York+City#v=twopage pp 49–50].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the 41st was renamed "[[The Little House on the Prairie]]", as fully 2/3 of the 94,000 residents originally served by the precinct had fled, leaving the fortified station house as one of the few structures in the neighborhood (and the sole building on Simpson Street) that had not been abandoned or burnt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Out of Fort Apache, the Bronx; New 41st Precinct Station House Leaves Behind Symbol of Community's Past Troubles |first=Ian |last=Fisher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/nyregion/pulling-fort-apache-bronx-new-41st-precinct-station-house-leaves-behind-symbol.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 23, 1993 |accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Society|Social]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] divisions in the city contributed to the tensions, which climaxed when attempts at community control in the nearby [[Ocean Hill, Brooklyn|Ocean Hill]]-[[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] school district pitted some black community residents and activists (from both inside and outside the area) against teachers, the majority of whom were [[whites|white]], many of them Jewish. Charges of [[racism]] were a common part of social tensions at the time.

Coincidentally, the 1964 riot took place throughout the NYPD's 28th and 32nd precinct, in Harlem, and the 79th precinct, in Bedford–Stuyvesant, which at one time were the only three police precincts in the NYPD where black police officers were allowed to patrol.&lt;ref&gt;Darien, Andrew.

In the late 1980s, resistance to illegal drug-dealing included, according to Rita Webb Smith, following police arrests with a civilian [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] 40-day patrol of several blocks near a mosque, the same group having earlier evicted drug sellers at a landlord's request, though that also resulted in arrests of the Muslims for "burglary, menacing and possession of weapons", resulting in a [[probation]]ary sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rita Webb, &amp; Tony Chapelle, ''The Woman Who Took Back Her Streets: One Woman Fights The Drug Wars And Rebuilds Her Community'' (Far Hills, New Jersey: New Horizon Press, 1991 ({{ISBN|0-88282-065-6}})), pp.&amp;nbsp;289–291 (quoting p.&amp;nbsp;290) (author Smith leader of a [[Harlem]] anti-drug campaign).&lt;/ref&gt; However, many properties were renovated after the start of the 21st century, and crime declined.

After arriving in New York, many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the [[slum]]s of the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] neighborhood, an area between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and the [[Bowery]], northeast of [[New York City Hall]]. By the 1820s, the area was home to many gambling dens and [[brothel]]s, and was known as a dangerous place to go.

====Chinatown====
The early days of [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]] were dominated by Chinese "[[tong (gang)|tongs]]" (now sometimes rendered neutrally as "[[voluntary association|associations]]"), which were a mixture of [[clan]] associations, landsman's associations, political alliances ([[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) vs [[Communist Party of China]]), and more secretly, [[organized crime|crime syndicates]]. The associations started to give protection from harassment due to anti-Chinese sentiment. Each of these associations was aligned with a [[street gang]]. The associations were a source of assistance to new immigrants – giving out [[loan]]s, aiding in starting business, and so forth.

Until the 1980s, the eastern portion of Chinatown east of the [[Bowery]], which is considered part of the [[Lower East Side]] was developing more slowly as being part of Chinatown, the proportion and concentration of Chinese residents was lower and more scattered than the western section, and there was still a higher proportion of Non-Chinese residents than Chinatown's western section consisting of Jewish, Puerto Ricans, a few Italians, and blacks.&lt;ref name="Inc1959"&gt;{{cite book |author=Time Inc |title=LIFE |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |date=September 7, 1959 |publisher=Time Inc |pages=36– |issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, the eastern portion of Chinatown east of the Bowery was a very quiet section, and like in the rest of the Lower East Side, many people and especially many Chinese people were afraid to walk through or even reside on the streets east of the Bowery due to deteriorating building conditions and high crime rates such as gang activities, robberies, building burglaries, and rape as well as fear of racial tensions with other ethnic people that were still residing there.

Similarly, crime in Chinatown increased due to the poor relations between Cantonese and [[Fuzhou]]ese immigrants. The Fuzhou immigration pattern started out in the 1970s very similarly like the Cantonese immigration during the late 1800s to early 1900s that had established Manhattan's Chinatown on Mott Street, Pell Street, and Doyers Street. Starting out as mostly men arriving first and then later on bringing their families over. The beginning influx of Fuzhou immigrants arriving during the 1980s and 1990s were entering into a Chinese community that was extremely Cantonese dominated. Due to the Fuzhou immigrants having no legal status and inability to speak Cantonese, many were denied jobs in Chinatown as a result causing many of them to resort to crimes to make a living that began to dominate the crimes going on in Chinatown. There was a lot of Cantonese resentment against Fuzhou immigrants arriving into Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/nyregion/neighborhood-report-chinatown-latest-wave-of-immigrants-is-splitting-chinatown.html |work=The New York Times |first=Jane H. |last=Lii |title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CHINATOWN; Latest Wave of Immigrants Is Splitting Chinatown |date=June 12, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RosenbergDunford2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Andrew Rosenberg |author2=Martin Dunford |title=The Rough Guide to New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ0z8ZSwQ-sC&amp;pg=PA81 |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |date=January 1, 2011 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-1-4053-8565-7 |pages=81–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KyleKoslowski2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Kyle |author2=Rey Koslowski |title=Global Human Smuggling: Comparative Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5blzwmEvZG4C&amp;pg=PA236 |accessdate=July 25, 2012 |date=May 11, 2001 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6590-9 |pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guest2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth J.

During the mid-to-late 80s, Chinatown began to experience an influx of Vietnamese refugees from the [[Vietnam War]], the majority of them being [[Vietnamese boat people|boat people]]. Due to language barriers, since the Vietnamese refugees could not speak [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or [[Cantonese]] which was solely used for most social services including banks, they struggled to survive and lived on the fringes of the community. Eventually, many of the Vietnamese youths within the city started to band together, forming several various gang factions within the city. Under the leadership of a wealthy enterprising Vietnamese immigrant [[David Thai]], who coalesced many separate gangs into one that became known as [[Born to Kill (gang)|Born to Kill]], Vietnamese youths began a violent crime spree in Chinatown, robbing, extorting, and racketeering—drawing much resentment from the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = English|first = TJ|date= 2011-11-15|title = Born to Kill: The Rise and Fall of America's Bloodiest Asian Gang| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gf3y2q-2CLQC|publisher = Open Road Media|isbn= 9781453234273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/01/30/book-world/aef9b38e-6ab9-40ba-94d9-776478c396c5/ |title=BOOK WORLD |accessdate=2016-05-08|date=1995-01-30|author=David Chanoff |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/03/30/Seven-Born-to-Kill-members-convicted-of-murder-racketeering/5759701931600/|title=Seven 'Born to Kill' members convicted of murder, racketeering |accessdate=2016-11-30|work=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZleBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA401&amp;lpg=PA401&amp;dq=born+to+Kill+gang+New+Orleans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HwKfiOdTSs&amp;sig=g5se5YZt9SwLnk4GY5L5COp52UA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMI65zwpe7ryAIVB-JjCh2ZQQKo#v=onepage&amp;q=born%20to%20Kill%20gang%20New%20Orleans&amp;f=false|title=Asian American Society: An Encyclopedia|accessdate=2015-10-30|date=2014-09-03|author=Mary Yu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==

===Broken windows theory===
{{Main|Broken windows theory}}
The [[broken windows theory]] is a [[Criminology|criminological]] theory of the norm-setting and signalling effect of urban disorder and [[vandalism]] on additional [[crime]] and [[anti-social behavior]].  The theory states that maintaining and monitoring [[Urban area|urban environments]] in a well-ordered condition may stop further [[vandalism]] and escalation into more serious crime.

===CompStat===
{{Main|Compstat}}
[[CompStat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/COMPSTAT/About-COMPSTAT.html |title=Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to the [[New York City Police Department]]'s accountability process and has since been replicated in many other departments. CompStat is a [[management]] philosophy or organizational management tool for police departments, roughly equivalent to [[Six Sigma]] or [[Total quality management|TQM]], and was not a computer system or software package in its original form. Through an evolutionary process, however, some commercial entities have created [[turnkey]] packages including computer systems, software, mobile devices, and other implements collectively assembled under the heading of CompStat. Instead, CompStat is a multilayered dynamic approach to [[crime]] reduction, [[quality of life]] improvement, and personnel and resource management. CompStat employs [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] and was intended to [[crime mapping|map crime]] and identify problems. In weekly meetings, ranking NYPD executives meet with local precinct commanders from one of the eight patrol boroughs in [[New York City]] to discuss the problems. They devise strategies and tactics to solve problems, reduce crime, and ultimately improve quality of life in their assigned area.

===Muslim surveillance===
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the NYPD surreptitiously developed a Muslim surveillance program. When the [[Associated Press]] published reports on NYPD's spying on Muslims in [[New York City]] and neighboring [[New Jersey]], the program came to light and much controversy was raised. Muslims were spied on in mosques, restaurants, streets, public places and Muslim groups, and websites were scrutinized. It resulted in much confusion and anger from [[Islam in the United States|Muslim communities in the United States]], as well as support from [[New York City]] mayor [[Michael Bloomberg|Bloomberg]]. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] criticized the spying as unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=209&amp;sid=2781096 |title=WTOP.com – Washington, DC News, Traffic &amp; Weather |publisher=WTOP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ap.org/Content/AP-in-the-News/2011/NYPD-spied-on-citys-Muslim-anti-terror-partners |title=NYPD-spied-on-citys-Muslim-anti-terror-partners |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310050652/http://ap.org/Content/AP-In-The-News/2011/NYPD-spied-on-citys-Muslim-anti-terror-partners |archivedate=March 10, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/03/08/muslim-surveillance-shows-tensions-between-nypd-fbi/ |title=Muslim Surveillance Shows Tensions Between NYPD, FBI |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/03/08/440780/fbi-official-nypd-muslim-surveillance/ |title=FBI Official: News Of NYPD Muslim Surveillance Program Is 'Starting To Have A Negative Impact' – ThinkProgress }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/fbi-nypd-muslim-surveillance_n_1327444.html |title=FBI Says NYPD Muslim Surveillance Is Breaking The Islamic Community's Trust |work=The Huffington Post |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associated Press]] won [[Pulitzer Prize|2012 Pulitzer Prize]] for the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/ap-series-about-nypds-surveillance-of-muslims-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-investigative-reporting/2012/04/16/gIQAWfsXMT_story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417102353/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/ap-series-about-nypds-surveillance-of-muslims-wins-pulitzer-prize-for-investigative-reporting/2012/04/16/gIQAWfsXMT_story.html |archive-date=April 17, 2012 |title=AP series about NYPD's surveillance of Muslims wins Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting |agency=Associated Press |date=April 17, 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in June 2012, Muslims in New Jersey sued the NYPD over the spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303753904577450564222258858?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=N.J.

=== Policing ===
{{Main|Law enforcement in New York City}}

Law enforcement in New York City is carried out by numerous [[law enforcement agencies]]. New York City has the highest concentration of law enforcement agencies in the United States. As with the rest of the US, agencies operate at federal and state levels. However, New York City's unique nature means many more operate at lower levels. Many private police forces also operate in New York City. The [[New York City Police Department]] is the main police agency in the city.

===Stop-and-frisk===
{{Main|New York City stop-and-frisk program}}
The NYPD has come under scrutiny for its use of [[New York City stop-and-frisk program|stop-and-frisk]], implemented under Bloomberg's tenure as mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NYPD Stop And Frisks: 15 Shocking Facts About A Controversial Program |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/13/nypd-stop-and-frisks-15-shocking-facts_n_1513362.html |accessdate=December 24, 2013 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stop-and-Frisk Campaign: About the Issue |url=http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices |publisher=NYCLU |accessdate=December 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230180424/http://www.nyclu.org/issues/racial-justice/stop-and-frisk-practices |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NYPD Stop and Frisk |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/nypd-stop-and-frisk |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a practice of the [[New York City Police Department]] by which police officers stop and question hundreds of thousands of pedestrians annually, and frisk them for weapons and other contraband. The rules for stop, question and frisk are found in New York State Criminal Procedure Law section 140.50, and are based on the decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Terry v.

'''Crime in Norway''' is countered by [[Law enforcement in Norway|Norway's law enforcement agencies]].

In general, Norway has seen a significant decline in crime the latest years. There was a 4.3 percent  decrease from 2015-2016, and a decline of as much as 9.6 percent from 2014. If population growth is factored in, this level of reported offences is by far the lowest in the 24 years of these statistics.&lt;ref name=SSB&gt;[https://www.ssb.no/en/sosiale-forhold-og-kriminalitet/statistikker/lovbrudda/aar ''Offences reported to the police, 2015-2016''[[Statistics Norway|SSB]], 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime by type ==

=== Murder ===
{{See|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

In 2014, Norway had a murder rate of 0.56 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=UNODC/&gt; There were a total of 29 murders in Norway in 2014.&lt;ref name=UNODC&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''. [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a comparison of crime statistics from Norwegian [[Kripos]] and Swedish [[Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention|BRÅ]] done by Norwegian daily newspaper [[Aftenposten]], the murder rate of Norway has since 2002 been roughly half that of neighbour country [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/GVLRV/Svensk-politi-skulle-ta-tilbake-kontrollen-over-utsatte-bydeler-fra-kriminelle-To-ar-senere-er-situasjonen-blitt-enda-verre-|title=Svensk politi skulle ta tilbake kontrollen over lovløse områder. To år senere er situasjonen blitt enda verre.|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
{{See|Domestic violence in Norway}}

According to Norwegian police statistics, 5,284 cases of domestic violence were reported in 2008. These cases ranged from serious acts of violence such as murder and attempted murder to physical assault.&lt;ref name="Police_statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politi.no/rad_fra_politiet/vold_i_nare_relasjoner/statistikk/|title=Statistikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Police Service]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reported cases of domestic violence increased by 500 percent from 2005 to 2011.&lt;ref name="Melgård"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/11/30/nyheter/vold_i_nere_relasjoner/nks/grete_faremo/19216834/|title=500 prosent flere anmeldelser av vold i nære relasjoner|last=Melgård|first=Marie|date=30 November 2011|work=[[Dagbladet]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime by location ==

=== Oslo ===
Statistics from the late 2000s indicate that crime in Oslo is rising.&lt;ref name="Redaksjon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Redaksjon|title=Fire ganger mer krim i Oslo enn i New York|url=http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Fire-ganger-mer-krim-i-Oslo-enn-i-New-York-6537952.html|accessdate=28 August 2012|newspaper=Osloby.no|date=2008-03-07|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oslo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Oslo|first=Politidistrikt|title=Kriminaliteten i Oslo|url=https://www.politi.no/oslo/strategier_og_analyser/statistikker_og_analyser/Tema_132.xml|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=Politi.no|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some media have reported that there are four times as many thefts and robberies in Oslo as in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Redaksjon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oslo"/&gt; Since 2012, the German travel guide ''[[M. DuMont Schauberg|Dumont]]'' now describes the city as being unsafe for female tourists. The guide also named Oslo "The Crime capital of Scandinavia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finstad|first=Vemund|title=Reiseguide advarer mot høy kriminalitet i Oslo|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/2012/07/16/reiseguide-advarer-mot-hoey-kriminalitet-i-oslo|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=Abcnyheter.no|date=16 July 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Oslo Police]], they receive more than 15,000 reports of petty thefts annually. The rate is more than seven times the number per-capita of [[Berlin]]. Approximately 0.8% of those cases get solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norsk Telegrambyrå|title=Oslo har like mange lommetyverier som Berlin|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10054623|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|date=9 October 2012|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first 6 months of 2014, the number of petty thefts has declined by approximately 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norsk Telegrambyrå|title=2.000 færre lommetyverier i Oslo hittil i år|url=http://www.osloby.no/2000-farre-lommetyverier-i-Oslo-hittil-i-ar-7627083.html|accessdate=17 July 2014|newspaper=Osloby.no|date=4 July 2014|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oslo has witnessed annual spikes in [[sexual assault]] cases in years leading up to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Enerstvedt|first=Vidar|title=Voldtektsnorge utenfor hovedstaden: 63 anmeldte overfallsvoldtekter - to tatt|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10023673|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=Vg.no|language=no|date=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants from Africa and the Middle East were found by Oslo police to be overrepresented as perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.politi.no/vedlegg/lokale_vedlegg/oslo/Vedlegg_1309.pdf "Oslo politidistrikt - Voldtekt i den globale byen (2010) pages 52-54"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime dynamics ==
A large proportion of the crime that is carried out in Norway is committed by criminals from overseas.&lt;ref name="Project Syndicate"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Nordic Page |title=Prisons in Norway Do not Scare Foreign Criminals |publisher=Project Syndicate |date=2 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 34 percent of the Norwegian prison population are foreigners.&lt;ref name="Project Syndicate"/&gt; In his autobiography ''Undesirables'', British criminal Colin Blaney has claimed that gangs of English thieves target the nation on account of the perception that its prisons are relatively comfortable compared to those of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies also indicate that this is one of the reasons that criminals from other parts of the world commit crime in Norway.&lt;ref name="Project Syndicate"/&gt;

Each country of origin has four bars, with M1 (green) representing the proportion of perpetrators unadjusted for socioeconomic factors, M2 (purple) symbolizing adjustment for age and gender, M3 (yellow) adjustment for residence, and M4 (blue) adjustment for employment. Over-representation is largely dependent on the M2-M4 variables, and drops significantly when they are taken into consideration.&lt;ref name="Popcr"/&gt;]]
The overall probability that a person living in Norway would be convicted for a felony ({{lang-no|forbrytelse}}) was increased by about 0.5 percentage points for the immigrant compared to non-immigrant populations for felonies committed in the years 2001-2004. The incidence was especially high among immigrants from Kosovo, Morocco, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Chile, and reached more than 2% in all these groups. In comparison, the incidence in the non-immigrant population was about 0.7%. Incidence was lower than for the non-immigrant population among immigrants from among others, Western European countries, Eastern Europe except Poland, the Balkans and Russia, the Philippines, China and North America. Incidence was also higher for persons with two immigrant parents for all countries of origin, including Nordic and Western European countries. When the data was corrected for the population group's age and gender structure (the most over-represented immigrant groups also have a considerable over-representation of young men), place of residence (rural–central) and employment situation, the over-representation was found to be significantly lower, especially for those groups which had the highest incidence in the uncorrected statistics. For some groups, among them immigrants from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Poland, Russia and the other Eastern European countries, the corrected incidences did not differ significantly from the non-immigrant population.&lt;ref name="SSB11"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skarðhamar |first1=Torbjørn |last2=Thorsen |first2=Lotte R. |last3=Henriksen |first3=Kristin |title=Kriminalitet og straff blant innvandrere og øvrig befolkning |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Crime and punishment among immigrants and non-immigrants |url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/03/05/rapp_201121/rapp_201121.pdf |format=pdf |date=2011-09-12 |publisher=[[Statistics Norway]] |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-537-8124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a Statistics Norway report on crime in Norway was ordered by the immigration minister [[Sylvi Listhaug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/politikk/i/3jJ8a0/Fersk-SSB-rapport-Barn-av-innvandrere-mer-kriminelle-enn-foreldrene|title=Etterlyste mer info om innvandrere og kriminalitet – svaret overrasker ikke SSB-forskerne|work=Aftenposten|access-date=2017-12-23|language=nb-NO}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Statistics Norway, since there is a generally low proportion of crime across all resident populations, it limited the scope of the paper to figures for individual nations from which at least 4,000 immigrants lived in Norway as of January 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

Skarðhamar et al. (2011).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010-2013 period, the proportion of foreign-born perpetrators of criminal offences aged 15 and older per 1000 residents in Norway was found to be highest among immigrants from [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]] (164.0), [[Africa]] (153.8), and [[Asia]] including [[Turkey]] (117.4), and lowest among immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]] (98.4), other [[Nordic countries]] (69.1), and [[Western Europe]] outside the Nordic region (50.7). This was compared to averages of 44.9 among native Norwegians and 112.9 among Norway-born residents with parents of foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

Blant norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre er tallet 112,9.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among individual countries of origin for which figures were provided, the estimated proportion of foreign-born perpetrators was highest among immigrants from [[Kosovo]] (131.48), [[Afghanistan]] (127.62), [[Iraqis in Norway|Iraq]] (125.29), [[Somalis in Norway|Somalia]] (123.81), and [[Iran]] (108.60). Over-representation largely depended on variables such as gender and age structure (M2) and employment (M4), with residence (M3) having a negligible effect on the total. When adjusted for these variables, the unadjusted proportion (M1) of the foreign-born perpetrators of criminal offences during the same period dropped significantly in the adjusted estimates: Kosovo (113 M2; 106 M4), Afghanistan (93 M2; 85 M4), Iraq (102 M2; 92 M4), Somalia (102 M2; 89 M4), and Iran (98 M2; 91 M4). Immigrants from [[Poles in Norway|Poland]] were the only over-represented population for which all three adjustable variables, including residence, could explain their over-representation.&lt;ref name="Popcr"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

De grønne og lilla søylene (M1 og M2) tilsvarer tallene i Tabell 3.3. Vedå kontrollere for alder og kjønn (M2) skjer det vesentlige endringer i andelgjerningspersoner, og da særlig for de landgruppene med høyest andel gjernings-personer. For eksempel synker andelen gjerningspersoner fra Afghanistan fra 127,6til 93,2 per 1000 (en reduksjon på 27 prosent), og for Irak synker andelen fra 125,3til 102,1 per 1000 (en reduksjon på 21 prosent). Dette betyr at for disse landenehenger overrepresentasjonen i vesentlig grad sammen med kjønns- og alders-strukturen. Korreksjon for alder og kjønn gir også en vesentlig reduksjon i andelengjerningspersoner blant innvandrere fra Litauen, Somalia og Irak, og en vissreduksjon ses også for alle andre grupper med unntak for innvandrere fra Danmark, Finland, Filipinene, Thailand og Nord-Amerika.[...] Å justere for bosted (M3) gir ingen eller liten endring for samtlige landgrupper.[...] Å kontrollere for sysselsetting (M4) reduserer imidlertid andelengjerningspersoner ytterligere for de landgruppene som fremdeles har relativt høyandel gjerningspersoner – herunder Somalia og øvrige Afrika, Irak og Iran.[...] Samlet sett er derfor rimelig åsi at sysselsetting forklarer noe av overrepresentasjonen for enkelte land ogregioner, selv om forskjellene jevnt over ikke er veldig store. Dette er i tråd medtidligere studier som finner at kjønn og alder er de viktigste sosiodemografiskeforklaringsfaktorene når man ønsker å forklare hvorfor innvandrere er over-representert i kriminalstatistikken. Det er også viktig å påpeke at kjønn, alder, bosted og sysselsetting kan forklare hele overrepresentasjonen kun blantinnvandrere fra Polen. For de andre landene som var overrepresentert i utgangspunktet består overrepresentasjonen også etter at disse faktorene er tatt hensyn til}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Statistics Norway, as of 2015, a total of 260,868 persons residing in Norway incurred sanctions. Of these, most were citizens of countries in [[Europe]] (240,497 individuals), followed by [[Asia]] (2,899 individuals), [[Africa]] (2,469 individuals), the [[Americas]] (909 individuals), and [[Oceania]] (92 individuals). There were also 13,853 persons sanctioned who had unknown citizenship, and 149 persons sanctioned without citizenship. The five most common countries of origin of foreign citizens in Norway who incurred sanctions were [[Poland]] (7,952 individuals), [[Lithuania]] (4,227 individuals), [[Sweden]] (3,490 individuals), [[Romania]] (1,953 individuals) and [[Denmark]] (1,728 individuals).&lt;ref name="Popcjs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Persons sanctioned, by group of principal offence and citizenship (and category of principal offence -2014).

This article is about the [[Demography|demographic]] features of the population of the [[Netherlands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the population, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the [[population]].

==Population size==
The [[Netherlands]] is the [[List of countries by population|66th most populated]] country in the world, and as of March 21, 2016, it has a population of 17,000,000.

Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10.0 million people. From 1951 to 2000 the population increased from 10.0 to 15.9 million people, increasing by a smaller proportion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&amp;PA=37556ENG&amp;D1=0-44,53-60&amp;D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&amp;LA=EN&amp;VW=T CBS Statline - Population; history]. [[Statistics Netherlands]]. Retrieved on 2009-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dutch provinces as European countries by population.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Dutch provinces as European countries by population]]

The Netherlands is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|thirty-first most densely populated]] country in the world. The 17,000,000&lt;ref name="cbs-counter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/cijfers/extra/bevolkingsteller.htm|title=Population counter|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch men, women and children are concentrated on an area of 41,526&amp;nbsp;km²;&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; this means that the country has a population density of {{#expr:17000000/41526 round 0}} per km² (August 2018:415 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or over {{#expr:17000000/33883 round 0}} per km² if only the land area, 33,883&amp;nbsp;km²,&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt; is counted. If only the land area of the provinces, 33,718&amp;nbsp;km², is counted, 500 inhabitants/km² were reached in the first half of 2014 or possibly in the last few days of 2013. 511 inhabitants per square kilometer were reached in August 2018.

[[Bangladesh]] and [[South Korea]] are larger and more densely populated (hence have a larger population). There are twenty-one more countries (twelve independent ones and nine [[Dependent territory|dependent territories]]) with a larger population density, but they all have a smaller population (hence a smaller area). If the water area is not counted then Taiwan is larger, and there are sixteen more countries (nine independent ones and seven dependent territories) with a larger population density.

As a result of these demographic characteristics the Netherlands has had to plan its [[land management|land use]] strictly. Since 1946 the [[VROM|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] has been occupied with the national coordination of land use. Because of its high population density the Netherlands has also [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land from the sea]] by [[polder]]ing. Between 1927 and 1968 an entire province, [[Flevoland]] was created. It currently (2015) houses more than 400,000 people. Because of these policies, the Dutch have been able to combine high levels of population density with extremely high levels of [[agriculture|agricultural production]].

Even though the Netherlands is so densely populated, it has no municipalities with a population over one million, although the two largest municipalities of the country do score well over a million if the complete city region is counted, including the neighbouring satellite towns that often are physically connected to the main municipality. Moreover, the "four big cities" ([[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]) can in many ways be regarded as a single metropolitan area, the [[Randstad]] ("rim city" or "edge city") with about 7 million inhabitants around an agricultural "green heart" (''het [[Groene Hart]]).

The Dutch population is [[Population ageing|ageing]]. Furthermore, [[life expectancy]] has increased because of developments in [[medicine]], and in addition to this, the Netherlands has seen increasing immigration. Despite these developments combined with the [[population boom]] after the [[Second World War]], the low birth rate has caused extremely low population growth: 2005 saw the lowest absolute population growth since 1900.

This demographic development has consequences for [[health care]] and [[social security]] policy. As the Dutch population ages, the proportion of people of working age, as a percentage of the entire population, decreases. Important policy advisors like the [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|CBS]] (Statistical Office) and the [[Centraal Planbureau|CPB]] (Planning Office) have pointed out that this will cause problems with the current system of old age pensions: fewer people will work to pay for old age pensions, while there will be more people receiving those pensions. Furthermore, the costs of health care are also projected to increase. These developments have caused several cabinets, most notably the recent [[Second cabinet Balkenende|second Balkenende cabinet]] to reform the system of health care and social security to increase participation in the labour market and make people more conscious of the money they spend on health care.

In 2003, the annual birth rate per thousand was highest in the province of Flevoland (15.9). The overall lifelong [[Total fertility rate]] (TFR), was highest in the province of Flevoland (2.0) and lowest in the province of Limburg (1.6). The municipality with the highest TFR was Urk (3.23) followed by Valkenburg (2.83), Graafstroom (2.79) and Staphorst (2.76). The lowest TFRs were recorded in Vaals (1.11) and Thorn (1.21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2003/2003-1269-wm.htm|title=Largest families in Urk|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total population at December 31, 2006 was 16,356,914. The population loss due to net emigration was 35,502 (an estimated 40-50% of emigrants were ethnic non-Dutch).

In 2007, there were 117,000 immigrants (including 7000 Germans, 6000 Poles, 5000 Bulgarians, 3000 Turks and 2000 Moroccans) and 123,000 emigrants. Nearly half the emigrants were native Dutch, followed at a distance by nearly 5000 Poles and more than 3000 Germans. There was an observable increase in net immigration from the former USSR, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2008/2008-011-pb.htm|title=Population growth 46 thousand in 2007|first=Statistics|last=Netherlands|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual death rate was lowest in the municipalities of Valkenburg (2.9 per 1000), Zeewolde (3.2), Renswoude (3.4), Westervoort and Zeevang (both 3.9). The highest annual death rates were recorded in Warmond (22.3 per 1000), Laren (19.9) and Doorn (18.8).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/publicaties/periodieken/bevolkingstrends/archief/2003/2003-k3-b15-pub.htm] {{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

16.4% of the total births in 2003 were to parents of non-European origin, although they account for only 12.4% of the population in the 25-34 age group. For example, 3.8% of the births were ethnic Moroccan, although they were only 2.26% of the 25-34 age group. Respective figures were 3.27% and 3.0% for Turks. The TFR for Moroccans in 2003 was 3.3 while the general TFR was 1.73. TFR was 2.3 for [[Turkish people|Turks]], 1.7 for [[Surinamese]], 1.8 for [[Aruba]]ns, 3.0 for [[Africans]] and 1.8 for [[Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070630223717/http://forum.europa.eu.int/irc/dsis/jointestatunece/info/data/paper_alders.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (These figures compare with a figure of around 2.1 required to maintain a stable overall population figure.)

According to Statistics Netherlands, for the year 2007, the TFR for those born in Netherlands was 1.72&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/A157E464-812A-40CC-8A71-E85FDF3A16B0/0/2008k1b15p55art.pdf|format=PDF|title=Bevolkingsprognose 2007–2014: tijdelijk hogere groei|website=Cbs.nl|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1.65 in 2000). TFR of Moroccan immigrants was 2.87 (3.22 in 2000) and that of Turkish immigrants was 1.88 (2.18 in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paa2007.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=70869|title=Fertility and Religiousness Among European Muslims|author1=Charles F.

Between 1590 and 1800 the estimated share of foreign-born population was consistently above 5%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2010 there were 1,800,000 foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1,400,000 (8.5%) were born outside the EU (including those from Dutch colonies) and 428,000 (2.6%) were born in another EU member state. The most common countries of birth being: [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF |format=PDF |title=6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad (34/2011) |work=[[Eurostat]] |first=Katya |last=VASILEVA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128101046/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF |archivedate=2012-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result of [[immigration]] from overseas, the Netherlands have a sizeable minority of non-indigenous peoples. There is also a considerable level of emigration, in majority consisting of former immigrants. In 2005, some 121,000 people left the country, while 94,000 entered it. Out of a total of 101,150 people immigrating into the Netherlands in 2006, 66,658 were from Europe, Oceania, the Americas or Japan, and 34,492 were from other (mostly developing) countries. Out of a total of 132,470 emigrants, 94,834 were going to Europe, Oceania, the Americas or Japan and 37,636 to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/table.asp?LYR=G2:0,G3:0,G4:0&amp;LA=en&amp;DM=SLEN&amp;PA=03742eng&amp;D1=0-4&amp;D2=0-7&amp;D6=a,!0-7&amp;HDR=T&amp;STB=G5:D,G1|title=CBS StatLine - External migration; sex, age (31 dec), marital status and country of birth|work=cbs.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were five subsequent waves of immigration to the Netherlands in recent history.
# In the late-1940s and into the 1950s, following the end of the [[Second World War]], people from the newly independent [[Indonesia|Republic of Indonesia]] repatriated or emigrated to the Netherlands - mainly [[Indo people|Indo-European]] (people of mixed European and Indonesian ancestry of Dutch nationality) and supporters of the [[Republic of South Maluku]].
# Between 1960 and 1974, migrants from [[Southern Europe]] (i.e. [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]]), [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]] came to work in the Netherlands as [[guest worker]]s. They were expected to return to their own country and many did, but others remained and in the 1970s and 1980s were joined by their families. Until 2004, when marriage immigration was restricted, their children usually married others from their home country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
# After 1974, people emigrated from the newly independent [[Suriname]] and from the [[Netherlands Antilles]], which remained part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. In 1974, about forty thousand Surinamese migrated while still retaining Dutch citizenship; between 1975 and 1980 there was a transitional arrangement allowing migration. Antilleans have the Dutch nationality and behave like typical labour migrants, travelling to and from the country in response to the employment available.
# During the 1970s and 1980s, the number of [[asylum seeker]]s was low, consisting e.g. of [[Chileans]] fleeing from political oppression and/or persecution. In the 1990s, asylum migration sharply increased,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/news/2015/05/substantial-increase-asylum-seekers |title=Substantial increase asylum seekers |last= |first= |date=29 January 2015 |website=cbs.nl |publisher= |access-date=6 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely consisting of [[Yugoslavs]], [[Somalis]], [[Iraqis]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] fleeing war or famine. Between 2000 and 2014 asylum migration strongly decreased due to the strict "Cohen Law". However, the [[Syrian Civil War]] of 2011 resulted in a large influx of Syrian asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016; about ninety thousand Syrians had been granted asylum by 2018.
# In the 2000s, migrant workers from the newly-joined EU member states in Central and [[Eastern Europe]], including: [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and non-EU states [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 2005, non-Western ethnic population comprised 1.7 million individuals, about 10% of the population in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scp.nl/Publicaties/Alle_publicaties/Publicaties_2005/Jaarrapport_Integratie_2005|title=Jaarrapport Integratie 2005 - SCP Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scp.nl|pages=1–3|language=nl|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017, persons with an immigration background, both western and non-western, formed a majority in Amsterdam (2011), Rotterdam (2013) and The Hague, the three largest cities of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&amp;PA=70748NED&amp;D1=0,2,4&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=5,15,24&amp;D5=l&amp;HDR=T&amp;STB=G4,G2,G1,G3&amp;VW=T|title=CBS|last=Statistiek|first=Centraal Bureau voor de|date=|website=Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the governmental ''Sociaal en Cultureel Planbureau'' in its annual report, noted recurring integration problems for ethnic minorities. While during the economic boom of the 1990s their unemployment and dependence on welfare had strongly decreased, the economic downturn between 2001 and 2004 disproportionally affected immigrant groups. This would be explained by their functioning as a labour reserve, by their lower educational levels and by lower language skills. The report also noted that per capita [[social interaction]]s between native Dutch and immigrant populations tended to decline over time, partly explainable by the size growth of immigrant groups. Integration levels strongly varied between groups. Surinamese and Antilleans were well economically integrated, but the latter less so culturally. Cultural integration was limited for Turks, but better for Moroccans. Of the asylum seekers, Somalis were among the least integrated into Dutch society, while Iranians were the best integrated with the highest education levels and modern lifestyles. Though the educational levels of the second generation were a significant improvement over those of the first generation, they still lagged behind the native Dutch who themselves on average had been attending ever higher school types. While half of all native Dutch pupils in 2005 proceeded to higher secondary education (HAVO and VWO), for Turks and Moroccans the share was a fifth and for Somali pupils even lower.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2007, non-Western groups were generally socio-economically disadvantaged and of the four largest non-Western groups, Turks and Moroccans were the most disadvantaged. In 2006 38.7% of Moroccans and 43.9% of Turks aged 15-64 were in employment, their unemployment rate was about four times the level of the native Dutch (17.2% for Moroccans and 15.1% for Turks), and 30% received some type of [[Welfare|social welfare]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After 2008, the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]] and the [[eurocrisis]] again hit immigrant groups particularly hard. In 2012, at 12% non-Western migrants were six times more likely than native Dutch to receive social welfare benefits, with 2% for the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scp.nl/english/Publications/Summaries_by_year/Summaries_2014/Annual_Integration_Report_2013|title=Annual Integration Report 2013 Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scp.nl|publisher=SCP|page=191|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 [[Statistics Netherlands|Statisics Netherlands]] report, the third generation of non-Western immigrants was predominantly young with 80% being younger than 15, while growing with 10% evey year. The third generation have a similar employment rate as the native Dutch and receive a similar amount of social benefits. The third non-Western generation follow adult education more frequently than both the native Dutch and non-Western immigrants. The non-Western immigrant population as a whole has 1.5 to 2 times the benefit dependence compared to the natives. The non-Western third generation had a rate slightly higher than the native Dutch as crime suspects, but lower than for non-Western immigrants as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Steven de Jong, "PVV-plan is prachtig.

According to Statistics Netherlands, nearly 53% of refugee households have a low income, six times the Netherlands average (8.2%).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Syrian and Eritrean househoulds the share is about 80%. At 33% the poverty risk is lowest among Iranian refugee households. The group of Syrian households at risk of poverty grew from ten thousand (76% of all Syrian households in 2016) to eighteen thousand (79% of all Syrian households) in 2018. Households of Polish, Romanian or Bulgarian origin have a greater than average risk of poverty even though households from these [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] countries generally depend on work for their income. Migrant workers from Eastern Europe generally perform low-skilled work while migrants fro [[Western Europe]] are often highly educated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Immigrants from foreign countries are divided into several ethnic groups. For example, there are both Russians and Chechenians from [[Russia]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] from [[Turkey]], [[Serbs]] and [[Albanians]] from [[Serbia]] and immigrants from [[Iran]] are divided into Persians, Azeris and Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}
The Netherlands has seen considerable emigration. In the 1950s 560,000{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} people migrated to the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]], leaving their war-torn and overpopulated home country behind. At least 60,000 of these migrants were [[Indo people|Indo-European]] (mixed Dutch-Indonesian) repatriants that moved on, mostly to the United States, after being repatriated to the Netherlands from the former [[Dutch East Indies]] during and after the Indonesian revolution.

In 2005 some 121,000 people migrated from the Netherlands. There is considerable migration towards neighbouring states, [[Belgium]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and to the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. Furthermore, almost half of the current emigration consists of people returning to their country of birth, including rejected [[asylum seekers]], after the more stringent migration laws were implemented.

== Religion ==
{{Main|Religion in the Netherlands}}
In 2013, [[Statistics Netherlands]] found that 26% of the population identified as Roman Catholic, 16% as Protestant, 5% as Muslim, and 6% as "other" (the last includes other Christian denominations, Hindus 0.6%, Jews 0.1%, and Buddhists 0.4%). The agency interviewed 355,237 people in the period 2010-2013.

'''''Dispatches''''' was a [[Canada|Canadian]] radio program, which aired on [[CBC Radio One]] from 2001 to 2012. The program, which was hosted by [[Rick MacInnes-Rae]], aired [[radio documentary|documentary]] reports on international news and feature topics.&lt;ref name=goodbye&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rick-macinnes-rae-says-goodbye-1.2711684 "Rick MacInnes-Rae says goodbye"]. [[CBC News]], July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening music was an excerpt from [[Mark Knopfler]]'s song "[[What It Is (Mark Knopfler song)|What It Is]]." 

Originally a half-hour program, the program expanded to a one-hour format in April 2007, incorporating some features of CBC Radio's cancelled [[world music]] series ''[[Global Village (radio show)|Global Village]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"CBC changes format of Radio Two". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2012, the CBC announced it would cancel the program as part of its budget cuts as a result of the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{About|Domestic violence in Bolivia|other related topics|Outline of domestic violence}}

[[Domestic violence]] in [[Bolivia]] is a pervasive and [[Crime statistics|underreported]] problem.&lt;ref name=report&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78881.htm Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Bolivia]. [[United States]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 6, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Center for the Information and Development of Women (CIDEM), 70 percent of women suffer some form of abuse.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; 

CIDEM noted that their 2006 statistics "did not reflect the full magnitude of the problem of violence against women" and that "a great number of women" did not report the aggression they faced on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; The most exhaustive national survey on domestic violence conducted by the National Statistical Institute in 2003 showed 64 percent of women were the target of some form of [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]], or [[sexual abuse]] from their partner.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

== Government action ==
In 2013, Bolivia passed a new comprehensive domestic violence law, which outlaws many forms of abuse of women, including [[marital rape]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ain-bolivia.org/2013/03/new-law-mandates-harsh-penalties-and-broad-services-to-address-violence-against-woman-in-bolivia/&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of November 26, 2006, the police Family Protection Brigade had attended to 8,954 cases, as compared to approximately 5,200 in 2005, and 3,640 were cases of repeat offenders. It was estimated that most cases of domestic violence went unreported.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

[[File:The Duchess of Richmond's Ball by Robert Alexander Hillingford.jpg|thumb|''The Duchess of Richmond's Ball'' by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]] (1870s)]]

The '''Duchess of Richmond's ball''' was a [[ball (dance)|ball]] hosted by [[Charlotte Lennox, Duchess of Richmond|Charlotte, Duchess of Richmond]] in [[Brussels]] on 15 June 1815, the night before the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]]. Charlotte's husband [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond]], was in command of a reserve force in Brussels, which was protecting that city in case [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded.

[[Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford|Elizabeth Longford]] described it as "the most famous ball in history".{{sfn|Hastings|1986|pp=230}} "The ball was certainly a brilliant affair",{{sfn|Bulloch|1902|p=42}} at which "with the exception of three generals, every officer high in [[Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign#Anglo-allied Army Order of Battle|[Wellington's] army]] was there to be seen".{{sfn|Arden|1898|loc=Letter}}

==The ball==
According to Lady Georgiana, a daughter of the Duchess,
{{cquote|My mother’s now famous ball took place in a large room on the ground-floor on the left of the entrance, connected with the rest of the house by an [[Antechamber|ante-room]]. It had been used by the coach-builder, from whom the house was hired, to put carriages in, but it was papered before we came there; and I recollect the paper—a trellis pattern with roses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip; At the ball supper I sat next to the [[Duke of Wellington]], when he gave me an original miniature of himself painted by a Belgian artist.&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;|||Georgiana, Dowager Lady De Ros{{sfn|Dowager Lady De Ros|2005}} }}

Lady Louisa, another of the Duchess's daughters, recalled:
{{cquote|I well remember the Gordon Highlanders dancing reels at the ball. My mother thought it would interest foreigners to see them,{{efn|Charlotte, Duchess of Richmond, was herself a Gordon: The eldest daughter of [[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Alexander, Duke of Gordon]] and Jane, the daughter of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet of Monreith.}} which it did. I remember hearing that some of the poor men who danced in our house died at Waterloo. There was quite a crowd to look at the Scotch dancers.|||Lady Louisa{{sfn|Bulloch|1902|p=42}}}}

While the exact order of the dances at this ball is not known, there is a comment from a contemporary critical observer about the season in Brussels:  
{{cquote|Whenever they get together the severest etiquette is present. The women on entering always salute on each side of the cheek; they then set [sic] down as stiff as waxworks. They begin a ball with a perfect [[Wiktionary:froideur|froideur]] they go on with their dangerous [[waltz]] (in which all the Englishwomen join) and finish with the [[Wiktionary:gallopade|gallopade]], a completely indecent and violent romp.|||Rev. George Griffin Stonestreet{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=67}}{{efn|Due to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] British society had been cut off from the fashions in the rest of Europe and with the end of hostilities in 1814, those who ventured to visit the European Continent were keen to assimilate the latest continental fashions including the new dances (if only not to appear staid and old-fashioned in continental society).{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=67}} Not everyone in Britain approved, and after the waltz was danced at the Prince Regent's court the following year [[The Times]] thundered in an editorial about "this obscene display" and warned "every parent against exposing their daughter to so fatal a contagion".{{sfn|Rust|2013|p=69}} }}
}}

[[File:Intelligence of the Battle of Ligny.jpg|thumb|''Intelligence of the Battle of Ligny'' (1818) by [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]], depicting a Prussian officer informing the Duke of Wellington that the French have crossed the border at Charleroi and that the Prussians would concentrate their army at Ligny]]
[[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] with his intimate staff arrived some time between 11 pm. and midnight.{{efn|Tim Clayton states Wellington must have arrived around 11 pm.,{{harv|Clayton|2014|p=76}} while Miller places the Duke's arrival around midnight {{harv|Miller|2005|p=67}}.}} Shortly before supper, which started around 1 am.,{{sfn|Clayton|2014|p=77}} Henry Weber, an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[William II of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]], arrived with a message for the Prince. The Prince handed it to Wellington, who pocketed it unopened. A short time later Wellington read the message—written at around 10 pm., it reported that Prussian forces had been forced by the French to retreat from [[Fleurus]]. As Fleurus is north-east of [[Charleroi]] this meant that the French had crossed the river [[Sambre]] (although Wellington couldn't tell from this message in what strength)— Wellington requested the Prince to return to his headquarters immediately, and then after issuing a few more orders went into supper, where he sat between Lady [[Frances Webster]] and Lady Georgiana. To his surprise the Prince of Orange returned and in a whisper informed him of another dispatch, this one sent by Baron [[Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque|Rebecque]] to the Prince's headquarters at [[Braine-le-Comte]], and dated 10:30 pm. It informed the Prince that the French had pushed up the main Charleroi to Brussels road nearly as far as [[Quatre Bras]].{{efn|This second dispatch provided some additional vital information for Wellington. The first was that as Fleurus was on a different main road out of Charleroi from that of Quatre Bras, this meant the French must have crossed the river Sambre in force. Secondly although Charleroi and Fleurus were [[picket (military)|picket]]ed by the Prussians, the area directly south of Quatre Bras was picketed by the Anglo-allies and this meant that units of his own command were now head-to-head with the French.}} After repeating to the Prince that he should return to his headquarters, Wellington continued to sit at the table and make small talk for 20 minutes more, before announcing that he would retire to bed. He rose from the supper-table and:{{sfn|Hastings|1986|pp=233–234}}
{{cquote|whispered to ask the Duke of Richmond if he had a good map. The Duke of Richmond said he had, and took Wellington into his dressing-room. Wellington shut the door and said, "Napoleon has humbugged me, by God; he has gained twenty-four hours' march on me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip; I have ordered the army to concentrate at Quatre Bras; but we shall not stop him there, and if so I must fight him &lt;u&gt;there&lt;/u&gt;" (passing his thumb-nail over the position of Waterloo). The conversation was repeated to me by the Duke of Richmond two minutes after it occurred.|||Captain Bowles&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|1896|loc=Chapter: "The inner history of the Waterloo Campaign"}} cites the ''Letters of the [[James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury|First Earl of Malmesbury]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|"In the course of the evening the duke asked my father for a map of the country and went into his study, which was on the same floor as the ball-room, to look at it. He put his finger on Waterloo, saying the battle would be fought there. My father marked the spot with his pencil, but alas! That map was lost or stolen for it never returned from Canada with his other possessions" {{harv|Dowager Lady De Ros|2005}}.}}
}}

The atmosphere in the room changed when news circulated among the guests that the French were crossing the border:
{{cquote|When the duke [of Wellington] arrived, rather late, at the ball, I was dancing, but at once went up to him to ask about the rumours. He said very gravely, "Yes, they are true; we are off to-morrow." This terrible news was circulated directly, and while some of the officers hurried away, others remained at the ball, and actually had not time to change their clothes, but fought in evening costume. I went with my [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond|eldest brother]] ([[Aide-de-camp|A.D.C]]. to the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]]) to his house, which stood in our garden, to help him to pack up, after which we returned to the ballroom, where we found some energetic and heartless young ladies still dancing. I heard afterwards that it had been said that "the Ladies Lennox were ''fine'', and did not do the honours of the ball well".&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;

It was a dreadful evening, taking leave of friends and acquaintances, many never to be seen again. The [[Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duke of Brunswick]], as he took leave of me in the ante-room adjoining the ball-room, made me a civil speech as to the Brunswickers being sure to distinguish themselves after "the honour" done them by my having accompanied the Duke of Wellington to their review! I remember being quite provoked with poor [[James Hay (soldier)|Lord Hay]], a dashing merry youth, full of military ardour, whom I knew very well for his delight at the idea of going into action, and of all the honours he was to gain; and the first news we had on the 16th was that he and the Duke of Brunswick were killed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;|||Georgiana, Dowager Lady De Ros{{sfn|Dowager Lady De Ros|2005}} }}

[[File:Henry-Nelson-O'Neil Before-Waterloo 1868.jpg|thumb|''Before Waterloo'' (1868), by [[Henry Nelson O'Neil|Henry O'Neil]], depicting officers departing from the Duchess of Richmond's ball]]
Katherine Arden daughter of [[Richard Arden, 1st Baron Alvanley|Richard Arden, 1st Lord Alvanley]] described the events towards the end of the ball and the rest of the night:
{{cquote|
&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;on our arrival at the ball we were told that the troops had orders to march at three in the morning, and that every officer must join his regiment by that time, as the French were advancing, you cannot possibly picture to yourself the dismay and consternation that appeared on every face. Those who had brothers and sons to be engaged openly gave way to their grief, as the last parting of many took place at this most terrible ball; others (and, thank Heaven, we ranked amongst that number, for in the midst of my greatest fears I still felt thankfulness was my prominent feeling that my beloved [[Richard Pepper Arden, 3rd Baron Alvanley|Dick]] was not here) who had no near relation yet felt that amongst the many friends we all had there it was impossible that all should escape, and that the next time we might hear of them they might be numbered with the dead; in fact, my dear aunt, I cannot describe to you mingled feelings; you will, however, I am sure, understand them, and I feel quite inadequate to express them. We stayed at this ball as short a time as we could, but long enough to see express after express arrive to the Duke of Wellington, to hear of aides-de-camp arriving breathless with news, and to see, what was more extraordinary than all, the Duke's equanimity a little discomposed.

We took a mournful farewell of some of our best friends, and returned home to anything but repose. The morning dawned most lovelily [sic], and before seven o'clock, we had seen 12,000 Brunswickers, Scotch and English pass before our windows, of whom one-third before the night were mingled with the dust. Mama took a farewell of Duke [of Wellington] as he passed by, but Fanny and myself, at last wearied out, had before he went, retired to bed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;
|||Katherine Arden{{sfn|Arden|1898|loc=Letter}} }}

==Ballroom==
[[File:Waterloo Ball v1.png|thumb|Floor plan by William brother of Lady de Ros]]
At the time of the ball no accurate record was kept of the location of the ballroom.
In 1887 a plan of the house was published by Lady De Ros (daughter of the Duchess of Richmond), provided by her brother, who were both resident in the house.  It was later reprinted in "Reminiscences of Lady de Ros" by the Honourable Mrs J. R. Swinton, her daughter.{{sfn|Dowager Lady De Ros|1889b|p={{page needed|date=January 2016}} }}

[[File:The Duchess of Richmond's ball (the coach-maker's depot).jpg|left|thumb|The coach house, proposed by [[Sir William Fraser]] in 1888 as the likely location of the ball]]
[[Sir William Fraser]] examined the site and concluded that the room proposed as the ballroom by Lady de Ros was too small a space for the number of people who attended the ball.{{sfn|Fraser|1902|pp=304–310}} A short time after his visit, he wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' which was published on 25 August 1888. He reported that he had likely discovered the room and that it was not part of the principal property that the Duke of Richmond had rented on the ''Rue des Cendres'', but was a coach house that backed onto the property and had an address in the next street, the ''Rue de la Blanchisserie''. The room had dimensions of {{convert|120|ft|m}} long, {{convert|54|ft|m}} broad, and about {{convert|13|ft|m}} high (the low ceiling was a case where reality impinged on one meaning of [[Lord Byron|Lord Byron's]] artistic allusion to "that high hall").{{sfn|Fraser|1902|pp=270–273}}&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron, ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'', Canto the Third, [[wikisource:Childe Harold's Pilgrimage/Canto the Third#XXIII.|stanza XXIII.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by lawyer P. Duvivier and published by Fleischman and Aerts in their 1956 book ''Bruxelles pendant la bataille de Waterloo'' put forward an alternative theory. It proposes that, unknown to Fraser, the coach house used as a ballroom had been demolished by the time of his investigations and that the building he assumed was the ballroom was not built until after 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wit|2014}} cites {{harvnb|Fleischman|Aerts|1956|pp=234–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural influences==
[[File:John Everett Millais The Black Brunswicker.jpg|thumb|''The Black Brunswicker'' by [[John Everett Millais|Millais]]]] 
The ball inspired a number of writers and artists in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Fraser|1902|p=272}} [[Sir Walter Scott]] mentioned it in passing in ''Paul's Letters  to his Kinsfolk''.{{sfn|Scott|1841|p=16}} It was described by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' and by [[Lord Byron]] in ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]''. Byron emphasises the contrast between the glamour of the ball and the horror of battle, concentrating on the emotional partings,
{{cquote|
:Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
:And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
:And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
:Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
:And there were sudden partings, such as press
:The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
:Which ne’er might be repeated; who could guess
:If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
:Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!|||Lord Byron, ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource]] has [[wikisource:Childe Harold's Pilgrimage/Canto the Third#XXIV.|the original text]] of this poem.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thackeray's dramatic use of the ball in ''Vanity Fair'' inspired, in turn, a number of screen depictions.  One notable example comes from the 1935 [[RKO]] production [[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]], the first full-length [[Technicolor]] film released after perfection of the full-color three-strip method,{{sfn|Hart|2010}}{{sfn|FM Staff|1934}} which makes the Duchess of Richmond's Ball the first historical set-piece ever staged in a full-colour feature film.{{sfn|Higgins|2007|p=48}} Critics of the day were not kind to the picture itself, but the sequence in which the officers hurry to leave the ball — the red of their coats suddenly and emotionally filling the frame — was widely praised as showing great promise for the dramatic use of colour on-screen.{{sfn|Higgins|2007|loc=Chapter 3}}

The ball also inspired artists, including [[John Everett Millais]], who painted ''[[The Black Brunswicker]]'' in 1860, [[Henry Nelson O'Neil]] who painted ''Before Waterloo'' in 1868 and [[Robert Alexander Hillingford|Robert Hillingford]] who painted ''The Duchess of Richmond's Ball''.{{sfn|''Royal Armouries''|2015}}

The ball was a scene in the third act of a melodrama called ''In the Days of the Duke'' written by [[Charles Haddon Chambers]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]], it was displayed sumptuously in the 1897 production, with a backdrop by William Harford showing the hall and staircase inside the Duchess's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulloch|1902|p=43}}; {{harvnb|''New York Times''|1897|p=7}}; and {{harvnb|''Eastern Michigan University''|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several characters attend the ball in [[Georgette Heyer]]'s 1937 novel ''[[An Infamous Army]]'', and also in her novelisation of the life of [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet]], ''[[The Spanish Bride]]''.
[[File:Summoned to Waterloo, Brussels, dawn of June 16, 1815 by Robert Alexander Hillingford (1898).jpg|thumb|left|''Summoned to Waterloo: Brussels, dawn of June 16, 1815'' by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]]]]
The ball was used by [[Sergei Bondarchuk]] in his 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' for dramatic effect. Bondarchuk contrasted an army at peace with the impending battle and in particular as a dramatic backdrop to show how completely Napoleon managed to "humbug" Wellington.

In the novel ''[[Sharpe's Waterloo (novel)|Sharpe's Waterloo]]'' (1990), [[Bernard Cornwell]] uses the ball in a similar way to Bondarchuk, placing his character [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]] in the role of the aide who brings the catastrophic news to Wellington, but includes a sub-plot where Sharpe brawls with [[Lord John Rossendale]], Sharpe's wife's lover and a man who owes Sharpe money.

A fictional account is given of the Duchess of Richmond's ball in ''The Campaigners'', Volume 14 of [[The Morland Dynasty]], a series of historical novels by author [[Cynthia Harrod-Eagles]].  Some of the fictional Morland family and other characters attend the ball and the events that unfold are seen and experienced through their eyes.

The ball serves as the backdrop for the first chapter of [[Julian Fellowes|Julian Fellowes's]] 2016 novel, Belgravia.  The chapter is titled, "Dancing into Battle," and portrays a potential mésalliance that is avoided the next day by a battlefield fatality at Quatre Bras.  Fellowes incorporates into his book actual occurrences at the ball, and inserts a fictional protagonist, James Trenchard, into the famous private conversation between the Duke of Richmond and the Duke of Wellington.  This actual conversation prompts a premature end of the ball, and in the resulting confusion, there is a misunderstanding that Fellowes plays with throughout the remainder of the book.

[[File:Bal de Waterloo.JPG|thumb|Descendants of guests at the original ball, participating in the Bicentennial Ball in 2015]]
On 15 June 1965 the British Ambassador in Brussels held a ball to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo and the Duchess of Richmond's ball. 540 guests attended the function of whom the majority were Belgians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|''Hansard''|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commemoration ball  has now become an annual event with the money raised going to support several charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robinson|2011}}; and {{harvnb|Committee of the Duchess of Richmond Ball|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Emerillon''' (or '''Emerilon''', '''Emerion''', '''Mereo''', '''Melejo''', '''Mereyo''', '''Teco''') - now called Teko, using their own denomination - are a [[Tupi–Guarani languages|Tupi–Guarani]]-speaking people in [[French Guiana]] living on the banks of the [[Camopi]] and [[Tampok]] rivers. Their subsistence is based on [[horticulture]], [[hunting]] and various [[fishing]] techniques. As of 2001 they numbered about 400 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Møhl, Perle (2012). "Omens and Effect: Divergent Perspectives on Emerillon Time, Space and Existence". France: Semeion Editions. {{ISBN|979-10-90448-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Emerillon constitute one of the six now-living ethnic groups of French Guiana already present before colonization. More [[nomadic]] than the other ethnic groups of the area, the Emerillon resided on different rivers in French Guiana during the colonial period, notably on the Approuague and, more recently, they settled within the surroundings of the [[Maroni River]] and the [[Camopi River]]. Their villages, usually located at a distance from the rivers for protection from raids, were moved frequently due to soil exhaustion, warfare, and several customary reasons, like the death of an inhabitant. Internal warfare was common and the members of the tribe practiced [[cannibalism]] as a means of revenge and of recuperating their enemies' forces.

The Emerillons' first contact with the Europeans occurred in the 18th century, when the number of male warriors were estimated at 400 - meaning that the group in its entirety was estimated to number around 1200. They were harassed by the [[Galibi|Galibi Indians]] who captured women and children and sold them as [[slaves]] in [[Surinam]]. By the 19th century internal and intertribal warfare had weakened the Emerillon to the point of being collective [[slaves]] to the [[Wayampi]]. This, along with the epidemics brought in by the gold prospectors, greatly reduced their numbers. By the late 1960s, when the prospectors left the area, the Emerillon were in a poor state of health. But due to general health improvements and various demographic strategies, they have since grown to the number of approximately 400.

The '''Fredrika Bremer Association''' ({{lang-sv|Fredrika-Bremer-Förbundet}}, abbreviated '''FBF''') is the oldest [[women's rights]] organisation in [[Sweden]]. It is a member of the [[International Alliance of Women]], which has [[general consultative status]] with the [[United Nations]].

==Activity==
The FBF works with forming public opinion in favor of gender equality by information and activities, and by handing out money from various funds and scholarships. It collaborates with other organisations with similar goals both nationally and internationally. The FBF had a representative in the governmental council of equality.

==History==
The organisation was founded in 1884 by a group largely consisting of the board of the [[women's magazine]] ''[[Home Review]]''. It consisted of the feminist [[Sophie Adlersparre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lars G. Warme|title=A History of Swedish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3JjeZz-OiwC&amp;pg=PA481|accessdate=12 August 2015|year=1996|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-4750-8|page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellen Anckarsvärd]], 
[[Fredrika Limnell]], [[Ellen Fries]], [[Hans Hildebrand]] and G. Sjöberg.&lt;ref&gt;Nya Stockholm. 624. (1890) [MARC] Author: Claës Lundin&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in honor of the [[Swedish literature|Swedish novelist]] [[Fredrika Bremer]], whose novel [[Hertha (novel)|''Hertha'']] was responsible for the legislation [[legal majority|emancipating]] unmarried women from wardship of their male relatives. It also led to the foundation of ''[[Göteborgs Kvinnoförening]]'' in Sweden's second city of Gothenburg, which was founded as a local answer to the FBF.

The purpose of the organisation was to support women's rights, to inform women of their rights and to encourage them to use them. At the time of its foundation, for example, the focus was to inform women of their rights to serve in the boards of public institutions, and of the rights of women of a certain income to vote in municipal elections and to use those rights.&lt;ref name=cla&gt;Claës Lundin: ''[http://runeberg.org/nyasthlm/0642.html Nya Stockholm]'' (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, the office of the organisation in Stockholm functioned as an employment agency for women of the middle classes, and offered juridical, economical and medical information and advice to women.&lt;ref name=cla/&gt; It was also noted at that time, that many women came there to be informed of the movement for [[women suffrage]].&lt;ref name=cla/&gt; In 1899, a delegation from the FBF presented a suggestion of woman suffrage to prime minister [[Erik Gustaf Boström]]. The delegation was headed by [[Agda Montelius]], accompanied by [[Gertrud Adelborg]], who had written the demand. This was the first time the Swedish women's movement themselves had officially presented a demand for suffrage.

In 1896, the [[Married Woman Property Association]] was merged in the association.

==Publications==
The FBF published the [[women's magazine]] ''[[Dagny (magazine)|Dagny]]'', which succeeded Adlersparre's ''[[Home Review]]'' in 1886. This publication was renamed ''[[Hertha (magazine)|Hertha]]'' in 1914 and was the oldest women's magazine in the world when it was discontinued in the late 1990s.

'''Gender studies''' is a [[Field of study|field]] for [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study devoted to [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], gender, and politics), [[men's studies]] and [[queer studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |title=Gender Studies |publisher=Whitman College |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

These disciplines study [[gender]] and sexuality in the fields of [[literature]], language, [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Film theory|cinema]], [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender And Media: Representing, Producing, Consuming |last1=Krijnen |first1=Tonny |last2=van Bauwel |first2=Sofie |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-69540-4 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; human development, law, public health and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ | title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) | publisher=[[The University of Chicago]] | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also analyzes how [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[Location (geography)|location]], [[Class (social)|class]], [[nationality]], and [[disability]] intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Race, Ethnicity, Gender &amp; Class"&gt;Healey, J. F. (2003). ''Race, Ethnicity, Gender and Class: the Sociology of Group Conflict and Change''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/ | title=Department of Gender Studies | publisher=[[Indiana University]] (IU Bloomington) | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding gender, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref name="de Beauvoir"&gt;de Beauvoir, S. (1949, 1989). "The Second Sex".&lt;/ref&gt; This view proposes that in gender studies, the term "gender" should be used to refer to the [[social constructionism|social and cultural constructions]] of masculinities and femininities and not to the state of being male or female in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Stephanie Garrett"&gt;Garrett, S. (1992). "Gender", p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not held by all gender theorists. Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see [[Sociology of gender]]), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]] and feminists such as [[Judith Butler]].

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as [[literary theory]], drama studies, [[film theory]], [[performativity|performance theory]], contemporary [[art history]], anthropology, sociology, [[sociolinguistics]] and [[psychology]]. However, these disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. For instance in anthropology, sociology and psychology, gender is often studied as a practice, whereas in cultural studies representations of gender are more often examined. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. ''Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |authorlink1=Philomena Essed |last2=Goldberg |first2=David Theo |authorlink2=David Theo Goldberg |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey |authorlink3=Audrey Kobayashi |title=A Companion to Gender Studies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZPgYDTa9P84C |accessdate=7 November 2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-8808-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each field came to regard "gender" as a practice, sometimes referred to as something that is [[Performative utterance|performative]].&lt;ref name = "performativity of gender"/&gt; [[Feminist theory]] of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Smith, ''Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable'' (Pluto Press, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; (the "semiotic" and "abjection") and [[Bracha L.

According to Sam Killermann, Gender can also be broken into three categories, gender identity, gender expression, and biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE|title=Understanding the Complexities of Gender: Sam Killermann at TEDxUofIChicago|date=3 May 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories are another way of breaking down gender into the different social, biological, and cultural constructions. These constructions focus on how femininity and masculinity are fluid entities and how their meaning is able to fluctuate depending on the various constraints surrounding them.

==Influences==

===Psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory. Among these are [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], and Mark Blechner.

Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are "mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis" (in Freud's terms a "deformity").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Horney | first = Karen | contribution = On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women (1922) | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = J. B. | title = Psychoanalysis and Women | location = New York | publisher = Bruner/Mazel | year = 1973 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the "phallic" organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is "supplementary" and not opposite or complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacan | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Lacan | title = Encore | publisher = Seuil | location = Paris | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, is useful in countering the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. In other words, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = E. | title = Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Other influences include [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Mark Blechner]]. --&gt;Julia Kristeva has significantly developed the field of [[semiotics]]. She contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being.&lt;ref name="Kristeva Abject"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kristeva | first = Julia | author-link = Julia Kristeva | title = Powers of Horror | year = 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Blechner expanded psychoanalytic views of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner| title = Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis | location = New York and London | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that there is a "gender fetish" in western society, in which the gender of sexual partners is given enormously disproportionate attention over other factors involved in sexual attraction, such as age and social class.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | contribution = The shaping of psychoanalytic theory and practice by cultural and personal biases about sexuality | editor-last1 = Domenici | editor-first1 = T. | editor-last2 = Lesser | editor-first2 = R. | title = Disorienting Sexuality | pages = 265–288 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bracha L. Ettinger]] transformed subjectivity in contemporary psychoanalysis since the early 1990s with the Matrixial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L. Ettinger | title = Matrix and metramorphosis | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 176–208 | date = 1992 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; feminine-maternal and prematernal Eros&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of borderlinking (bordureliance), borderspacing (bordurespacement) and co-emergence.

Ettinger rethinks the human subject as informed by the archaic connectivity to the maternal and proposes the idea of a Demeter-Persephone Complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mdkbYsjlMA8|Public lecture at EGS (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can have very different norms of maleness and [[masculinity]]. Blechner identifies the terror, in Western males, of penetration. Yet in many societies, being gay is defined only by being a male who lets himself be penetrated. Males who penetrate other males are considered masculine and not gay and are not the targets of prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blechner | first = Mark J. | author-link = Mark Blechner | title = Maleness and masculinity | journal = [[Contemporary Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 597–613 | doi = 10.1080/00107530.1998.10747024 | date = 1998 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cultures, however, receptive [[fellatio]] is the norm for early adolescence and seen as a requirement for developing normal manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herdt | first = G. | title = Guardians of the Flute | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], Bracha L. Ettinger, [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive | publisher = Routledge | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luce Irigaray]] and Jane Flax have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being [[censored]]). [[Shulamith Firestone]], in "The Dialectic of Sex" calls Freudianism the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is ''almost'' completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power".

Critics such as [[Elizabeth Grosz]] accuse [[Jacques Lacan]] of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name ="Grosz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grosz | first = Elizabeth | author-link = Elizabeth Grosz| title = Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Judith Butler]], Bracha L. Ettinger and [[Jane Gallop]] have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender theory.&lt;ref name="Gender Trouble"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettinger"&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L.

According to J. B. Marchand, "The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chaudoye | first1 = Guillemine | last2 = Cupa | first2 = Dominique | last3 = Parat | first3 = Hélène | contribution = Judith Butler | editor-last1 = Chaudoye | editor-first1 = Guillemine | editor-last2 = Cupa | editor-first2 = Dominique | editor-last3 = Parat | editor-first3 = Hélène | title = Le Sexuel, ses différences et ses genres | publisher = EDK Editions | location = Paris | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], gender studies (and activists of sexual minorities) "besieged" and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as "the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], Armand Abécassis, Alain Houziaux, ''La psychanalyse peut-elle guérir?'' Paris: Éditions de l'Atelier, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]]'s worries about the psychoanalytic outlook under which sexual difference is "undeniable" and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = Judith | last2 = Fassin | first2 = Éric | last3 = Wallach Scott | first3 = Joan | author-link1 = Judith Butler | author-link2 = Éric Fassin | author-link3 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Pour ne pas en finir avec le 'genre'... table ronde | trans-title = For more on 'gender'... round table | journal = Sociétés &amp; Représentations, Special Issue: Investigating Gender | volume = 2 | issue = 24 | pages = 285–306 | doi = 10.3917/sr.024.0285 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies "often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beaune | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Rea | first2 = Caterina | title = Psychanalyse sans Œdipe: Antigone, genre et subversion | page = 78 | publisher = L'Harmattan | location = Paris | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented French feminism focused on visual and literary theory all along. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s legacy as well as "[[Adrienne Rich]]'s call for women's revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Mica Howe &amp; Sarah A. Aguier (eds). ''He said, She Says''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] and other feminists have articulated Myth and poetry&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"&gt;Vanda Zajko &amp; [[Miriam Leonard]] (eds). ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''.

Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of [[post-modernism]] theories affected gender studies,&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"/&gt; causing a movement in [[Gender identity|identity theories]] away from the concept of fixed or [[essentialism|essentialist]] gender identity, to [[Postmodernity#Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory|post-modern]]&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, M. (2007). ''Gender After Lyotard''. NY: SUNY Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; fluid&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Ayelet (ed.), ''PostGender''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple identities.&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib, S. (1995). "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange", and Butler, J. (1995), "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange".&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of post-structuralism, and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenging of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of [[queer theory]] in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderandsexuality.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Gender and Sexuality Studies – New York University|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward [[hegemonic masculinity|masculinity studies]], due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as [[R. W. Connell]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and E. Anthony Rotundo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Manhood: Transformations In Masculinity From The Revolution To The Modern Era|author= E. Anthony Rotundo|isbn= 9780465001699|date= 1994-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygoodloe.com/papers/lesbian-feminism-and-queer-theory-another-battle-of-the-sexes/|title=Lesbian-Feminism and Queer Theory: Another "Battle of the Sexes"?|work=amygoodloe.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is [[social construction|socially constructed]] does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==Development of theory==

===History===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," American Historical Review 91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the universal suffrage revolution of the twentieth century, the [[women's liberation movement]] of the 1960 and 1970s promoted a revision from the feminists to "actively interrogate" the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women's and men's attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. Handbook of the Sociology of Gender. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called "men's studies".&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"&gt;Douglas, Fedwa. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender''. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=HISTORY, FEMINISM AND GENDER STUDIES|url=http://www.jliddington.org.uk/cig1.html|publisher=University of Leeds Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies: Working Paper 1 Feminist Scholarship: within/across/between/beyond the disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of drivers' propensity to use traffic information system showed that income and car ownership play an important role in travel behavior for men, while education and occupation were identified significant in the women's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women's and Men's Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015|doi=10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although doctoral programs for women's studies have existed since 1990, the first doctoral program for a potential PhD in gender studies in the United States was approved in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/10/gender |title=Indiana Creates First Gender Studies PhD |date=10 November 2005 |first=Scott |last=Jaschik |quote=The last decade has seen the number of women's studies PhD programs grow to at least 10 – most of them relatively new.

In 2015, [[Kabul University]] became the first university in Afghanistan to offer a master's degree course in gender and women's studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FaithWorld |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2015/10/26/kabul-university-unlikely-host-for-first-afghan-womens-studies-programme/ |title=Kabul University unlikely host for first Afghan women's studies programme |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date=26 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's studies===
{{Main|Women's studies}}
Women's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes [[feminist theory]], [[women's history]] (e.g. a history of [[women's suffrage]]) and [[social history]], [[women's fiction]], [[women's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the [[feminist]] and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

===Men's studies===
{{Main|Men's studies}}
Men's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes feminist theory, men's history and [[social history]], men's fiction, [[men's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody suggest that there 'have always been dangers present in the institutionalisation of "masculinity studies" as a semi-gated community', and note that 'a certain triumphalism vis-à-vis feminist philosophy haunts much masculinities research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurie |first1=Timothy |last2=Hickey-Moody |first2=Anna |year=2015 |title=Geophilosophies of Masculinity: Remapping Gender, Aesthetics and Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912564 |format=PDF |journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender in Asia===
{{See also|Women in Asia}}

Certain issues associated with gender in [[Eastern Asia]] and the [[Pacific Region]] are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, "gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The World Bank. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html "Gender in East Asia and Pacific"], Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and some provinces in more remote locations, "women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the "growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women's voice is often weakest and where even the women's civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

East Asia Pacific's approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html#EAP_approach | website = The World Bank | title = Gender in East Asia and Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for peace, renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], as well as the [[Philippines]], and efforts are starting to be made in [[Laos]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Timor Leste]] as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Judith Butler===
{{Main|Judith Butler}}

The concept of gender performativity is at the core of philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's work ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. In Butler's terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She locates the [[Social constructivism|construction]] of the "gendered, sexed, desiring subject" in "regulative discourses". A part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UczySqq19AIC|title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex|last=Butler|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Butler|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136807183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | pages = 163–71, 177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies' current reliance on [[post-structuralism]] – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Palmer, "Descent into Discourse: The Reification of Language and the Writing of Social History", Trent University (Peterborough, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge propose in the book ''Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies'' that the attempt to make women's studies serve a political agenda has led to problematic results such as dubious scholarship and pedagogical practices that resemble indoctrination more than education.

[[Rosi Braidotti]] (1994) has criticized gender studies as "the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases... of positions advertised as 'gender studies' being given away to the 'bright boys'. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Feminism by any other name (Judith Butler interviews Rosi Braidotti) | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 44–45 | date = Summer 1994 | url = https://bagelabyss.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/butler-and-braidotti-interview-feminism-by-any-other-name1.pdf | format = pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Thomas countered that, "as Joseph Allen Boone points out, 'many of the men in the academy who are feminism's most supportive 'allies' ''are'' gay,'" and that it is "disingenuous" to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Calvin, ed., "Introduction: Identification, Appropriation, Proliferation", ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''. University of Illinois Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender studies, and more particularly queer studies within gender studies, were repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=John |last=Newsome |title=Pope warns of 'ideological colonization' in transgender teachings |work=CNN |date=October 4, 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/world/pope-transgender-comments/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant that "gender ideology" threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when Catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] has shown that this fear has deep historical roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruno Perreau]], ''[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response]'', Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the rejection of gender studies and queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics.

Teaching certain aspects of gender theory was banned in public schools [[New South Wales]] after an independent review into how the state teaches sex and health education and the controversial material included in the teaching materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Urban|first1=Rebecca|title=Gender theory banned in NSW classrooms|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/gender-theory-banned-in-nsw-classrooms/news-story/eeb40f3264394798ebe67260fa2f5782|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|date=February 9, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/5TEdW|archive-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State and governmental attitudes to gender studies ===
In Central and Eastern Europe ‘anti-gender’ movements are on the rise, especially, in Hungary, Poland, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-global/how-hungary-and-poland-ha_b_12486148.html|title=How Hungary and Poland have silenced women and stifled human rights|last=Global|first=The Conversation|date=2016-10-14|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Anti-Gender Movements on the Rise?|url=https://pl.boell.org/sites/default/files/anti-gender-movements-on-the-rise.pdf|journal=Publication Series on Democracy|volume=38|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
In Russia gender studies are at the moment tolerated, however state support practices that pushes gender agenda related to perspectives on gender of those in power – e.g. law solving in detail specifics of domestic violence was abolished in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/09/putins-war-on-women/|title=Putin's War on Women|last=Ferris-Rotman|first=Amie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010 the Russia has also been leading a campaign at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] to recognise so-called ‘traditional values’ as a legitimate consideration in human rights protection and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2018/01/15/traditional-values-for-the-99-the-new-gender-ideology-in-russia/|title=‘Traditional values’ for the 99%?

==== Hungary ====
Gender studies programs were banned in Hungary in October 2018. In a statement released by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's office, a spokesperson stated that "The government's standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes." The ban has attracted criticism from several European universities which offer the program, among them the Budapest-based Central European University, whose charter was revoked by the government, and is widely seen as part of the Hungarian ruling party's move towards totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-bans-gender-studies-programmes-viktor-orban-central-european-university-budapest-a8599796.html|title=Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban bans gender studies programmes|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|date=2018-10-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
[[Central People's Government|The Central People's Government]] supports studies of gender and social development of gender in history and practices that lead to gender equality. Citing [[Mao Zedong]]'s philosophy, "Women hold up half the sky", this may be seen as continuation of equality of men and women introduced as part of [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/china-voices-lu-ying|title=China voices: the professor of gender studies|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2009-05-20|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Croatia]], there are over 2,900 people who consider themselves German, most of these [[Danube Swabians]]. Germans are officially recognized as an autochthonous national minority, and as such, they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]], shared with members of eleven other national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are mainly concentrated in the area around [[Osijek]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Esseg'') in eastern [[Slavonia]]. 

==Ethnology==

The community traditionally inhabited northern Croatia and [[Slavonia]].  In the Early modern period they had settled from other territories in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], and in what is today Croatia mainly settled territories of the [[Military Frontier]].{{sfn|Oberkersch}} The [[Danube Swabians]] that inhabited Western Slavonia were subject to strong [[Croatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Institutul de Istorie "A.D.

These hard-working and thrifty peasants, colonized there in XVIII century, were exposed to ruthless Magyarization since 1870s and as a result held predominantly Hungarian sympathies. Their extension in the western region of Slavonia (which used to belong to the autonomous kingdom of Croatia within Hungary) was in turn subject to strong Croatization.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian intelligentsia only acknowledged a German minority in 1865.{{sfn|Oberkersch}}

==History==
[[File:Ethnic Germans in Hungary and parts of adjacent Austrian territories.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ethnic Germans in Austro-Hungarian lands, 1890 census]]
With the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], the Germans of Croatia became a minority. In 1920, Germans established the cultural association ''Kulturbund''. Kulturbund was banned on April 11, 1924 by Minister of the Interior [[Svetozar Pribićević]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Janjetović. [http://www.drustvosns.org/nemacka%20manjina/janjetovic/Z.%20Janjetovic,%20The%20Ethnic-Germans%20in%20Political%20Life%20of%20Yugoslavia%201918-1941.pdf The ethnic Germans in the political life of Yugoslavia (1918-1941)]&lt;/ref&gt; The following government of Ljuba Davidović and the Democratic Party saw the ban lifted.

In 1922, they formed the [[German Party (Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes)|German Party]] (''Partei der Deutschen'').&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Geiger. [http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/hr/7943.pdf Njemačka manjina u Kraljevini Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca/Jugoslaviji (1918.-1941.)]&lt;/ref&gt; The party existed until it was banned as part of King Alexander's dictatorship in 1929. 

The Croatian German population reached a peak number of 85,781 in the 1900 census, while this number plummeted after the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|German exodus]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/31818 Emigration of Italians and Germans from Croatia during and immediately after the Second World War]&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, 100,000 Yugoslav Germans fled to [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="Geiger"&gt;Vladimir Geiger, ''[http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/31507 Povratak slavonskih Nijemaca nakon Drugoga svjetskog rata iz izbjeglištva / prognaništva u zavičaj i njihova sudbina]''&lt;/ref&gt; This population was not dealt with in the [[Potsdam Agreement]] which prevented them from being repatriated to [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Geiger"/&gt; The Allies considered them Yugoslavian citizens and sought their repatriation there.&lt;ref name="Geiger"/&gt; However, on June 4 the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] released a decree that rescinded the citizenship of Yugoslavian Germans.&lt;ref name="Geiger"/&gt; Their property was henceforth confiscated, and the majority settled in Germany and Austria. Some managed to return to Yugoslavia and returned to their homes.&lt;ref name="Geiger"/&gt;

The historically predominantly German town of Čeminac built the parish Church of Sacred Heart of Christ in 1906-1907.&lt;ref name="Franc"&gt;[http://www.hd-osijek.hr/bastina_1.htm Sacral heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; The German population in the town was forced to leave in 1945. After democratic changes in Croatia in 1990, former inhabitants of the town, mostly living in [[Germany]], repaired the church. However, on April 10, 1992 the church was burnt by Serb forces as part of the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Franc"/&gt; In 2001, various levels of the Croatian government contributed to its repairs, which were carried out by 2005.&lt;ref name="Franc"/&gt;

In 1996, Croatia and Germany signed an agreement to facilitate the marking of German graves from the World Wars in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.mvp.hr/?mh=160&amp;mv=925 Zbirka međunarodnih ugovora]&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[German War Graves Commission|German military cemeteries]] in [[Pula]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/98/06/27/rh_hrv.html KRATKE VIJESTI IZ HRVATSKE], [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the [[Croatian government]] passed a comprehensive law on the return of nationalized Austrian property to its rightful owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/21925/ |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |title=Diplomate razbjesnio povrat imovine Austrijancima |language=Croatian |trans-title=Diplomats angered by restoration of property to Austrians |author=Eduard Šoštarić |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |archivedate=30 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68odeL3yL?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/21925/diplomate-razbjesnio-povrat-imovine-austrijancima |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
The Germans and Austrians have created the Society of Germans and Austrians of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=135&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=281&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=134&amp;cHash=b2aa6fea8d Austrians in Croatia], [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a German culture centre in Osijek, and a small number of German schools in the area.

Since the fall of communism and Croatian independence, the minority has held an annual academic conference titled ''Germans and Austrians in the Croatian cultural circle''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osijek031.com/osijek.php?topic_id=16067 16.

'''The Longwood Medical and Academic Area''' (also known as '''Longwood Medical Area''', '''LMA''', or simply '''Longwood''') is a medical campus in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  Flanking Longwood Avenue, as it runs from [[Huntington Avenue]] to The Riverway, LMA is adjacent to the [[Fenway–Kenmore]], Audubon Circle, and [[Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts|Mission Hill]] neighborhoods, and the town of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Longwood Medical and Academic Area (LMA) Fact Sheet|url=http://www.masco.org/sites/default/files/downloads/thelma/lmafactsheet2012.pdf|publisher=MASCO Area Planning and Development|accessdate=1 December 2014|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is most strongly associated with the [[Harvard Medical School]], the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], the [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]] and other medical facilities such as Harvard's teaching hospitals, but prominent non-Harvard institutions are located there as well, such as [[Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]], museums, liberal arts colleges, and research centers.

The Harvard Medical Schools central Quadrangle was designed by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]].

==Transportation==
LMA is served by two rail stations at opposite ends of Longwood Avenue:
"[[Longwood (MBTA station)|Longwood]]" (on the [[MBTA]] Green Line's "D" branch) and
"[[Longwood Medical Area (MBTA station)|Longwood Medical Area]]"  (on the "E" branch).
Several public bus routes serve the area and commuter rail service is available at nearby [[Ruggles_(MBTA station)|Ruggles Station]]. MASCO offers shuttle buses (generally for affiliated personnel only) around the Longwood Medical Area and between Harvard's Cambridge Campus and the Medical Campus (M2). The M2 shuttle is free for passengers holding a Harvard ID, and tickets can be purchased at [http://www.masco.org/directions/m2-cambridge-harvard-shuttle#Fare multiple locations].

'''Malthusianism''' is the idea that [[Malthusian growth model|population growth is potentially exponential]] while the growth of the food supply is linear. It derives from the political and economic thought of the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], as laid out in his 1798 writings, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''. Malthus believed there were two types of "checks" that in all times and places kept population growth in line with the growth of the food supply: "preventive checks", such as moral restraints ([[abstinence]], [[marriage|delayed marriage]] until finances become balanced), and restricting marriage against persons suffering poverty or perceived as defective, and "positive checks", which lead to premature death such as disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. The catastrophe would return population to a lower, more "sustainable", level.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrons&gt;{{cite book |title=Barrons AP Human Geography 2008 Edition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=u374siQOPTgC&amp;q=malthusian#v=snippet&amp;q=malthusian&amp;f=false |editor=Meredith Marsh, Peter S. Alagona |year=2008 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |isbn=978-0-7641-3817-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malthusianism has been linked to a variety of political and social movements, but almost always refers to advocates of population control.&lt;ref name="Dolan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Malthus, Medicine &amp; Morality: Malthusianism after 1798 |author=Dolan, Brian |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2znzI0_nzXcC&amp;lpg |isbn=978-90-420-0851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-Malthusianism''' is the advocacy of [[human population planning| population control]] programs to ensure resources for current and future populations.&lt;ref name="Barrons" /&gt; In Britain the term 'Malthusian' can also refer more specifically to arguments made in favour of preventive birth control, hence organizations such as the [[Malthusian League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Malthusian Mutations: The changing politics and moral meanings of birth control in Britain |author=Hall, Lesley |year= |publisher=Rodopi |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2znzI0_nzXcC&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=malthusian%20league&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= |location=Dolan (2000), ''Malthus, Medicine &amp; Morality: Malthusianism after 1798'', p. 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Malthusians differ from Malthus's theories mainly in their enthusiasm for [[contraception]]. Malthus, a devout Christian, believed that "self-control" (abstinence) was preferable to artificial birth control. In some editions of his essay, Malthus did allow that abstinence was unlikely to be effective on a wide scale, thus advocating the use of artificial means of birth control as a solution to population "pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Veer, Udai |title=Modern Teaching of Population Education |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8C8DCpTHE-MC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=neo-malthusianism&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD |isbn=978-81-261-1878-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern "neo-Malthusians" are generally more concerned than Malthus was with environmental degradation and catastrophic famine than with poverty.

Malthusianism has attracted criticism from a diverse range of differing schools of thought, including [[Marxists]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite book|title=Marx and Engels on the Population Bomb |editor=Ronald L.

Malthus was not the first to outline the problems he perceived. The original essay was part of an ongoing intellectual discussion at the end of the 18th century regarding the origins of [[poverty]]. ''Principle of Population'' was specifically written as a rebuttal to thinkers like [[William Godwin]] and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], and Malthus's own father who believed in the perfectibility of humanity. Malthus believed humanity's ability to reproduce too rapidly doomed efforts at perfection and caused various other problems.

His criticism of the working class's tendency to reproduce rapidly, and his belief that this, rather than exploitation by capitalists, led to their poverty, brought widespread criticism of his theory.&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=From Malthus to the Club of Rome and Back |last= Neurath |first=Paul |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1994 |publisher= M.E. Sharpe|location= |isbn= 9781563244070 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZHx3GO_xLMC&amp;lpg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthusians perceived ideas of charity to the poor, typified by [[Tory]] [[paternalism]], were futile, as these would only result in increased numbers of the poor; these theories played into [[British Whig Party|Whig]] economic ideas exemplified by the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834]]. The Act was described by opponents as "a Malthusian bill designed to force the poor to emigrate, to work for lower wages, to live on a coarser sort of food",&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian J. Desmond]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7LeJ4i0-vAC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=%22malthusian+bill+designed+to+force+the+poor+to+emigrate+to+work+for+lower+wages+to+live+on+a+coarser+sort+of+food%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=eLmHyjwJv1&amp;sig=zFsubZrx0Mz-V8KNEaBipsEJZIY ''The Politics of Evolution: Morphology, Medicine, and Reform in Radical London''], University of Chicago Press, 1989, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; which initiated the construction of [[workhouse]]s despite riots and arson.

Malthus revised his theories in later editions of ''An Essay on the Principles of Population'', taking a more optimistic tone, although there is some scholarly debate on the extent of his revisions.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt; According to Dan Ritschel of the Center for History Education at the University of Maryland, &lt;blockquote&gt;The great Malthusian dread was that "indiscriminate charity" would lead to exponential growth in the population in poverty, increased charges to the public purse to support this growing army of the dependent, and, eventually, the catastrophe of [[national bankruptcy]]. Though Malthusianism has since come to be identified with the issue of general over-population, the original Malthusian concern was more specifically with the fear of over-population by the dependent poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umbc.edu/history/CHE/InstPg/RitDop/Discovery-of-poverty-Malthusianism.htm UMBC.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621105033/http://www.umbc.edu/history/CHE/InstPg/RitDop/Discovery-of-poverty-Malthusianism.htm |date=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the earliest critics was [[David Ricardo]]. Malthus immediately and correctly recognised it to be an attack on his theory of wages. Ricardo and Malthus debated this in a lengthy personal correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/159 ''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo''], ed. Piero Sraffa with the Collaboration of M. H. Dobb (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2005), 11 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of the 19th century critics of Malthusian theory was [[Karl Marx]] who referred to it as "nothing more than a schoolboyish, superficial plagiary of De Foe, Sir James Steuart, Townsend, Franklin, Wallace" (in ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', see Marx's footnote on Malthus from ''Capital'' – reference below). Marx and Engels described Malthus as a "lackey of the bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Neurath 1994 7" /&gt; Socialists and communists believed that Malthusian theories "blamed the poor" for their own exploitation by the capitalist classes, and could be used to suppress the proletariat to an even greater degree, whether through attempts to reduce fertility or by justifying the generally poor conditions of labour in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

One proponent of Malthusianism was the novelist [[Harriet Martineau]] whose circle of acquaintances included [[Charles Darwin]], and the ideas of Malthus were a significant influence on the [[inception of Darwin's theory|inception of Darwin's theory of evolution]].&lt;ref name=JvW&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist] A biographical sketch by John van Wyhe, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was impressed by the idea that population growth would eventually lead to more organisms than could possibly survive in any given environment, leading him to theorise that organisms with a relative advantage in the struggle for survival and reproduction would be able to pass their characteristics on to further generations. Proponents of Malthusianism were in turn influenced by Darwin's ideas, both schools coming to influence the field of [[eugenics]]. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr.]] advocated "humane birth selection through humane birth control" in order to avoid a Malthusian catastrophe by eliminating the "unfit".&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;

Malthusianism became a less common intellectual tradition as the 19th century advanced, mostly as a result of technological increases, the opening of new territory to agriculture, and increasing international trade.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;  Although a "[[conservation movement|conservationist]]" movement in the United States concerned itself with resource depletion and natural protection in the first half of the twentieth century, Desrochers and Hoffbauer write, "It is probably fair to say ... that it was not until the publication of Osborn’s and Vogt’s books [1948] that a Malthusian revival took hold of a significant segment of the American population".&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;

==Modern Malthusianism==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Malthusian theory is a recurrent theme in many social science venues.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], in ''Economic Consequences of the Peace'', opens his polemic with a Malthusian portrayal of the political economy of Europe as unstable due to Malthusian population pressure on food supplies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Many models of resource depletion and scarcity are Malthusian in character: the rate of energy consumption will outstrip the ability to find and produce new energy sources, and so lead to a crisis.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In France, terms such as "''politique malthusienne''" ("Malthusian politics") refer to population control strategies. The concept of restriction of population associated with Malthus morphed, in later political economic theory, into the notion of restriction of production. In the French sense, a "Malthusian economy" is one in which protectionism and the formation of cartels is not only tolerated but encouraged.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Vladimir Lenin]], the leader of the [[Bolshevik Party]] and main architect of the [[Soviet Union]] was a critic of Neo-Malthusian theory (but not of birth control and abortion in general).&lt;ref&gt;V. I. Lenin, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/jun/29.htm "The Working Class and Neo-Malthusianism"], 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Neo-Malthusianism" is a concern that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] may increase [[resource depletion]] or [[environmental degradation]] to a degree that is not [[Sustainability|sustainable]] with the potential of [[ecological collapse]] or other [[Man-made hazard|hazards]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The term is also often connected with [[eugenics]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]]. These findings are the basis for neo-malthusian modern mathematical models of ''long-term historical dynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Peter Turchin]] 2003; [http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf Turchin and Korotayev 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229202712/http://cliodynamics.info/PDF/Turchin_Korotayev_SEH_2006.pdf |date=February 29, 2012 }}; Peter Turchin et al. 2007; [[Korotayev]] et al. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a general "neo-Malthusian" revival in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s after the publication of two influential books in 1948 ([[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|Fairfield Osborn]]'s ''[[Our Plundered Planet]]'' and [[William Vogt]]'s ''[[Road to Survival]]''). During that time the population of the world rose dramatically. Many in environmental movements began to sound the alarm regarding the potential dangers of population growth.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb |author1=Pierre Desrochers |author2=Christine Hoffbauer |journal=[[International Policy Network|The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url=http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |year=2009 |volume=1 |issue=3 |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185414/http://www.dpi.inpe.br/sil/cst310/Aula2_fundamentos/THE_POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2013}}&lt;!-- maybe highlight in text that opinions are from fake journal from pressure group, no CiteSeerX cite --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Club of Rome]] published a book entitled ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2013}}
The '''Mangal''' ({{lang-ps|منگل}}) is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe, residing in eastern [[Paktia]] and adjacent [[Khost]] provinces of [[Afghanistan]], and in the town of [[Tari Mangal]], district [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan|Kurram]], Pakistan. Their land constitutes the northeastern part of the [[Loya Paktia]] (Greater Paktia) region. The Mangals descent from [[Karlani]] Pashtun lineage.

Mangals are known for their bravery and independent nature, they have resisted the taliban and other infiltrators. Majority of Mangals are spread across Afghanistan who among other Afghans are attached to professions such as politicians, military commanders, teachers and scholars specializing in Pashto literature. The Mangal leaders are most recognized for settling tribal disputes and have founded unwritten code known as (nerkh) which the Pashtun tribes still use as a tool to resolve conflict among each other. A small number of Mangals residing in the present day lakki marwat District around 1500 AD along with Honi tribe. Most of these Mangals live as independent in lakki marwat(kpk) and in Kurma Pakistan which borders the Mangal province of Paktia in Afghanistan. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Mangal tribal militia was one of the various militias assisted [[Mohammad Nader Khan]] to topple the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] King, [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Consequently, Nadir Khan owed much to the tribes of Paktia, these tribal leaders were granted vast war booty and power by the new administration. In fact, the entire greater [[Loya Paktia]] region was exempt from mandatory military service, which the rest of the nation (regardless of ethnicity, region, or family) endured. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Mangal tribal militia was deployed in Northern Afghanistan shortly before Nadir Khan's assassination to oust an Uzbek Muslim resistance fighter, [[Ibrahimbeg Laqqai]], who was using ethnic kin support in Northern Afghanistan against [[Soviets]] in his homeland across the [[Oxus]] river. Laqqai had been successfully battling Soviet troops, who had taken over his homeland of modern-day Uzbekistan, in what is now known as the [[Basmachi Movement]]. During Kalakani's short rule as king, Laqqai was given support in the Northern Tajik and Uzbek communities and thus he recruited locals to fight across the river against the [[Soviets]]. [[Mohammad Nader Khan]] worried by this, summoned the Mangal tribe, amongst others, armed them with Soviet-supplied weaponry and motivated them by promises of war booty, to being dispatched to the north. Within a few months, with [[Soviet]] support and systematic terror against [[Tajik people|Tajik]] and [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] locals, the Basmachi Movement were brutally crushed in [[Afghanistan]] and eventually in [[Central Asia]] and driven him back across the [[Amu river]], where [[Ibrahimbeg Laqqai]] was subsequently captured and hanged by the Soviets. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The Mangals also played a notable role in the late 20th century history of [[Afghanistan]]. The son and grandsons of the Mangals who toppled [[Habibullah Kalakani]] were recruited in the [[Afghan Army]] and educated in [[Soviet]] Military Academies. Consequently, they came back as ideological [[Communists]] who eventually joined military corp of the [[KHALQ]] faction and overthrew the Monarchy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Barnet R.|title=The Fragmentation of Afghanistan|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=115–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangal tribe is also found in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] province mainly in area of Thall Vally and also in District Hangu and Orakzai Agency of [[FATA]].
A  large group of Mangal's are living in the valley of kurram agency's areas such as Tari Mangal, Kutri Mangal, Gobazana, Haqdara, Gidu, Sursurang, Piwar tangi and Shalawzan Tangi.
Mangal tribe also found in Qematay Mangal nearer to [[Tari Mangal]] on Afghanistan side. Mangals Of [[Tari Mangal]] and Mangals of Qematay Mangal are relatives of each other.These Mangals on both sides of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan are called the saver of the border.
A great and famous poet "Gul Nazir Mangal" also belongs to [[Tari Mangal]], Parachinar Kurram Agency.Aseer mangal is a famous writer and poet.Akhtar gul mangal  a famous educationist living in lakki marwat with big mangal tribe. Naseeb Mangal is the first person from sursurang to attend UKCBC London United Kingdom  (UK COLLEGE OF BUSINESS AND COMPUTING). He is the first person to have master degree in business administration  (MBA).
Mangals are living bothsides in Afghanistan and Pakistan

[[Industry]] is continually [[Chemical synthesis|synthesizing]] new chemicals, the regulation of which requires evaluation of the potential danger for [[human]] [[health]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Risk assessment is nowadays considered essential for making these decisions on a scientifically sound basis.

Measures or defined limits include:
*''No effect concentration'' (NEC),  ''No Observed Effect Concentration'' (NOEC), ''[[No-observed-adverse-effect level]]'' (NOAEL)
*''[[Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level]]'' (LOAEL)
*''Acceptable Operator Exposure Level'' (AOEL)&lt;ref&gt;[http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/AOEL thefreedictionary.com/AOEL] Retrieved on June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*ECx (in percent)

==No effect concentration==
''No effect concentration'' (NEC) is a [[risk assessment]] parameter that represents the [[concentration]] of a [[pollutant]] that will not harm the [[species]] involved, with respect to the effect that is studied. It is often the starting point for [[environmental policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruijn et al., 1997, Chen &amp; Selleck 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not much debate on the existence of an NEC&lt;ref&gt;Van Straalen 1997, Crane and Newman 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but the assignment of a value is another matter. Current practice consists of the use of standard tests. In the standard tests groups of animals are exposed to different concentrations of [[chemical]]s and different effects such as survival, growth or [[reproduction]] are monitored. These toxicity tests typically result in a ''[[No Observed Effect Concentration]]'' ([[NOEC]], also called a [[No Observable Effect Level]] or [[NOEL]]). This NOEC has been severely criticized on statistical grounds by several authors&lt;ref&gt;Suter 1996, Laskowski 1995, [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy96.html Kooijman 1996], Van der Hoeven 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and it was concluded that the NOEC should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/30/0,2340,en_2649_34365_1916638_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Document No 54 of "Series on Testing Assessment", 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ECx==
A proposed alternative is the use of so-called ECx – the concentration(s) showing ''x''% effect (e.g. an [[EC50]] in a survival experiment indicates the concentration where 50% of the test animals would die in that experiment). ECx concentrations also have their problems in applying them to risk assessment. Any other value for ''x'' other than zero may give the impression that an effect is accepted, and this is in conflict with the aim of maximally protecting the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bruijn et al. 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In addition ECx values do depend on the exposure time.&lt;ref&gt;Kooijman 1981, [http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/JageHeug2006.html Jager et al. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; ECx values for survival decrease for increasing exposure time, until equilibrium has been established. This is because effects depend on internal concentrations,&lt;ref&gt;Kooijman 1981, Péry et al. 2001a&lt;/ref&gt; and that it takes time for the compound to penetrate the body of test organisms. However, sub-lethal endpoints (e.g., body size, reproductive output) may reveal less predictable effect patterns in time.&lt;ref&gt;Alda Alvarez et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the effect patterns over time depends on properties of the test compound, properties of the organism, the endpoint considered and the dimensions in which the endpoint is expressed (e.g., body ''size'' or body ''weight''; reproduction ''rate'' or ''cumulative'' reproduction).

==Biology-based==
Biology-based methods not only aim to describe observed effects, but also to understand them in terms of underlying processes such as [[toxicokinetics]], mortality, feeding, growth and reproduction (Kooijman 1997). This type of approach starts with the description of the uptake and elimination of a compound by an organism, as an effect can only be expected if the compound is inside the organism, and where the No Effect Concentration is one of the modeling parameters. As the approach is biologically based it is also possible by using [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/research/bib/Kooy2000.html Kooijman, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; to incorporate multiple [[stressor]]s (e.g. effects of food restriction, temperature, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Heugens, 2001, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and processes that are active under field conditions (e.g. [[adaptation]], population dynamics, species interactions, [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] phenomena, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Sibly and Calow (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these multiple stressors are excluded in the standard test procedures by keeping the local environment in the test constant. It is also possible to use these parameter values to predict effects at longer exposure times, or effects when the concentration in the medium is not constant. If the observed effects include those on survival and reproduction of individuals, these parameters can also be used to predict effects on growing populations in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Kooijman 1997, Hallam et al. 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media system dependency theory''' ('''MSD'''), or simply '''media dependency''', was developed by Sandra Ball-Rokeach and [[Melvin Defleur]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=[[Communication Research (journal)|Communication Research]]|year=1976|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is grounded in classical sociological literature positing that media and their audiences should be studied in the context of larger social systems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Efficacy on the Internet: A Media System Dependency Approach|url=https://www.academia.edu/2193885/Political_Efficacy_on_the_Internet_A_Media_System_Dependency_Approach|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|accessdate=5 May 2014|author=Ognyanova, K.|author2=Ball-Rokeach, S. J.|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSD ties together the interrelations of broad [[Social system|social systems]], [[mass media]], and the individual into a comprehensive explanation of media effects. At its core, the basic dependency hypothesis states that the more a person depends on media to meet needs, the more important media will be in a person's life, and therefore the more effects media will have on a person. 
 
==The relationships between components==
Dependency on media emerges from three relationships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Alan M|author2=Windahl, S|title=The uses and dependency model of mass communication|journal=[[Critical Studies in Media Communication]]|year=1986|volume=3|pages=184–199|doi=10.1080/15295039609366643}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''The relationship between the society and the media:''' Within this relationship, media access and availability are regarded as important antecedents to an individual's experience with the media. The nature of media dependence on societal systems varies across political, economic, and cultural system.
#'''The relationship between the media and the audience:''' This relationship is the key variable in this theory because it affects how people might use a mass medium. This relationship also varies across media systems. The more salient the information needs, the stronger are the motivation to seek mediated information and the dependency on the medium. In result, the likelihood for the media to affect audiences becomes greater.
#'''The relationship between the society and the audience:''' The societies influence consumers' needs and motives for media use, and provide norms, values, knowledge, and laws for their members. Social system can function an alternatives to the media by offering similar services of the media.

==Media needs and media dependency==
===Three types of needs===
According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|author2=DeFleur, ML|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects|journal=In G. Gumpert &amp; R.S. Cathart, (eds.), Inter/Media: Interpersonal communication in a media world.|year=1979|pages=81–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; three media needs determine how important media is to a person at any given moment:
#The need to understand one's social world (surveillance)
#The need to act meaningfully and effectively in that world (social utility)
#The need to escape from that world when tensions are high (fantasy-escape)

When these needs for media are high, the more people turn to media to meet these needs, and therefore the media have a greater opportunity to affect them. That said, none of these media needs are constant over long periods of time. They change based on aspects of our social environment.

===Two basic conditions for heightened media needs===
Media dependency theory states two specific conditions under which people's media needs, and consequently people's dependency on media and the potential for media effects, are heightened.

The first condition of heightened media needs occurs when the number of media and centrality of media functions in a society are high.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; For instance, in modernized countries like the United States, there are many media outlets and they serve highly centralized social functions. In the United States alone, the media act as a "fourth branch" of government, an alarm system during national emergencies, and as a tool for entertainment and escape, whereas in the underdeveloped world the media are not as numerous and serve far fewer functions. As such, the media have a greater opportunity to serve needs and exert effects in contemporary America than in a third world country.

The second condition of heightened media needs occurs when a society is undergoing social change and conflict. When there is a war or large-scale public protests like during Vietnam or the Arab Spring, a national emergency like the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowery|first=W|title=Media dependency during a large-scale social disruption: The case of September 11|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=3|pages=339–357|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0703_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hindman|first=DB|title=Media system dependency and public support for the press and president|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2004|volume=7|issue=1|pages=29–42|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0701_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina, people turn to media to help understand these important events. Consequently, the media have a greater opportunity to exert effects during these times of social change and conflict.

==The effects of media message==
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur suggests that the cognitive, behavioral and affective consequences of media use
are premised upon characteristics of both individuals and their social environment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Cognitive===
There are five types of cognitive effects that will be exerted on audiences, the first of which is the creation and resolution of ambiguity. Ambiguity occurs when audiences receive inadequate or incomplete information about their social world. When there is high ambiguity, stress is created, and audiences are more likely to turn to mass media to resolve ambiguity. Ambiguity might be especially prevalent during times of social change or conflict.

The second effect is agenda-setting. This is another reason why we might call dependency a "comprehensive" theory of media effects&amp;nbsp;– it incorporates the entire theory of agenda-setting within its theoretical framework. Like any other effect, media agenda-setting effects should be heightened during times when the audience's needs and therefore dependency on media are high. So, for instance, if our informational needs and dependency on media was high during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, we would have been more susceptible to agenda-setting effects, and we would have therefore perceived the Iraq War as the most important problem (MIP) facing the United States.

Third is attitude formation. Media exposes us to completely new people, such as political figures and celebrities, not to mention physical objects like birth control pills or car safety mechanisms that we come to form attitudes about. Dependency does not suggest media are monolithic in their ability to influence attitudes, but the theory does suggest that media play a role in selecting objects and people for which people form attitudes about. If a person is experiencing greater media dependency, we would therefore expect that the person will form more (or more complex) attitudes about these attitude-objects than people with low media dependency.

Media also have the potential cognitive effect of expanding people's belief systems. Media can create a kind of "enlargement" of citizen's beliefs by disseminating information about other people, places, and things. Expansion of people's belief systems refers to a broadening or enlarging of beliefs in a certain category. For example, a constant flow of information about global warming will expand people's beliefs about pollution affecting the earth's atmosphere, about cap and trade and other policies, and about personal contributions to global warming. These beliefs meet with and are incorporated into an existing value system regarding religion, free enterprise, work, ecology, patriotism, recreation, and the family.

Last is value clarification and conflict. Media help citizens clarify values (equality, freedom, honesty, forgiveness) often by precipitating information about value conflicts. For instance, during the 1960s the mass media regularly reported on the activities of the Civil Rights movement, presenting conflicts between individual freedoms (e.g., a businessman's property rights to deny blacks entrance) and equality (e.g., human rights). When such conflicts play out in the mass media, the value conflicts are identified, resulting in audiences forming their own value positions. Such a position can be painful to articulate because it can force a choice between mutually incompatible goals and the means for obtaining them. However, in the process of trying to decide which is more important in a particular case, general value priorities can become clarified.

===Affective===
Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur mentions several possible affective media effects that are more likely to occur during times of heightened dependency.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; First is desensitization, which states that prolonged exposure to violent content can have a "numbing" effect on audiences, promoting insensitivity or the lack of desire toward helping others when violent encounters happen in real life.

Second, exposure to news messages or TV dramas that portray crime-ridden cities can increase people's fear or anxiety about living in or even traveling to a city.

Media can also have effects on morale and feelings of alienation. The degree of positive or negative mass media depictions of social groups can cause fluctuations in people's sense of morale in belonging to that group or in their sense of alienation from that group.

===Behavioral===
There are two broad categories of behavioral effects that Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur identify.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The first broad category is called "activation" effects, which refer to instances in which media audiences do something they would not otherwise have done as a consequence of receiving media messages. Behavioral effects are largely thought to work through cognitive and affective effects. For instance, a woman reading a news story about sexism in the workplace might form an attitude toward sexism that creates a negative emotional state, the culmination of which is joining a women's rights march in her local community.

The second broad category of behavioral effects is called "deactivation", and refers to instances in which audiences would have otherwise done something, but don't do as a consequence of media messages. For example, the primary presidential campaign has become longer and increasingly use more media to target audiences. As such, primary campaigns might elicit negative attitudes toward the electoral process and negative affective states such as boredom or disgust that in turn might make a person not turn out to vote.

==The levels of media dependency==
In the MSD view, the media system has two-way resource-dependency relations with individuals (micro-level), groups and organizations (meso-level), and other social systems (macro-level).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball-Rokeach|first=Sandra J|title=The origins of individual media-system dependency: a sociological framework| journal=Communication research|year=1985|volume=12|issue=4|pages=485–510|doi=10.1177/009365085012004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The microlevel (individual level)===
Microlevel, or individual level application, focuses on the relationship between individuals and media. The microlevel dependency, better known as individual level media system dependency (IMD), begins with an assessment of the types of motivation that bring individuals to use the media.
In the perspective of IMD, goals are preferred to needs to conceptualize the motivations that affect media behavior. According to Ball-Rokeach and DeFleur, goals are the key dimension of individual motivation. While needs imply both rational and irrational motives, goals imply a problem-solving motivation more appropriate to a theory of media behavior based upon the dependency relation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Three types of motivational goals====
The IMD approach provides a comprehensive conceptualization of three motivational goals: understanding, orientation, and play.
#Understanding – needs for individuals to have a basic understanding of themselves and the world around them.
#Orientation – needs for individuals to direct personal actions effectively and interact successfully with others.
#play(or recreation) – a way through which one learns roles, norms, and values and its reflected in such activities as sport, dance, and celebration.

===The macrolevel===
Every country's media system is interdependent on the country's other social systems (e.g., its economy, its government) for resources, and vice versa. At the macrolevel, dependency theory states these interrelationships influence what kinds of media products are disseminated to the public for consumption, and the range of possible uses people have for media.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

====Media and economic system====
The media depend on a society's economic system for 1) inculcation and reinforcement of free enterprise values, 2) establishing and maintaining linkages between producers and sellers, and 3) controlling and winning internal conflicts, such as between management and unions. In turn, the media is dependent on a society's economic system for 1) profit from advertising revenue, 2) technological developments that reduce costs and compete effectively with other media outlets, and 3) expansion via access to banking and finance services, as well as international trade.

====Media and political system====
A society's media and political system are also heavily interdependent. Political system rely on the media to 1) inculcate and reinforce political values and norm such as freedom, voting, or obedience to the law, 2) maintain order and social integration, 3) organize and mobilize citizens to carry out essential activities like waging war, and 4) controlling and winning conflicts that develop within political domains (e.g., Watergate). Conversely, the media rely on a country's political system for judicial, executive, and legislative protection, formal and informal resources required to cover the news, and revenue that comes from political advertising and subsidies.

====Media and secondary systems====
To a lesser extent, media has established interdependencies with several other social systems. The family is dependent on media for inculcation and reinforcement of family values, recreation and leisure, coping with everyday problems of child rearing, marriage, and financial crises. On the other hand, the media is dependent on the family for consuming their media products.

The same is true of media and religious systems. Religious systems rely on media for inculcation and reinforcement of religious values, transmitting religious messages to the masses, and successfully competing with other religious or nonreligious philosophies. In turn, the media relies on the religious system to attain profits from religious organizations who purchase space or air time.

The educational system in a society relies on media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging successful conflicts or struggles for scarce resources, and knowledge transmission such as in educational media programming. Media depends on the educational system for access to expert information and being able to hire personnel trained in the educational system.

Finally, the military system depends on the media for value inculcation and reinforcement, waging and winning conflicts, and specific organizational goals such as recruitment and mobilization. The media, in turn, depends on the military for access to insider or expert information.

The consequences of all of these interdependencies, again, are alterations in media products that audiences consume. In this way, the system-level interdependencies control media products, the range of possible social uses for media, the extent to which audiences depend on the media to fulfill needs, and ultimately media effects on audiences. Individual differences due to demographics or personality traits might change what people actually do with media messages or how they interpret media messages, but the messages always begin as the result of interdependent social systems.

==Comparison with use and gratification theory==
Ball-Rokeach summarized the major differences between uses and gratification (U&amp;G) theory and media system dependency (MSD) theory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Conception of audience members===
Both U&amp;G and MSD theorists view the audience member as active, but the basic conceptions of the audience member differ. U&amp;G theorists focus on psychological and sociodemographic origins of differences in media use. In this perspective, the variability of text interpretation suggests an audience member in charge of the text.

MSD theorists focus on psychological, interpersonal, and sociological origins of differences in micro MSD relations as well as the macro MSD relations that constrain media text production and individual's MSD relations. The responsiveness of micro MSD relations to environmental conditions and the ecological constraints on media production and consumption are important features. In this perspective, the audience member is neither in charge of the text nor controlled by the text. The only way we can predict the effects is the audiences' MSD relations in context of the ecology of macro relations.

===Conception of interpersonal networks and communication===
U&amp;G theorists emphasize the role of interpersonal communication in the distortion of media messages and of networks as interpretive communities. In this conception, interpersonal networks are regarded as a safety way against the cultural apparatus of the media and its partners. They believe that the interpersonal network contributes to individual "agency", and the "networked" individual is empowered to manipulate media texts, not to be manipulated by them.

The MSD conception is compatible with the U&amp;G conception up to a point. Consistent with MSD conceptions of the individual member of the active media audience, the interpersonal networks play major roles in MSD theory. They link the individual to public and they link and influence the nature of the individual's relations with the media system.

===Conception of the media system and of media power===
U&amp;G theorists in the psychological tradition think of the media system as creators of tentative texts subject to multiple reconstructions. In this perspective, the media system is functional to the extent that it is useful or affords ways for individuals to gratify needs.

The MSD conception is closer to a macro functionalist version of U&amp;G. MSD shares the macro functionalists' view of the media's interdependence with other social and cultural system. In this view, the function of media is seen as a key structure for vertical and horizontal integration of society. The MSD viewpoints seem to be even closer to cultural studies traditions in that the central concern for structural relations of control over information resources that generate the power to create social realities and to negotiate social conflict and social change.

===Methods of observation, analysis, and interpretation===
Although both U&amp;G and MSD researchers ask similar questions of individuals, they do so for very different reasons. Those differences are reflected most clearly in (a) the logics of hypothesis formation (b) item and scale construction (c) modes of data analysis, and (d) interpretation of findings.

The MSD researcher essentially wants to know the micro and macro determinants of stability and change in micro MSD relations to learn something about their cross-level consequences for individuals and their interpersonal networks-the dynamics of their inner worlds and how they live in their social worlds. The U&amp;G theorist wants to learn something about the individual's attraction to media texts and the interaction between text and reader to better understand the contributions of reader characteristics to text processing. The differences between micro U&amp;G and micro MSD are, thus, in their epistemological origins, assumptions, concepts, and missions.

==Theoretical applications in social media==
===New media dependency (NMD)===
The characteristics of new media, including social media domain and the unique contents available through participatory use, as adding to the measure of individual dependency relation (IMD), are treated as the mediator. This cognitive process of mediating IMD is called new media dependency (NMD). Age and the popularity of online contents are seen as influential to NMD, in which younger people show higher NMD especially on popular content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Yoonwhan|year=2009|title=New media uses and dependency effect model: exploring the relationship between new media use habit, dependency relation, and possible outcomes|url=https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/25730/PDF/1/|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Rutgers University-Graduate School-New Brunswick|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cross-level===
====Inevitable limitations====
#The mass media centered framework.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ball-Rokeach, S.J. &amp; Jung, J-Y, (2009). The Evolution of Media System dependency theory. In R. Nabi and M. B. Oliver,'' Sage Handbook of Media Processes and Effects''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Its theoretical assumption of asymmetry between mass media and individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
However, the communication environment has changed as social media provides more choices for people to actively select information generated by other people, instead of passively receiving from satellites and cable channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Cross-level analysis of social media====
Three basic factors of MSD – individual characteristics, social environment, and media system activity – are derived from both micro and macro levels in a society, postulating media remained on a single level. However, the functionality of social media has been suggested as crossing those levels. Through social media, users are able to create the story (on the micro level), and the story can be either shared publicly (on the macro level) or not. Thus, social media gain the ability to move across levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Joo-Young, J., Moro, M., Jung, J. Y., &amp; Munehito, M. (2012). Cross-level analysis of social media: Toward the construction of an ecological framework. ''国際基督教大学学報. II-B, 社会科学ジャーナル'', 73, 53-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The argument about studies in social media===
Particularly, there are lots of MSD studies in online social networking sites ranging from MySpace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schrock|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Myspace Or Ourspace: A Media System Dependency View Of Myspace|url=|journal=Doctoral dissertation, University of Central Florida|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Facebook and Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, J. Y. (2012). Social media use and goals after the Great East Japan Earthquake. ''First Monday'', ''17''(8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ha, L., Yoon, K., &amp; Zhang, X. (2013). Consumption and dependency of social network sites as a news medium: A comparison between college students and general population. ''Journal of Communication and Media Research'', ''5''(1), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, scholars still have concerns about whether it is appropriate or not to apply MSD for studying the use of social media.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/27/from-media-dependency-system-to-communication-infrastructure-theory/comment-page-1/|title=Can media system dependency account for social media? Or should communication infrastructure theory take care of it?|last=Matei|first=Sorin Adam|date=27 July 2010|website=I Think|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that MSD accounts for social media, giving reasons that:
#MSD provides a framework for the many relationships through which information can flow in social media environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
#In the case of social media, the power is dependent on the relationship between the provider of information and the consumer of information, rather than in specific people or positions, which is consistent with what MSD suggests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
On the contrary, others challenge that MSD does not fit well with social media studies, because:

'''Meporter''' was a [[citizen journalist]] [[mobile phone]] application that used [[geolocation]] and [[multimedia]] to create [[hyperlocal]], real-time [[news]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporter: The beat on the street|url=http://www.meporter.com/about|website=www.meporter.com|accessdate=April 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528042311/http://www.meporter.com/about|archivedate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is a combination of ''Me'' and ''Reporter''. Users posted news with headlines, text, videos, and images using their [[smartphone|smartphones]] to the Meporter database and to the Meporter website; users could have the story pinpointed on a map using GPS. When the story was uploaded, it was viewable by other meporters via their smartphone or the Meporter website. Users earned "Press Passes", that were similar to [[Foursquare]] Badges, which could be exchanged for prizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meporter.com/store/product.htm?prizeID=6 "Forbes Meporter Press Pass"], ''Meporter LLC'', Retrieved 2011-08-03 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730164219/http://www.meporter.com/store/product.htm?prizeID=6 |date=2011-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Meporter was a multimedia-based system that allowed users to upload text, images, and videos to the events on meporter. Unlike other geolocation apps, Meporter did not have character limits on the text, so users could upload as much text as they deemed necessary to the database. The Meporter development team did not edit any of the user uploaded media on Meporter.

Meporter had a point system that awarded "Press Passes" to individuals who uploaded content and eet certain criteria. If the participating business was involved with the Press Pass, they could offer prizes to Press Pass holders. For instance, ''Forbes'' magazine offered a free 6-month subscription to meporters who posted 10 stories to the business category.

'''Mesac Damas''' (born July 2, 1976) is a Haitian American man convicted of the murder of his wife and five children at their home in [[Collier County, Florida]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = September 22, 2009 | title = Florida man held in Haiti charged in family slayings | periodical = CNN | url =http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/22/florida.family.dead/index.html?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mesac Damas was born in [[Haiti]] on July 2, 1976. Damas had an unstable family life and was influenced in his youth by [[domestic violence]] and [[poverty]].

He was raised an [[Evangelical Christian]] by his mother and father until the age of 10 when his parents left for the [[United States]], leaving him in Haiti with extended family members who practiced [[Haitian Voodoo]]. As an adult, Damas identifies as an Evangelical Christian.

At the age of 19, Damas left Haiti and relocated to the United States, where he has lived ever since.

At the time of the murders, Damas was 33 years old and worked as a chef at a local ale house. He described himself as "the best of the best" in his line of work.

In January 2009, eight months prior to the murders, Damas was arrested for domestic violence battery against his wife, Guerline, whom he had been with for 12 years. The incident arose over Damas' suspicions of unfaithfulness on the part of his wife.

==Murders==
In a statement to US Marshal agents, Damas divulged that on Wednesday, September 16, 2009, his wife, Guerline Damas, brought up the topic of [[divorce]] while at home that evening. Damas stated that the conversation became frenzied, and that at one point he said to his wife, "Divorce me? I'll [expletive] kill you."

The following morning, Thursday, September 17, 2009, Damas followed his wife to work for her 5:00AM shift at [[Publix]] to make sure she was "really there". Another argument then ensued when she discovered that he had followed her.

Damas stated that the conversation of the night before lingered in his mind all day, causing him to become increasingly angrier over the subject. Damas reported to work that evening but clocked out after working only two hours, saying that he couldn't work because he wasn't feeling well and had a "pounding headache". Damas would later tell agents that at the time, "bad spirits" and voices were telling him that his wife would leave him.

After leaving work, Damas arrived at a local [[supermarket]] where he purchased a Berkley fillet knife, a roll of silver duct tape, and a pack of gum.

When he arrived home, Damas stated that his wife did not speak to him except to ask him to sign [[immigration]] papers and tell him that she still intended on leaving. It was then that Damas grabbed a knife, tied her with a rope, and duct taped her mouth.

Damas could not describe any of the events after that, except to say, "it's bad, it's criminal." When agents asked whether anyone helped him commit the crimes, Damas said that he had help from a "visible spirit" but not an actual, physical person. Damas asserted that his actions were carried out as a result of a [[Curse|hex]] that was placed on him by his mother-in-law and/or a coworker of his.

Damas remained in the house until 7:00AM the following morning, thinking about how he was going to kill himself. He then changed his clothes, packed a suitcase, and drove to [[Miami International Airport]].

On Saturday September 19, 2009, the family of Guerline Damas contacted the Collier County Sheriff's Office to file a missing person's report, as they had not heard from Guerline since Thursday, September 17, 2009 and she had not reported to work.

At 7:03 PM that evening, deputies arrived at the Damas family's residence to conduct a welfare check on Guerline Damas and her five children. It was at this time that deputies entered the residence and noticed what appeared to be blood leaking from a closed door under the stairs, with floor rugs pushed against it to cover the space between the bottom of the door and the tile floor beneath it. The residence was then secured as a possible [[homicide]] scene.

Deputies pried open the locked door to discover the body of Guerline Damas on the floor of a small bathroom, face down in a large pool of dried blood with a black trash bag over her head and her limbs bound with duct tape.

Her [[autopsy]] revealed [[blunt force injury]] to her right elbow and right eye, and deep, extensive sharp force injury to her left shoulder and neck.

Deputies then discovered the body of Meshach Damas in a second floor bedroom, face down on a mattress atop an area of dried blood. The autopsy of Meshach Damas revealed sharp force injuries to the palm of his right hand, as well as extensive sharp force injuries encircling almost the entirety of his neck.

Upon entry into another second floor bedroom, deputies discovered the bodies of the remaining four Damas children, two on the bedroom floor beside one another, one on the bed, and one on a mattress on the floor of the bedroom. All four sustained sharp force injuries to their necks.

==Flight and Arrest==
On the morning of Friday, September 18, 2009, Mesac Damas arrived at the Miami International Airport and purchased a ticket for a one-way flight to [[Port Au Prince]], Haiti, where he arrived at 10:50 AM the same morning.

Damas would later state to US Marshal agents that he had flown to Haiti to say goodbye to his family, because he "knew what he did was wrong and that he didn't deserve to live".

On September 22, 2009 a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] was signed by a [[Collier County]] judge for the arrest of Mesac Damas for the murder of his wife and five children. 
 
On September 23, 2009, Damas was apprehended by [[United States Marshal Service]] agents in Port Au Prince, Haiti. Damas voluntarily provided a lengthy statement to agents at that time, saying, among other things, "I know what I did was wrong. Bad spirits made me do it." and asking agents, "You think I want to live after what I did?"

In a statement to the Naples Daily News the same day, Damas admitted to the murders of his wife and five children, and stated that he wished to receive the death penalty for his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = September 23, 2009 | title = Damas questioned at Collier County Jail | periodical = WBBH | url =http://www.nbc-2.com/Global/story.asp?S=11175306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publication-date=September 22, 2009 |title=Mesac Damas confesses to killing family, wants to go to heaven |periodical=Naples Daily News |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/sep/22/haiti-mesac-damas-confesses-killing-naples-family/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126161412/http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/sep/22/haiti-mesac-damas-confesses-killing-naples-family/ |archivedate=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damas was transported back to Collier County by the US Marshal, where he was incarcerated and held no bond.

==Competency==

Throughout the pendency of the Damas case, his [[competence (law)|competency]] to stand [[trial]] was an ongoing question, mainly revolving around his hyper-religious ideation and refusal to cooperate with attorneys, with the court, and with jail staff. Questions of competency caused frequent and significant delays in the progress of the case.

Between September 2010 and March 2011, three experts were appointed by the court to evaluate Damas' competency, resulting in a June 2011 court order finding him competent to proceed. Despite this, competency issues persisted as the case proceeded and as Damas' [[behavior]] became more bizarre.

Damas was then re-evaluated and found incompetent to proceed on March 19, 2014 by a court order which cited, "a substantial likelihood that in the near future the defendant will inflict serious bodily harm on himself or another person, as evidenced by recent behavior." Additionally, the order stated that Damas' condition had "substantial probability" of responding well to treatment with the goal of restoring his competency to proceed "in the reasonably foreseeable future." It was at this time that he was committed to the custody of the [[Florida Department of Children and Families|Department of Children and Families]] and referred to a mental health treatment facility, where he was admitted in April 2014.

In October 2014, his competency was found to have been restored by a court order, stating that facility records note Damas was "aggressive, manipulative, and deceitful, and would engage in cooperative behavior when necessary to get something he wanted," as well as describing Damas as "grandiose, preoccupied with his own self-worth, entitled and wants to be admired by others, lacks empathy, and arrogant." Reports further state that Damas "has the ability to engage in appropriate behavior, and his refusal to do so at times is a volitional choice, and not a symptom of [[mental illness]]".

Having found that his competency had been restored, Damas was set back on track to proceed to trial.

==Jail and Courtroom Behavior==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2014}}While being held in custody, Damas rejected his legal name and took on a moniker of his own making, "C.O.G." — an acronym meaning "Child of [[God]]".

Damas also refused to eat or shower for long periods of time. At least one reported instance involved Damas going without showering for over 30 consecutive days. Local news sources reported that the smell coming from Mesac Damas' cell was so bad at times that it made other inmates physically ill.

Damas routinely refused deputies' orders and was the subject of numerous disciplinary action by jail staff, including at least one incident wherein Damas was sprayed with [[pepper spray]] after hiding under his bunk.

Damas' courtroom behavior often became a spectacle and attracted much [[media (communication)|media]] attention. One August 2010 court appearance involved Damas singing aloud until his lawyer and the presiding judge asked him to calm down. He ceased until the hearing was almost over, but then began again with the outbursts.&lt;ref name="Aug2010"&gt;{{Citation | publication-date = August 13, 2010 | title = Mesac Damas makes wild appearance in Collier courtroom | periodical = WBBH | url =http://www.nbc-2.com/Global/story.asp?S=12973883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damas was routinely transported by multiple jail deputies to and from his court appearances, at times secured to a wheelchair-like contraption for the safety of staff.

As the case proceeded, Damas' courtroom behavior became generally less disruptive but not necessarily any more cooperative. At nearly every court appearance attended by Damas in 2017, he could be seen sitting silently with his head resting on the table, possibly asleep.

At a hearing on June 23, 2017, Damas unexpectedly rose to his feet and stated in open court that he wanted to discharge his attorneys, represent himself, and plead [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y to the charges against him. At a later hearing on July 21, 2017 to determine his ability to adequately represent himself and enter a guilty plea to six capital felonies, Damas again became uncooperative, making rambling and disjointed statements to the court.

At one hearing in October 2017, Damas handwrote a note to the presiding judge which read, "Go ahead, continue your work, may my blood be upon your shoulders," signing the note "C.O.G."

==Disposition==

On September 5, 2017, Mesac Damas pled guilty to all six counts of first degree premeditated murder. Sentencing was deferred until October 27, 2017, when Collier Circuit Judge Christine H. Greider sentenced Mesac Damas to concurrent [[death sentences]] on all six counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/crime/2017/10/27/death-sentence-mesac-damas-resolves-colliers-most-horrifying-murder-case/807709001/ Naples Daily News] Published 4:38 p.m. ET Oct. 27, 2017 | Updated 3:43 a.m. ET Oct. 28, 2017.

'''Missing stair''' is an analogy for a [[sexual predator]] who many people know cannot be trusted, but who they work around by trying to quietly warn others rather than deal with openly. The analogy is to a dangerous [[Structure|structural]] fault such as a missing stair in a home, which residents have become used to and accepting of, and which is not fixed or signposted, but which (most) newcomers are warned about.

== Origins ==
The phrase was coined by [[blog]]ger Cliff Pervocracy in a 2012 post&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Pervocracy: The missing stair.|url = http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html|website = The Pervocracy|date = 2012-06-22|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Cliff|last = Pervocracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; on The Pervocracy, a blog about [[BDSM]] and [[Kink (sexual)|kink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Pervocracy: About The Pervocracy|url = http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/p/about-pervocracy.html|website = pervocracy.blogspot.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing a man in his social circle known to be a [[rapist]], Pervocracy wrote:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;People had gotten so used to working around this guy, to accommodating his "special requirements," that they didn't feel like there was an urgent problem in their community. They did eventually expel him, but it was after months of it being widely shared knowledge that he was a rapist. [...] I think there were some people in the community who were intentionally protecting him, but there were more who were de facto protecting him by treating him like a missing stair. Like something you're so used to working around, you never stop to ask "what if we actually fixed this?" Eventually you take it for granted that working around this guy is just a fact of life, and if he hurts someone, that's the fault of whoever didn't apply the workarounds correctly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pervocracy intended the term to apply beyond sexually predatory behaviour to include, for example, underperforming colleagues who let others pick up their slack. However, since its coinage it has been used mostly in the context of [[sexual harassment]] and [[rape]].

== Meaning ==

The analogy of the missing stair has been described as powerful because it makes it clear that the problem is the missing stair (the predator) and the solution is fixing the stair (stopping the predatory behaviour).

An article about industry sexual harassment on comics news site [[Comics Alliance]] posed the question: "Which one of these statements makes more sense to say: 'These people need to find more ways to stop people from harming them.' OR: 'These people should stop causing harm.' If you ever find yourself saying the former instead of the latter, take a moment and ask yourself why."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sexual Harassment in Comics: The Tipping Point |url=http://comicsalliance.com/sexual-harassment-women-in-comics/ |website=Comics Alliance |access-date=2016-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129185129/http://comicsalliance.com/sexual-harassment-women-in-comics/ |archivedate=2016-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 post on the anti-rape blog [[Yes Means Yes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sexist Interview: Thomas MacAulay Millar on Feminist Men|url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2010/03/19/sexist-interview-thomas-macaulay-millar-on-feminist-men/|website = Washington City Paper|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; lawyer Thomas MacAulay Millar wrote that the missing stair analogy was consistent with his understanding of [[rapists]]' motivations and behaviours, based on research carried out by [[clinical psychologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[David Lisak]] and Paul M. Miller, and by Stephanie K. McWhorter, a [[researcher]] with the U.S. Naval Health Research Center. Millar wrote that while a small number of rapists are "one-timers" who may be making a mistake or confused about consent, the majority are [[Recidivism|repeat offenders]], averaging six rapes each.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghomeshi: The Developing Story, And Predator Theory Observations|url = https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/ghomeshi-the-developing-story-and-predator-theory-observations/|access-date = 2016-01-22|last = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We need to spot the rapists," Millar wrote, "and we need to shut down the social structures that give them a license to operate. They don’t accidentally end up in a room with a woman too drunk or high to consent or resist; they plan on getting there and that’s where they end up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet The Predators|url = https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/|access-date = 2016-01-22|last = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The analogy has been picked up and used in communities related to [[Modern Paganism|paganism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Silence equals complicity: making Pagan groups safe for everyone|url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2014/03/silence-equals-death/|website = Dowsing for Divinity|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[comics]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Punk rock|punk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Imagining a Safer Space: Building Community &amp; Ending Harassment in Punk|url = http://storebrandsoda.com/2015/04/28/imagining-a-safer-space-building-community-ending-harassment-in-punk/|website = store brand soda|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Lorena|last = Cupcake}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[geek culture]], and in [[Tavi Gevinson]]'s [[Rookie (magazine)|Rookie]], a [[magazine]] for teenage girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saturday Links: Baltimore Rises Edition - Rookie|url = http://www.rookiemag.com/2015/05/saturday-links-126/|website = Rookie|access-date = 2016-01-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by [[advice columnist]]s including Captain Awkward,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = #784: The Geek Social Fallacy Host - Missing Stair Guest Relationship|url = http://captainawkward.com/2015/11/03/784-the-geek-social-fallacy-host-missing-stair-guest-relationship/|website = Captain Awkward|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sam W. at [[Scarleteen.com|Scarleteen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Help!

Geek culture site [[The Mary Sue]] referenced the concept in 2013, in a story celebrating [[science fiction]] writer [[John Scalzi]]'s announcement that he would no longer attend [[science fiction convention]]s that didn't have clear and prominent [[Sexual harassment|sexual harassment policies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sci-Fi Luminary John Scalzi Swears Off Cons Without Clear and Prominent Sexual Harassment Policies|url = http://www.themarysue.com/john-scalzi-con-harassment/|website = www.themarysue.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Feministe quoted science fiction [[Editing|editor]] Michi Trota describing [[James Frenkel]], who was permanently banned from attending [[Wiscon|WisCon]] after harassment complaints, as "someone who has been an industry missing stair for decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Procedure Fail: WisCon, Feminism and Safe Spaces|url = http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2014/07/31/procedure-fail-wiscon-feminism-and-safe-spaces/|website = Feministe|access-date = 2016-01-22|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the anti-rape blog Yes Means Yes compared disgraced former [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] and [[pop musician]] [[Jian Ghomeshi]] to a missing stair, and urged the BDSM community to distance themselves from him.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;

In 2015, the missing stair concept was invoked by the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] in its coverage of American [[astronomer]] [[Geoffrey Marcy]]'s resignation from his [[professor]]ship at [[UC Berkeley]], following its finding that between 2001 and 2010 he had repeatedly violated the [[university]]'s sexual harassment policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = We can't stop rape if we prize men's reputations over women's safety|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/16/we-cant-stop-if-we-prize-men-reputations-over-women-safety|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2015-10-16|access-date = 2016-01-22|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, after [[pornographic film]] [[actress]] [[Stoya]] accused her colleague and former boyfriend [[James Deen]] of rape, prompting similar allegations by a dozen other women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What To Know About The Sexual Assault Allegations Against James Deen|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-deen-rape-explainer_us_566063f8e4b079b2818d68f4|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; feminist site We Hunted The Mammoth wrote that James Deen seemed to be "a perfect example" of a missing stair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = James Deen: Porn’s Missing Stair?|url = http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/11/30/james-deen-porns-missing-stair/|website = We Hunted The Mammoth|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[NPR]], in a review of the 2015 [[Jo Walton]] science fiction/fantasy novel ''[[The Just City]]'', reviewer [[Amal El-Mohtar]] argued that Walton deliberately included missing stairs in her book, in an effort to reflect current discourse around the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Consolations (And Controversies) Of Philosophy In 'The Just City'|url = https://www.npr.org/2015/01/15/376093453/the-consolations-and-controversies-of-philosophy-in-the-just-city|website = NPR.org|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Amal|last = El-Mohtar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fred Martinez ==
Fred Martinez lived in [[Cortez, Colorado]] on a Navajo reservation, with his mother Pauline Mitchell.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Jon|date=October 2001|title=Getting Along in Cortez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=advocate+getting+along+in+cortez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H415NqlvmE&amp;sig=NrEaNrSqJmqSc3LXWVjTAho1x_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9zt220-bXAhXqj1QKHYwWAcoQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=advocate%20getting%20along%20in%20cortez&amp;f=false|journal=Advocate|issue=848|pages=26–28|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Martinez said that he was often harassed for his identity in school by their peers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Martinez's mother was supportive of his identity as nádleehi as well as his friends in the community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Navajo society is traditionally matrilineal, and Mitchell's open support of her child reflects the respect and understanding found traditionally in Navajo society.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Fred Martinez was killed by Shaun Murphey in June 2001 and it was determined that Murphey's motives were linked to Martinez's identity, Murphey was arrested and sentenced, though it was not ruled as a hate crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2009/11/19/teen-spirit|title=Teen Spirit|last=Goldberg|first=Leslie|date=November 19, 2009|website=Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a documentary that discussed Fred Martinez's case called "Two-Spirit" that explores both Fred Martinez's life and the nádleehi identity in Navajo culture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Role in Navajo society ==
Traditionally, a nádleehi person could choose to take on female roles in society, wear traditionally female clothes and do traditionally female work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some would also choose to also have sexual relations with men and this was accepted by their tribe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A nádleehi person's role and identity could be described as depending on their contextual surroundings, meaning that their identity could change when with different groups of people or in different cultural contexts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The nádleehi identity differs from other two-spirit identities that are specific to other indigenous tribes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to society:

'''[[Society]]''' &amp;ndash; group of people sharing the same geographical or virtual territory and therefore subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Such people share a distinctive [[culture]] and [[institutions]], which characterize the patterns of [[social relations]] between them. Large societies typically develop [[social stratification]] and [[dominance hierarchy|dominance patterns]] among its subgroups. A given society may be described as the sum total of social relationships among its members. The branch of science that studies society is [[sociology]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

*** [[Sociocultural evolution]]

=== Stages of sociocultural evolution ===

[[Sociocultural evolution]] &amp;ndash; below are listed some typical and some ''potential'' stages of progression in the evolution of cultures and societies:
* Pre-civilization
** [[Hunter-gatherer]] [[band society|bands]]
** [[Social rank]]
** [[Tribe]]s
** [[Social stratification]]
** [[Chiefdom]]s
** [[Neolithic Revolution]]
* [[Civilization]]
** [[Pre-industrial society]]
*** [[Agrarian society]]
**** Agrarian [[village]]s
**** [[Town]]s
**** [[City|Cities]]
**** [[City-state]]s
**** [[Nation-state]]s
** [[Industrial Revolution]]
** [[Modernity]]
*** [[Industrial society]]
** [[Postmodernity]]
*** [[Post-industrial society]]  
** [[Informational Revolution]]
** [[Information society]]
*** [[Digital Revolution]]
*** [[Knowledge society]]
** [[Globalization]] &amp;ndash; process by which the world is becoming more interconnected, being integrated into a unified global community, through the interchange &amp;mdash; of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture &amp;mdash; made possible by technological advancements in communication and transportation and the dissemination of knowledge those bring.
** ''[[World government]]?'' &amp;ndash; notion of a single common political authority (global state) for all of humanity. Currently there is no worldwide executive, legislature, judiciary, military, or constitution with jurisdiction over the entire planet. The United Nations is limited to a mostly advisory role, and its stated purpose is to foster cooperation between existing national governments rather than exert authority over them.
* ''[[Space colonization]]?'' &amp;ndash; hypothetical expansion of the human race into outer space: to the moon, to other planets or moons, or in space stations. 
* ''[[Technological singularity]]?'' (TS) &amp;ndash; hypothetical result that may occur if and when [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]] (artificial intelligence at least as smart as a human) is developed. Such AIs would be recursive, and therefore able to improve themselves (or each other) at an increasingly rapid rate to super intelligence. Technological advancements implemented by such entities would probably be so profound and come so quickly that it seems unlikely anyone could reliably forecast what such a future would be like &amp;mdash; like a black hole, a singularity we cannot see.

===Forces of societal change===
* [[Climate change, industry and society]] –
* ''[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]]'' &amp;ndash; James Burke presented in this TV series his hypothesis that the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation.
* [[Conquest (military)|Conquest]] –
* [[Cooperation]] –
* [[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]] –
* [[Disaster]] –
* [[Economic forces]] –
** [[Economic growth]] –
* [[Exploration]] –
* [[Human migration]] – Migration can impact on our identity since it may be difficult to feel a sense of belonging in a new society. Human migration can also introduce new cultural values to a society, (ref: Held, D.,(2004) A globilizing world? Culture, economics and politics, London Routeledge/The Open University)
* Population change
** [[Population decline]] –
** [[Population growth]] –
* [[Revolution]] –
* [[Social conflict]] –
* [[Social disintegration]] –
* [[Social movement]] –
* [[Societal collapse]] –
* [[Technological change]] –

==Study of society: sociology==

[[Outline of sociology]]
* [[Sociology]] – scientific study of society. This social science directs methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis upon human social activity, focusing on the influence of relationships and how they affect attitudes and behaviours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12845">The continued growth and operation of the [[agricultural industry]] in the [[Okanagan]] absolutely depends on the employment of temporary [[migrant worker]]s.&lt;ref name=tomic78&gt;Tomic et al., 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, there were 3,000 Mexican migrant labourers working in the Okanagan.&lt;ref name=tomic78/&gt;

==History==
The racialization of agricultural labour in the [[Okanagan Valley]] is not a recent phenomenon. It has an extensive history, reaching as far back as early settlement by white, predominantly British, [[wikt:colonial|colonials]] in the 1800s.&lt;ref name=lw1&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; The first settlers in the Okanagan region focused primarily on [[cattle ranch]]ing, switching to [[fruit production]] in about the 1890s.&lt;ref name=lw1/&gt; It was this switch to fruit production that started the racialization of agricultural labour in the Okanagan, a lasting legacy that has carried on to the present. Part of its beginnings was the directed promotion of Okanagan Valley towards the wealthier British [[middle class]] as a very fashionable endeavour.&lt;ref name=lw2&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through this rather successful promotional scheme that the Okanagan came to be known for its "whiteness",&lt;ref name=lw2/&gt; an issue that the area continues to be beset with today.&lt;ref&gt;Aguiar et al., 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the influx of British ‘settlers’ many with the goal of establishing fruit [[orchard]]s, migrant [[seasonal labour]] became a pressing issue as there were not enough settlers able or willing to do the manual labour involved in [[harvesting]]. The settler’s solution to this issue was to employ those of other ‘races’ or ethnicities believed by the white population to be better suited to do [[menial]] labour, and hence the beginning of the racialization of agricultural labour in the Okanagan was born.

There were various waves or periods when people of a certain ethnic category, or ‘[[race (classification of humans)|race]]’ were more heavily employed as agricultural labourers then others, largely reflecting the [[political climate]] of the day.&lt;ref name=lw3&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Part III.&lt;/ref&gt; The first racialized groups to be employed as agricultural labourers were [[First Nations]] people and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], with First Nations employment beginning around the 1880s to the present and the Chinese from the early 1900s to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Parts III &amp; IV.&lt;/ref&gt;  Local First Nations groups were often used during the harvesting season of June to October, in addition to migrant First Nations from [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]].&lt;ref name=lw4&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Part IV.&lt;/ref&gt; After the construction of the [[railway]] by Chinese migrant workers, many were left with no work in a foreign land where [[Racism|racist]] fears severely limited the type of work Chinese migrants could do.&lt;ref name=lw3/&gt; It is for this reason that migrant Chinese were segregated into manual agricultural labour until the introduction of the $500 [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]] that effectively stemmed further Chinese migration to Canada.&lt;ref name=lw3/&gt;

When the Chinese and First Nations could no longer fulfil the demands of [[orchardist]]s, they switched to alternate racialized groups. During the [[Interwar period|interwar]] and [[World War II|WWII]] era these groups were predominantly the [[Doukhobor]]s and the [[Japanese people|Japanese]].&lt;ref name=lw56&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Parts V &amp; VI.&lt;/ref&gt;  With many young men off to war there was a gap in agricultural labour that needed to be filled. Reluctantly white orchardists opted to use the forced labour of interned Japanese-Canadians and migrant Doukhobor labour.&lt;ref name=lw56/&gt; Once the Japanese began to move back to the coast after the war and the Doukhobors began to migrate back to their settlements in the [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] area, an agricultural labour gap was once again apparent and in need of filling.

This time it was the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] who became the next racialized agricultural group in the Okanagan agricultural industry.&lt;ref name=lw7&gt;Lanthier &amp; Wong, Part VII.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Portuguese were not nearly as discriminated against as the previous groups had been,&lt;ref name=lw7/&gt; largely due to their country of origin, which was less feared and more acceptable to the primarily white settler population in the Okanagan. From about the 1960s when Portuguese agricultural labour began to decline, migrant labour of young "Québécois"[[French Canadian]]s&lt;ref name="Hugo Couture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theses.ulaval.ca/2009/26151/26151.pdf|title=LES MIGRATIONS SAISONNIÈRES DES QUÉBÉCOIS DANS LES VALLÉES FRUITIÈRES DE LA COLOMBIE-BRITANNIQUE|last=Couture|first=Hugo|year=2009|work=Sociologie|publisher=Université Laval|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to be prominent in the Okanagan agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Tomic et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this labour force too eventually waned, leaving yet another agricultural labour gap. This time labour is coming from much farther away, however, many of the same issues that characterized the Racialized labour of the 20th century remain in the migrant labour needs of [[fruit tree]] agriculture of the Okanagan.

==Latin American migrant workers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}Over the last decade or so,{{When|date=May 2017}} many [[Latin America]]n migrant workers began to arrive in [[British Columbia]] to work in the agricultural industry. The primary reason for the arrival of workers from as far away as [[Mexico]] is to fill the gap the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[farm worker]]s refuse or are unable to fill. As a result, Mexican migrant workers face hardships in the Okanagan agricultural industry. These include, but are not limited to, housing, hours of work, [[employment benefits]], and [[wages]]. In addition, an agreement between the Canadian and Mexican governments was signed and in accordance to this agreement Mexico is to provide Canada with agricultural workers on a seasonal basis. The period lasts for approximately eight months and occurs annually.

===Motivation and perpetuation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}Mexican migrant workers come to the Okanagan to work in the [[agricultural industry]] as a mere means of survival. While there are Canadians who come from the east to enjoy the weather and, at the same time, work in the orchards, some employers claim that they do not have the same [[work ethic]]s as the Mexican migrant workers (see Couture, 2009 cited below for an ethnography of the Young Quebec fruit picker phenomenon). Through the agreement between the Canadian and Mexican governments, migrant workers from Mexico travel to Canada to work, however, once in Canada mobility is made very difficult. Therefore, the men and women who undertake the jobs available in the Canadian agricultural industry cannot change jobs in an effort to earn more to support their families back home.

===Type of work and industry===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}Historically migrant agricultural labour was needed in the Okanagan for tree fruit harvesting, mainly from late June to late October. This typically included the starting of harvest with “[[Cherry|cherries]] in late June, followed by [[apricot]]s and [[peach]]es in July, the continuation of peaches, [[prune]]s, and some varieties of [[pear]]s in August, pears, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s in September, and finally more grapes in October”.  Migrant labour is only need during these various harvesting periods for relatively short periods of time. While many of these same fruits continue to be grown in the Okanagan today,{{When|date=May 2017}} a much larger focus has been given to [[vineyard]]s with the burgeoning of the [[wine]] industry in the Okanagan in recent years.{{When|date=May 2017}} Cherries and apple production continue to remain dominant in agricultural production in the Okanagan Valley as well.

The migrant workers are assigned to jobs in orchards and vineyards that entail picking, fertilizing and caring for the plants. Also, processing the produce is their task. In other words, the migrant workers in the Okanagan agricultural industry have to perform the tedious jobs that the industry offers. Consequently, these migrant workers are not usually assigned administrative tasks.

===Separation of families===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}There are many problems that Mexican migrant workers face in the agricultural industry in the Okanagan Valley. First, they are separated from their families who are at times difficult to connect with through the use of the [[telephone]]. In addition to their low wages earned workers have to purchase [[phone card]]s; however, the transportation to and from the store to make that purchase is not easily accessible because workers are located on the outskirts of town where orchards and vineyards are typically located relying solely on the employer for transportation. In the Okanagan Valley, an employer claimed that he would not pay a driver to take only 15 workers to town to pick up personal items. In other words, workers may have to spend their days off on location unless they all decide to go to town at the same time. The other alternative for them to get needed items from [[shopping]] areas is by way of foot, often at great distances.

==2010 developments==
On June 15, 2010, three hundred Mexicans marched on the Canadian Embassy in [[Mexico City]] to protest unfair treatment of Mexican migrant workers in Canada under the [[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]]. According to the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] Union, the largest private union in Canada, "Under SAWP, migrant agriculture workers are typically paid [[minimum wage]] and are often subject to working and housing conditions that Canadian residents would find intolerable. SAWP workers have historically been hesitant to report dangerous working conditions or hostile employers for fear of being sent home or blacklisted from returning the next season."&lt;ref&gt;UFCW, "Migrant Workers march..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the UFCW’s 2009–2010 report on the "Status of Migrant Farm Workers in Canada" found the conditions under which Mexican temporary workers are employed to be unacceptable.

“The denial of human rights should not be the foundation for Canada’s food supply system”, said UFCW Canada and AWA president Wayne Hanley. “But as the report details, that’s exactly what’s happening to migrant farm workers. Even worse, it’s happening with the blessing of the federal government which turns a blind eye to the dangers and abuse migrants are forced to accept if they want to keep their jobs.”&lt;ref&gt;UFCW, "2010-2011 Migrant farm workers report published".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{VG Industry}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}

The inclusion of '''sex and nudity in video games''' has been a controversial topic since the early days of [[video game industry|the industry]]. While many [[video game]]s have used scantily clad images or characters to sell or enhance games, some go further, using [[Human sexual activity|sex acts]] or [[nudity]] as a character motivation, in-game reward, or simply as a gameplay element. These games originate worldwide, on most [[computing platform|platforms]] and can be of any [[video game genre]]. While releases in Europe and North America have been sporadic and often unlicensed, Japan has seen the emergence of a pornographic video game subgenre—[[eroge]], first appearing on the [[NEC PC-88]] computer platform in the 1980s. In the 1990s [[NEC]] (on the [[PC Engine]] series and [[PC-FX]]) and [[Sega]] (on [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]]) were the only companies who officially allowed sexual content on their consoles in Japan, but eroge was more prevalent on the [[NEC PC-98]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.

==History==
===1980s===
One of the earliest video games (if not the first) to feature sexual themes was the 1981 [[text adventure|text-based]] ''[[Softporn Adventure]]'', published by [[On-Line Systems]] for the [[Apple II]]. Despite heavy piracy the game still sold 25,000 copies, roughly equivalent to 25% of the number of Apple II's sold at the time. In a 1981 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', On-Line reported that they were making a version of the game for straight women, though this never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever Softporn Adventure Is the Best Sex Crazed Text Adventure Ever - UGO.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201004424/http://www.ugo.com/games/softporn-adventure-best-game-ever |date=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Japan's [[Koei]], founded by husband-and-wife team [[Yoichi Erikawa|Yoichi]] and [[Keiko Erikawa]] (and later known for [[strategy video game]]s), released the first erotic computer game with sexually explicit graphics, ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]'',&lt;ref name=Retro&gt;[http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers3.htm Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier], Hardcore Gaming 101, reprinted from ''[[Retro Gamer]]'', Issue 67, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; an early [[graphic adventure game]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew T.|date=December 2005|title=The Impact of Telepresence on Cultural Transmission through Bishoujo Games|journal=PsychNology Journal|volume=3|issue=3|pages=292–311|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ3(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_3_3_JONES.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1720-7525}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[NEC PC-8801]]. That same year, Koei released another erotic title, ''Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku'' (''Seduction of the Condominium Wife''),&lt;ref name=Pesimo/&gt; which was an early [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danchizuma no Yuuwaku|publisher=Legendra|url=http://www.legendra.com/rpg/fiche-rpg_id-3276-rpg-danchizuma_no_yuuwaku.html#fichesr_33_3276|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danchi-zuma no Yuuwaku|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/fm7/rpg/danchizumanoyuuwaku/index.html|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[adventure game]] with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the [[PC-8000 Series|NEC PC-8001]] computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company.&lt;ref name=Pesimo&gt;{{cite book|author=Pesimo, Rudyard Contretas|chapter='Asianizing' Animation in Asia: Digital Content Identity Construction Within the Animation Landscapes of Japan and Thailand|title=Reflections on the Human Condition: Change, Conflict and Modernity - The Work of the 2004/2005 API Fellows|year=2007|publisher=The Nippon Foundation|pages=124–160|chapterurl=http://www.apimal.org/blogcms/media/13/File/Pesimo.pdf|deadurl=yes|url=http://www.apimal.org/blogcms/media/13/File/Pesimo.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904050744/http://www.apimal.org/blogcms/media/13/File/Pesimo.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1982, the [[video game company]] [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] released three unlicensed games for the [[Atari 2600]]; ''[[Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em]]'', ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', and ''[[Bachelor Party (video game)|Bachelor Party]]''. The games were [[List of video games notable for negative reception|noted for their negative reception]], particularly ''Custer's Revenge'' for its depiction of (what was perceived as) [[George Armstrong Custer|General Custer]] raping [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] women. Despite the increased sales (due to one of the first instances of [[video game controversy]]), Mystique went out of business after only releasing these three games. A company named [[Playaround]] began distributing these games packaged in 2-in-1 "double-ender" cartridges. These games also included re-worked versions with female protagonists, ''Philly Flasher'' (''Beat 'Em &amp; Eat 'Em''), ''Bachelorette Party'' (''Bachelor Party''), and ''General Retreat'' (''Custer's Revenge''). The re-released version of ''Custer's Revenge'' was titled ''Westward Ho!'', and featured slight modifications, such as the Native American woman beckoning to indicate that she welcomed Custer's advances. They released four new titles, ''Burning Desire/Jungle Fever'' and ''Cathouse Blues/Gigolo''. 1983 saw the release of another Atari 2600 game, ''[[X-Man (Atari 2600 video game)|X-Man]]''. ''X-man'' features the player as a nude man working through a maze toward a pink door in the center, past antagonistic crabs, teeth and scissors. Players that reached the pink door were rewarded with a controllable [[sex scene]].

Like with Koei, several other now-famous Japanese companies such as [[Enix]], [[Square (company)|Square]] and [[Nihon Falcom]] also released erotic adult games for the [[PC-8801]] computer in the early 1980s before they became mainstream. Early eroge usually had simplistic stories and extreme sexual content, such as [[rape]] and types [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]], hentai, [[Lolicon]]. These factors often led to widespread condemnation from the Japanese media.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In some of the early erotic games, the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storyline, though others often used it as simply an excuse for pornography.&lt;ref name=Retro/&gt; Erotic games made the PC-8801 popular, but customers quickly tired of paying 8800 yen ($85) for such simple games. Soon, new genres were invented. ASCII's ''Chaos Angels,'' a [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] eroge, inspired titles such as ''[[Dragon Knight (hentai)|Dragon Knight]]'' by Elf and ''[[Rance (hentai)|Rance]]'' by [[AliceSoft]].

In 1983, a company called Entertainment Enterprises, Ltd., released an arcade game called ''Swinging Singles'' which was mostly meant for [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[Sex shop|adult stores]] and [[sex club]]s. The game requires the player to drive through the city maze gathering dots like [[Pac-Man]] before reaching a [[brothel]] where the player is required to fight off [[Sexually transmitted infection|venereal disease]] and collect keys to unlock sex scenes. Once the scenes are unlocked the top door is open where the player can go and engage in a controllable sex scene letting the player have intercourse with a woman until the player reaches [[orgasm]] and the game is over.

Also released in 1984 was Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance for the Commodore 64 which was created by Artworx Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamefaqs.com/c64/934689-strip-poker-a-sizzling-game-of-chance/data|title=Strip Poker: A Sizzling Game of Chance Release Information for Commodore 64 - GameFAQs|website=www.gamefaqs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Martech]] released a Strip Poker game featuring digitized pictures of [[Samantha Fox]], on the Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad. The same company would later release the controversial ''[[Vixen (video game)|Vixen]]'', featuring another page 3 model [[Corinne Russell]].

Also in 1986 On-line Systems (now called [[Sierra On-Line]]) asked [[game designer]] [[Al Lowe]] to create an adult game in the [[graphical adventure]] style made popular by their ''[[King's Quest]]'' series. Lowe took the basic elements of ''Softporn Adventure'', greatly expanded it, and released it as the 1987 game ''[[Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards]]''. Sierra didn't advertise the game and retailers were loath to carry it, so initial sales were low. However [[word-of-mouth]] spread and soon the [[Leisure Suit Larry]] series was a success, spawning two sequels before the end of the decade, 1988's ''[[Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)]]'', and 1989's  ''[[Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals]]''.

===1990s===
With [[CD-ROM]] and multimedia based games in the 1990s, most adult games featured video clips with limited interactivity. Both pre-rendered and real-time 3D graphics were also used. While most games could be considered nothing more than [[pornography]], some attempted to include actual story and plot. This can be seen in some games with less explicit content, equal to an R or PG-13 rated movie.

1990 saw the release of the first game in the ''[[Gals Panic]]'' series. The game derived gameplay elements off an older title called ''[[Qix]]'', which didn't have sexual images. The object of the games is to slowly remove pieces of the playing field while avoiding an enemy or groups of enemies. Removing the playing field slowly reveals pictures of [[glamour model|model]]s in escalating states of undress. The game had nine sequels throughout the 1990s (with a final game in 2002).

In 1992, Elf released ''[[Dōkyūsei]]''. In it, before any eroticism, the user has to first win the affection of one of a number of female characters, making the story into an [[interactive fiction|interactive romance novel]]. Thus, the [[dating simulation|love simulation]] genre was invented. Soon afterwards, the video game ''Otogirisou'' on the [[Super Famicom]] attracted the attention of many Japanese gamers. ''Otogirisou'' was a standard adventure game but had multiple endings. This concept was called a "sound novel."

In 1996, the new software publisher [[Leaf (company)|Leaf]] expanded on this idea, calling it a [[visual novel]] and releasing their first successful game, ''[[Shizuku]],'' a horror story starring a rapist high school student, with very highly reviewed writing and music. Their next game, ''[[Kizuato]],'' was almost as dark. However, in 1997, they released ''[[To Heart]],'' a sweetly sentimental story of high school love.

In the West, [[Voyeur_(video_game)|Voyeur]] by Philips came out in 1996 for their [[Philips CD-i|CD-i console]]. While the game does not show any explicit nudity, it allows the player to spy on several characters in lingerie, foreplay, and explores taboos such as BDSM and incest.

After a similar game by [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]], ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]],'' became a hit in 1998, [[Visual Art's]] scouted main creative staff of ''One'' to form a new brand under them, which became [[Key (company)|Key]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1999, Key released ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]''. It contains about 7 brief erotic scenes in a sentimental story the size of a long novel (an all-ages version was also released afterward). ''Kanon'' sold over 300,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sega.jp/psp/kanon/|title=''Kanon'' 深い雪に覆われた街で語られる、小さな奇跡の物語|trans-title=''Kanon'' A Story Told in a Profound, Snow Covered Town, a Story of a Small Miracle |publisher=[[Sega]]|accessdate= January 10, 2007|language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429002509/http://sega.jp/psp/kanon/ |archivedate=April 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a 13-episode anime series was produced, as well as another 24-episode anime series in 2006. Although many eroge still market themselves primarily on sex, eroge that focus on story are now a major established part of Japanese [[otaku]] culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In response to increasing pressure from Japanese [[lobby group]]s, in mid-1996 [[Sega of Japan]] announced that they would no longer permit [[Sega Saturn]] games to include nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Svensson|first=Christian |title=Sega Sees Naked Truth |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
{{update-section|date=October 2017}}
Modern console publishers often have policies against depictions of nudity and explicit sexuality, particularly [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] with its [[PlayStation]] brand of consoles. ''[[BMX XXX]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] was censored in the American release, while versions on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] were not and featured nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/06/why-sony-censored-bmx-xxx|title=Why Sony Censored BMX XXX|first=I. G. N.|last=Staff|date=6 November 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sony allowed nudity in the title ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', which was also developed by Sony.

Sex scenes and nudity have also appeared in Quantic Dream's Fahrenheit (aka Indigo Prophecy) and Heavy Rain, released for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=David |title=10 Most cringeworthy video game sex scenes |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/10-most-cringeworthy-video-game-sex-scenes/ |website=Gamesraider |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=EN-US |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new generation of adult social games has emerged that bring multiple users together in sexual environments. Examples include ''[[Red Light Center]], [[Singles: Flirt Up Your Life]]'' and ''[[Playboy: The Mansion]]''. While it is not explicitly intended for purely adult-oriented entertainment, the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is made up almost entirely of player-made content, has an array of very exotic adult entertainment including nudity and full-on sexual activities.

Adult games may take the form of [[copyright infringement|bootleg]]s, circumventing mainstream publishers who may have policies against such games. [[Patch (computing)|Patch]]es or [[Hack (technology slang)|hacks]] to mainstream non-adult games may add sexual and pornographic themes, mostly for [[humor]], especially when sexuality was never intended in the original game. Examples include the ''[[Tomb Raider (series)|Tomb Raider]]'' video games, the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' [[Hot Coffee mod]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and 
''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', (which both have multiple such mods), [[Half-Life 2]]'s FakeFactory Cinematic Mod and [[read-only memory|ROM]] hacks for console [[emulator]]s.

The Internet has allowed adult games to receive wider availability and recognition, including amateur games in Flash or Java. It has also allowed amateurs to create and distribute adult text adventure games, known as "Adult Interactive Fiction" or AIF.&lt;ref name=Apophis/&gt;

'''Sex for Fish''' sometimes referred to as "Fish for Sex" is a phenomenon in which female traders engage in sexual relationships with fishermen to secure their supply of fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2007.05.010 |title=Women and Fish-for-Sex: Transactional Sex, HIV/AIDS and Gender in African Fisheries |year=2008 |last1=Béné |first1=Christophe |last2=Merten |first2=Sonja |journal=World Development |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=875–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women fish traders are often pressured into having sex with the fishermen who supply them with daily fresh fish. Along the beaches where the sex for fish practices have been observed, the fishermen do maintain several transactional sexual relationships with women at different beaches where they land with their fish.
 
Sex for Fish as a phenomenon is common in many low and middle income developing countries; however, the bulk cases have been observed in Sub-Saharan Africa’s inland fisheries. The most vulnerable victims are economically disadvantaged women, e.g. single or divorced women as well as widows residing in along the shores of inland fisheries centers.

Several social-economic factors including poverty, cultural practices, and competition among women who are involved in fish trade are often listed as variables fueling the sex for fish practice. There is no conclusive research that shows what promotes sex for fish practice, however, fishermen seem to be taking advantage of stiff competition between the women who trade in fish to demand sexual favors in exchange for the fish. The men or the trader who receives sexual favors would grant preferential sale and sale at reduced prices to these women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cg7UT6fBpk |title=Sex for Fish - Kenya |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in [[Kenya]], women have been observed giving out empty polythene bags to the fishermen before they go out fishing at night or early morning, and when the fishermen return, some of the best catch would be set aside for them, stashed in these bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/aeap.2013.25.3.216 |title=Jaboyavs.Jakambi: Status, Negotiation, and HIV Risks Among Female Migrants in the "Sex for Fish" Economy in Nyanza Province, Kenya |year=2013 |last1=Camlin |first1=Carol S. |last2=Kwena |first2=Zachary A. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Shari L. |journal=AIDS Education and Prevention |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=216–31 |pmid=23631716 |pmc=3717412}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fishermen take advantage of these economically and social disadvantaged women by offering preferential treatment in fish business in exchange for sex.

==Poverty==
In Kenya where sex for fish has been well documented, poverty among the fishing communities has been constantly listed as factors contributing to the practice of sex for fish. Sex for fish practice in Kenya is popularly referred to as Jaboya system. Jaboya in Luo tribe dialect means customer, however, due to the transactional involvement of fishermen with women fish traders, the locals coined the term Jaboya system to refer to sex for fish phenomenon. Fishmongers in lake side city of [[Kisumu]], have sex with fishermen to get stock to sell in order to make a living. They have alluded to having children to feed and having to pay rent and school fees as drivers for exchange of sex for fish. In Kenya’s third largest city of Kisumu, Dunga Beach along the shores of Lake Victoria young girls have become the new attraction for fishermen who use their fish catch as a bait to lure these vulnerable group into sex for fish practice fees.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/country/ke/kenya |title=IRIN &amp;#124; Africa &amp;#124; East Africa &amp;#124; Kenya |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of poverty and vulnerable ensures that older women introduces their younger daughters or orphaned girls to sex for fish trade. In return the young girl sleeps with the fisherman that offers the best deal. In many cases the young girls do have sex with multiple partners and are exposed to STD’s and potentially HIV infections.&lt;ref name="irinnews1" /&gt;

==Exploitation of gay men==
In September 2012, a Kenyan TV station reported incidents where gay men exchange sex for fish. This occurs due to poor catch or for money. The economically weak gay men have been become the latest group to be involved in sex for fish within the fishing communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |title=Anal Sex For Fish In Kisumu: The Invisible Bridge Final Part |publisher=Identitykenya.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217090019/http://identitykenya.com/index.php/daily-news/709-anal-sex-for-fish-in-kisumu-the-invisible-bridge-final-part |archivedate=2013-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS prevalence==
Some of the earliest recorded cases of [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa were in fishing communities around Lake Victoria in 1982. Several studies have shown a link between sex for fish phenomenon and higher HIV prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qui1whVeqX4 |title=Sex for fish: How fishing is fueling the spread of HIV/Aids in Homabay |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-12-26 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kenya]], it is assumed that ‘Sex for Fish’ contributes to the high HIV/AIDS prevalence along the lake region, where it is double the national average.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtzpsda.co.ke/download.php?filename=psda_downloads/_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf&amp;name=_Menn%20%20Anyango_vf.pdf |title=Omena fishery and 'Sex for Fish' at Lake Victoria |publisher=Gtzpsda.co.ke |accessdate=2013-11-23 |author=Dr. Iris Menn and Elizabeth Anyango}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenya Modes of Transmission Study 2008 had put prevalence in the fishing communities at between 25 percent and 30 percent in Nyanza province in Kenya.&lt;ref name="irinnews1"/&gt; This prevalence level was double Nyanza province in general infection rate of 15.3 percent, which was nearly the national average. The effect of HIV transmission is made worse by the fact that these women have no control over the use of condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of the HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

In [[Uganda]], studies conducted around [[Lake George (Uganda)|Lake George]] and [[Lake Edward]] by the [[Uganda Fisheries and Fish Conservation Association]] (UFFCA), found that the HIV/AIDS prevalence average rate was at 22.4 percent against the national prevalence of 7.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancap.org/en/news-global/1723-uganda-sex-for-fish-common-as-hiv-reaches-22-percent.html |title=Uganda: 'Sex for Fish' Common As HIV Reaches 22 Percent |publisher=Pancap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex for fish is considered by many leaders and researchers as one of the reasons that have led to higher than average HIV/AIDS prevalence amongst these fisher communities.

In [[Mangochi]], [[Malawi]], sex is a vibrant part of fishing and research has shown a strong link between HIV prevalence and sex for fish trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7448/IAS.15.3.17364 |title=Transactional sex and HIV: Understanding the gendered structural drivers of HIV in fishing communities in Southern Malawi |year=2012 |last1=MacPherson |first1=Eleanor E |last2=Sadalaki |first2=John |last3=Njoloma |first3=Macdonald |last4=Nyongopa |first4=Victoria |last5=Nkhwazi |first5=Lawrence |last6=Mwapasa |first6=Victor |last7=Lalloo |first7=David G |last8=Desmond |first8=Nicola |last9=Seeley |first9=Janet |last10=Theobald |first10=Sally |journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society |volume=15 |issue=3 Suppl 1 |pmid=22713352 |pages=1–9 |pmc=3499929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactional sex is common in Malawian fishing communities, with women identified as vulnerable in negotiations because of existing gendered power structures.  Men carrying out the fishing, therefore men controls factors of production, and women processing, drying and selling the fish. The control of factors of production by men, the power dynamics in these exchanges favour men and make it more difficult for women to negotiate safe sex.
The Malawian NGO, [[Youth Net and Counselling]] (YONECO) that works to combat the spread of HIV infection in Malawi, observed that despite increased awareness on HIV and AIDS in Malawi, fishermen on Lake Chilwa are queuing for sex. This was disclosed by fishermen who were trained by YONECO as peer educators during a monitoring visit the organization made to Mposa in Machinga district. The reports indicate that a total of 25 fishermen would line up to have sex with one woman in exchange of 15 dozen fish if no condom is used during sexual intercourse or 3 dozen fish if a condom is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb7WF4OJaG0#t=82]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kafue Flats]] region of [[Zambia]] sex for fish exchange increased the spread of HIV/AIDS rapidly between the years 2002-2005.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Interventions==

===U.S. Peace Corps===
In 2010, two [[Peace Corps]] volunteers, Dominik Mucklow and Michael Geilhufe who lived near Lake Victoria decided to do something to help the women who were trapped in sex for fish practice. With support from the U.S. [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) funding, they assisted a group of women fish traders to acquire their own fishing boats. The women then employed men to go fishing using these boats. This simple advancement allowed women to be free from sexual exploitation in order to secure their fish supply.&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"&gt;{{cite web|author=World Connect, US |url=http://www.worldconnect-us.org/discoverprojects/sex-fish-nyamware/ |title=No Sex for Fish: Nyamware &amp;#124; World Connect |publisher=Worldconnect-us.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No sex for fish aimed to change the work dynamic between the women and the men who make their living from the fishing industry by giving women ownership of the means of production, boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/94497/Kenya-Helping-Wowen-to-end-sex-for-fish-culture |title=IRIN Africa &amp;#124; KENYA: Helping women to end sex-for-fish culture &amp;#124; Kenya &amp;#124; Economy &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; HIV/AIDS (PlusNews) &amp;#124; Prevention - PlusNews |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women own the boats, as the women work they repay the cost of building the boat, then the boat repayment money is pooled to construct more boats; increasing the number of women involved. The pilot project was managed by the [[Victoria Institute for Research on Environment and Development]] (Vired).&lt;ref name="worldconnect-us1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26186194 Kenya's battle to end 'sex for fish' trade], BBC News, Mark Lowen, 17 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merlin===
An organization that brings together local leaders and community members, Merlin has created several theatre groups in Western Kenya that perform skits and plays that deal with the issues that the sex for fish (Jaboya System) practice brings. The shows take place once per month, and coincide with the return of the fishermen to the beach. The shows typically draw large crowds on the beach, and end with a discussion, as well as condom distribution to the fishermen. Local people believe that the shows are getting the local community to change their thinking about the Jaboya system, and ultimately their behaviour as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Okwiri|first=Caroline|title=Jaboya System|url=http://www.jaluo.com/wangwach/1106/Caroline_Okwiri111506.html|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Deadly Catch'' film==
''Deadly Catch'' is a film that was produced by [[IRIN]] that centers around the fishing community located outside of [[Bondo, Kenya]]. It shows how the HIV virus has affected different people in various ways, focusing on those both directly involved with the jaboya system, and those that have lost family members due to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KENYA: Deadly Catch: Lake Victoria's AIDS crisis|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61001|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=IRIN|date=10 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''shooting of Abdullahi '''"'''Abdi'''"''' Omar Mohamed''' occurred in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], on February 27, 2016. Mohamed, a 17-year-old [[Somalis|Somali]] refugee, was shot and injured by police after allegedly being involved in a confrontation with another person. Mohamed was armed with a metal broomstick, and was asked to drop it by responding officers. The shooting led to protests, immediate civil unrest, and later controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triblive.com/usworld/nation/10067844-74/police-officers-footage |title=Body camera footage withheld in Salt Lake City shooting |work=Tribune Live |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 2016, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's office declined to file charges against the officers involved. The shooting was recorded on officers' body cameras and the footage was released to the public after it was shown in court on January 23, 2017.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Jessica Miller: [http://www.sltrib.com/home/4854062-155/body-cam-footage-shows-2016-police Body-cam footage shows 2016 police shooting of Abdi Mohamed outside SLC homeless shelter.] [[The Salt Lake Tribune]], Jan 23 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abdi Mohamed==
Mohamed was born in April 1998 in [[Somalia]],&lt;ref name="McCombs"/&gt; and had lived in a [[refugee camp]] in [[Kenya]]. He moved to Utah with his family when he was six years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Whitehurst, Lindsay|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/17-year-old-shot-by-police-in-utah-had-fled-violence-in-somali-refugee-camp/2016/03/05/86e94d72-e319-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html|title=17-year-old shot by police in Utah had fled violence in Somali refugee camp|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=March 5, 2016|accessdate=March 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The shooting and unrest==
At 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Mohamed became involved in an altercation with another man at 200 South Rio Grande Street in downtown Salt Lake City when officers were called to the scene. According to Salt Lake County prosecutors, Mohamed was involved in a fight after a failed drug deal and dispute over $1.10 near a homeless shelter. A man had come into the homeless shelter to obtain food, and asked Mohamed for marijuana, but he only had [[methamphetamine]]. Mohamed then demanded the man's money. Mohamed was holding a metal broomstick at the time, and had used it to hit the other man at least once. Responding officers asked Mohamed to drop the broomstick at least ten times. When he did not drop the broomstick and appeared to try to hit the man again, he was shot four times by officers Kory Checketts and Jordan Winegar. Mohamed's family disputed the claim, and his cousin, Muslima Weledi, said that witnesses told her Mohamed was armed with a wooden broomstick. The man battered with the broomstick received welts and bruises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/02/28/salt-lake-police-battle-rock-throwers-after-shooting/81068444/ |title=Salt Lake police battle rock throwers after shooting |work=USA Today |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCombs"/&gt; Abdullahi was left in critical condition.

Following the shooting, many locals in the downtown area began to throw rocks and bottles at police. The police deployed 100 riot officers and barricaded four city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-salt-lake-city-police-shooting-20160229-story.html |title=Salt Lake City police shooting raises questions |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Mohamed became [[coma]]tose following his injuries, and had awoken from his medically-induced coma on March 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crothers, Don|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2886331/abdi-mohamed-awakens-from-coma/|title=Abdi Mohamed: Teen shot by Salt Lake City police awakens from coma|publisher=[[The Inquisitr]]|date=March 13, 2016|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal proceedings===
On August 8, 2016, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said that no charges would be filed against officers Kory Checketts and Jordan Winegar. He said that the two officers believed that Mohamed was about to seriously injure or kill a man with a metal broom handle.&lt;ref name="McCombs"&gt;{{cite web|author=McCombs, Brady|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-shooting-wounded-utah-teen-ruled-justified-41209328|title=Prosecutor: Police Shooting That Wounded Utah Teen Justified|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=August 8, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the shooting was recorded on the officers' body cameras, prosecutors declined to release the footage to the public until January 2017. Mohamed faces charges in juvenile court of aggravated robbery and possessing drugs with an intent to distribute after officers said they found [[methamphetamine]] in his pocket.&lt;ref name="McCombs"/&gt;  On January 23, 2017, a preliminary hearing was held in juvenile court.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; In June 2017, Mohamed was released from the juvenile court system with a $500 fee. As part of the plea bargain, he admitted to aggravated assault and drug possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vaifanua |first=Tamara |url=http://fox13now.com/2017/06/23/judge-closes-case-involving-teen-shot-by-police-outside-homeless-shelter-in-slc/ |title=Judge closes case involving teen shot by police outside homeless shelter in SLC |date=June 24, 2017|work=Fox 13 News |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Protests followed in the days after the incident, criticizing the police's use of force. On February 29, 1,000 people rallied and marched in Salt Lake City. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] criticized the police use of force and riot removal tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/salt-lake-city-withhold-footage-police-shooting-37283308 |title=Salt Lake City Police Shooting Triggers Protest, Questions |work=abc NEWS |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=38712730 |title=Hundreds rally in downtown Salt Lake to protest police shooting of teen |work=KSL.com |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group, Utah Against Police Brutality, planned to protest on August 9 in downtown Salt Lake City, in response to the district attorney's decision to not file charges against the officers involved.&lt;ref name="McCombs"/&gt;

Но учреждения, на которые было возложено решение  еврейской проблемы, категорически отвергли это мнение профессора. Им  казалась более верной точка зрения вышеназванного института. Свой вывод  они обосновывали тем, что и советские власти относят эти народности к  евреям. Проф. Г. Киттель, к которому также обратились за консультацией,  ответил, что вопрос сложный и ответить на него можно только проведя  исследование на месте. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406181555/http://istok.ru/library/jewish-education/history/highland/jews_9811.html |archivedate=2015-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslims|Muslim]] and number about 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Ludwig (1998a).

Starting from the Middle Ages, the term ''Tati'' was used not only for the Caucasus but also for northwestern Iran, where it was extended to almost all of the local Iranian languages except Persian and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].{{cn|date=March 2015}}

Currently, the term ''Tati'' and ''Tati language'' is used to refer to a particular group of north-western Iranian dialects (Chali, Danesfani, Hiaraji, Hoznini, Esfarvarini, Takestani, Sagzabadi, Ebrahimabadi, Eshtehardi, Hoini, Kajali, Shahroudi, Harzani) in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]], as well as south of it in the provinces of [[Qazvīn Province|Qazvin]] and [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Языки мира.

}} is a derogatory term of the [[Italian language]] to designate an inhabitant of [[Southern Italy]]. 

The term comes from an [[agent noun]] formed from the word {{lang|it|terra}} ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "land"). In fact it was historically used, after the [[unification of Italy|Italian unification]], to describe the [[landlord]]s of the former [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], highlighting the fact that they profited from a land property (the so-called {{wiktit|latifondo}}) without working and until the 1950s it kept the meaning of "peasant", "person working the land". It was not until the [[Italian economic miracle]], when a great number of Southerners migrated to the industrial centers of [[Northern Italy]], that it began to be used (often as a slur) to indicate people from Southern Italy, who were mostly peasants back then. This epithet often designates negative personal characteristics, such as laziness and ignorance. Similarly, with particular reference to some slang, the term has taken on the meaning of an uncouth person lacking in good manners, like the word {{lang|it|cafone}}.
 
In addition, the term is generally associated with certain somatic, phenotypical and physical traits, such as [[olive skin]], short stature, high cheeks and other characteristics typical of the stereotype attached to Southern Italians.

'''''The ABC of Sex Education for Trainables''''' is a 1975 [[short film|short]] [[educational film]] hosted by Richard Dix.  It was intended to inform people about the need to educate the [[mentally disabled]] ("trainables" as they are referred to in the film) about [[sex]] and sexuality.  Reflecting the views held at the time, the film explains that "trainables" cannot learn in the same manner as those of normal intelligence, but must instead be trained through repetition.

==Background==
The 20 minute video places a high priority on teaching the intellectually disabled about sex so that they will not make inappropriate sexual comments, expose parts of their bodies, [[masturbate]] in public, be involved in unplanned pregnancies, or become victims of rape or molestation. It also notes that the goal of teachers should be to explain sexuality in a factual manner, and that views of sexual morality vary between families and should therefore be left for parents to teach.

The movie is used in "Timmy and the Sex Lesson", an episode of [[The Residents]]' video series ''[[Timmy (The Residents)|Timmy]]''.

==Cast==
The onscreen credits acknowledge that narration was provided by Richard Dix and that dramatic sequences were provided by William Block, M.D., Beverly Camp, Rick Fullerton, Peter Green, Michael Kowalski, Ellen Moats, George Murray, Aaron Orenstein, Christopher Reidy, Murray Zeligman, and members and staff of the Ronald Bruce Nippon Assoc., and [[Planned Parenthood]] of [[Southeastern Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="google video"&gt;{{cite av media | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2987243478639579087# | title=The ABC's of Sex education for trainables | location=[[Sonar Entertainment|Hallmark Films, Inc.]] credited as studio within the opening 18 seconds, and the onscreen credits role after 19 minutes | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182015/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2987243478639579087 | archivedate=2011-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scenes from the movie ==

*The opening sequence is of a girl (presumably a mentally disabled person) walking down the street. She is approached by a man in a car who leans out of his window and plays with her hair. She then gets in the back seat of his car and rides away.
*A group of teachers are in a workshop together. The instructor encourages the teachers to yell out different [[slang]] terms for the penis while she writes them on a chalkboard. This is intended to make the teachers more comfortable with the words so that they will not be embarrassed to teach mentally disabled children about sex.
*A man sits with a mentally disabled young man and explains to him about how penises become erect using several drawings.
*A man comes into a boy's bedroom, asking him why he has not yet left his bed. The boy replies: "I'm all wet and sticky!". The man proceeds to explain to the boy what a [[wet dream]] is and says he will help him clean up.
*A woman comes into her son's bedroom unannounced and discovers him masturbating. She then explains to him that it is good that he is doing it in private, that it feels good, and that someday she and he will have to talk about it and then leaves the room.

==Reception==
In 2001, ''[[DVD Talk]]'' reviewed the Fantoma Films "Educational Archives" series, ''Sex &amp; Drugs'', and noted ''The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables'' as among those included, writing the film had the "impact of ''[[Freaks]]''" and that it was intended to "guide teachers in mental institutions, who must try to train (not teach) those patients considered 'trainable', to know enough about their bodies and sex to neither be anti-social nor victimized in public."  They commented upon the film addressing the issues directly by its showing "some very dedicated teachers taking on a really tough job."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s358educate.html | title=Sex and Drugs breakdown- The ABC of Sex-Ed for Trainables | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Glenn Erickson | date=November 13, 2001 | work=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When they reviewed the [[DVD]] compilation "Educational Archives" ''School Locker'' in 2006, they made note that collections of educational films from Fantoma "included the best of the best in educational films", and that it was "hard to top marvels like ''The ABCs of Sex Education for Trainables''," and that while this later compilation was not without merit, "it pales in comparison with the earlier releases."&lt;ref name="dvdtalk2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/22988/educational-archives-school-locker/ | title=Educational Archives - School Locker | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Francis Rizzo III | date=August 1, 2006 | work=[[DVD Talk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[DVD Verdict]]'' wrote that the film was "the flip side of all those sex education films directed at children", in how the "well-meaning short teaches teachers how to handle sex education for "retardates," or the developmentally disabled." They noted that the film tended to be more graphic when compared to the other films included on the "Educational Archives" series, ''Sex &amp; Drugs'', and though it tried "very hard to take its subject seriously. Nevertheless, it comes across as very surreal."&lt;ref name="dvdverdict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/sexanddrugs.php | title=review: Sex And Drugs (Educational Archives Volume I) | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Mike Pinsky | date=April 4, 2002 | work=[[DVD Verdict]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710160729/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/sexanddrugs.php | archivedate=July 10, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digitally Obsessed'' wrote that the ''ABC of Sex Education for Trainables'' was "produced by Planned Parenthood to train teachers of developmentally-challenged young adults (called "trainables" here) about their bodies, reproduction, and the place of sexual relations in society."  They noted that the film had a few scenes considered (in 2001) as humorous, but that the film "actually does the best job of dealing with the issues of sex in context with society," in how it dealt with such issues as anatomy, aspects of normal development and sexual maturity, the appropriateness of public masturbation, and being aware of exploitation, with the subjects "handled with tact and matter of factness."  They concluded that stylistic problems aside, the film was "quite an interesting piece on what would present a real challenge to those caring for developmentally-challenged individuals, and their responsibilities as sexual beings." and that of the films making up the compilation, it was "the most educational, and least condescending sex education film of the lot."&lt;ref name="digitallyobsessed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=1905 | title=review: The Educational Archives: Volume 1—Sex &amp; Drugs | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | author=Jeff Ulmer | date=November 22, 2001 | work=Digitally Obsessed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No copies of this serial’s “chapters” have been found, so the overall production is currently classified as a [[lost film]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/D/DiamondFromTheSky1915.html |title=Progressive Silent Film List: ''The Diamond from the Sky'' |publisher=silentera.com |accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The prologue in the serial's first episode, "A Heritage of Hate", depicts the discovery of a spectacular diamond inside a [[meteorite]], a gem that later becomes the property of the Stanley family, who call their heirloom “The Diamond From the Sky”. The remainder of the first chapter portrays the intense rivalry between Colonel Arthur Stanley and [[Judge]] Lamar Stanley, [[Virginia]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and descendants of Lord Arthur Stanley, 200 years later.

When a girl is born to the young wife of Colonel Arthur Stanley, the latter, to retain an [[earldom]] and “The Diamond From the Sky,” buys a new born [[Romani people|Gypsy]] baby boy and substitutes it for his own babe. Judge Lamar Stanley visits Colonel Arthur Stanley’s home to see the child just as Hagar, the [[Romani people|gypsy]] woman, bursts into the room to demand her boy, and the [[colonel]] falls unconscious across the [[library]] table.

*While on location during the production of the “continued photoplay”, director William Desmond Taylor was nearly electrocuted by an exposed power line. The [[trade magazine]] ''[[Motion Picture News]]'' reported the near tragedy in its August 7, 1915, issue:{{quote|W. D. Taylor, director of “The Diamond from the Sky,” the North American Film Corporation’s $800,000 continued photoplay, had a narrow escape from death a few days ago, when he accidentally stepped on a heavy charged electric wire. The members of the company were at work in an underground tunnel, in which one of the scenes takes place, when Taylor, walking in advance of the players, stepped on the wire, which was uncovered. Luckily, a physician employed in the mining camp nearby had come over to watch the taking of the scene. He offered immediate assistance.&lt;ref name="MPN"/&gt;}}

The '''Tombs of Talpur Mirs''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|میران تالپور کے مقبرے}}}}) are a complex of [[tomb]]s of the ruling [[Talpur]] [[Emir|Mirs]] of [[Sindh]] who reigned from 1784 to 1843. The tombs are also known as '''Cubbas''' (the [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] word for ''tombs''). These tombs are located in [[Hirabad, Hyderabad|Hirabad]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] in the [[Sindh]] province of [[Pakistan]].

The tombs complex hosts large mausoleums for Talpur rulers while they are several smaller mausoleums for their wives, consorts and infant children. There are several graves in the external area that are uncovered and unmarked, apart from a few exceptions. The graves are mostly made out of marble and usually have [[Quran]]ic verses inscribed on their surfaces.

Once a magnificent burial ground for the Talpur rulers, this place now has several preservation concerns.&lt;ref name="talpur_tombs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/654788/the-talpur-tombs|title=The Talpur tombs|publisher=Dawn News|date=27 August 2011|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 30 March 2011, the Culture Department, [[Government of Sindh]] retained the charge for these monuments, following a devolution of the government to provinces.&lt;ref name="aisha_iqbal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/150911/crumbling-heritage-the-talpur-tombs-hold-quiet-histories-long-forgotten/|title=Crumbling heritage: The Talpur tombs hold quiet histories long forgotten|first=Aisha|last=Iqbal|publisher=The Express Tribune|date=17 April 2011|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been slow and steady restoration work on preserving these monuments.

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Cubbas tombs of mirs.JPG|250px|thumb|Photograph of the tombs complex (c. 1900)]]
The architecture patterns of the tombs in the complex are reminiscent of various Talpur structures, however most of the tombs in this complex are either square or rectangular in shape. These structures follow almost the same specifications as that of the [[mausoleum]] of [[Mir Fateh Ali Khan]] at [[New Khudabad]].&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talpur.org/articles/talpurs-and-their-tomb-architecture|title=Talpurs and their tomb architecture|first=Shaikh Khurshid|last=Hasan|publisher=The Royal Talpurs of Sindh|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest domed structure contains two graves, those of, Mir Karam Ali Khan (d. 1828) and Mir Murad Ali Khan (d. 1833). Behind this building is a smaller building which contains the graves of Mir Karam’s two wives, the wife of Mir Abdullah Khan and an infant. To the north of these structures is one containing the graves of Talpur rulers, Mir Nur Muhammad Khan, Mir Nasir Khan, Mir Shahdad Khan and Mir Hussain Ali Khan.&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01" /&gt; It is said that the rulers designed their own burial places while alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/764804/art-history-and-tombs|title=Art, history and tombs|first=Peerzada|last=Salman|publisher=Dawn News|date=17 November 2012|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building in front of the last on the east, contains the remains of the wife and child of Mir Nur Muhammad Khan and the wife of Mir Husayn Ali Khan. Other wives of two of these rulers and three young children, repose in the small tomb in the north-west corner. Other Mirs lie within the two small tombs at the southwest corner of Mir Karam Ali Khan’s mausoleum and the remaining buildings contain the bodies of wives, daughters and children of some of these.&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01" /&gt;

In the southern group of tombs, two principal mausoleums that are nearest the entrance on the east and immediately behind it, contain the graves of four Mirs, while the rest are occupied by their wives and children.&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01" /&gt;

=== Vaulted structures ===
[[File:Artwork_on_the_Dome.jpg|thumb|Interior of one of the tombs]]
The ladies’ mausoleums are peculiar in the sense that they appear to look like vaulted wagon structures. One such mausoleum is rectangular in plan and surmounted by two domes, flanked by kicks on each of its four corners. The façade containing the entrance door is divided into three arched panels on each side. On the top of each arched panel, there is a rectangular panel covered with tiles in floral patterns. The other sides of the mausoleum contain more or less the same arched panelling and similar decorative colour scheme.&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01" /&gt;

=== Decorative art ===
These tombs are renowned for the tile decoration on their outside façade. The tiles are placed in multiple colours which primarily include blue floral patterns over white background. Some accents of green, yellow and brown are placed in a manner so as to break the monotonous decorative look.

== Burial traditions ==
In typical Talpur fashion, the marble graves have the actual royal turbans of these rulers placed upon a projection at the end of each. The graves are etched with [[Quran]]ic verses in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], whilst some of the walls inside the mausoleums are decorated with poetry in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Apart from the Arabic inscriptions on the graves, they are largely unmarked and have no names to denote their occupants.&lt;ref name="zeeshan_ahmed_01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1131734|title=Histories forgotten: The crumbling tombs of Talpur Mirs|first=Syed Zeeshan|last=Ahmed|publisher=Dawn News|date=16 September 2014|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graves are usually covered in marble masonry work.

=== ''Purdah'' for females ===
The mausoleums of female Talpurs are designed to be closed structures. These are distinctly vaulted structures with ''jaalis'' on the door archways to show the dead buried within still observing ''[[purdah]]'', as they would’ve in life.&lt;ref name="khurshid_hasan_01" /&gt; To this day, it is forbidden for men to step inside these mausoleums.

== Preservation ==
[[Image:Entrance to tombs of Talpur Mirs.jpg|250px|thumb|The visitor is greeted by a board erected by the Department of Archaeology, [[Government of Pakistan]] which has since been appropriately modified after the government was devolved to the province.]]
Once a magnificent burial ground for the Talpur rulers, this place now has several preservation concerns. Under the management of the Department of Archaeology, [[Government of Pakistan]], the mausoleums fell into disrepair. As of 30 March 2011, the Culture Department, [[Government of Sindh]] retained the charge for these monuments, following a devolution of the government to provinces.&lt;ref name="aisha_iqbal" /&gt;

The tomb complex is now enclosed in a walled area in order to put a halt to the encroaching residential buildings surrounding the site. Many of the crumbling tombs were “used by drug addicts and drifters for resting the night” whilst “local youngsters to play cricket during the day” in wide open spaces around the mausoleums.&lt;ref name="zeeshan_ahmed_01" /&gt;

=== Restoration and maintenance ===
Lately, there have been efforts to restore the tombs of ancient rulers elsewhere, including some of former Talpur rulers. The restoration began in April 2012 and was led by Ishtiaq Ansari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilyhauze.com/blog/9-tombs-of-the-talpur-mirs|title=Tombs of Talpur Mirs|first=Emily S.|last=Hauze|date=6 May 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there are restoration works actively in progress elsewhere, the site, that is the subject of this article, has since been neglected.

The newly devolved Sindh government nevertheless shows a willingness to work towards improving these monuments and “mak[ing] right [the wrongs of] the past 63 years” under the former management.&lt;ref name="aisha_iqbal" /&gt;

'''Votes''', sometimes also ''Vods'' ({{lang-vot|vađđalaizõd}}) are a [[Finnic peoples|Finnic ethic group]] native to [[Votia]] in [[Ingria]], the part of modern-day northwestern [[Russia]] that is roughly southwest of [[Saint Petersburg]] and east of the [[Estonia]]n border-town of [[Narva]]. The [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] [[Votic language]] spoken by Votes is close to [[Language death|extinction]]. Nonetheless, the Votic language is still spoken in three villages of historical Votia and by an unknown number of fluent Votic speakers in the countryside.  The villages are ''[[Jõgõperä]]'' (Krakolye), ''Liivcülä'' (Peski), and ''Luuditsa'' (Luzhitsy).&lt;ref name="ERM"&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/?lang=EST&amp;node=648&amp;parent=83 Eesti Rahva Muuseum: Vadjalased] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Votians were one of the founding people of [[Veliky Novgorod]].

==History==
[[File:Votic language map.png|thumb|300px|A map of Votic and neighbouring Ingrian-Finnish and Izhorian villages 1848–2007.]]

Votes are the oldest known ethnic group in Ingria. They are probably descended from an Iron-age population of north-eastern Estonia and western Ingria. Some scholars claim they were a tribe of [[Estonians]], who developed a separate identity during isolation from other Estonians. It is speculated the ancient Estonian county of [[Vaiga]] got its name from Votians.&lt;ref name="ERM"/&gt; The [[Budini]], ancient people described by [[Herodotus]], have been identified as Votes. The [[Kylfings]], a people active in Northern Europe during the [[Viking Age]], may have also been Votes.

The earliest literary references to the Votes by their traditional name are from medieval Russian sources, where Votes are referred to as ''Voď''. Older Russian sources grouped them (under the name [[Chud]]es) with Estonians. [[Lake Peipus]] near the Votian homelands is called ''Chudsko ozero'', meaning "Lake of Chudes" in Russian.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"&gt;Toivo Vuorela: ''Suomensukuiset kansat'', Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 1960 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1069 Votes were mentioned taking part in an attack on the [[Novgorod Republic]] by the [[Principality of Polotsk]]. Eventually Votes became part of the Novgorod Republic and in 1149 they were mentioned taking part in an attack by Novgorod against ''[[Jems]]'' who are speculated to be peoples of [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]. One of the administrative divisions of Novgorod, ''Voch'skaa'', was named after Votes. After the collapse of Novgorod, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] deported many Votes from their homelands and began more aggressive conversion of them. Missionary efforts started in 1534, after Novgorod's [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|archbishop Macarius]] complained to [[Ivan IV]] that Votes were still practicing their pagan beliefs. Makarius was authorized to send monk Ilja to convert the Votes. Ilja destroyed many of the old holy shrines and worshiping places. Conversion was slow and the next [[archbishop Feodosii]] had to send priest Nikifor to continue Ilja's work. Slowly Votes were converted and they became devoted Christians.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;Gustav Ränk, ''Vatjalaiset'', Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, Helsinki 1960 ''(Finnish)''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sweden controlled Ingria in the 17th century, and attempts to convert local Orthodox believers to the Lutheran faith caused some of the Orthodox population to migrate elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joensuu.fi/ajankohtaista/vaitos2.php?id=921 Mika Sivonen, ''Me inkerikot, vatjalaiset ja karjalaiset" - Uskonnollinen integrointi ja ortodoksisen vähemmistön identiteetin rakentuminen Ruotsin Inkerissä 1680-1702''] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time many Finnish peoples immigrated to Ingria. Religion separated the Lutheran Finns and Estonians and the Orthodox Izhorians and Votes, so intermarriage was uncommon between these groups. Votes mainly married other Votes, or Izhorians and Russians. They were mostly trilingual in Votic, Izhoran and Russian.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt; In 1848, the number of Votes had been 5,148, (Ariste 1981: 78).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ariste]] 1981. ''Keelekontaktid''. Tallinn: Valgus. [pt. 2.6. ''Kolme läänemere keele hääbumine'' lk. 76-82] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the Russian census of 1926 there were only 705 left. From the early 20th century on, the Votic language no longer passed to following generations.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt; Most Votes were evacuated to [[Finland]] along with Finnish [[Ingrians]] during [[World War II]], but were returned to the Soviet Union later.&lt;ref name="RedBook"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/votes.shtml The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a distinct [[nation|people]], Votes have become practically extinct after [[Stalinist]] dispersion to distant Soviet provinces as 'punishment' for alleged disloyalty and cowardice during World War II. Expelees allowed to return in 1956 found their old homes occupied by Russians.&lt;ref name="RedBook"/&gt; In 1989, there were still 62 known Votes left, with the youngest born in 1930. There were 73 self-declared Votes in the 2002 Russian census. Of them 12 lived in [[St. Petersburg]], 12 in [[Leningrad Oblast]] and 10 in [[Moscow]]. In 2008 Votes were added to the list of Indigenous peoples of Russia, granting them some support to preserving their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkeri.com/vatjalaiset.html Inkeri: Kantakansojen päivillä pohdittiin vatjalaisten ja inkerikkojen tulevaisuutta], {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some conflicts with Votic villagers and foresters, and in 2001 the Votic museum was burned in the village of Lužitsõ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaikuttava.net/article.php?sid=1215 Vaikuttava Tietotoimisto: Sukukansojamme kohdanneet onnettomuudet] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible problem is a port which is being constructed to [[Ust-Luga]]. It is planned that some 35,000 people would move near historic Votic and Izhoran villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkeri.ee/INKERI/2008_05/Laukaansuu.htm Inkeri.ee: Laukaansuun suursatama uhkaa inkerois- ja vatjalaiskyliä] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Votes in Latvia==
{{See also|Kreevins}}
[[image:Kreevinit.JPG|150px|thumb|right
|Latvian Votes in their national costumes, drawn by de Pauly]]
The Votes in Latvia were called ''krieviņi'' in Latvian. The word comes from ''krievs'', which means "Russian". Historical sources indicate the [[Teutonic Knights]] led by [[Vinke von Overberg]] captured many people in [[Ingermanland]] during their attack there in 1444–1447, and moved them to [[Bauska]], where a workforce was needed to build a castle. It is estimated that some 3,000 people were transferred there. After the castle was built, the Votes did not go back, but were settled in the vicinity of Bauska and became farmers. Gradually, they forgot their own language and customs and were assimilated by the neighboring [[Latvians]].&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt; They are first mentioned in literature of 1636. The first "modern" scientist to study them was Finnish [[Anders Johan Sjögren]], but the first person to connect them with Votes was [[Ferdinand Johan Wiedemann]] in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Marjo Mela ja Lembit Valba: Latvian historiaa ja kulttuuria. Rozentāls-seura. {{ISBN|951-98671-1-2}} {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian poet [[Jānis Rainis]] had some Votic roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Ethnicities/Vots/vots.htm Ethnicity of the Latvian Vots - The Krieviņi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Votian doll, 1935 - Museum of Cultures (Helsinki) - DSC04765.JPG|thumbnail|right|Votic doll on display at Museum of Cultures, Finland.]]
Historically most Votes were farmers. [[Slash and burn]] (''sardo'') was practiced until the early 20th century. Cattle, horses and geese were the most important livestock. Some made their living from fishing. Many primitive fishing habits survived a long time in Votic communities, such as fishing with a club or spear. [[Seine fishing]] was practiced during the winter. Votians formed seine groups (''artelli'') and made fishing trips as far as the Finnish outer islands like [[Seskar]]. Fishermen lived in wooden sleds called (''pudka'') during these trips.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt; Hunting was never an important source of income, because local nobility had reserved the right to hunt to themselves. Since St. Petersburg was so close to Votic homelands, many of the Votes went working there. Men worked in factories and women worked as servants. This contributed to rapid demise of Votic culture.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt; 

Votes were quite poorly educated, and only one Vote, [[Dmitri Tsvetkov]], is known to have ever attended and graduated from a University. Ancient Votic religion is not known well, but it is assumed that it was similar to other Finnic-beliefs.&lt;ref name="Suomensukuiset kansat"/&gt;

===Language and Identity===
Most Votes were able to speak [[Izhorian language|Izhorian]] and Russian as well as the Votic language. In fact, Izhorian was more common in every day use than Votic in some villages. Votic was commonly used with family members, while Russian and Izhorian were used with others. Russian was the only language used in Churches. Votes often referred to themselves as ''Izores'', since this term was more commonly known among others. The term came in use when people wanted to make a difference between Lutheran and Orthodox Finnic populations in Ingria.&lt;ref&gt;Mauno Jokipii, ''Itämerensuomalaiset - Heimokansojen historiaa ja kohtaloita'', Jyväskylä 1995, {{ISBN|9519362800}}&lt;/ref&gt;
