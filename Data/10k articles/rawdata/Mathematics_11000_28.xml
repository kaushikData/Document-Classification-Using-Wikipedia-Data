'''93''' ('''ninety-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[92 (number)|92]] and preceding [[94 (number)|94]].

==In mathematics==
93 is:

* the twenty-eighth distinct [[semiprime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A001358}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ninth of the form (3.q).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A001748}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the first number in the third triplet of consecutive semiprimes, 93, 94, and 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A056809}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[Blum integer]], since its two prime factors, 3 and 31 are both [[Gaussian prime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A016105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[repdigit]] in base 5 (333&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A048330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 (33&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;).
* palindromic in bases 2, 5, and 30.
* a [[lucky number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A000959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[cake number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A000125}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an [[idoneal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A000926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 93 different [[cyclic permutation|cyclic]] [[Gilbreath permutation]]s on 11 elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A000048}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore there are 93 different [[real number|real]] periodic points of order 11 on the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Magical Mathematics: the mathematical ideas that animate great magic tricks|first1=Persi|last1=Diaconis|author1-link=Persi Diaconis|first2=Ron|last2=Graham|author2-link=Ronald Graham (mathematician)|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|chapter=Chapter 5: From the Gilbreath Principle to the Mandelbrot Set|pages=61–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other fields==
'''Ninety-three''' is:
*The [[atomic number]] of [[neptunium]], an actinide.
* The code for [[List of country calling codes|international direct dial]] phone calls to [[Afghanistan]].
* One of two [[ISBN]] Group Identifiers for books published in [[India]].
* The number of the French department [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], and as such used by many French [[gangsta rap]]pers and those emulating their speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Black, Blanc, Beur: Rap Music and Hip-Hop Culture in the Francophone World|first=Alain-Philippe|last=Durand|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2002|isbn=9780810844315|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cMq4ni2BQowC&amp;pg=PA55|page=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Spitting Fire|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=March 2006|pages=76–81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J98-LX7jemQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT5|first1=Marisa|last1=Meltzer|first2=Julianne|last2=Shepherd}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical Persian [[finger counting]], the number 93 is represented by a closed fist. Because of this, classical Arab and Persian poets around 1 CE referred to someone's lack of generosity by saying that the person's hand made "ninety-three".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://bcm.bc.edu/issues/spring_2002/ll_hand.html|title=Hand sums: The ancient art of counting on your fingers|journal=Boston College Magazine|date=Spring 2002|first=Jonathan M.|last=Bloom}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6616">In the mathematical field of [[category theory]], an '''allegory''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that has some of the structure of the category of sets and [[binary relation]]s between them. Allegories can be used as an abstraction of categories of relations, and in this sense the theory of allegories is a generalization of [[relation algebra]] to relations between different sorts. Allegories are also useful in defining and investigating certain constructions in category theory, such as [[regular category|exact]] completions.

In this article we adopt the convention that morphisms compose from right to left, so ''RS'' means "first do ''S'', then do ''R''".

==Definition==

An allegory is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] in which
* every morphism ''R'' : ''X → Y'' is associated with an '''anti-involution''', i.e. a morphism ''R''° : ''Y → X'' with ° satisfying ''R''°° = ''R'' and (''RS'')° = ''S''°''R''°; and
* every pair of morphisms ''R'',''S'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' with common domain/codomain is associated with an '''intersection''', i.e. a morphism ''R''∩''S'' : ''X'' → ''Y''
all such that
* intersections are idempotent (''R''∩''R'' = ''R''), commutative (''R''∩''S'' = ''S''∩''R''), and associative (''R''∩''S'')∩''T'' = ''R''∩(''S''∩''T'');
* anti-involution distributes over intersection ((''R''∩''S'')° = ''S''°∩''R''°);
* composition is semi-distributive over intersection (''R''(''S''∩''T'')⊆''RS''∩''RT'', (''R''∩''S'')''T''⊆''RT''∩''ST''); and
* the modularity law is satisfied: (''RS''∩''T''⊆(''R''∩''TS''°)''S'').
Here, we are abbreviating using the order defined by the intersection: "''R''⊆''S''" means "''R'' = ''R''∩''S''".

A first example of an allegory is the [[Category of relations|category of sets and relations]]. The objects of this allegory are sets, and a morphism ''X → Y'' is a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y''. Composition of morphisms is [[composition of relations]]; intersection of morphisms is [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of relations.

==Regular categories and allegories==

===Allegories of relations in regular categories===

In a category ''C'', a '''relation''' between objects ''X'', ''Y'' is a [[span (category theory)|span]] of morphisms ''X←R→Y'' that is jointly-monic. Two such spans ''X←S→Y'' and ''X←T→Y'' are considered equivalent when there is an isomorphism between S and T that make everything commute, and strictly speaking relations are only defined up to equivalence (one may formalise this either using equivalence classes or using bicategories). If the category ''C'' has products, a relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' is the same thing as a [[monomorphism]] into ''X''×''Y'' (or an equivalence class of such). In the presence of pullbacks and a proper [[factorization system]], one can define the composition of relations. The composition of ''X←R→Y←S→Z'' is found by first pulling back the cospan ''R→Y←S'' and then taking the jointly-monic image of the resulting span ''X←R←·→S→Z''.

Composition of relations will be associative if the factorization system is appropriately stable. In this case one can consider a category Rel(''C''), with the same objects as ''C'', but where morphisms are relations between the objects. The identity relations are the diagonals ''X''→''X''×''X''.

Recall that a [[regular category]] is a category with finite limits and images in which covers are stable under pullback. A regular category has a stable regular epi/mono factorization system. The category of relations for a regular category is always an allegory. Anti-involution is defined by turning the source/target of the relation around, and intersections are intersections of subobjects, computed by pullback.

===Maps in allegories, and tabulations===

A morphism ''R'' in an allegory ''A'' is called a '''map''' if it is entire (1⊆''R''°''R'') and deterministic (''RR''°⊆1). Another way of saying this: a map is a morphism that has a [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] in ''A'', when ''A'' is considered, using the local order structure, as a [[2-category]]. Maps in an allegory are closed under identity and composition. Thus there is a subcategory Map(''A'') of ''A'', with the same objects but only the maps as morphisms. For a regular category ''C'', there is an isomorphism of categories ''C''≅Map(Rel(''C'')). In particular, a morphism in Map(Rel('''Set''')) is just an ordinary set function.

In an allegory, a morphism ''R:X→Y'' is '''tabulated''' by a pair of maps ''f'':''Z→X'', ''g'':''Z→Y'' if ''gf''°=R and ''f''°''f''∩''g''°''g''=1. An allegory is called '''tabular''' if every morphism has a tabulation. For a regular category ''C'', the allegory Rel(''C'') is always tabular. On the other hand, for any tabular allegory ''A'', the category Map(''A'') of maps is a locally regular category: it has pullbacks, equalizers and images that are stable under pullback. This is enough to study relations in Map(''A'') and, in this setting, ''A''≅Rel(Map(''A'')).

===Unital allegories and regular categories of maps===

A '''unit''' in an allegory is an object ''U'' for which the identity is the largest morphism ''U→U'', and such that from every other object there is an entire relation to ''U''. An allegory with a unit is called '''unital'''. Given a tabular allegory ''A'', the category Map(''A'') is a regular category (it has a terminal object) if and only if ''A'' is unital.

===More sophisticated kinds of allegory===
Additional properties of allegories can be axiomatized. '''Distributive allegories''' have a [[union (set theory)|union]]-like operation that is suitably well-behaved, and '''division allegories''' have a generalization of the division operation of [[relation algebra]]. '''Power allegories''' are distributive division allegories with additional [[powerset]]-like structure. The connection between allegories and regular categories can be developed into a connection between power allegories and [[toposes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1608">A [[Banach algebra]], ''A'',  is '''amenable''' if all [[bounded linear map|bounded]] [[Differential algebra|derivation]]s from ''A'' into [[dual module|dual]] [[Banach module|Banach ''A''-bimodules]] are [[inner derivation|inner]] (that is of the form &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto a.x-x.a&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the dual module).

An equivalent characterization is that ''A'' is amenable if and only if it has a [[virtual diagonal]].

==Examples==
* If ''A'' is a [[group algebra]] &lt;math&gt;L^1(G)&lt;/math&gt; for some [[locally compact group]] ''G'' then ''A'' is amenable if and only if ''G'' is [[amenable group|amenable]].
* If ''A'' is a [[C*-algebra]] then ''A'' is amenable if and only if it is [[nuclear C*-algebra|nuclear]].
* If ''A'' is a [[uniform algebra]] on a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] then ''A'' is amenable if and only if it is trivial (i.e. the algebra ''C(X)'' of all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[complex number|complex]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] on ''X'').
* If ''A'' is amenable and there is a continuous algebra homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; from ''A'' to another Banach algebra, then the closure of &lt;math&gt;\overline{\theta(A)}&lt;/math&gt; is amenable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28551">'''Automated theorem proving''' (also known as '''ATP''' or '''automated deduction''') is a subfield of [[automated reasoning]] and [[mathematical logic]] dealing with proving [[mathematical theorem]]s by [[computer program]]s.  Automated reasoning over [[mathematical proof]] was a major impetus for the development of computer science.

== Logical foundations ==
While the roots of formalised [[Logicism|logic]] go back to [[Aristotelian logic|Aristotle]], the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw the development of modern logic and formalised mathematics. [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879) introduced both a complete [[propositional logic|propositional calculus]] and what is essentially modern [[predicate logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frege|first=Gottlob|title=Begriffsschrift|year=1879|publisher=Verlag Louis Neuert|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65658c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic|Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', published 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frege|first=Gottlob|title=Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik|year=1884|publisher=Wilhelm Kobner|location=Breslau|url=http://www.ac-nancy-metz.fr/enseign/philo/textesph/Frege.pdf|access-date=2012-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926172317/http://www.ac-nancy-metz.fr/enseign/philo/textesph/Frege.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed (parts of) mathematics in formal logic. This approach was continued by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their influential ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', first published 1910–1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principia Mathematica|year=1910–1913|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Bertrand Russell|edition=1st|author2=Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with a revised second edition in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principia Mathematica|year=1927|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Bertrand Russell|edition=2nd|author2=Alfred North Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Whitehead thought they could derive all mathematical truth using axioms and inference rules of formal logic, in principle opening up the process to automatisation. In 1920, [[Thoralf Skolem]] simplified a previous result by [[Leopold Löwenheim]], leading to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] and, in 1930, to the notion of a [[Herbrand universe]] and a [[Herbrand interpretation]] that allowed (un)satisfiability of first-order formulas (and hence the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of a theorem) to be reduced to (potentially infinitely many) propositional satisfiability problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbrand|first=Jaques|title=Recherches sur la théorie de la démonstration|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, [[Mojżesz Presburger]] showed that the theory of [[natural numbers]] with addition and equality (now called [[Presburger arithmetic]] in his honor) is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] and gave an algorithm that could determine if a given sentence in the language was true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Presburger|first=Mojżesz|title=Über die Vollständigkeit eines gewissen Systems der Arithmetik ganzer Zahlen, in welchem die Addition als einzige Operation hervortritt|journal=Comptes Rendus du I congrès de Mathématiciens des Pays Slaves|year=1929|pages=92–101|location=Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis2001&gt;{{Citation

However, shortly after this positive result, [[Kurt Gödel]] published ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]]'' (1931), showing that in any sufficiently strong axiomatic system there are true statements which cannot be proved in the system. This topic was further developed in the 1930s by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], who on the one hand gave two independent but equivalent definitions of [[computability]], and on the other gave concrete examples for undecidable questions.

== First implementations ==

Shortly after [[World War II]], the first general purpose computers became available. In 1954, [[Martin Davis]] programmed Presburger's algorithm for a [[JOHNNIAC]] vacuum tube computer at the [[Princeton Institute for Advanced Study]]. According to Davis, "Its great triumph was to prove that the sum of two even numbers is even".&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bibel2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bibel|first=Wolfgang|title=Early History and Perspectives of Automated Deduction|journal=KI 2007|year=2007|series=LNAI|issue=4667|pages=2–18|url=http://www.intellektik.de/resources/OsnabrueckBuchfassung.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2012|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; More ambitious was the [[Logic Theory Machine]] in 1956, a deduction system for the [[propositional logic]] of the ''Principia Mathematica'', developed by [[Allen Newell]], [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Cliff Shaw|J. C. Shaw]]. Also running on a JOHNNIAC, the Logic Theory Machine constructed proofs from a small set of propositional axioms and three deduction rules: [[modus ponens]], (propositional) variable substitution, and the replacement of formulas by their definition. The system used heuristic guidance, and managed to prove 38 of the first 52 theorems of the ''Principia''.&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;

The "heuristic" approach of the Logic Theory Machine tried to emulate human mathematicians, and could not guarantee that a proof could be found for every valid theorem even in principle.  In contrast, other, more systematic algorithms achieved, at least theoretically, [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] for first-order logic. Initial approaches relied on the results of Herbrand and Skolem to convert a first-order formula into successively larger sets of propositional formulae by instantiating variables with terms from the [[Herbrand universe]]. The propositional formulas could then be checked for unsatisfiability using a number of methods. Gilmore's program used conversion to [[disjunctive normal form]], a form in which the satisfiability of a formula is obvious.&lt;ref name=Davis2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Paul|title=A proof procedure for quantification theory: its justification and realisation|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|year=1960|volume=4|pages=28–35|doi=10.1147/rd.41.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decidability of the problem ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Depending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a formula varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of [[propositional logic]], the problem is decidable but [[co-NP-complete]], and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proof tasks. For a [[first-order logic|first order predicate calculus]], [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] states that the theorems (provable statements) are exactly the logically valid [[well-formed formula]]s, so identifying valid formulas is [[recursively enumerable]]: given unbounded resources, any valid formula can eventually be proven. However, ''invalid'' formulas (those that are ''not'' entailed by a given theory), cannot always be recognized.

The above applies to first order theories, such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]. However, for a specific model that may be described by a first order theory, some statements may be true but undecidable in the theory used to describe the model. For example, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], we know that any theory whose proper axioms are true for the natural numbers cannot prove all first order statements true for the natural numbers, even if the list of proper axioms is allowed to be infinite enumerable. It follows that an automated theorem prover will fail to terminate while searching for a proof precisely when the statement being investigated is undecidable in the theory being used, even if it is true in the model of interest. Despite this theoretical limit, in practice, theorem provers can solve many hard problems, even in models that are not fully described by any first order theory (such as the integers).

== Related problems ==

A simpler, but related, problem is '''[[proof verification]]''', where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a [[primitive recursive function]] or program, and hence the problem is always decidable.

Since the proofs generated by automated theorem provers are typically very large, the problem of [[proof compression]] is crucial and various techniques aiming at making the prover's output smaller, and consequently more easily understandable and checkable, have been developed.

[[Proof assistant]]s require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have proved a number of interesting and hard theorems, including at least one that has eluded human mathematicians for a long time, namely the [[Robbins conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.W. McCune|title=Solution of the Robbins Problem|journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning|year=1997|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h77246751668616h/|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Computer Math Proof Shows Reasoning Power|author=Gina Kolata|date=December 10, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.

Another distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  Other techniques would include [[model checking]], which, in the simplest case, involves brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).

There are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule. There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true. A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called [[non-surveyable proofs]]).  Another example of a program-assisted proof is the one that shows that the game of [[Connect Four]] can always be won by first player.

== Industrial uses ==

Commercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in [[integrated circuit design]] and verification.  Since the [[Pentium FDIV bug]], the complicated [[floating point unit]]s of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny. [[AMD]], [[Intel]] and others use automated theorem proving to verify that division and other operations are correctly implemented in their processors.

==First-order theorem proving==
In the late 1960s agencies funding research in automated deduction began to emphasize the need for practical applications. One of the first fruitful areas was that of [[program verification]] whereby first-order theorem provers were applied to the problem of verifying the correctness of computer programs in languages such as Pascal, Ada, Java etc. Notable among early program verification systems was the Stanford Pascal Verifier developed by David Luckham at Stanford University. This was based on the Stanford Resolution Prover also developed at Stanford using J.A. Robinson's resolution Principle. This was the first automated deduction system to demonstrate an ability to solve mathematical problems that were announced in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society before solutions were formally published.

[[First-order logic|First-order]] theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling ''fully'' automated systems. More expressive logics, such as [[Higher-order logic|higher order logics]], allow the convenient expression of a wider range of problems than first order logic, but theorem proving for these logics is less well developed.

==Benchmarks, Competitions, and Sources ==
The quality of implemented systems has benefited from the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples — the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) Problem Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Geoff|title=The TPTP Problem Library for Automated Theorem Proving|url=http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  — as well as from the [[CADE ATP System Competition]] (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.

Some important systems (all have won at least one CASC competition division) are listed below.
* [[E theorem prover|E]] is a high-performance prover for full first-order logic, but built on a [[superposition calculus|purely equational calculus]], originally developed in the automated reasoning group of [[Technical University of Munich]], and now at [[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University]] in [[Stuttgart]].
* [[Otter (theorem prover)|Otter]], developed at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], is based on [[first-order resolution]] and [[paramodulation]]. Otter has since been replaced by [[Prover9]], which is paired with [[Mace4]].
* [[SETHEO]] is a high-performance system based on the goal-directed [[model elimination]] calculus. It is developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich. E and SETHEO have been combined (with other systems) in the composite theorem prover E-SETHEO.
* [[Vampire theorem prover|Vampire]] is developed and implemented at [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ Manchester University] by [http://www.voronkov.com/ Andrei Voronkov] and [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hoderk/ Krystof Hoder], formerly also by [http://www.freewebs.com/riazanov/ Alexandre Riazanov]. It has won the CADE ATP System Competition in the most prestigious CNF (MIX) division for eleven years (1999, 2001–2010).
* Waldmeister is a specialized system for unit-equational first-order logic developed by Arnim Buch and Thomas Hillenbrand. It won the CASC UEQ division for fourteen consecutive years (1997–2010).
* [[SPASS]] is a first order logic theorem prover with equality. This is developed by the research group Automation of Logic, [[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]].

The [https://theoremprover-museum.github.io/ Theorem Prover Museum] is an initiative to conserve the sources of theorem prover systems for future analysis, since they are important cultural/scientific artefacts. It has the sources of many of the systems mentioned above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''BS 8888''' is the [[British Standards|British standard]] developed by the [[BSI Group]] for technical product documentation, geometric product specification, geometric tolerance specification and engineering drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2007/1/Newly-Revised-BS-8888-2006-Technical-Product-Specification/|title=Newly Revised BS 8888:2006 Technical Product Specification|publisher=British Standards Institution |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[BS 308]] was formerly the standard for engineering drawing since 1927. Over a period of 73 years it was expanded and edited until its withdrawal in 2000. The [[BSI Group]], who produced the standard, played an important role in the development of the international standard on technical specification in conjunction with the ISO. In 2000, the [[BS 308]] was replaced by the updated BS 8888.

===2013 update===
A significant change in the 2013 revision is that there is no longer a requirement to state whether specifications have been toleranced in accordance with either the Principle of Independency or the Principle of Dependency.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===2017 update===
This updated version of the standard has been restructured to be more aligned to the workflow of designers and engineers to assist throughout the design process.  The standard now references 3D geometry, not only as drawings but also allowing a 3D surface to be used as a datum feature. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2017/february/UKs-national-standard-for-engineering-drawings-revised/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
BS 8888 performs three fundamental tasks:
*Unifying all the ISO standards applicable to technical specification;
*Giving an index of ISO standards involved with different principles of technical product specification (TPS);
*Providing BSI with a platform for further explanatory commentary where necessary.

      <comment>/* Application to densely ordered sets */ [[MOS:BOLD]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5353">In [[mathematical logic]], especially [[set theory]] and [[model theory]], the '''back-and-forth method''' is a method for showing [[isomorphism]] between [[countably infinite]] structures satisfying specified conditions. In particular:

* It can be used to prove that any two [[countably infinite]] [[dense order|densely ordered]] sets (i.e., linearly ordered in such a way that between any two members there is another) without endpoints are isomorphic. An isomorphism between [[linear order]]s is simply a strictly increasing [[bijection]]. This result implies, for example, that there exists a strictly increasing bijection between the set of all [[rational number]]s and the set of all [[real number|real]] [[algebraic number]]s.
* It can be used to prove that any two countably infinite atomless [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are isomorphic to each other.
* It can be used to prove that any two equivalent countable [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]] of a theory are isomorphic.
* It can be used to prove that the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] of [[random graph]]s, when applied to countably infinite graphs, always produces a unique graph, the [[Rado graph]].
* It can be used to prove that any two [[m-complete]] [[recursively enumerable]] sets are [[computable function|recursively]] isomorphic.

== Application to densely ordered sets ==
Suppose that

* (''A'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''B'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;) are linearly ordered sets;
* They are both unbounded, in other words neither ''A'' nor ''B'' has either a maximum or a minimum;
* They are densely ordered, i.e. between any two members there is another;
* They are countably infinite.

Fix enumerations (without repetition) of the underlying sets:

:''A'' = { ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … },
:''B'' = { ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … }.

Now we construct a one-to-one correspondence between ''A'' and ''B'' that is strictly increasing. Initially no member of ''A'' is paired with any member of ''B''.

: '''(1)''' Let ''i'' be the smallest index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B''. Let ''j'' be some index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A'' '''and''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(2)''' Let ''j'' be the smallest index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A''. Let ''i'' be some index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B'' '''and''' ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(3)''' Go back to step '''(1)'''.

It still has to be checked that the choice required in step '''(1)''' and '''(2)''' can actually be made in accordance to the requirements. Using step '''(1)''' as an example:

If there are already ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' corresponding to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''B'' respectively such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, we choose ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in between ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; using density. Otherwise, we choose a suitable large or small element of ''B'' using the fact that ''B'' has neither a maximum nor a minimum. Choices made in step '''(2)''' are dually possible. Finally, the construction ends after countably many steps because ''A'' and ''B'' are countably infinite. Note that we had to use all the prerequisites.

== History ==
According to Hodges (1993):
:''Back-and-forth methods are often ascribed to [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] […], but there is no evidence to support any of these attributions.''
While the theorem on countable densely ordered sets is due to Cantor (1895), the back-and-forth method with which it is now proved was developed by Huntington (1904) and Hausdorff (1914). Later it was applied in other situations, most notably by [[Roland Fraïssé]] in [[model theory]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2000">In mathematics, a '''Baire measure''' is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the [[σ-algebra]] of [[Baire set]]s of a [[topological space]] whose value on every compact Baire set is finite. In compact [[metric spaces]] the [[Borel set]]s and the [[Baire set]]s are the same, so Baire measures are the same as [[Borel measure]]s that are finite on [[compact set]]s. In general Baire sets and Borel sets need not be the same. In spaces with non-Baire Borel sets, Baire measures are used because they connect to the properties of [[continuous function]]s more directly.

There are several inequivalent definitions of [[Baire set]]s, so correspondingly there are several inequivalent concepts of Baire measure on a topological space. These all coincide on spaces that are locally compact [[σ-compact]] [[Hausdorff spaces]]. 

In practice Baire measures can be replaced by [[regular Borel measure]]s. The relation between Baire measures and regular Borel measures is as follows: 

*The restriction of a finite Borel measure to the Baire sets is a Baire measure.
*A finite Baire measure on a compact space is always regular.
*A finite Baire measure on a compact space is the restriction of a unique regular Borel measure.
*On compact (or σ-compact) metric spaces, Borel sets are the same as Baire sets and Borel measures are the same as Baire measures.

==Examples==

*[[Counting measure]] on the [[unit interval]] is a measure on the Baire sets that is not regular (or σ-finite).
*The (left or right) [[Haar Measure]] on a [[locally compact group]] is a Baire measure invariant under the left (right) action of the group on itself. In particular, if the group is an [[abelian group]], the left and right Haar measures coincide and we say the Haar measure is [[translation invariant]]. See also [[Pontryagin duality]].

[[Image:Butterlink.png|thumb|The butterfly curve singularity link]]
In [[mathematics]], the algebraic '''butterfly curve''' is a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] of [[sextic plane curve|degree six]], given by the [[equation]] 

:&lt;math&gt;x^6 + y^6 = x^2.&lt;/math&gt;  

The butterfly curve has a single [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] with [[delta invariant]] three, which means it is a curve of [[geometric genus|genus]] seven. The only plane curves of genus seven are singular, since seven is not a [[triangular number]], and the minimum degree for such a curve is six, so the butterfly curve aside from its appearance is possibly interesting as an example.

The butterfly curve has branching number and multiplicity two, and hence the singularity [[link (knot theory)|link]] has two components, pictured at right.

The area of the algebraic butterfly curve is given by (with [[gamma function]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;4 \cdot \int_0^1 (x^2 - x^6)^{\frac{1}{6}} dx = \frac{ \Gamma(\frac{1}{6}) \cdot \Gamma(\frac{1}{3})}{3 \sqrt{\pi}} \approx 2.804,&lt;/math&gt;
and its [[arc length]] ''s'' by
:&lt;math&gt;s \approx 9.017.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''centroid''' or '''geometric center''' of a [[plane figure]] is the [[arithmetic mean]] position of all the points in the figure. Informally, it is the point at which a cutout of the shape could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pin.

The definition extends to any object in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[space (mathematics)|space]]: its centroid is the mean position of all the points in all of the coordinate directions.

While in [[geometry]] the term '''barycenter''' is a synonym for ''centroid'', in [[astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]], [[barycenter]] is the center of mass of two or more bodies that [[orbit]] each other. In [[physics]], the [[center of mass]] is the arithmetic mean of all points [[Weighting|weighted]] by the local density or [[specific weight]]. If a physical object has uniform density, then its center of mass is the same as the centroid of its shape.

In [[geography]], the centroid of a radial projection of a region of the Earth's surface to sea level is known as the region's [[geographical center]].

== History ==
The term "centroid" is of recent coinage (1814). It is used as a substitute for the older terms "[[center of gravity]]," and "[[center of mass]]", when the purely geometrical aspects of that point are to be emphasized. The term is peculiar to the English language. The French use "centre de gravité" on most occasions, and others use terms of similar meaning.

The center of gravity, as the name indicates, is a notion that arose in mechanics, most likely in connection with building activities. When, where, and by whom it was invented is not known, as it is a concept that likely occurred to many people individually with minor differences. 

While it is possible [[Euclid]] was still active in Alexandria during the childhood of [[Archimedes]] (287-212 BCE), it is certain that when Archimedes visited [[Alexandria]], Euclid was no longer there. Thus Archimedes could not have learned the theorem that the medians of a triangle meet in a point—the center of gravity of the triangle directly from Euclid, as this proposition is not in [[Euclid's Elements]]. The first explicit statement of this proposition is due to [[Heron|Heron of Alexandria]] (perhaps the first century CE) and occurs in his Mechanics. It may be added, in passing, that the proposition did not become common in the textbooks on plane geometry until the nineteenth century.

While Archimedes does not state that proposition explicitly, he makes indirect references to it, suggesting he was familiar with it. However, [[Jean-Étienne Montucla|Jean Etienne Montucla]] (1725-1799), the author of the first history of mathematics (1758), declares categorically (vol. I, p. 463) that the center of gravity of solids is a subject Archimedes did not touch.

In 1802 [[Charles Bossut]] (1730-1813) published a two-volume Essai aur PhisMire generale des mathematiques. This book was highly esteemed by his contemporaries, judging from the fact that within two years after its publication it was already available in translation in Italian (1802-03), English (1803), and German (1804). Bossut credits Archimedes with having found the centroid of plane figures, but has nothing to say about solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Court|first=Nathan Altshiller|date=1960|title=Notes on the centroid|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27956057|journal=The Mathematics Teacher|volume=53|issue=1|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
The geometric centroid of a [[convex set|convex]] object always lies in the object.  A non-convex object might have a centroid that is outside the figure itself. The centroid of a [[Annulus (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]], for example, lies in the object's central void.

If the centroid is defined, it is a [[fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space|fixed point of all isometries]] in its [[symmetry group]]. In particular, the geometric centroid of an object lies in the intersection of all its [[hyperplane]]s of [[symmetry]].  The centroid of many figures ([[regular polygon]], [[regular polyhedron]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[rectangle]], [[rhombus]], [[circle (geometry)|circle]], [[sphere (geometry)|sphere]], [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]], [[Lamé curve|superellipse]], [[superellipsoid]], etc.) can be determined by this principle alone.

In particular, the centroid of a [[parallelogram]] is the meeting point of its two [[diagonal]]s.  This is not true for other [[quadrilateral]]s.

For the same reason, the centroid of an object with [[translational symmetry]] is undefined (or lies outside the enclosing space), because a translation has no fixed point.

==Of a triangle==
The centroid of a triangle is the intersection of the three [[median (triangle)|medians]] of the triangle (each median connecting a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side). It lies on the triangle's [[Euler line]], which also goes through various other key points including the [[orthocenter]] and the [[circumcenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|pp=18,189,225–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any of the three medians through the centroid divides the triangle's area in half. This is not true for other lines through the centroid; the greatest departure from the equal-area division occurs when a line through the centroid is parallel to a side of the triangle, creating a smaller triangle and a [[trapezoid]]; in this case the trapezoid's area is 5/9 that of the original triangle.&lt;ref name=Bottomley2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Bottomley|first=Henry|title=Medians and Area Bisectors of a Triangle|url=http://www.se16.info/js/halfarea.htm|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''P'' be any point in the plane of a triangle with vertices ''A, B,'' and ''C'' and centroid ''G''. Then the sum of the squared distances of ''P'' from the three vertices exceeds the sum of the squared distances of the centroid ''G'' from the vertices by three times the squared distance between ''P'' and ''G'':

:&lt;math&gt;PA^2+PB^2+PC^2=GA^2+GB^2+GC^2+3PG^2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of the squares of the triangle's sides equals three times the sum of the squared distances of the centroid from the vertices:

:&lt;math&gt;AB^2+BC^2+CA^2=3(GA^2+GB^2+GC^2).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Altshiller-Court|1925|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A triangle's centroid is the point that maximizes the product of the directed distances of a point from the triangle's sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Kimberling, "Trilinear distance inequalities for the symmedian point, the centroid, and other triangle centers", ''Forum Geometricorum'', 10 (2010), 135--139. http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2010volume10/FG201015index.html &lt;/ref&gt;

For other properties of a triangle's centroid, see [[#Of a triangle|below]].

== Locating ==
=== Plumb line method ===
The centroid of a uniformly dense [[planar lamina]], such as in figure (a) below, may be determined experimentally by using a [[plumbline]] and a pin to find the collocated center of mass of a thin body of uniform density having the same shape.  The body is held by the pin, inserted at a point, off the presumed centroid in such a way that it can freely rotate around the pin; the plumb line is then dropped from the pin (figure b).  The position of the plumbline is traced on the surface, and the procedure is repeated with the pin inserted at any different point (or a number of points) off the centroid of the object. The unique intersection point of these lines will be the centroid (figure c).  Provided that the body is of uniform density, all lines made this way will include the centroid, and all lines will cross at the exact same place.

{| cellpadding=3
|- valign=center
| [[File:Center gravity 0.svg|147px|center]]
| [[File:Center gravity 1.svg|183px|center]]
| [[File:Center gravity 2.svg|157px|center]]
|-
| align=center | (a)
| align=center | (b)
| align=center | (c)
|}

This method can be extended (in theory) to concave shapes where the centroid may lie outside the shape, and virtually to solids (again, of uniform density), where the centroid may lie within the body. The (virtual) positions of the plumb lines need to be recorded by means other than by drawing them along the shape.

=== Balancing method ===
For convex two-dimensional shapes, the centroid can be found by balancing the shape on a smaller shape, such as the top of a narrow cylinder.  The centroid occurs somewhere within the range of contact between the two shapes (and exactly at the point where the shape would balance on a pin).  In principle, progressively narrower cylinders can be used to find the centroid to arbitrary precision.  In practice air currents make this infeasible.  However, by marking the overlap range from multiple balances, one can achieve a considerable level of accuracy.

=== Of a finite set of points ===
The centroid of a finite set of &lt;math&gt;{k}&lt;/math&gt; points &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_1+\mathbf{x}_2+\cdots+\mathbf{x}_k}{k} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This point minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances between itself and each point in the set.

=== By geometric decomposition ===
The centroid of a plane figure &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by dividing it into a finite number of simpler figures &lt;math&gt;X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n&lt;/math&gt;, computing the centroid &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; and area &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; of each part, and then computing

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac{\sum C_{i_x} A_i}{\sum A_i} , C_y = \frac{\sum C_{i_y} A_i}{\sum A_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Holes in the figure &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, overlaps between the parts, or parts that extend outside the figure can all be handled using negative areas &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, the measures &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; should be taken with positive and negative signs in such a way that the sum of the signs of &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; for all parts that enclose a given point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is 1 if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and 0 otherwise.

For example, the figure below (a) is easily divided into a square and a triangle, both with positive area; and a circular hole, with negative area (b).
{{multiple images

|image2=COG 2.svg

|image3=COG 3.svg
|caption3=(c) Centroids of elements of the object
}}
The centroid of each part can be found in any [[list of centroids|list of centroids of simple shapes]] (c). Then the centroid of the figure is the weighted average of the three points.  The horizontal position of the centroid, from the left edge of the figure is
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{5 \times 10^2 + 13.33 \times \frac{1}{2}10^2 - 3 \times \pi2.5^2}{10^2 + \frac{1}{2}10^2 -\pi2.5^2} \approx 8.5 \mbox{ units}.&lt;/math&gt;
The vertical position of the centroid is found in the same way.

The same formula holds for any three-dimensional objects, except that each &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; should be the volume of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, rather than its area.  It also holds for any subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^d&lt;/math&gt;, for any dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, with the areas replaced by the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s of the parts.

=== By integral formula ===
The centroid of a subset ''X'' of  &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; can also be computed by the [[integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\int x g(x) \; dx}{\int g(x) \; dx}&lt;/math&gt;

where the integrals are taken over the whole space &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, and ''g'' is the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset, which is 1 inside  ''X'' and 0 outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that the denominator is simply the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of the set ''X''. This formula cannot be applied if the set ''X'' has zero measure, or if either integral diverges.

Another formula for the centroid is

:&lt;math&gt;C_k = \frac{\int z S_k(z) \; dz}{\int S_k(z) \; dz}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;  is the ''k''th coordinate of ''C'', and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') is the measure of the intersection of ''X'' with the hyperplane defined by the equation ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''z''.  Again, the denominator is simply the measure of ''X''.

For a plane figure, in particular, the barycenter coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm x} = \frac{\int x S_{\mathrm y}(x) \; dx}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm y} = \frac{\int y S_{\mathrm x}(y) \; dy}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the figure ''X''; ''S''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the length of the intersection of ''X'' with the vertical line at [[abscissa]] ''x''; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') is the analogous quantity for the swapped axes.

==== Bounded region ====
The centroid &lt;math&gt;(\bar{x},\;\bar{y})&lt;/math&gt; of a region bounded by the graphs of the [[continuous function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \geq g(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a \leq x \leq b&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}=\frac{1}{A}\int_a^b x[f(x) - g(x)]\;dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{y}=\frac{1}{A}\int_a^b \left[\frac{f(x) + g(x)}{2}\right][f(x) - g(x)]\;dx,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the region (given by &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b [f(x) - g(x)]\;dx&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey, Jr.|1970|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Larson|1998|pp=458–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of an L-shaped object ===
This is a method of determining the centroid of an L-shaped object.

[[Image:CoG of L shape.svg|300px]]

#Divide the shape into two rectangles, as shown in fig 2. Find the centroids of these two rectangles by drawing the diagonals. Draw a line joining the centroids. The centroid of the shape must lie on this line AB.
#Divide the shape into two other rectangles, as shown in fig 3. Find the centroids of these two rectangles by drawing the diagonals. Draw a line joining the centroids. The centroid of the L-shape must lie on this line CD.
#As the centroid of the shape must lie along AB and also along CD, it must be at the intersection of these two lines, at O. The point O might ''not'' lie inside the L-shaped object.

|}

The centroid of a [[triangle]] is the point of intersection of its [[median (geometry)|medians]] (the lines joining each [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] with the midpoint of the opposite side). The centroid divides each of the medians in the [[ratio]] 2:1, which is to say it is located ⅓ of the distance from each side to the opposite vertex (see figures at right).  Its [[Cartesian coordinates]] are the [[arithmetic mean|means]] of the coordinates of the three vertices. That is, if the three vertices are &lt;math&gt;L = (x_L, y_L),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;M= (x_M, y_M),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N= (x_N, y_N),&lt;/math&gt; then the centroid (denoted ''C'' here but most commonly denoted ''G'' in [[triangle geometry]]) is

:&lt;math&gt;
  C = \frac13(L+M+N) = \left(\frac13 (x_L+x_M+x_N),\;\;
  \frac13(y_L+y_M+y_N)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The centroid is therefore at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac13:\tfrac13:\tfrac13&lt;/math&gt; in [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]].

In [[trilinear coordinates]] the centroid can be expressed in any of these equivalent ways in terms of the side lengths ''a, b, c'' and vertex angles ''L, M, N'':&lt;ref&gt;Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangles {{cite web |url=http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETC.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419171900/http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETC.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{1}{a}:\frac{1}{b}:\frac{1}{c}=bc:ca:ab=\csc L :\csc M:\csc N&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\cos L+\cos M \cdot \cos N:\cos M+\cos N \cdot \cos L: \cos N+\cos L \cdot \cos M&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\sec L+\sec M \cdot \sec N:\sec M+\sec N \cdot \sec L: \sec N+ \sec L \cdot\sec M.&lt;/math&gt;

The centroid is also the physical center of mass if the triangle is made from a uniform sheet of material; or if all the mass is concentrated at the three vertices, and evenly divided among them.  On the other hand, if the mass is distributed along the triangle's perimeter, with uniform [[linear density]], then the center of mass lies at the [[Spieker center]] (the [[incenter]] of the [[medial triangle]]), which does not (in general) coincide with the geometric centroid of the full triangle.

The area of the triangle is 1.5 times the length of any side times the perpendicular distance from the side to the centroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Johnson|2007|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A triangle's centroid lies on its [[Euler line]] between its [[orthocenter]] ''H'' and its [[circumcenter]] ''O'', exactly twice as close to the latter as to the former:

:&lt;math&gt;CH=2CO.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, for the [[incenter]] ''I'' and [[nine-point center]] ''N'', we have

:&lt;math&gt;CH=4CN,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;CO=2CN,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;IC&lt; HC,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;IH &lt; HC,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;IC&lt; IO.&lt;/math&gt;

If G is the centroid of the triangle ABC, then:
:* &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\text{Area of triangle ABG})=(\text{Area of triangle ACG})=(\text{Area of triangle BCG})=\frac13(\text{Area of triangle ABC})&lt;/math&gt;

The [[isogonal conjugate]] of a triangle's centroid is its [[symmedian|symmedian point]].

=== Of a polygon ===
The centroid of a non-self-intersecting closed [[polygon]] defined by ''n'' vertices (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is the point (''C''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; where

: &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm x} = \frac{1}{6A}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_i+x_{i+1})(x_i\ y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}\ y_i)&lt;/math&gt; , and

: &lt;math&gt;C_{\mathrm y} = \frac{1}{6A}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i+y_{i+1})(x_i\ y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}\ y_i)&lt;/math&gt; ,

and where ''A'' is the polygon's signed area,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described by

: &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i\ y_{i+1} - x_{i+1}\ y_i)\;&lt;/math&gt;.

In these formulas, the vertices are assumed to be numbered in order of their occurrence along the polygon's perimeter; furthermore, the vertex ( ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is assumed to be the same as ( ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ), meaning ''i + 1'' on the last case must loop around to ''i = 0''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}  (If the points are numbered in clockwise order, the area ''A'', computed as above, will be negative; however, the centroid coordinates will be correct even in this case.{{cn|date=July 2018}})

=== Of a cone or pyramid ===
The centroid of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] or [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] is located on the line segment that connects the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] to the centroid of the base. For a solid cone or pyramid, the centroid is 1/4 the distance from the base to the apex. For a cone or pyramid that is just a shell (hollow) with no base, the centroid is 1/3 the distance from the base plane to the apex.

===Of a tetrahedron and ''n''-dimensional simplex===
A [[tetrahedron]] is an object in [[three-dimensional space]] having four triangles as its [[face (geometry)|faces]]. A line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the centroid of the opposite face is called a ''median'', and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a ''bimedian''. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians. These seven line segments all meet at the ''centroid'' of the tetrahedron.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Kam-tim; and Suen, Suk-nam; "Vectors, matrices and geometry", Hong Kong University Press, 1994, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; The medians are divided by the centroid in the ratio 3:1. The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its [[Monge point]] and circumcenter (center of the circumscribed sphere). These three points define the ''Euler line'' of the tetrahedron that is analogous to the [[Euler line]] of a triangle.

These results generalize to any ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]] in the following way. If the set of vertices of a simplex is &lt;math&gt;{v_0,\ldots,v_n}&lt;/math&gt;, then considering the vertices as [[vector (geometry)|vectors]], the centroid is

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{i=0}^n v_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric centroid coincides with the center of mass if the mass is uniformly distributed over the whole simplex, or concentrated at the vertices as ''n'' equal masses.

=== Of a hemisphere ===
The centroid of a solid hemisphere (i.e. half of a solid ball) divides the line segment connecting the sphere's center to the hemisphere's pole in the ratio 3:8. The centroid of a hollow hemisphere (i.e. half of a hollow sphere) divides the line segment connecting the sphere's center to the hemisphere's pole in half.

'''''Counterexamples in Topology''''' (1970, 2nd ed. 1978) is a book on [[mathematics]] by [[topology|topologist]]s [[Lynn Steen]] and [[J. Arthur Seebach, Jr.]]

In the process of working on problems like the [[metrization problem]], topologists (including Steen and Seebach) have defined a wide variety of [[topological properties]].  It is often useful in the study and understanding of abstracts such as [[topological space]]s to determine that one property does not follow from another.  One of the easiest ways of doing this is to find a [[counterexample]] which exhibits one property but not the other.  In '''''Counterexamples in Topology''''', Steen and Seebach, together with five students in an undergraduate research project at [[St. Olaf College]], [[Minnesota]] in the summer of 1967, canvassed the field of [[topology]] for such counterexamples and compiled them in an attempt to simplify the literature.

For instance, an example of a [[first-countable space]] which is not [[second-countable space|second-countable]] is counterexample #3, the [[discrete topology]] on an [[uncountable set]].  This particular counterexample shows that second-countability does not follow from first-countability.

Several other "Counterexamples in ..." books and papers have followed, with similar motivations.

==Reviews==
In her review of the first edition, [[Mary Ellen Rudin]] wrote:
:In other mathematical fields one restricts one's problem by requiring that the [[topological space|space]] be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] or [[paracompact]] or [[metric space|metric]], and usually one doesn't really care which, so long as the restriction is strong enough to avoid  this dense forest of counterexamples. A usable map of the forest is a fine thing...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mary Ellen | last=Rudin | year=1971 | title=Review: ''Counterexamples in Topology'' | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] | doi=10.2307/2318037 | volume=78 | issue=7 | pages=803–804 | mr=1536430}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his submission&lt;ref&gt;C. Wayne Patty (1971) "Review: ''Counterexamples in Topology''", {{MR|id=0266131}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Mathematical Reviews]] C. Wayne Patty wrote:
:...the book is extremely useful, and the general topology student will no doubt find it very valuable. In addition it is very well written.
When the second edition appeared in 1978 its review in [[Advances in Mathematics]] treated topology as territory to be explored:
:[[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] once said that every mathematician should be something of a [[Naturalism_(philosophy)|naturalist]].  This book, the updated journal of a continuing expedition to the never-never land of general topology, should appeal to the latent naturalist in every mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first1=Joseph | last1=Kung | first2=Gian-Carlo | last2=Rota | year=1979 | title=Review: ''Counterexamples in Topology'' | journal=[[Advances in Mathematics]] | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=81 | doi=10.1016/0001-8708(79)90031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
Several of the [[naming convention]]s in this book differ from more accepted modern conventions, particularly with respect to the [[separation axiom]]s. The authors use the terms T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to refer to [[regular space|regular]], [[normal space|normal]], and [[completely normal space|completely normal]]. They also refer to  [[completely Hausdorff space|completely Hausdorff]] as [[Urysohn space|Urysohn]]. This was a result of the different historical development of metrization theory and [[general topology]]; see [[History of the separation axioms]] for more.

Among Martin's most notable work are the proofs of [[analytic set|analytic]] [[determinacy]] (from the existence of a [[measurable cardinal]]), [[Borel set|Borel]] [[determinacy]] (from [[ZFC]] alone), the proof (with [[John R. Steel]]) of [[projective determinacy]] (from suitable [[large cardinal]] axioms), and his work on [[Martin's axiom]]. [[Martin measure]] on [[Turing degree]]s is also named after Martin.

Martin is a [[List of Harvard Junior Fellows|Harvard junior fellow]]. In 2014, he became a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2014-12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Finite State Machine with Datapath''' (FSMD) is a [[mathematical abstraction]] that is sometimes used to design [[digital logic]] or [[computer program]]s.

An FSMD is a digital system composed of a [[finite-state machine]], which controls the [[program flow]], and a [[datapath]], which performs data processing operations.

FSMDs are essentially sequential programs in which statements have been scheduled into states, thus resulting in more complex state diagrams.

Here, a program is converted into a complex state diagram in which states and arcs may include [[arithmetic expression]]s, and those expressions may use external inputs and outputs as well as variables.

FSMs do not use variables or arithmetic operations/conditions, thus FSMDs are more powerful than FSMs.

The FSMD level of abstraction is often referred to as the [[register-transfer level]].

FSMD is equivalent to [[Turing machine]] in power.

'''Gathering 4 Gardner (G4G)''' is an educational foundation and non-profit corporation (Gathering 4 Gardner, Inc.) devoted to preserving the legacy and spirit of prolific writer [[Martin Gardner]]. G4G organizes conferences where people who have been inspired by or have a strong personal connection to Martin Gardner can meet and celebrate his influence.&lt;ref name=science_news&gt;Peterson, Ivars (2006). ''[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/gathering-gardner A Gathering for Gardner]'' [[Science News]], March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These events explore ideas and developments in recreational mathematics, magic, illusion, puzzles, philosophy, and rationality, and foster creative work in all of these areas by enthusiasts of all ages.  G4G also facilitates a related series of events called Celebration of Mind (CoM).

==History==
Martin Gardner's prolific output as a columnist and writer—he authored over 100 books between 1951 and 2010—put him in contact with a large number of people on a wide range of subjects from magic, mathematics, puzzles, physics, philosophy, logic and rationality, to [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Alice in Wonderland]], and the [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]].  As a result, he had a large following of amateurs and professionals eager to pay tribute to him, but many of them had only infrequent contact with each other. Moreover, Gardner was famously shy, and generally declined to appear at any events honoring him.&lt;ref name=crease&gt;[[Robert P. Crease|Crease, Robert P.]] (2010). ''[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304370304575151970094262604 Gathering for Gardner: Homage to the iconic author of Scientific American's 'Mathematical Games' column]'' The Wall Street Journal, April 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Atlanta-based entrepreneur and puzzle collector Thomas M. Rodgers (1943–2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.yak.net/1018 Thomas M. Rodgers (1 August 1943 – 10 April 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of Martin Gardner's, conceived a plan to create a gathering of people who shared Gardner's interests, especially puzzles, magic, and mathematics.&lt;ref name= bellos&gt;Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, May 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Rodgers invited the world's foremost puzzle composers and collectors, and enlisted magician [[Mark Setteducati]] and mathematician [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] to recruit leading magicians and recreational mathematicians, respectively.&lt;ref name=science_news/&gt; Gardner agreed to attend. Thus was born the first Gathering (G4G1), held in Atlanta, GA, in January 1993.&lt;ref name=rothstein&gt;Rothstein, Edward (2006). ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/arts/puzzles-origami-and-other-mindtwisters.html Puzzles, Origami and Other Mind-Twisters]'' The New York Times, April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 board members Rodgers, Berlekamp, Setteducati, Thane Plambeck, and Scott Hudson de Tarnowsky decided that G4G should broaden its reach and expand the scope of its educational programs.  To that end they formed the 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation '''Gathering 4 Gardner, Inc.'''

The logo of Gathering for Gardner, as well as the logo for the first CoM event, employs [[ambigrams]] designed by long-time Gardner associate [[Scott Kim]].

==G4Gn events==
{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=33%
|quote= Packed with wonderful treats and startling surprises, it provided one "aha!" moment after another.&lt;ref name=science_news/&gt;
|source= –[[Ivars Peterson]]}}

Continuing Martin Gardner's pursuit of a playful and fun approach to learning, G4Gn events explore ideas in fields of interest to Gardner.  The term G4G is also used to denote the community of people who participate in these events. With the "n" denoting the number in the series, G4Gn is an invitation-only bi-annual conference that started with G4G1 in January 1993.  A second gathering (G4G2) was held in Atlanta in 1996, and from then on the events have been held bi-annually, in the springs of even-numbered years, the most recent being G4G13 which took place in April 2018 and featured [[Fields medal]]list [[Manjul Bhargava]] and inventor of the eponymous cube [[Erno Rubik]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://physicsworld.com/a/martin-gardner-would-have-smiled/ Martin Gardner would have smiled]'' 16 Apr 2018 by Robert P Crease, ''Physics World''&lt;/ref&gt; To date, all G4Gn conferences have been held in Atlanta, GA.&lt;ref name=science_news/&gt;  Gardner (and his wife), who disliked travel in addition to wanting to avoid the limelight, attended only the first two G4Gs.

Activities typically include lectures, performance art, puzzle and book displays, close-up and stage magic acts, as well as guided sculpture building. Traditionally, each conference has a Gift Exchange, in which attendees swap puzzles, magic tricks, artwork, mathematical papers, novelty items, books, and CDs/DVDs.&lt;ref name=crease/&gt;

Gardner and many of his admirers were filmed at G4G2 in 1996, and this footage formed the basis for a 46-minute episode of [[The Nature of Things]] made by [[David Suzuki]].  Titled, ''Mystery and Magic of Mathematics: Martin Gardner and Friends'', it showcases Martin's numerous passions, and reminds us of the amazing panoply of people that he informally assembled and mentored over the decades.&lt;ref name=math_aware&gt;[http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2014/calendar/gardner.html Mathematics Awareness Month 2014: Mathematics, Magic, and Mystery] mathaware.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration of Mind events==

Developed in 2010 after Martin Gardner's death that spring, Celebration of Mind (CoM) is a worldwide series of events held on or around Gardner's birthday: October 21.&lt;ref name=mulcahy&gt;Mulcahy, Colm (2012).

The goal is to celebrate the boundless creativity and curiosity of the human mind, and they have been held in locations from Boston to Beijing, and from Riga to Rio. There have been Celebration of Mind events hosted on all seven continents, and G4G encourages organizers to register their events at the CoM website.&lt;ref name=aperiodical&gt;Mulcahy, Colm (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">The '''Hilbert–Bernays paradox''' is a distinctive [[paradox]] belonging to the family of the paradoxes of [[reference]] (like [[Berry's paradox]]). It is named after [[David Hilbert]] and [[Paul Bernays]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==

The paradox appears in Hilbert and Bernays' ''[[Grundlagen der Mathematik]]'' and is used by them to show that a sufficiently strong consistent theory cannot contain its own reference functor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilbert|first1=David|last2=Bernays|first2=Paul|title=Grundlagen der Mathematik|date=1939|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|pages=263–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has gone largely unnoticed in the course of the 20th century, it has recently been rediscovered and appreciated for the distinctive difficulties it presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Priest|first1=Graham|title=Towards Non-Being|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=156–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation==

Just as the [[semantics|semantic]] property of [[truth]] seems to be governed by the naive schema:

:(T) The sentence ' ''P'' ' is true if and only if ''P''

(where we use single quotes to refer to the linguistic expression inside the quotes), the semantic property of reference seems to be governed by the naive schema:

:(R) If ''a'' exists, the referent of the name ' ''a'' ' is identical with ''a''

Consider however a name '''h''' for (natural) numbers satisfying:

:(H) '''h''' is identical with '(the referent of '''h''') +1'

Suppose that, for some number ''n'':

:(1) The referent of '''h''' is identical with ''n''

Then, surely, the referent of '''h''' exists, and so does (the referent of '''h''')+1. By (R), it then follows that:

:(2) The referent of '(the referent of '''h''')+1' is identical with (the referent of '''h''')+1

and so, by (H) and the principle of [[identity of indiscernibles|indiscernibility of identicals]], it is the case that:

:(3) The referent of '''h''' is identical with (the referent of '''h''')+1

But, again by indiscernibility of identicals, (1) and (3) yield:

:(4) The referent of '''h''' is identical with ''n'' +1

and, by [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], (1) together with (4) yields:

:(5) ''n'' is identical with ''n''+1

But (5) is absurd, since no number is identical with its successor.

==Solutions==

Since every sufficiently strong theory will have to accept something like (H),{{clarify|reason=Why should (1) be true, i.e. why should a number exist that satisfies the property h? For example, no natural number is designated by the name 'The number whose square is 2', but this isn't called a paradox.|date=May 2015}} absurdity can only be avoided either by rejecting the principle of naive reference (R) or by rejecting [[classical logic]] (which validates the reasoning from (R) and (H) to absurdity). On the first approach, typically whatever one says about the [[Liar paradox]] ''carries over smoothly'' to the Hilbert–Bernays paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Simmons|editor1-last=Beall|editor1-first=JC|title=Liars and Heaps|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=230–252|chapter=Reference and Paradox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox presents instead ''distinctive difficulties'' for many solutions pursuing the second approach: for example, solutions to the Liar paradox that reject the [[law of excluded middle]] (which is ''not'' used by the Hilbert–Bernays paradox) have denied that there is such a thing as the referent of '''h''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Hartry|title=Saving Truth from Paradox|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=291–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; solutions to the [[Liar paradox]] that reject the [[law of noncontradiction]] (which is ''not'' used by the Hilbert–Bernays paradox) have claimed that '''h''' refers to more than one object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Priest|first1=Graham|title=Towards Non-Being|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=156–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''hypercomplex number''' is a traditional term for an [[element (mathematics)|element]] of a unital [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s. 
The study of hypercomplex numbers in the late 19th century forms the basis of modern [[group representation]] theory.

==History==
In the nineteenth century [[number system]]s called [[quaternion]]s, [[tessarine]]s, [[coquaternion]]s, [[biquaternion]]s, and [[octonion]]s became established concepts in mathematical literature, added to the real and [[complex number]]s. The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all, and called for a discipline to explain and classify them.

The cataloguing project began in 1872 when [[Benjamin Peirce]] first published his ''Linear Associative Algebra'', and was carried forward by his son [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;Linear Associative Algebra (1881) [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 4(1):221&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;  Most significantly, they identified the [[nilpotent]] and the [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s as useful hypercomplex numbers for classifications. The [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] used [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s to generate complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions out of the real number system. Hurwitz and Frobenius proved theorems that put limits on hypercomplexity: [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] says finite-dimensional real [[composition algebra]]s are the reals ℝ, the complexes ℂ, the quaternions ℍ, and the octonions 𝕆, and the [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|Frobenius theorem]] says the only real [[associative division algebra]]s are ℝ, ℂ, and ℍ. In 1958 [[Frank Adams|J. Frank Adams]] published a further generalization in terms of Hopf invariants on ''H''-spaces which still limits the dimension to 1, 2, 4, or 8.&lt;ref name="Adams1958"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1970147 | title=On the Non-Existence of Elements of Hopf Invariant One | author=Adams, J. F. | journal=Annals of Mathematics |date=July 1960  | volume=72 | issue=1 | pages=20–104 | doi=10.2307/1970147| url=http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/otherpapers/Adams-HI1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]] that harnessed the hypercomplex systems. First, matrices contributed new hypercomplex numbers like [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. Soon the matrix paradigm began to explain the others as they became represented by matrices and their operations.  In 1907 [[Joseph Wedderburn]] showed that associative hypercomplex systems could be represented by matrices, or direct sums of systems of matrices. From that date the preferred term for a hypercomplex system became [[associative algebra]] as seen in the title of Wedderburn’s thesis at [[University of Edinburgh]]. Note however, that non-associative systems like octonions and  [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s represent another type of hypercomplex number.

As Hawkins&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hawkins (1972) "Hypercomplex numbers, Lie groups, and the creation of group representation theory", ''[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]'' 8:243&amp;ndash;87&lt;/ref&gt; explains, the hypercomplex numbers are stepping stones to learning about [[Lie group]]s and [[group representation]] theory. For instance, in 1929 [[Emmy Noether]] wrote on "hypercomplex quantities and representation theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Noether| first = Emmy | year = 1929 | title = Hyperkomplexe Größen und Darstellungstheorie |trans-title=Hypercomplex Quantities and the Theory of Representations | journal = Mathematische Annalen | volume = 30 | pages = 641–92|doi= 10.1007/BF01187794 | language = German |url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=11&amp;PPN=GDZPPN002371448&amp;L=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Kantor and Solodovnikov published a textbook on hypercomplex numbers which was translated in 1989.&lt;ref name=KS78&gt;Kantor, I.L., Solodownikow (1978), ''Hyperkomplexe Zahlen'', BSB B.G.

[[Karen Parshall]] has written a detailed exposition of the heyday of hypercomplex numbers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Parshall]] (1985) "Wedderburn and the Structure of Algebras" ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'' 32:223&amp;ndash;349&lt;/ref&gt; including the role of such luminaries as [[Theodor Molien]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Molien]] (1893) "Über Systeme höher complexen Zahlen", ''Mathematische Annalen'' 41:83&amp;ndash;156&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard Study]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Study]] (1898) "Theorie der gemeinen und höhern komplexen Grössen", [[Klein's encyclopedia|''Encyclopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]] I A '''4''' 147&amp;ndash;83&lt;/ref&gt; For the transition to [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], [[Bartel van der Waerden]] devotes thirty pages to hypercomplex numbers in his ''History of Algebra''.&lt;ref&gt;* [[B.L. van der Waerden]] (1985) ''A History of Algebra'', Chapter 10: The discovery of algebras, Chapter 11: Structure of algebras, Springer, {{isbn|3-540-13610X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A definition of a '''hypercomplex number''' is given by {{harvtxt|Kantor|Solodovnikov|1989}} as an element of a finite-dimensional algebra over the real numbers that is [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[distributive property|distributive]] (but not necessarily [[associative property|associative]]). Elements are generated with real number coefficients &lt;math&gt;(a_0, \dots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for a basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, i_1, \dots, i_n \}&lt;/math&gt;. Where possible, it is conventional to choose the basis so that &lt;math&gt;i_k^2 \in \{ -1, 0, +1 \}&lt;/math&gt;. A technical approach to hypercomplex numbers directs attention first to those of [[dimension]] two.

==Two-dimensional real algebras==
'''Theorem:'''&lt;ref name=KS78/&gt;{{rp|14,15}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1968) ''Complex Numbers in Geometry'', pages 10 to 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John H. Ewing editor (1991) ''Numbers'', page 237, Springer, {{isbn|3-540-97497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to isomorphism, there are exactly three 2-dimensional unital algebras over the reals: the ordinary [[complex number]]s, the [[split-complex number]]s, and the [[dual number]]s.

:Proof: Since the algebra is two dimensional, we can pick a basis ''{1, u}''.  Since the algebra is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under squaring, the non-real basis element ''u'' squares to a linear combination of 1 and ''u'':
:&lt;math&gt;u^2=a_0+a_1u&lt;/math&gt;
for some real numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Using the common method of [[completing the square]] by subtracting ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''u'' and adding the quadratic complement {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 4}} to both sides yields
:&lt;math&gt;u^2-a_1u+\frac{a_1^2}{4}=a_0+\frac{a_1^2}{4} .&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u^2-a_1u+\frac{a_1^2}{4}=\left(u-\frac{a_1}{2}\right)^2= \tilde{u}^2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; so that
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{u}^2~=a_0+\frac{a_1^2}{4} .&lt;/math&gt;
The three cases depend on this real value:
* If {{nowrap|1=4''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = −''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|1=''ũ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}}. Hence, ''ũ'' can directly be identified with the [[nilpotent]] element &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of the basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, ~\epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; of the dual numbers.
* If {{nowrap|4''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; −''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|''ũ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0}}. This leads to the split-complex numbers which have normalized basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1 , ~j \}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;j^2 = +1&lt;/math&gt;. To obtain ''j'' from ''ũ'', the latter must be divided by the positive real number &lt;math&gt;a:=\sqrt{a_0+\frac{a_1^2}{4}}&lt;/math&gt; which has the same square as ''ũ'' has.
* If {{nowrap|4''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; −''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|''ũ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 0}}. This leads to the complex numbers which have normalized basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1 , ~i \}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. To yield ''i'' from ''ũ'', the latter has to be divided by a positive real number &lt;math&gt;a:=\sqrt{\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_0}&lt;/math&gt; which squares to the negative of ''ũ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The complex numbers are the only two-dimensional hypercomplex algebra that is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]].
Algebras such as the split-complex numbers that include non-real roots of 1 also contain [[idempotent element|idempotent]]s &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} (1 \pm j)&lt;/math&gt; and [[zero divisor]]s &lt;math&gt;(1 + j)(1 - j) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so such algebras cannot be [[division algebra]]s. However, these properties can turn out to be very meaningful, for instance in describing the [[Lorentz transformations]] of [[special relativity]].

In a 2004 edition of [[Mathematics Magazine]] the two-dimensional real algebras have been styled the "generalized complex numbers".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony A. Harkin &amp; Joseph B. Harkin (2004) [http://people.rit.edu/harkin/research/articles/generalized_complex_numbers.pdf Geometry of Generalized Complex Numbers], [[Mathematics Magazine]] 77(2):118–29&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of [[cross-ratio]] of four complex numbers can be extended to the two-dimensional real algebras.&lt;ref&gt;Sky Brewer (2013) [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00006-012-0335-7 "Projective Cross-ratio on Hypercomplex Numbers"], [[Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras]] 23(1):1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher-dimensional examples (more than one non-real axis)==

===Clifford algebras===
A [[Clifford algebra]] is the unital associative algebra generated over an underlying vector space equipped with a [[quadratic form]]. Over the real numbers this is equivalent to being able to define a symmetric scalar product, ''u''⋅''v'' = ½(''uv'' + ''vu'') that can be used to [[orthogonalization|orthogonalise]] the quadratic form, to give a set of bases {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that:
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2} (e_i e_j + e_j e_i) = \Bigg\{  \begin{matrix} -1, 0, +1  &amp; i=j,  \\
                                   0 &amp;  i \not = j. \end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;
Imposing closure under multiplication generates a multivector space spanned by a basis of 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements, {1, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...}.  These can be interpreted as the basis of a hypercomplex number system. Unlike the basis {''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}, the remaining basis elements may or may not anti-commute, depending on how many simple exchanges must be carried out to swap the two factors.  So {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = −''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = +(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Putting aside the bases for which {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}} (i.e. directions in the original space over which the quadratic form was [[degenerate form|degenerate]]), the remaining Clifford algebras can be identified by the label ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), indicating that the algebra is constructed from ''p'' simple basis elements with {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +1}}, ''q'' with {{nowrap|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}, and where '''R''' indicates that this is to be a Clifford algebra over the reals—i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are to be real numbers.

These algebras, called [[geometric algebra]]s, form a systematic set, which turn out to be very useful in physics problems which involve [[rotation]]s, [[phase (waves)|phase]]s, or [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s, notably in [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetic theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].

Examples include: the [[complex number]]s ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,1&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), [[split-complex number]]s ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1,0&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), [[quaternion]]s ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), [[split-biquaternion]]s ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;0,3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), [[split-quaternion]]s {{nowrap|''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') ≈ ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;2,0&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''')}} (the natural algebra of two-dimensional space); ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;3,0&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') (the natural algebra of three-dimensional space, and the algebra of the [[Pauli matrices]]); and the [[spacetime algebra]] ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;1,3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''').

The elements of the algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') form an even subalgebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''+1,''p''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of the algebra ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''q''+1,''p''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), which can be used to parametrise rotations in the larger algebra.  There is thus a close connection between complex numbers and rotations in two-dimensional space; between quaternions and rotations in three-dimensional space; between split-complex numbers and (hyperbolic) rotations ([[Lorentz transformations]]) in 1+1-dimensional space, and so on.

Whereas Cayley–Dickson and split-complex constructs with eight or more dimensions are not associative with respect to multiplication, Clifford algebras retain associativity at any number of dimensions.

In 1995 [[Ian R. Porteous]] wrote on "The recognition of subalgebras" in his book on Clifford algebras. His Proposition 11.4 summarizes the hypercomplex cases:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian R. Porteous]] (1995) ''Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups'', pages 88–89, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|0-521-55177-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For extension beyond the classical algebras, see [[Classification of Clifford algebras]].

===Cayley–Dickson construction===
{{details|Cayley–Dickson construction}}
All of the Clifford algebras ''C''ℓ&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''q''&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') apart from the real numbers, complex numbers and the quaternions contain non-real elements that square to +1; and so cannot be division algebras.  A different approach to extending the complex numbers is taken by the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]].  This generates number systems of dimension 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, ..., with bases &lt;math&gt;\{1, i_1, \dots, i_{2^n-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where all the non-real basis elements anti-commute and satisfy &lt;math&gt;i_m^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. In 8 or more dimensions (n ≥ 3) these algebras are non-associative. In 16 or more dimensions (n ≥ 4) these algebras also have [[zero-divisor]]s.

The first algebras in this sequence are the four-dimensional [[quaternion]]s, eight-dimensional [[octonion]]s, and 16-dimensional [[sedenion]]s. An algebraic symmetry is lost with each increase in dimensionality: quaternion multiplication is not [[commutative]], octonion multiplication is non-[[associative]], and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of [[sedenion]]s is not multiplicative.

The Cayley–Dickson construction can be modified by inserting an extra sign at some stages. It then generates the "split algebras" in the collection of [[composition algebra]]s instead of the division algebras: 
: [[split-complex number]]s with basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, i_1 \}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\ i_1^2 = +1&lt;/math&gt;,
: [[split-quaternion]]s with basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, i_1, i_2, i_3 \}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\ i_1^2 = -1, i_2^2 = i_3^2 = +1&lt;/math&gt;, and
: [[split-octonion]]s with basis &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, i_1, \dots, i_7 \}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\ i_1^2 = i_2^2 = i_3^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ i_4^2 = \cdots = i_7^2 = +1 .&lt;/math&gt;
Unlike the complex numbers, the split-complex numbers are not [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], and further contain [[zero divisor]]s and non-trivial [[idempotent]]s. As with the quaternions, split-quaternions are not commutative, but further contain [[nilpotent]]s; they are isomorphic to the [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. Split-octonions are non-associative and contain nilpotents.

===Tensor products===
The [[tensor product]] of any two algebras is another algebra, which can be used to produce many more examples of hypercomplex number systems.

In particular taking tensor products with the complex numbers (considered as algebras over the reals) leads to four-dimensional [[tessarine]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;, eight-dimensional [[biquaternion]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb H&lt;/math&gt;, and 16-dimensional [[octonion|complex octonion]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb O&lt;/math&gt;.

===Further examples===
* [[bicomplex number]]s: a 4-dimensional vector space over the reals, 2-dimensional over the complex numbers
* [[multicomplex number]]s: 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers
* [[composition algebra]]: algebra with a [[quadratic form]] that composes with the product

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">In [[mathematics]], the '''integral representation theorem for classical Wiener space''' is a result in the fields of [[measure theory]] and [[stochastic processes|stochastic analysis]]. Essentially, it shows how to decompose a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on [[classical Wiener space]] into the sum of its [[expected value]] and an [[Itō integral]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt;C_{0} ([0, T]; \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; (or simply &lt;math&gt;C_{0}&lt;/math&gt; for short) be classical Wiener space with classical Wiener measure &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;F \in L^{2} (C_{0}; \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a unique Itō integrable process &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{F} : [0, T] \times C_{0} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. in &lt;math&gt;L^{2} (B)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is canonical [[Brownian motion]]) such that

:&lt;math&gt;F(\sigma) = \int_{C_{0}} F(p) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (p) + \int_{0}^{T} \alpha^{F} (\sigma)_{t} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;-almost all &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in C_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the above,
* &lt;math&gt; \int_{C_{0}} F(p) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma (p) = \mathbb{E} [F]&lt;/math&gt; is the expected value of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;; and
* the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} \cdots\, \mathrm{d} \sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is an Itō integral.

The proof of the integral representation theorem requires the [[Clark-Ocone theorem]] from the [[Malliavin calculus]].

==Corollary: integral representation for an arbitrary probability space==

Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]]. Let &lt;math&gt;B : [0, T] \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Brownian motion]] (i.e. a [[stochastic process]] whose law is [[Wiener measure]]). Let &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathcal{F}_{t} | 0 \leq t \leq T \}&lt;/math&gt; be the natural [[Filtration (abstract algebra)|filtration]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; by the Brownian motion &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t} = \sigma \{ B_{s}^{-1} (A) | A \in \mathrm{Borel} (\mathbb{R}), 0 \leq s \leq t \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f \in L^{2} (\Omega; \mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{T}&lt;/math&gt;-measurable. Then there is a unique Itō integrable process &lt;math&gt;a^{f} \in L^{2} (B)&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;f = \mathbb{E}[f] + \int_{0}^{T} a_{t}^{f} \, \mathrm{d} B_{t}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;-almost surely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''Itoh-Tsujii inversion algorithm''' is used to invert elements in a [[finite field]].  It was introduced in 1988 and first used over GF(2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) using the [[normal basis]] representation of elements, however the algorithm is generic and can be used for other bases, such as the [[polynomial basis]].  It can also be used in any finite field, GF(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;).

The algorithm is as follows:
:'''Input''': ''A'' ∈ GF(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''Output''': ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;
:#''r'' ← (''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1)/(''p'' &amp;minus; 1)
:#compute ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; in GF(''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) 
:#compute ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; · ''A''
:#compute (''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; in GF(''p'')
:#compute ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; · ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''r'' &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;
:#return ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;

This algorithm is fast because steps 3 and 5 both involve operations in the subfield GF(''p'').  Similarly, if a small value of ''p'' is used a lookup table can be used for inversion in step 4.  The majority of time spent in this algorithm is in step 2, the first exponentiation.  This is one reason why this algorithm is well-suited for the normal basis, since squaring and exponentiation are relatively easy in that basis.

Koza''' is a [[computer scientist]] and a former adjunct professor at [[Stanford University]], most notable for his work in pioneering the use of [[genetic programming]] for the optimization of complex problems. Koza co-founded of [[Scientific Games Corporation]], a company which builds computer systems to run [[Lottery#Lottery in the United States|state lotteries in the United States]]. John Koza is also credited with being the creator of the '[[scratch card]]' with the help of retail promotions specialist Daniel Bower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/magazine/who-made-that-scratch-off-lottery-ticket.html|title=Who Made That Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket?|last=Kennedy|first=Pagan|date=2013-07-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koza was born in 1944 and earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from the [[University of Michigan]], being the second person to ever earn a bachelor's degree in computer science.  He earned a doctoral degree in computer science from the University of Michigan in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Keats |first=Jonathon |date=2006-04-19 |title=John Koza Has Built an Invention Machine |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2006-04/john-koza-has-built-invention-machine |magazine=Popular Science |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koza was featured in [[Popular Science]] for his work on evolutionary programming that alters its own code to find far more complex solutions.  The machine, which he calls the "invention machine", has created antennae, circuits, and lenses, and has received a patent from the [[US Patent Office]].

In the political space, Koza advocates for a plan to revamp the way states choose their electors for the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in the United States, such that candidates who win the majority of the popular vote would then win a majority of the electors [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact|through an interstate compact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/07/24/MNGIHK4CSQ1.DTL|title=Stanford professor stumps for electoral alternative|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2006-07-24|first=Matthew|last=Yi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He established the organization "National Popular Vote" to advocate for state adoption of the policy and the election of supportive candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/12/out-of-state_group_seeks_to_ou.html|title=Out-of-state group seeks to oust Peter Courtney, president of Oregon Senate|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4911">{{other uses|Judgment (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''judgment''' (or '''judgement''') or '''assertion''' is a statement or enunciation in the [[metalanguage]]. For example, typical judgments in [[first-order logic]] would be ''that a string is a [[well-formed formula]]'', or ''that a proposition is true''. Similarly, a judgment may assert the occurrence of a [[free variable]] in an expression of the object language, or the provability of a [[proposition]]. In general, a judgment may be any inductively definable assertion in the [[metatheory]].

Judgments are used in formalizing [[Formal system|deduction systems]]: a [[logical axiom]] expresses a judgment, premises of a [[rule of inference]] are formed as a [[sequence]] of judgments, and their conclusion is a judgment as well (thus, hypotheses and conclusions of proofs are judgments). A characteristic feature of the variants of [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s is that the ''context'' is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]] contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the [[Logical consequence|derivability]] of [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]], not hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert-style deduction system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form. The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems: as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences, they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided—not even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies.

This basic diversity among the various calculi allows such difference, that the same basic thought (e.g. [[deduction theorem]]) must be proven as a [[metatheorem]] in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]], while it can be declared explicitly as a [[rule of inference]] in [[natural deduction]].

In [[type theory]], some analogous notions are used as in [[mathematical logic]] (giving rise to connections between the two fields, e.g. [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]). The abstraction in the notion of ''judgment'' in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well.

==Logical assertion==
In [[logic]], '''logical assertion''' is a statement that [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|asserts]] that a certain [[premise]] is true, and is useful for statements in proof. It is equivalent to a [[sequent]] with an empty [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]].

For example, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"''x''&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;even", the implication
:&lt;math&gt; (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0)&lt;/math&gt;
is thus true. We can also write this using the logical [[Turnstile (symbol)|assertion symbol]], as
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash \left( (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In computer programming and [[Semantics (computer science)|programming language semantics]], these are used in the form of [[assertion (computing)|assertions]]; one example is a [[loop invariant]].

'''Kharitonov's theorem''' is a result used in [[control theory]] to assess the [[stability (mathematics)|stability]] of a [[dynamical system]] when the physical parameters of the system are not known precisely. When the coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]] are known, the [[Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion]] can be used to check if the system is stable (i.e. if all [[root]]s have negative real parts). Kharitonov's theorem can be used in the case where the coefficients are only known to be within specified ranges. It provides a test of stability for a so-called [[interval polynomial]], while Routh-Hurwitz is concerned with an ordinary [[polynomial]].

==Definition== 
An interval polynomial is the family of all polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;
                        p(s)= a_0 + a_1 s^1 + a_2 s^2 + ... + a_n s^n
&lt;/math&gt;
where each coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_i \in R&lt;/math&gt; can take any value in the specified intervals
:&lt;math&gt;
                           l_i \le a_i \le u_i.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is also assumed that the leading coefficient cannot be zero: &lt;math&gt;0 \notin [l_n, u_n]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Theorem==
An interval polynomial is stable (i.e. all members of the family are stable) if and only if the four so-called '''Kharitonov polynomials'''
:&lt;math&gt;k_1(s) = l_0 + l_1 s^1 + u_2 s^2 +  u_3 s^3 + l_4 s^4 + l_5 s^5 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_2(s) = u_0 + u_1 s^1 + l_2 s^2 +  l_3 s^3 + u_4 s^4 + u_5 s^5 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_3(s) = l_0 + u_1 s^1 + u_2 s^2 +  l_3 s^3 + l_4 s^4 + u_5 s^5 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k_4(s) = u_0 + l_1 s^1 + l_2 s^2 +  u_3 s^3 + u_4 s^4 + l_5 s^5 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
are stable.

What is somewhat surprising about Kharitonov's result is that although in principle we are testing an infinite number of polynomials for stability, in fact we need to test only four.  This we can do using Routh-Hurwitz or any other method.  So it only takes four times more work to be informed about the stability of an interval polynomial than it takes to test one ordinary polynomial for stability.

Kharitonov's theorem is useful in the field of [[robust control]], which seeks to design systems that will work well despite uncertainties in component behavior due to [[measurement error]]s, changes in operating conditions, equipment wear and so on.

'''Nicolae Popescu''', [[Ph.D.]], [[D.Phil.]]&lt;!--, Member of the Romanian Academy--&gt; ({{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e poˈpesku|lang}}; 22 September 1937 – 29 July 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://codrinscutaru.blogspot.com/2010/08/matematica-pierdut-un-nume-nicolae.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Romanian [[mathematician]] and professor at the [[University of Bucharest]]. He also held a research position at the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]], and was elected a Member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1992. 

He is best known for his contributions to [[algebra]] and the theory of [[Abelian categories]]. From 1964 to 2007 he collaborated with [[Pierre Gabriel]] on the characterization of abelian categories; their best-known result is the [[Gabriel–Popescu theorem]].  His areas of expertise were [[category theory]], [[abelian category|abelian categories]] with applications to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], [[adjoint functors]], [[Limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]], the theory of sheaves, the theory of [[ring theory|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[polynomial]]s, and [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation theory]]. He also had interests and published in the following areas: [[algebraic topology]], [[algebraic geometry]], [[commutative algebra]], [[K-theory]], [[class field theory]], and [[functional analysis|algebraic function theory]]. 

Popescu published between 1962 and 2008 more than 102 papers in peer-reviewed, mathematics journals, several monographs on the theory of sheaves, and also six books on [[category theory|abelian category theory]] and [[abstract algebra]]. In a [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]]-like, energetic style, he initiated and provided scientific leadership to several seminars on category theory, sheaves and abstract algebra which resulted in a continuous stream of high-quality mathematical publications in international, peer-reviewed mathematics journals by several members participating in his Seminar series. His book ''Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules''&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Popescu. Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules, Academic Press, L. M. S. Monograph No.3, London, 1973, {{ISBN|0-12-561550-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; continues to provide valuable information to mathematicians around the world. 

==Biography==
Popescu was married, and there is a surviving wife, Professor Dr. Elena Liliana Popescu and three children. He earned his [[Master of Science|M.S.]] degree in mathematics in 1964, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in mathematics in 1967, both at the [[University of Bucharest]]. He was awarded a [[D. Phil.]] degree (Doctor Docent) in 1972 by the University of Bucharest.

In 2009 he carried out mathematics studies at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207023652/http://imar.ro/prez/prez_algebra.html Algebra research group] and also had international collaborations on three continents. He shared many moral, ethical and religious values with another famous mathematician, [[Alexander Grothendieck]], who visited the School of Mathematics in Bucharest in 1968. Like Grothendieck, he had a long-standing interest in category theory, number theory, practicing Yoga, and supporting promising young mathematicians in his fields of interest. He also supported the early developments of category theory applications in [[mathematical biology|relational biology]] and mathematical biophysics/[[mathematical biology]].

==Academic positions==
Popescu was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Bucharest in 1968 where he taught graduate students until 1972. Since 1964, he also held a [http://www.imar.ro/~nipopesc/ Research Professorship] at the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]]; the institute was closed in 1976 by order of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], for reasons related to his daughter [[Zoia Ceaușescu]], who had been hired at the institute two years before.

Oscar Goldman received his [[Ph.D]] in 1948 under [[Claude Chevalley]] at [[Princeton University]]. He was chair of the Mathematics Department at [[Brandeis University]] from 1952&lt;ref&gt;In response to an inquiry as to who was the chair of the Brandeis mathematics department in 1951, [[Richard Palais]] replied (19 Sept. 2012) by email: "I didn't become a member of the department myself until 1960, which was just a year or two after the graduate program was getting organized. Remember, Brandeis was only founded in 1948, and it takes a few years to get things organized, and I was under the impression that Oscar was the first chair, and that before 1952 there was no math department as such, just a few teachers of math. The sentence at the bottom of page 101 of Sachar's "A Host at Last" lists a group of seven original "nucleus"  members of the department, and I am reasonably sure that none of them preceded Oscar as chair."&lt;/ref&gt; to 1960. As chair of the department his immediate successor was [[Maurice Auslander]]. 

In 1962, Goldman left Brandeis to become a professor and chair of the mathematics department at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. [[Murray Gerstenhaber]] and [[Chung Tao Yang]] had persuaded [[Provost (education)|Provost]] [[David R. Goddard]] to hire Goldman to help improve the quality of U. Penn's mathematics department to the level of the mathematics departments of the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Princeton University]]. From 1963 to 1967, Goldman served as the chair of the mathematics department of U. Penn., hired several outstanding mathematicians including [[Richard Kadison]] and [[Eugenio Calabi]], and regularly consulted [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]] in making his decisions on hiring and curriculum improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.upenn.edu/History/brief_history.html brief_history – Department of Mathematics – University of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(w)=(|w|_{a_1}, |w|_{a_2}, \ldots, |w|_{a_k})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;|w|_{a_i}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of occurrences of the letter &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; in the word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^k&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''linear'' if it is of the form

&lt;math&gt;u_0+\langle u_1,\ldots,u_m\rangle=\{u_0+t_1u_1+\dots+t_mu_m \mid t_1,\ldots,t_m\in\mathbb{N}\}&lt;/math&gt; for some vectors &lt;math&gt;u_0,\ldots,u_m&lt;/math&gt;.

A subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^k&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''semi-linear'' if it is a union of finitely many linear subsets.

The formal statement of Parikh's theorem is as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be a context-free language. Let &lt;math&gt;P(L)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of Parikh vectors of words in &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;P(L) = \{p(w) \mid w \in L\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;P(L)&lt;/math&gt; is a semi-linear set.

Two languages are said to be ''commutatively equivalent'' if they have the same set of Parikh vectors. If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is any semi-linear set, the language of words whose Parikh vectors are in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is commutatively equivalent to some regular language. Thus, every context-free language is commutatively equivalent to some regular language.

==Significance==
The theorem has multiple interpretations. It shows that a context-free language over a singleton alphabet must be a [[regular language]] and that some context-free languages can only have [[ambiguous grammar]]s{{explain|reason=why exactly?|date=April 2017}}. Such languages are called ''[[inherently ambiguous language]]s''. From a [[formal grammar]] perspective, this means that some ambiguous [[context-free grammar]]s cannot be converted to equivalent unambiguous context-free grammars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">The '''Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem''' is often called the second theorem in [[extreme value theory]]. It gives the asymptotic [[tail distribution]] of a [[random variable]]&amp;nbsp;''X'', when the true distribution ''F'' of ''X'' is unknown. Unlike for the first theorem (the [[Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem]]) in extreme value theory, the interest here is in the values above a threshold.

==Conditional excess distribution function==
If we consider an unknown distribution function &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of a random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we are interested in estimating the conditional distribution function &lt;math&gt;F_u&lt;/math&gt; of the variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; above a certain threshold &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;. This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as

: &lt;math&gt;F_u(y) = P(X-u \leq y | X&gt;u) = \frac{F(u+y)-F(u)}{1-F(u)} &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq y \leq x_F-u&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_F&lt;/math&gt; is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;F_u&lt;/math&gt; describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, given that the threshold is exceeded.

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;(X_1,X_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of [[independent and identically-distributed random variables]], and let &lt;math&gt;F_u&lt;/math&gt; be their conditional excess distribution function. Pickands (1975), Balkema and de Haan (1974) posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and large &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_u&lt;/math&gt; is well approximated by the [[generalized Pareto distribution]]. That is:

: &lt;math&gt;F_u(y) \rightarrow G_{k, \sigma} (y),\text{ as }u \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;G_{k, \sigma} (y)= 1-(1+ky/\sigma)^{-1/k} &lt;/math&gt;,  if &lt;math&gt;k \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_{k, \sigma} (y)= 1-e^{-y/\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;,  if &lt;math&gt;k = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''&amp;sigma;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and ''y''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 when ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;''&amp;sigma;''/''k'' when ''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0. Since a special case of the generalized Pareto distribution is a power-law, the Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem is sometimes used to justify the use of a power-law for modeling extreme events. Still, many important distributions, such as the normal and log-normal distributions, do not have extreme-value tails that are asymptotically power-law.

==Special cases of generalized Pareto distribution==
* [[Exponential distribution]] with [[expected value|mean]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;,  if ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.
* [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|Uniform distribution]] on &lt;math&gt;[0,\sigma]&lt;/math&gt;,  if k = -1.
* [[Pareto distribution]], if ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

In [[algebra]], the '''polynomial remainder theorem''' or '''little [[Étienne Bézout|Bézout]]'s theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Piotr Rudnicki |title=Little Bézout Theorem (Factor Theorem) |journal=Formalized Mathematics |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=49–58 |url=http://mizar.org/fm/2004-12/pdf12-1/uproots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an application of [[Euclidean division of polynomials]]. It states that the remainder of the division of a [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by a [[linear polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;x-r&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;f(r) .&lt;/math&gt; In particular, &lt;math&gt;x-r&lt;/math&gt; is a [[divisor]] of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;f(r)=0,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Ron (2014), College Algebra, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; a property known as the [[factor theorem]].

== Examples ==
===Example 1===
Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 - 42&lt;/math&gt;. Polynomial division of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(x-3)&lt;/math&gt; gives the quotient &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 9x - 27&lt;/math&gt; and the remainder &lt;math&gt;-123&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f(3)=-123&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example 2===
Show that the polynomial remainder theorem holds for an arbitrary second degree polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; by using algebraic manipulation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{f(x)}{{x - r}} &amp;= \frac{{a{x^2} + bx + c}}{{x - r}} \\
 &amp;= \frac{{a{x^2} - arx + arx + bx + c}}{{x - r}} \\
 &amp;= \frac{{ax(x - r) + (b + ar)x + c}}{{x - r}} \\
 &amp;= ax + \frac{{(b + ar)(x - r) + c + r(b + ar)}}{{x - r}} \\
 &amp;= ax + b + ar + \frac{{c + r(b + ar)}}{{x - r}} \\
 &amp;= ax + b + ar + \frac{{a{r^2} + br + c}}{{x - r}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying both sides by (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'') gives
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = (ax + b + ar)(x - r) + {a{r^2} + br + c}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;R = ar^2 + br + c&lt;/math&gt; is our remainder, we have indeed shown that &lt;math&gt;f(r) = R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Proof ==

The polynomial remainder theorem follows from the theorem of [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]], which, given two polynomials ''f''(''x'') (the dividend) and ''g''(''x'') (the divisor), asserts the existence (and the uniqueness) of a quotient ''q''(''x'') and a remainder ''R''(''x'') such that
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=q(x)g(x) + R(x)\quad \text{and}\quad R(x) =0 \; \text{or}\; \deg(R)&lt;\deg(g)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If we take &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x-r&lt;/math&gt; as the divisor, either ''R'' = 0 or its degree is zero; in both cases,  ''R'' is a constant that is independent of ''x''; that is 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=q(x)(x-r) + R\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt;x=r&lt;/math&gt; in this formula, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;f(r)=R\,.&lt;/math&gt;

A slightly different proof, which may appear to some people as more elementary, starts with an observation that &lt;math&gt;f(x)-f(r)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear combination]] of the terms of the form  &lt;math&gt;x^k-r^k&lt;/math&gt;, each of which is divisible by &lt;math&gt;x-r&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;x^k-r^k=(x-r)(x^{k-1}+x^{k-2}r+\dots+xr^{k-2}+r^{k-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==

The polynomial remainder theorem may be used to evaluate &lt;math&gt;f(r)&lt;/math&gt; by calculating the remainder, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[polynomial long division]] is more difficult than evaluating the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] itself, [[synthetic division]] is computationally easier.  Thus, the function may be more "cheaply" evaluated using synthetic division and the polynomial remainder theorem.

The [[factor theorem]] is another application of the remainder theorem: if the remainder is zero, then the linear divisor is a factor. Repeated application of the factor theorem may be used to factorize the polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Ron (2011), Precalculus with Limits, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28527">In [[probability theory]] and [[mathematical physics]], a '''random matrix''' is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]-valued [[random variable]]&amp;mdash;that is, a matrix in which some or all elements are random variables. Many important properties of [[physical system]]s can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example, the [[thermal conductivity]] of a [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]] can be computed from the dynamical matrix of the particle-particle interactions within the lattice.

==Applications==

===Physics===

In [[nuclear physics]], random matrices were introduced by [[Eugene Wigner]] to model the nuclei of heavy atoms.&lt;ref name=wigner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wigner|first=E.|title=Characteristic vectors of bordered matrices with infinite dimensions|journal=Annals of Mathematics |year=1955 |volume=62 |pages=548–564|doi=10.2307/1970079|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He postulated that the spacings between the lines in the spectrum of a heavy atom nucleus should resemble the spacings between the [[eigenvalues]] of a random matrix, and should depend only on the symmetry class of the underlying evolution.&lt;ref name=mehta&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=M.L.|title=Random Matrices|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-12-088409-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[solid-state physics]], random matrices model the behaviour of large disordered [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] in the [[mean field]] approximation.

In [[quantum chaos]], the Bohigas–Giannoni–Schmit (BGS) conjecture asserts that the spectral statistics of quantum systems whose classical counterparts exhibit chaotic behaviour are described by random matrix theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohigas|first=O.|last2=Giannoni|first2=M.J.|last3=Schmit|first3=Schmit|title=Characterization of Chaotic Quantum Spectra and Universality of Level Fluctuation Laws|journal=Phys.

In [[quantum optics]], transformations described by random unitary matrices are crucial for demonstrating the advantage of quantum over classical computation (see, e.g., the [[boson sampling]] model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=Scott|last2=Arkhipov|first2=Alex|title=The computational complexity of linear optics|journal=Theory of Computing|date=2013|volume=9|pages=143–252|doi=10.4086/toc.2013.v009a004|url=http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v009a004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, such random unitary transformations can be directly implemented in an optical circuit, by mapping their parameters to optical circuit components (that is [[beam splitter|beam splitters]] and phase shifters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Nicholas|last2=Chakhmakhchyan|first2=Levon|last3=O'Brien|first3=Jeremy|last4=Laing|first4=Anthony|journal=New J.

===Mathematical statistics and numerical analysis===

In [[multivariate statistics]],  random matrices were introduced by [[John Wishart (statistician)|John Wishart]] for statistical analysis of large samples;&lt;ref name=wishart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wishart|first=J.|title=Generalized product moment distribution in samples|journal=Biometrika|year=1928|volume=20A|issue=1–2|pages=32–52|doi=10.1093/biomet/20a.1-2.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[estimation of covariance matrices]].

Significant results have been shown that extend the classical scalar [[Chernoff bound|Chernoff]], [[Bernstein inequalities (probability theory)|Bernstein]], and [[Hoeffding's inequality|Hoeffding]] inequalities to the largest eigenvalues of finite sums of random [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tropp | first=J.|title=User-Friendly Tail Bounds for Sums of Random Matrices|journal=Foundations of Computational Mathematics|year=2011|doi=10.1007/s10208-011-9099-z|volume=12|pages=389–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Corollary results are derived for the maximum singular values of rectangular matrices.

In [[numerical analysis]], random matrices have been used since the work of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Herman Goldstine]]&lt;ref name=vng&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Neumann|first=J.|last2=Goldstine|first2=H.H.|title=Numerical inverting of matrices of high order|journal=Bull.

===Number theory===

In [[number theory]], the distribution of zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (and other [[L-function]]s) is modelled by the distribution of eigenvalues of certain random matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keating|first=Jon|title=The Riemann zeta-function and quantum chaology|journal=Proc. Internat. School of Phys. Enrico Fermi|year=1993|volume=CXIX|pages=145–185|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-81588-0.50008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection was first discovered by [[Hugh Montgomery (mathematician)|Hugh Montgomery]] and [[Freeman J. Dyson]]. It is connected to the [[Hilbert–Pólya conjecture]].

===Theoretical neuroscience===

In the field of theoretical neuroscience, random matrices are increasingly used to model the network of synaptic connections between neurons in the brain.  Dynamical models of neuronal networks with random connectivity matrix were shown to exhibit a phase transition to chaos &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sompolinsky|first=H.|author2=Crisanti, A. |author3=Sommers, H. |title=Chaos in Random Neural Networks|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=July 1988|volume=61|issue=3|pages=259–262|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.259|bibcode = 1988PhRvL..61..259S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  when the variance of the synaptic weights crosses a critical value, at the limit of infinite system size. Relating the statistical properties of the spectrum of biologically inspired random matrix models to the dynamical behavior of randomly connected neural networks is an intensive research topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=García del Molino|first=Luis Carlos|author2=Pakdaman, Khashayar |author3=Touboul, Jonathan |author4= Wainrib, Gilles |title=Synchronization in random balanced networks|journal=Physical Review E|date=October 2013|volume=88|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.88.042824|bibcode = 2013PhRvE..88d2824G |arxiv=1306.2576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Kanaka|author2=Abbott, L. |title=Eigenvalue Spectra of Random Matrices for Neural Networks|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=November 2006|volume=97|issue=18|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.188104|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97r8104R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wainrib|first=Gilles|author2=Touboul, Jonathan |title=Topological and Dynamical Complexity of Random Neural Networks|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=March 2013|volume=110|issue=11|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.118101|arxiv = 1210.5082 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110k8101W|pmid=25166580|page=118101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timme|first=Marc|author2=Wolf, Fred |author3=Geisel, Theo |title=Topological Speed Limits to Network Synchronization|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=February 2004|volume=92|issue=7|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.074101|arxiv = cond-mat/0306512 |bibcode = 2004PhRvL..92g4101T |pmid=14995853 |page=074101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muir|first1=Dylan|last2=Mrsic-Flogel|first2=Thomas|title=Eigenspectrum bounds for semirandom matrices with modular and spatial structure for neural networks|journal=Phys.

===Optimal control===

In [[optimal control]] theory, the evolution of ''n''  state variables through time depends at any time on their own values and on the values of ''k'' control variables. With linear evolution, matrices of coefficients appear in the state equation (equation of evolution). In some problems the values of the parameters in these matrices are not known with certainty, in which case there are random matrices in the state equation and the problem is known as one of [[stochastic control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chow |first=Gregory P. |year=1976 |title=Analysis and Control of Dynamic Economic Systems |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-15616-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch. 13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnovsky |first=Stephen |year=1976 |title=Optimal stabilization policies for stochastic linear systems: The case of correlated multiplicative and additive disturbances |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=191–194 |jstor=2296741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnovsky |first=Stephen |year=1974 |title=The stability properties of optimal economic policies |journal=American Economic Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=136–148 |jstor=1814888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key result in the case of [[linear-quadratic control]] with stochastic matrices is that the [[certainty equivalence principle]] does not apply: while in the absence of [[multiplier uncertainty]] (that is, with only additive uncertainty) the optimal policy with a quadratic loss function coincides with what would be decided if the uncertainty were ignored, this no longer holds in the presence of random coefficients in the state equation.

==Gaussian ensembles==

The most studied random matrix ensembles are the Gaussian ensembles.

The '''Gaussian unitary ensemble''' GUE(''n'') is described by the [[Gaussian measure]] with density

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{Z_{\text{GUE}(n)}} e^{- \frac{n}{2} \mathrm{tr} H^2} &lt;/math&gt;

on the space of ''n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;n'' [[Hermitian matrices]] ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''H''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;){{su|b=''i'',''j''=1|p=''n''}}. Here ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;GUE&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;/sup&gt; is a normalization constant, chosen so that the integral of the density is equal to one. The term ''unitary'' refers to the fact that the distribution is invariant under unitary conjugation.
The Gaussian unitary ensemble models [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] lacking time-reversal symmetry.

The '''Gaussian orthogonal ensemble''' GOE(''n'') is described by the Gaussian measure with density

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{Z_{\text{GOE}(n)}} e^{- \frac{n}{4} \mathrm{tr} H^2} &lt;/math&gt;

on the space of ''n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;n'' real symmetric matrices ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''H''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;){{su|b=''i'',''j''=1|p=''n''}}. Its distribution is invariant under orthogonal conjugation, and it models Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry.

The '''Gaussian symplectic ensemble''' GSE(''n'') is described by the Gaussian measure with density

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{Z_{\text{GSE}(n)}} e^{- n \mathrm{tr} H^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;

on the space of ''n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;n'' Hermitian [[Quaternionic matrix|quaternionic matrices]], e.g. symmetric square matrices composed of [[quaternion]]s, ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''H''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;){{su|b=''i'',''j''=1|p=''n''}}. Its distribution is invariant under conjugation by the [[symplectic group]], and it models Hamiltonians with time-reversal symmetry but no rotational symmetry.

The joint [[probability density function|probability density]] for the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of GUE/GOE/GSE is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z_{\beta, n}} \prod_{k=1}^n e^{-\frac{\beta n}{4}\lambda_k^2}\prod_{i&lt;j}\left|\lambda_j-\lambda_i\right|^\beta~, \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[freeman dyson|Dyson]] index, ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 for GOE, ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 for GUE, and ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 for GSE, counts the number of real components per matrix element; ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;beta;'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a normalization constant which can be explicitly computed, see [[Selberg integral]]. In the case of GUE (''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2), the formula (1) describes a [[determinantal point process]]. Eigenvalues repel as the joint probability density has a zero (of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;th order) for coinciding eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j=\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For the distribution of the largest eigenvalue for GOE, GUE and Wishart matrices of finite dimensions, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chiani M|title=Distribution of the largest eigenvalue for real Wishart and Gaussian random matrices and a simple approximation for the Tracy-Widom distribution|journal=Journal of Multivariate Analysis |volume=129|pages=69–81|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.jmva.2014.04.002|arxiv = 1209.3394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of level spacings===

From the ordered sequence of eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 &lt; \ldots &lt; \lambda_n &lt; \lambda_{n+1} &lt; \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, one defines the normalized [[Level-spacing distribution|spacings]] &lt;math&gt;s = (\lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n)/\langle s \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle s \rangle =\langle  \lambda_{n+1} - \lambda_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the mean spacing. The probability distribution of spacings is approximately given by,

: &lt;math&gt;  p_1(s) = \frac{\pi}{2}s\, \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\pi}{4} s^2}  &lt;/math&gt;
                                                                             
for the orthogonal ensemble GOE &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;,                                    
                                                                             
:&lt;math&gt; p_2(s) = \frac{32}{\pi^2}s^2 \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{4}{\pi} s^2}  &lt;/math&gt;                
                                                                             
for the unitary ensemble GUE &lt;math&gt;\beta=2&lt;/math&gt;,  and                                  
                                                                            
:&lt;math&gt; p_4(s) = \frac{2^{18}}{3^6\pi^3}s^4 \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{64}{9\pi} s^2}   &lt;/math&gt;        
                                                                          
for the symplectic ensemble GSE &lt;math&gt;\beta=4&lt;/math&gt;.

The numerical constants are such that &lt;math&gt; p_\beta(s) &lt;/math&gt; is normalized:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty ds\,p_\beta(s) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

and the mean spacing is,

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty ds\, s\, p_\beta(s) = 1, &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; \beta = 1,2,4 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalizations==

''Wigner matrices'' are random Hermitian matrices &lt;math&gt; \textstyle H_n = (H_n(i,j))_{i,j=1}^n &lt;/math&gt; such that the entries
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ H_n(i, j)~, \, 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
above the main diagonal are independent random variables with zero mean, and
:&lt;math&gt; \left\{ H_n(i, j)~, \, 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n \right\} &lt;/math&gt;
have identical second moments.

''Invariant matrix ensembles'' are random Hermitian matrices with density on the space of real symmetric/ Hermitian/ quaternionic Hermitian matrices, which is of the form
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{Z_n} e^{- n \mathrm{tr} V(H)}~, &lt;/math&gt;
where the function ''V'' is called the potential.

The Gaussian ensembles are the only common special cases of these two classes of random matrices.

==Spectral theory of random matrices==

The spectral theory of random matrices studies the distribution of the eigenvalues as the size of the matrix goes to infinity.

===Global regime===
In the ''global regime'', one is interested in the distribution of linear statistics of the form ''N&lt;sub&gt;f, H&lt;/sub&gt; = n&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'' tr ''f(H)''.

====Empirical spectral measure====

The ''empirical spectral measure'' ''μ&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''H'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \mu_{H}(A) = \frac{1}{n} \, \# \left\{ \text{eigenvalues of }H\text{ in }A \right\} = N_{1_A, H}, \quad A \subset \mathbb{R}. &lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the limit of &lt;math&gt; \mu_{H} &lt;/math&gt; is a deterministic measure; this is a particular case of [[self-averaging]]. The [[cumulative distribution function]] of the limiting measure is called the [[density of states|integrated density of states]] and is denoted ''N''(''λ''). If the integrated density of states is differentiable, its derivative is called the [[density of states]] and is denoted&amp;nbsp;''ρ''(''λ'').

The limit of the empirical spectral measure for Wigner matrices was described by [[Eugene Wigner]]; see [[Wigner semicircle distribution]] and [[Wigner surmise]]. As far as sample covariance matrices are concerned, a theory was developed by Marčenko and Pastur.&lt;ref name=MP&gt;.{{cite journal |last1=Marčenko |first1=V A |last2=Pastur |first2=L A |title=Distribution of eigenvalues for some sets of random matrices |journal=Mathematics of the USSR-Sbornik  |volume=1 |issue=4  |year=1967 |doi=10.1070/SM1967v001n04ABEH001994 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0025-5734/1/4/A01;jsessionid=F84D52B000FBFEFEF32CCB5FD3CEF2A1.c1 |pages=457–483 |bibcode = 1967SbMat...1..457M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pastur72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pastur|first=L.A.|title=Spectra of random self-adjoint operators|journal=Russ.

The limit of the empirical spectral measure of invariant matrix ensembles is described by a certain integral equation which arises from [[potential theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pastur|first=L.|last2=Shcherbina|first2 = M.|author2-link= Mariya Shcherbina |title=On  the  Statistical Mechanics Approach in  the Random Matrix Theory:  Integrated  Density  of  States|journal=J.

====Fluctuations====

For the linear statistics ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''f'',''H''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;∑&amp;nbsp;''f''(''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), one is also interested in the fluctuations about ∫&amp;nbsp;''f''(''&amp;lambda;'')&amp;nbsp;''dN''(''&amp;lambda;''). For many classes of random matrices, a central limit theorem of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{N_{f,H} - \int f(\lambda) \, dN(\lambda)}{\sigma_{f, n}} \overset{D}{\longrightarrow} N(0, 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is known, see,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johansson|first=K.|title=On fluctuations of eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices|journal=Duke Math. J.|year=1998|volume=91|issue=1|pages=151–204|doi=10.1215/S0012-7094-98-09108-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pastur|first=L.A.|title=A simple approach to the global regime of Gaussian ensembles of random matrices|journal=Ukrainian Math. J.|year=2005|volume=57|issue=6|pages=936–966|doi=10.1007/s11253-005-0241-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

===Local regime===
In the ''local regime'', one is interested in the spacings between eigenvalues, and, more generally, in the joint distribution of eigenvalues in an interval of length of order 1/''n''. One distinguishes between ''bulk statistics'', pertaining to intervals inside the support of the limiting spectral measure, and ''edge statistics'', pertaining to intervals near the boundary of the support.

====Bulk statistics====
Formally, fix &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of the [[Support (measure theory)|support]] of &lt;math&gt;N(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. Then consider the [[point process]]

:&lt;math&gt; \Xi(\lambda_0) = \sum_j \delta\Big({\cdot} - n \rho(\lambda_0) (\lambda_j - \lambda_0) \Big)~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues of the random matrix.

The point process &lt;math&gt;\Xi(\lambda_0)&lt;/math&gt; captures the statistical properties of eigenvalues in the vicinity of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;. For the [[#Gaussian_ensembles|Gaussian ensembles]], the limit of &lt;math&gt;\Xi(\lambda_0)&lt;/math&gt; is known;&lt;ref name=mehta /&gt; thus, for GUE it is a [[determinantal point process]] with the kernel

:&lt;math&gt; K(x, y) = \frac{\sin \pi(x-y)}{\pi(x-y)} &lt;/math&gt;
(the ''sine kernel'').

The ''universality'' principle postulates that the limit of &lt;math&gt;\Xi(\lambda_0)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; should depend only on the symmetry class of the random matrix (and neither on the specific model of random matrices nor on &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt;). This was rigorously proved for several models of random matrices: for invariant matrix ensembles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Wishart matrices===

{{main article|Wishart distribution}}

''Wishart matrices'' are ''n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;n'' random matrices of the form ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''X'' is an ''n&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;m'' random matrix (''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n'') with independent entries, and ''X''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is its [[conjugate transpose]]. In the important special case considered by Wishart, the entries of ''X'' are identically distributed Gaussian random variables (either real or complex).

The limit of the empirical spectral measure of Wishart matrices was found&lt;ref name=MP /&gt; by [[Vladimir Marchenko]] and [[Leonid Pastur]], see [[Marchenko–Pastur distribution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">In [[computer algebra]], a '''regular chain''' is a particular kind of triangular set in a multivariate polynomial ring over a field. It enhances the notion of [[Wu's method of characteristic set|characteristic set]].

== Introduction ==

Given a [[System of linear equations|linear system]], one can convert it to a [[Triangular matrix|triangular system]] via [[Gaussian elimination]]. For the non-linear case, given a [[System of polynomial equations|polynomial system]] F over a field, one can convert (decompose or triangularize) it to a finite set of triangular sets, in the sense that the [[algebraic variety]] ''V''(F) is described by these triangular sets.

A triangular set may merely describe the empty set. To fix this degenerated case, the notion of regular chain was introduced, independently by Kalkbrener (1993), Yang and Zhang (1994). Regular chains also appear in Chou and Gao (1992). Regular chains are special triangular sets which are used in different algorithms for computing unmixed-dimensional decompositions of algebraic varieties. Without using factorization, these decompositions have better properties that the ones produced by [[Wu's method|Wu's algorithm]]. Kalkbrener's original definition was based on the following observation: every irreducible variety is uniquely determined by one of its [[generic point]]s and varieties can be represented by describing the generic points of their irreducible components. These generic points are given by regular chains.

== Examples ==

Denote '''Q''' the rational number field. In '''Q'''[x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] with variable ordering x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;T = \{ x_2^2-x_1^2, x_2(x_3-x_1)\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a triangular set and also a regular chain. Two generic points given by ''T'' are (a, a, a) and (a, -a, a) where ''a'' is transcendental over '''Q'''.
Thus there are two irreducible components, given by { x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; } and { x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }, respectively.
Note that: (1) the [[content (algebra)|content]] of the second polynomial is x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which does not contribute to the generic points represented and thus can be removed; (2) the [[dimension]] of each component is 1, the number of free variables in the regular chain.

== Formal definitions ==

The variables in the polynomial ring 
:&lt;math&gt;R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; 
are always sorted as x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. 
A non-constant polynomial ''f'' in  &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a univariate polynomial in its greatest variable.
The greatest variable in ''f'' is called its main variable, denoted by ''mvar''(f). Let ''u'' be 
the main variable of ''f'' and write it as 
:&lt;math&gt;f = a_eu^e + \cdots + a_0&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''e'' is the degree of ''f'' w.r.t. ''u''  and &lt;math&gt;a_e&lt;/math&gt; is 
the leading coefficient of ''f'' w.r.t. ''u''.  Then the initial of ''f''
is &lt;math&gt;a_e&lt;/math&gt; and ''e'' is its main degree.

*Triangular set

A non-empty subset ''T'' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a triangular set, 
if the polynomials in ''T'' are non-constant and have distinct main variables. 
Hence, a triangular set is finite, and has cardinality at most ''n''.

*Regular chain

Let T = {t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;} be a triangular set such that 
''mvar''(t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; ... &lt; ''mvar''(t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;), 
&lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; be the initial of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h'' be the product of h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s. 
Then ''T'' is a ''regular chain'' if 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{resultant}(h, T) = 
\mathrm{resultant}(\cdots(\mathrm{resultant}(h, t_s),\ldots, t_i)\cdots)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, 
where each [[resultant]] is computed with respect to the main variable of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.  
This definition is from Yang and Zhang, which is of much algorithmic flavor.

*Quasi-component and saturated ideal of a regular chain

The ''quasi-component'' ''W''(''T'') described by the regular chain ''T'' is 
:&lt;math&gt;W(T)=V(T)\setminus V(h)&lt;/math&gt;, that is,
the set difference of the varieties ''V''(''T'') and ''V''(''h''). 
The attached algebraic object of a regular chain is its ''saturated ideal'' 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sat}(T)=(T):h^\infty&lt;/math&gt;. 
A classic result is that the [[Zariski closure]] of ''W''(''T'') equals the variety defined by sat(''T''), that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{W(T)}=V(\mathrm{sat}(T))&lt;/math&gt;,
and its dimension is n - |T|, the difference of the number of variables and the number of polynomials in ''T''.

*Triangular decompositions

In general, there are two ways to decompose a polynomial system ''F''. The first one is to decompose lazily, that is, only to represent its [[generic point]]s in the (Kalkbrener) sense,
: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(F)}=\cap_{i=1}^{e}\sqrt{\mathrm{sat}(T_i)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The second is to describe all zeroes in the [[Daniel Lazard|Lazard]] sense,
: &lt;math&gt;V(F)=\cup_{i=1}^{e}W(T_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
There are various algorithms available for triangular decompositions in either sense.

== Properties ==

Let ''T'' be a regular chain in the polynomial ring ''R''.

* The saturated ideal sat(''T'') is an ''unmixed ideal'' with dimension n − |''T''|.
* A regular chain holds a strong elimination property in the sense that:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{sat}(T \cap k[x_1, \ldots , x_i]) = \mathrm{sat}(T) \cap k[x_1,\ldots , x_i] &lt;/math&gt;.

* A polynomial ''p'' is in sat(''T'') if and only if p is pseudo-reduced to zero by ''T'', that is,
: &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathrm{sat}(T)\iff \mathrm{prem}(p, T)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
:Hence the membership test for sat(''T'') is algorithmic.

* A polynomial p is a '''[[zero-divisor]]''' modulo sat(''T'') if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{prem}(p, T)\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{resultant}(p, T)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
:Hence the regularity test for sat(''T'') is algorithmic.

* Given a prime ideal ''P'', there exists a regular chain ''C'' such that ''P'' = sat(''C'').
* If the first element of a regular chain ''C'' is an irreducible polynomial and the others are linear in their main variable, then sat(''C'') is a prime ideal.
* Conversely, if ''P'' is a prime ideal, then, after almost all linear changes of variables, there exists a regular chain ''C'' of the preceding shape such that ''P'' = sat(''C'').
* A triangular set is a regular chain if and only if it is a [[Wu's method of characteristic set#Ritt characteristic set|Ritt characteristic set]] of its saturated ideal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5747">In [[mathematics]], the '''resolvent formalism''' is a technique for applying concepts from [[complex analysis]] to the study of the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s on [[Banach space|Banach spaces]] and more general spaces. Formal justification for the manipulations can be found in the framework of [[holomorphic functional calculus]].

The '''resolvent''' captures the spectral properties of an operator in the analytic structure of the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]. Given an operator {{mvar|A}}, the resolvent may be defined as
: &lt;math&gt; R(z;A)= (A-zI)^{-1}~. &lt;/math&gt;

Among other uses, the resolvent may be used to solve the inhomogeneous [[Fredholm integral equation]]s; a commonly used approach is a series solution, the [[Liouville-Neumann series]].

The resolvent of {{mvar|A}} can be used to directly obtain information about the [[spectral decomposition]]
of {{mvar|A}}. For example, suppose {{mvar|λ}}  is an isolated [[eigenvalue]] in the 
[[spectrum]] of {{mvar|A}}. That is, suppose there exists a simple closed curve &lt;math&gt; C_\lambda &lt;/math&gt; 
in the complex plane that separates   {{mvar|λ}} from the rest of the spectrum of {{mvar|A}}.
Then the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]] 
: &lt;math&gt; -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{C_\lambda} (A- z I)^{-1}~ dz &lt;/math&gt;
defines a [[projection operator]] onto the  {{mvar|λ}} [[eigenspace]] of {{mvar|A}}. {{further|Frobenius covariant|Holomorphic functional calculus}}

The [[Hille-Yosida theorem]] relates the resolvent through a [[Laplace transform]] to an integral over the one-parameter [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations generated by {{mvar|A}}.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, section 9 of Appendix A.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for example, if {{mvar|A}} is [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]], then {{math|''U''(''t'') {{=}} exp(''itA'')}} is a one-parameter group of unitary operators. The resolvent of ''iA'' can be expressed as their [[Laplace transform]] integral 
: &lt;math&gt;R(z;iA)= \int_0^\infty e^{-zt}U(t) dt~.&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
The first major use of the resolvent operator as a series in {{mvar|A}} (cf.  [[Liouville-Neumann series]]) was by [[Ivar Fredholm]], in a landmark 1903 paper in ''Acta Mathematica'' that helped establish modern [[operator theory]].  

The name ''resolvent'' was given by [[David Hilbert]].

==Resolvent identity==
For all {{math|''z, w''}}  in   {{math|''ρ''(''A'')}}, the [[resolvent set]] of an operator  {{mvar|A}}, we have that the '''first resolvent identity''' (also called Hilbert's identity) holds:&lt;ref&gt;Dunford and Schwartz, Vol I, Lemma 6, p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(z; A) - R(w; A) = (z-w) R(z;A) R(w;A)\, . &lt;/math&gt;
(Note that Dunford and Schwartz, cited, define the resolvent as {{math|(''zI −A'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, instead, so that the formula above  differs in sign from theirs.)

The '''second resolvent identity''' is a generalization of the first resolvent identity, above, useful for comparing the resolvents of two distinct operators.    Given operators  {{mvar|A}} and  {{mvar|B}}, both defined on the same linear space,  and {{mvar|z}}  in {{math|''ρ''(''A'')∩''ρ''(''B'')}} the following identity holds,&lt;ref&gt; Hille and Phillips, Theorem 4.8.2, p. 126 &lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(z;A) - R(z;B) = R(z;A)(B-A) R(z;B) \, .  &lt;/math&gt;

==Compact resolvent==
When studying an [[unbounded operator]]     {{mvar|A}}: {{mvar|H}} → {{mvar|H}} on a [[Hilbert space]]  {{mvar|H}}, if there exists &lt;math&gt;z\in\rho(A)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;R(z;A)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact operator]], we say that  {{mvar|A}} has compact resolvent. The spectrum &lt;math&gt;\sigma(A)&lt;/math&gt; of such  {{mvar|A}}  is a discrete subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If furthermore {{mvar|A}} is [[self-adjoint]], then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(A)\subset\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and there exists an orthonormal basis &lt;math&gt;\{v_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; of eigenvectors of  {{mvar|A}} with eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Also, &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda_i\}&lt;/math&gt; has no finite [[accumulation point]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13996">In [[mathematics]], the '''Robinson–Schensted correspondence''' is a [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence between [[permutation]]s and pairs of standard [[Young tableaux]] of the same shape. It has various descriptions, all of which are of algorithmic nature, it has many remarkable properties, and it has applications in [[combinatorics]] and other areas such as [[representation theory]]. The correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways, notably by Knuth to what is known as the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]], and  a further generalization to [[picture (mathematics)|picture]]s by Zelevinsky.

The simplest description of the correspondence is using the '''Schensted algorithm''' {{harvs|author=Craige Schensted| last=Schensted |year=1961}}, a procedure that constructs one tableau by successively inserting the values of the permutation according to a specific rule, while the other tableau records the evolution of the shape during construction. The correspondence had been described, in a rather different form, much earlier by Robinson {{harvs|authorlink=Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson| last=Robinson|year=1938}}, in an attempt to prove the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]]. The correspondence is often referred to as the '''Robinson–Schensted algorithm''', although the procedure used by Robinson is radically different from the Schensted–algorithm, and almost entirely forgotten. Other methods of defining the correspondence include a [[nondeterministic algorithm]] in terms of [[jeu de taquin]].

The bijective nature of the correspondence relates it to the [[enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\lambda\in\mathcal{P}_n} (t_\lambda)^2= n!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of [[Partition (number theory)|partition]]s of {{mvar|n}} (or of [[Young diagram]]s with {{mvar|n}} squares), and {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} denotes the number of standard Young tableaux of shape {{mvar|λ}}.

== The Schensted algorithm ==
The Schensted algorithm starts from the permutation {{mvar|σ}} written in two-line notation

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \cdots &amp; n\\ \sigma_1 &amp; \sigma_2 &amp; \sigma_3 &amp; \cdots &amp; \sigma_n \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''σ''(''i'')}}, and proceeds by constructing sequentially a sequence of (intermediate) ordered pairs of Young tableaux of the same shape:

:&lt;math&gt;(P_0, Q_0), (P_1, Q_1), \ldots, (P_n, Q_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are empty tableaux. The output tableaux are {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Once {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is constructed, one forms {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by ''inserting'' {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} into {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and then {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} by adding an entry {{mvar|i}} to {{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the square added to the shape by the insertion (so that {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} have equal shapes for all {{mvar|i}}). Because of the more passive role of the tableaux {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the final one {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which is part of the output and from which the previous {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are easily read off, is called the '''recording tableau'''; by contrast the tableaux {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are called '''insertion tableaux'''.

=== Insertion ===
[[Image:Young-Schensted.png|thumb|right|180px|Insertion of (4):
&lt;br/&gt;• (4) replaces (5) in the first row
&lt;br/&gt;• (5) replaces (8) in the second row
&lt;br/&gt;• (8) creates the third row]]
The basic procedure used to insert each {{math|''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is called '''Schensted insertion''' or '''row-insertion''' (to distinguish it from a variant procedure called column-insertion). Its simplest form is defined in terms of "incomplete standard tableaux": like standard tableaux they have distinct entries, forming increasing rows and columns, but some values (still to be inserted) may be absent as entries. The procedure takes as arguments such a tableau {{mvar|T}} and a value {{mvar|x}} not present as entry of {{mvar|T}}; it produces as output a new tableau denoted {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}} and a square {{mvar|s}} by which its shape has grown. The value {{mvar|x}} appears in the first row of {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}}, either having been added at the end (if no entries larger than {{mvar|x}} were present), or otherwise replacing the first entry {{math|''y'' &gt; ''x''}} in the first row of {{mvar|T}}. In the former case {{mvar|s}} is the square where {{mvar|x}} is added, and the insertion is completed; in the latter case the replaced entry {{mvar|y}} is similarly inserted into the second row of {{mvar|T}}, and so on, until at some step the first case applies (which certainly happens if an empty row of {{mvar|T}} is reached).

More formally, the following [[pseudocode]] describes the row-insertion of a new value {{mvar|x}} into {{mvar|T}}.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from {{citation|author=D. E. Knuth|authorlink=Donald Ervin Knuth|title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]]|year=1973|volume=3|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Set {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1}} and {{mvar|j}} to one more than the length of the first row of {{mvar|T}}.
# While {{math|''j'' &gt; 1}} and {{math|''x'' &lt; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i'', ''j''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, decrease {{mvar|j}} by 1. (Now {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is the first square in row {{mvar|i}} with either an entry larger than {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|T}}, or no entry at all.)
# If the square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is empty in {{mvar|T}}, terminate after adding {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|T}} in square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} and setting {{math|''s'' {{=}} (''i'', ''j'')}}.
# Swap the values {{mvar|x}} and {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;i, j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. (This inserts the old {{mvar|x}} into row {{mvar|i}}, and saves the value it replaces for insertion into the next row.)
# Increase {{mvar|i}} by 1 and return to step 2.

The shape of {{mvar|T}} grows by exactly one square, namely {{mvar|s}}.

==== Correctness ====
The fact that {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}} has increasing rows and columns, if the same holds for {{mvar|T}}, is not obvious from this procedure (entries in the same column are never even compared). It can however be seen as follows. At all times except immediately after step&amp;nbsp;4, the square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is either empty in {{mvar|T}} or holds a value greater than {{mvar|x}}; step&amp;nbsp;5 re-establishes this property because {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} now is the square immediately below the one that originally contained {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|T}}. Thus the effect of the replacement in step&amp;nbsp;4 on the value {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;i, j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is to make it smaller; in particular it cannot become greater than its right or lower neighbours. On the other hand the new value is not less than its left neighbour (if present) either, as is ensured by the comparison that just made step&amp;nbsp;2 terminate. Finally to see that the new value is larger than its upper neighbour {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1, ''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} if present, observe that {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1, ''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} holds after step&amp;nbsp;5, and that decreasing {{mvar|j}} in step&amp;nbsp;2 only decreases the corresponding value {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1, ''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

=== Constructing the tableaux ===
The full Schensted algorithm applied to a permutation {{mvar|σ}} proceeds as follows.
# Set both {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} to the empty tableau
# For {{mvar|i}} increasing from {{mvar|1}} to {{mvar|n}} compute {{math|''P'' ← ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the square {{mvar|s}} by the insertion procedure; then replace {{mvar|P}} by {{math|''P'' ← ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and add the entry {{mvar|i}} to the tableau {{mvar|Q}} in the square {{mvar|s}}.
# Terminate, returning the pair {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}}.

The algorithm produces a pair of standard Young tableaux.

==== Invertibility of the construction ====
It can be seen that given any pair {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, there is an inverse procedure that produces a permutation that will give rise to {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} by the Schensted algorithm. It essentially consists of tracing steps of the algorithm backwards, each time using an entry of {{mvar|Q}} to find the square where the inverse insertion should start, moving the corresponding entry of {{mvar|P}} to the preceding row, and continuing upwards through the rows until an entry of the first row is replaced, which is the value inserted at the corresponding step of the construction algorithm. These two inverse algorithms define a bijective correspondence between permutations of {{mvar|n}} on one side, and pairs of standard Young tableaux of equal shape and containing {{mvar|n}} squares on the other side.

== Properties ==
One of the most fundamental properties, but not evident from the algorithmic construction, is symmetry:

* If the Robinson–Schensted correspondence associates tableaux {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} to a permutation {{mvar|σ}}, then it associates {{math|(''Q'', ''P'')}} to the inverse permutation {{math|''σ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

This can be proven, for instance, by appealing to [[Viennot's geometric construction]].

Further properties, all assuming that the correspondence associates tableaux {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} to the permutation {{math|''σ'' {{=}} (''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

* In the pair of tableaux {{math|(''P''′, ''Q''′)}} associated to the reversed permutation {{math|(''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the tableau {{math|''P''′}} is the transpose of the tableau {{mvar|P}}, and {{math|''Q''′}} is a tableau determined by {{mvar|Q}}, independently of {{mvar|P}} (namely the transpose of the tableau obtained from {{mvar|Q}} by the [[Schützenberger involution]]).
* The length of the [[longest increasing subsequence]] of {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to the length of the first row of {{mvar|P}} (and of {{mvar|Q}}).
* The length of the longest decreasing subsequence of {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is equal to the length of the first column of {{mvar|P}} (and of {{mvar|Q}}), as follows from the previous two properties.
* The descent set {{math|{''i'' : ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}} of {{mvar|σ}} equals the descent set {{math|{''i'' : ''i''+1 is in a row strictly below the row of ''i''}}} of {{mvar|Q}}.
* Identify subsequences of {{mvar|π}} with their sets of indices. It is a theorem of Greene that for any {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}, the size of the largest set that can be written as the union of at most {{mvar|k}} increasing subsequences is {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In particular, {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} equals the largest length of an increasing subsequence of {{mvar|π}}.
* If {{mvar|σ}} is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], then the number of fixed points of {{mvar|σ}} equals the number of columns of odd length in {{mvar|λ}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">In mathematics, '''Sendov's conjecture''', sometimes also called '''Ilieff's conjecture''', concerns the relationship between the locations of [[zero of a function|roots]] and [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of a [[polynomial function]] of a [[complex variable]].  It is named after [[Blagovest Sendov]].

The conjecture states that for a polynomial

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = (z - r_1)\cdots (z-r_n),\qquad (n\ge 2) &lt;/math&gt;

with all roots ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; inside the closed [[unit disk]] |''z''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, each of the ''n'' roots is at a distance no more than&amp;nbsp;1 from at least one critical point.

The [[Gauss–Lucas theorem]] says that all of the critical points lie within the [[convex hull]] of the roots.  It follows that the critical points must be within the unit disk, since the roots are.

The conjecture has been proven for&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;9. 

==History==
{{citations needed|date=July 2015}}

This conjecture was first mooted by Blagovest Sendov in 1959. He proposed this conjecture to Nikola Obreschkov. In 1967 this conjecture was misattributed to Ljubomir Iliev by Walter Hayman. In 1969 Mier and Sharmaad proved the conjecture for polynomials with ''n'' &lt; 6. In 1991 Brown proved the conjecture for ''n'' &lt; 7. Borcea extended the proof to n &lt; 8 in 1996. Brown and Xiang proved the conjecture for ''n'' &lt; 9 in 1999. Degot has proven the conjecture for large ''n'' but this proof requires additional conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">In [[arithmetic]] and [[algebra]] the '''seventh [[power (algebra)|power]]''' of a number ''n'' is the result of multiplying seven instances of ''n'' together. So:
:{{math|size=120%|1=''n''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}}.

Seventh powers are also formed by multiplying a number by its [[sixth power]], the [[square number|square]] of a number by its [[fifth power (algebra)|fifth power]], or the [[cube number|cube]] of a number by its [[fourth power]].

The sequence of seventh powers of [[integer]]s is:

:0, 1, 128, 2187, 16384, 78125, 279936, 823543, 2097152, 4782969, 10000000, 19487171, 35831808, 62748517, 105413504, 170859375, 268435456, 410338673, 612220032, 893871739, 1280000000, 1801088541, 2494357888, 3404825447, 4586471424, 6103515625, 8031810176, ... {{OEIS|id=A001015}}

In the [[Zenzizenzizenzic|archaic notation]] of [[Robert Recorde]], the seventh power of a number was called the "second sursolid".{{r|womack}}

==Properties==

[[Leonard Eugene Dickson]] studied generalizations of [[Waring's problem]] for seventh powers, showing that every non-negative integer can be represented as a sum of at most 258 non-negative seventh powers.{{r|dickson}} All but finitely many positive integers can be expressed more simply as the sum of at most 46 seventh powers.{{r|kumchev}} If negative powers are allowed, only 12 powers are required.{{r|choudhry}}

The smallest number that can be represented in two different ways as a sum of four positive seventh powers is 2056364173794800.{{r|ekl}} 

The smallest seventh power that can be represented as a sum of eight distinct seventh powers is:{{r|stewart}}
:&lt;math&gt;102^7=12^7+35^7+53^7+58^7+64^7+83^7+85^7+90^7.&lt;/math&gt;

The two known examples of a seventh power expressible as the sum of seven seventh powers are

:&lt;math&gt;568^7 = 127^7+ 258^7 + 266^7 + 413^7 + 430^7 + 439^7 + 525^7&lt;/math&gt; (M. Dodrill, 1999);{{r|meyrignac}}

and

:&lt;math&gt; 626^7=625^7+309^7+258^7+255^7+158^7+148^7+91^7&lt;/math&gt; (Maurice Blondot, 11/14/2000);{{r|meyrignac}}

any example with fewer terms in the sum would be a counterexample to [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]], which is currently only known to be false for the powers 4 and 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10083">In [[number theory]], a '''smooth (or friable) number''' is an [[integer]] which [[integer factorization|factors]] completely into small [[prime number]]s. For example, a 7-smooth number is a number whose prime factors are all at most 7, so 49 = 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 15750 = 2 × 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × 7 are both 7-smooth, while 11 and 702 = 2 × 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × 13 are not. The term seems to have been coined by [[Leonard Adleman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=M. E.|last1=Hellman|authorlink1=Martin Hellman|first2=J. M.|last2=Reyneri|title=Fast computation of discrete logarithms in ''GF'' (q)|journal=Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of CRYPTO '82 (eds. D. Chaum, R. Rivest, A. Sherman)|publisher=New York: Plenum Press| year=1983|pages=3–13|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_1|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth numbers are especially important in [[cryptography]] relying on factorization. The 2-smooth numbers are just the [[Power of two|powers of 2]], while 5-smooth numbers are known as [[regular number]]s.

==Definition==
A [[negative and positive numbers|positive]] [[integer]] is called &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;-'''smooth''' if none of its [[prime factor]]s is greater than &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;. For example, 1,620 has prime factorization 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; × 5; therefore 1,620 is 5-smooth because none of its prime factors are greater than 5. This definition includes numbers that lack some of the smaller prime factors; for example, both 10 and 12 are 5-smooth, even though they miss out prime factors 3 and 5 respectively. All 5-smooth numbers are of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; × 3&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; × 5&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;, where a, b and c are positive integers or zero.

5-smooth numbers are also called ''[[regular number]]s'' or ''Hamming numbers''; 7-smooth numbers are also called '''''humble numbers''''', and sometimes called ''highly composite'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A002473|name=7-smooth numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this conflicts with another meaning of [[highly composite numbers]].

Note that &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; itself is not required to appear among the factors of a B-smooth number. If the largest prime factor of a number is &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; then the number is &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;-smooth for any &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; ≥ &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;. Usually &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt; is prime, but [[composite number]]s are permitted as well. A number is &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;-smooth [[if and only if]] it is &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;-smooth, where &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is the largest prime less than or equal to &lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;.

==Applications==
An important practical application of smooth numbers is for [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms (such as the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]) that operate by recursively breaking down a problem of a given size ''n'' into problems the size of its factors.  By using ''B''-smooth numbers, one ensures that the base cases of this recursion are small primes, for which efficient algorithms exist.  (Large prime sizes require less-efficient algorithms such as [[Bluestein's FFT algorithm]].)

5-smooth or [[regular number]]s play a special role in [[Babylonian mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Smooth numbers have a number of applications to cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=David|last1=Naccache|first2=Igor |last2=Shparlinski|title=Divisibility, Smoothness and Cryptographic Applications|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/437.pdf|date=17 October 2008|website=eprint.iacr.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}f&lt;/ref&gt;  Although most applications involve [[cryptanalysis]] (e.g. the fastest known [[integer factorization]] algorithms), the [[Very smooth hash|VSH]] hash function is one example of a constructive use of smoothness to obtain a [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure design]].

==Distribution==

Let &lt;math&gt; \Psi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of ''y''-smooth integers less than or equal to ''x'' (the de Bruijn function).

If the smoothness bound ''B'' is fixed and small, there is a good estimate for &lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,B)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi(x,B) \sim  \frac{1}{\pi(B)!} \prod_{p\le B}\frac{\log x}{\log p}. &lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\pi(B)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of primes less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B&lt;/math&gt;.

Otherwise, define the parameter ''u'' as ''u'' = log&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''y'': that is, ''x'' = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''u''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then,

:&lt;math&gt; \Psi(x,y) = x\cdot \rho(u) + O\left(\frac{x}{\log y}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(u)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dickman function]].

The average size of the smooth part of a number of given size is known as &lt;math&gt;\zeta(u)&lt;/math&gt; and it is known to decay much more slowly than &lt;math&gt;\rho(u)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BatnCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=average+smooth+part+integer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=siMO9IZjky&amp;sig=Tfk6lovpzITH_wF2twIt9C3Qm0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ89Kw6dfPAhXJIsAKHTAcDw0Q6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=average%20smooth%20part%20integer&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Information and Computer Security: 10th International Workshop on Security, IWSEC 2015, Nara, Japan, August 26-28, 2015, Proceedings|last=Tanaka|first=Keisuke|last2=Suga|first2=Yuji|date=20 August 2015|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319224251|location=|page=|pages=49–51|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any ''k'', [[almost all]] natural numbers will not be ''k''-smooth.

==Powersmooth numbers==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Table of prime factors]] --&gt;

Further, ''m'' is called ''B''-'''powersmooth''' (or ''B''-'''ultrafriable''') if all prime ''powers'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle p^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; dividing ''m'' satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt;p^{\nu} \leq B.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 720 (2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is 5-smooth but is not 5-powersmooth (because there are several prime powers greater than 5,  ''e.g.'', &lt;math&gt;3^2=9 \nleq 5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^3 &gt; 5&lt;/math&gt;). It is 16-powersmooth since its greatest prime factor power is 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16. The number is also 17-powersmooth, 18-powersmooth, etc.

''B''-smooth and ''B''-powersmooth numbers have applications in number theory, such as in [[Pollard's p &amp;minus; 1 algorithm|Pollard's ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 algorithm]]. Such applications are often said to work with "smooth numbers," with no ''B'' specified; this means the numbers involved must be ''B''-powersmooth for some unspecified small number ''B''; as ''B'' increases, the performance of the algorithm or method in question degrades rapidly. For example, the [[Pohlig–Hellman algorithm]] for computing [[discrete logarithm]]s has a running time of [[asymptotic notation|O]](''B''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of ''B''-smooth order.

==Smooth over a set A==
Moreover, ''m'' is said to be smooth over a set '''A''' if there exists a factorization of ''m'' where the factors are powers of elements in '''A'''. For example, 12=4*3, '''12''' is smooth over sets such as '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;={4,3}, '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;={2,3}, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;; however it would not be smooth over the set '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;={3,5} as 12 contains the factor 4 or 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is not in '''A'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note the set '''A''' does not have to be a set of prime factors, but it is typically a proper subset of the primes as seen in the [[factor base]] of [[Dixon's factorization method]] and the [[Quadratic sieve]]. Likewise it is what the [[General number field sieve]] uses to build its notion of smoothness under the homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\to\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.math.vt.edu/people/brown/doc/briggs_gnfs_thesis.pdf|title=An Introduction to the General Number Field Sieve|first=Matthew E.|last=Briggs|publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|website=math.vt.edu|date=17 April 1998|location=Blacksburg, Virginia|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">In [[mathematics]], a '''Suslin representation''' of a set of reals (more precisely, elements of [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]]) is a [[tree (descriptive set theory)|tree]] whose projection is that set of reals.  More generally, a subset ''A'' of κ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; is '''λ-Suslin''' if there is a [[tree (descriptive set theory)|tree]] ''T'' on κ × λ such that ''A'' = p[''T''].

By a tree on κ × λ we mean here a subset ''T'' of the union of κ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; × λ&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''i'' ∈ '''N''' (or ''i'' &lt; ω in set-theoretical notation).

Here, p[''T''] = { ''f'' | ∃''g'' : (''f'',''g'') ∈ [''T''] } is the ''projection of ''T'',
where [''T''] = { (''f'', ''g'' ) | ∀''n'' ∈ ω : (''f''(''n''), ''g''(''n'') ∈ ''T'' } is the set of [[tree (descriptive set theory)#Branches and bodies|branch]]es through ''T''.

Since [''T''] is a closed set for the [[product topology]] on κ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; × λ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; where κ and λ are equipped with the [[discrete topology]] (and all closed sets in  κ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; × λ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; come in this way from some tree on κ × λ), λ-Suslin subsets of κ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; are projections of closed subsets in κ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; × λ&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.

When one talks of ''Suslin sets'' without specifying the space, then one usually means Suslin subsets of '''R''', which descriptive set theorists usually take to be the set ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Symbolic data analysis (SDA)''' is an extension of standard [[data analysis]] where symbolic data tables are used as input and symbolic objects are made output as a result. The data units are called ''symbolic'' since they are more complex than standard ones, as they not only contain values or categories, but also include internal variation and structure. SDA is based on four spaces: the space of individuals, the space of concepts, the space of descriptions, and the space of symbolic objects. The space of descriptions models individuals, while the space of symbolic objects models concepts&lt;ref&gt;

In [[vector calculus]] and physics, a '''vector field''' is an assignment of a [[vector (geometry)|vector]] to each point in a subset of [[Space (mathematics)|space]].&lt;ref name="Galbis-2012-p12" /&gt;  A vector field in the plane (for instance), can be visualised as: a collection of arrows with a given magnitude and direction, each attached to a point in the plane.  Vector  fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout space, or the strength and direction of some [[force]], such as the [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[gravity|gravitational]] force, as it changes from one point to another point.

The elements of [[differential and integral calculus]] extend naturally to vector fields.  When a vector field represents [[force]], the [[line integral]] of a vector field represents the [[Work (physics)|work]] done by a force moving along a path, and under this interpretation [[conservation of energy]] is exhibited as a special case of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].  Vector fields can usefully be thought of as representing the velocity of a moving flow in space, and this physical intuition leads to notions such as the [[divergence]] (which represents the rate of change of volume of a flow) and [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] (which represents the rotation of a flow).

In coordinates, a vector field on a domain in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] can be represented as a [[vector-valued function]] that associates an ''n''-tuple of real numbers to each point of the domain.  This representation of a vector field depends on the coordinate system, and there is a well-defined [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|transformation law]] in passing from one coordinate system to the other.  Vector fields are often discussed on [[open set|open subsets]] of Euclidean space, but also make sense on other subsets such as [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, where they associate an arrow tangent to the surface at each point (a [[Differential geometry of curves|tangent vector]]).

More generally, vector fields are defined on [[differentiable manifold]]s, which are spaces that look like Euclidean space on small scales, but may have more complicated structure on larger scales.  In this setting, a vector field gives a tangent vector at each point of the manifold (that is, a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tangent bundle]] to the manifold).  Vector fields are one kind of [[tensor field]].

==Definition==

===Vector fields on subsets of Euclidean space===

}}

Given a subset ''S'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, a '''vector field''' is represented by a [[vector-valued function]] ''V'': ''S'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in standard Cartesian coordinates (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  If each component of ''V'' is continuous, then ''V'' is a continuous vector field, and more generally ''V'' is a ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' vector field if each component of ''V'' is ''k'' times [[continuously differentiable]].

A vector field can be visualized as assigning a vector to individual points within an ''n''-dimensional space.&lt;ref name="Galbis-2012-p12"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Galbis, Antonio &amp; Maestre, Manuel|title=Vector Analysis Versus Vector Calculus|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-2199-3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdF8uTn2cnMC&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given two ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''-vector fields ''V'', ''W'' defined on ''S'' and a real valued ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''-function ''f'' defined on ''S'', the two operations scalar multiplication and vector addition

:&lt;math&gt; (fV)(p) := f(p)V(p)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (V+W)(p) := V(p) + W(p)\,&lt;/math&gt;

define the [[Module (mathematics)|module]] of ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''-vector fields over the [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] of C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-functions where the multiplication of the functions is defined pointwise (therefore, it is commutative with the multiplicative identity being ''f&lt;sub&gt;id&lt;/sub&gt;(p) := 1'').

===Coordinate transformation law===
In physics, a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] is additionally distinguished by how its coordinates change when one measures the same vector with respect to a different background coordinate system.  The [[Euclidean vector#Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations|transformation properties of vectors]] distinguish a vector as a geometrically distinct entity from a simple list of scalars, or from a [[covector]].

Thus, suppose that (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a choice of Cartesian coordinates, in terms of which the components of the vector ''V'' are

:&lt;math&gt;V_x = (V_{1,x},\dots,V_{n,x})&lt;/math&gt;

and suppose that (''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) are ''n'' functions of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; defining a different coordinate system.  Then the components of the vector ''V'' in the new coordinates are required to satisfy the transformation law
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_{i,y} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} V_{j,x}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Such a transformation law is called [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]].  A similar transformation law characterizes vector fields in physics: specifically, a vector field is a specification of ''n'' functions in each coordinate system subject to the transformation law ({{EquationNote|1}}) relating the different coordinate systems.

Vector fields are thus contrasted with [[scalar field]]s, which associate a number or ''scalar'' to every point in space, and are also contrasted with simple lists of scalar fields, which do not transform under coordinate changes.

Given a [[differentiable manifold]] ''M'', a '''vector field''' on ''M'' is an assignment of a [[Tangent space|tangent vector]] to each point in ''M''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tu, Loring W.|chapter=Vector fields|title=An Introduction to Manifolds|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7399-3|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZ8Pvk7b6bUC&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a vector field ''F'' is a [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] from ''M'' into the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM'' so that &lt;math&gt; p\circ F &lt;/math&gt; is the identity mapping
where ''p'' denotes the projection from ''TM'' to ''M''. In other words, a vector field is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tangent bundle]].

An alternative definition: A smooth vector field ''X'' on a manifold M is a linear map &lt;math&gt;X: C^\infty(M) \rightarrow C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt; such that ''X'' is a [[Derivation_(differential_algebra)|derivation]]:
&lt;math&gt;X(fg)=fX(g)+X(f)g&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f,g \in C^\infty(M)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~lerman/518/f11/8-19-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

If the manifold ''M''  is smooth or analytic—that is, the change of  coordinates is smooth (analytic)—then one can make sense of the notion of smooth (analytic) vector fields. The collection of all smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold ''M'' is often denoted by Γ(T''M'') or ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'',T''M'') (especially when thinking of vector fields as [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s); the collection of all smooth vector fields is also denoted by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathfrak{X} (M)&lt;/math&gt; (a [[fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|fraktur]] "X").

==Examples==
[[File:Cessna 182 model-wingtip-vortex.jpg|thumb|250px|The flow field around an airplane is a vector field in '''''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, here visualized by bubbles that follow the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]]s showing a [[wingtip vortex]].]]
* A vector field for the movement of air on Earth will associate for every point on the surface of the Earth a vector with the wind speed and direction for that point. This can be drawn using arrows to represent the wind; the length ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]) of the arrow will be an indication of the wind speed. A "high" on the usual [[barometric pressure]] map would then act as a source (arrows pointing away), and a "low" would be a sink (arrows pointing towards), since air tends to move from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.
* [[Velocity]] field of a moving [[fluid]].  In this case, a [[velocity]] vector is associated to each point in the fluid.
* [[Streamlines, Streaklines and Pathlines]] are 3 types of lines that can be made from vector fields. They are :
::streaklines  &amp;mdash; as revealed in [[wind tunnel]]s using smoke.
::streamlines (or fieldlines)&amp;mdash; as a line depicting the instantaneous field at a given time.
::pathlines &amp;mdash; showing the path that a given particle (of zero mass) would follow.
* [[Magnetic field]]s. The fieldlines can be revealed using small [[iron]] filings.
* [[Maxwell's equations]] allow us to use a given set of initial conditions to deduce, for every point in [[Euclidean space]], a magnitude and direction for the [[force]] experienced by a charged test particle at that point; the resulting vector field is the [[electromagnetic field]].
*A [[gravitational field]] generated by any massive object is also a vector field. For example, the gravitational field vectors for a spherically symmetric body would all point towards the sphere's center with the magnitude of the vectors reducing as radial distance from the body increases.

===Gradient field in euclidean spaces===
[[File:Irrotationalfield.svg|thumb|300px|A vector field that has circulation about a point cannot be written as the gradient of a function.]]

Vector fields can be constructed out of [[scalar field]]s using the [[gradient]] operator (denoted by the [[del]]: ∇).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawber, P.G.|title=Vectors and Vector Operators|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-85274-585-4|year=1987|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luBlL7oGgUIC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vector field ''V'' defined on an open set ''S'' is called a '''gradient field''' or a '''[[conservative field]]''' if there exists a real-valued function (a scalar field) ''f'' on ''S'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;V = \nabla f = \bigg(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_3}, \dots ,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\bigg).&lt;/math&gt;

The associated [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] is called the '''gradient flow''', and is used in the method of [[gradient descent]].

The [[line integral|path integral]] along any [[closed manifold|closed curve]] ''γ'' (''γ''(0) = ''γ''(1)) in a conservative field is zero:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_\gamma V(\boldsymbol {x})\cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol {x}  = \oint_\gamma \nabla f(\boldsymbol {x})\cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol {x}  = f(\gamma(1)) - f(\gamma(0)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Central field in euclidean spaces===
A ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-vector field over '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0} is called a '''central field''' if

:&lt;math&gt;V(T(p)) = T(V(p)) \qquad (T \in \mathrm{O}(n, \mathbf{R}))&lt;/math&gt;

where O(''n'', '''R''') is the [[orthogonal group]]. We say central fields are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformations]] around 0.

The point 0 is called the '''center''' of the field.

Since orthogonal transformations are actually rotations and reflections, the invariance conditions mean that vectors of a central field are always directed towards, or away from, 0; this is an alternate (and simpler) definition. A central field is always a gradient field, since defining it on one semiaxis and integrating gives an antigradient.

==Operations on vector fields==

===Line integral===
{{Main|Line integral}}
A common technique in physics is to integrate a vector field along a [[differential geometry of curves|curve]], also called determining its [[line integral]]. Intuitively this is summing up all vector components in line with the tangents to the curve, expressed as their scalar products. For example, given a particle in a force field (e.g. gravitation), where each vector at some point in space represents the force acting there on the particle, the line integral along a certain path is the work done on the particle, when it travels along this path. Intuitively, it is the sum of the scalar products of the force vector and the small tangent vector in each point along the curve.

The line integral is constructed analogously to the [[Riemann integral]] and it exists if the curve is rectifiable (has finite length) and the vector field is continuous.

Given a vector field ''V'' and a curve γ, [[parametric equation|parametrized]] by ''t'' in [''a'', ''b''] (where ''a'' and ''b'' are [[real number]]s), the line integral is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma  V(\boldsymbol {x})\cdot \mathrm{d}\boldsymbol {x}  = \int_a^b  V(\gamma(t))\cdot\dot \gamma(t)\; \mathrm{d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===
{{Main|Divergence}}
The [[divergence]] of a vector field on Euclidean space is a function (or scalar field).  In three-dimensions, the divergence is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{div} \mathbf{F} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial z},&lt;/math&gt;

with the obvious generalization to arbitrary dimensions.  The divergence at a point represents the degree to which a small volume around the point is a source or a sink for the vector flow, a result which is made precise by the [[divergence theorem]].

The divergence can also be defined on a [[Riemannian manifold]], that is, a manifold with a [[Riemannian metric]] that measures the length of vectors.

===Curl in three-dimensions===
{{Main|Curl  (mathematics)}}
The [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] is an operation which takes a vector field and produces another vector field. The curl is defined only in three-dimensions, but some properties of the curl can be captured in higher dimensions with the [[exterior derivative]].  In three-dimensions, it is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{curl}\,\mathbf{F} = \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial y}- \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial z}\right)\mathbf{e}_1 - \left(\frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x}- \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial z}\right)\mathbf{e}_2 + \left(\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x}- \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial y}\right)\mathbf{e}_3.&lt;/math&gt;

The curl measures the density of the [[angular momentum]] of the vector flow at a point, that is, the amount to which the flow circulates around a fixed axis.  This intuitive description is made precise by [[Stokes' theorem]].

===Index of a vector field===
The index of a vector field is an integer that helps to describe the behaviour of a vector field around an isolated zero (i.e., an isolated singularity of the field). In the plane, the index takes the value -1 at a saddle singularity but +1 at a source or sink singularity.

Let the dimension of the manifold on which the vector field is defined be '''n'''. Take a small sphere S around the zero so that no other zeros lie in the interior of S. A map from this sphere to a unit sphere of dimensions ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 can be constructed by dividing each vector on this sphere by its length to form a unit length vector, which is a point on the unit sphere S&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This defines a continuous map from S to S&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The index of the vector field at the point is the [[Degree of a continuous mapping#Differential topology|degree]] of this map. It can be shown that this integer does not depend on the choice of S, and therefore depends only on the vector field itself.

'''The index of the vector field''' as a whole is defined when it has just a finite number of zeroes. In this case, all zeroes are isolated, and the index of the vector field is defined to be the sum of the indices at all zeroes.

The index is not defined at any non-singular point (i.e., a point where the vector is non-zero). it is equal to +1 around a source, and more generally equal to (−1)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; around a saddle that has k contracting dimensions and n-k expanding dimensions. For an ordinary (2-dimensional) sphere in three-dimensional space, it can be shown that the index of any vector field on the sphere must be 2. This shows that every such vector field must have a zero. This implies the [[hairy ball theorem]], which states that if a vector in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is assigned to each point of the unit sphere S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a continuous manner, then it is impossible to "comb the hairs flat", i.e., to choose the vectors in a continuous way such that they are all non-zero and tangent to S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For a vector field on a compact manifold with a finite number of zeroes, the [[Poincaré-Hopf theorem]] states that the index of the vector field is equal to the [[Euler characteristic]] of the manifold.

==Physical intuition==
[[File:Magnet0873.png|thumb|[[Magnetism|Magnetic]] field lines of an iron bar ([[magnetic dipole]])]]

[[Michael Faraday]], in his concept of ''[[lines of force]],'' emphasized that the field ''itself'' should be an object of study, which it has become throughout physics in the form of [[field theory (physics)|field theory]].

In addition to the magnetic field, other phenomena that were modeled by Faraday include the electrical field and [[light field]].

==Flow curves==
{{Main|Integral curve}}
Consider the flow of a fluid through a region of space.  At any given time, any point of the fluid has a particular velocity associated with it; thus there is a vector field associated to any flow.  The converse is also true: it is possible to associate a flow to a vector field having that vector field as its velocity.

Given a vector field ''V'' defined on ''S'', one defines curves γ(''t'') on ''S'' such that for each ''t'' in an interval ''I''

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma'(t) = V(\gamma(t))\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]], if ''V'' is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] there is a ''unique'' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-curve γ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for each point ''x'' in ''S'' so that, for some ε &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_x(0) = x\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma'_x(t) = V(\gamma_x(t)) \qquad \forall t \in (-\varepsilon, +\varepsilon) \subset \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The curves γ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''integral curves''' or '''trajectories''' (or less commonly, flow lines) of the vector field ''V'' and partition ''S'' into [[equivalence class]]es. It is not always possible to extend the interval (−ε, +ε) to the whole [[real number line]]. The flow may for example reach the edge of ''S'' in a finite time.
 &lt;!--Integrating the vector field along any flow curve &amp;gamma; yields

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma \langle \mathbf{F}( \mathbf{x} ), d\mathbf{x} \rangle = \int_a^b \langle \mathbf{F}( \mathbf{\gamma}(t) ), \mathbf{\gamma}'(t) \rangle dt = \int_a^b dt = \mbox{constant}. &lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
In two or three dimensions one can visualize the vector field as giving rise to a [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]] on ''S''. If we drop a particle into this flow at a point ''p'' it will move along the curve γ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; in the flow depending on the initial point ''p''. If ''p'' is a stationary point of ''V'' (i.e., the vector field is equal to the zero vector at the point ''p''), then the particle will remain at ''p''.

Typical applications are [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]] in [[fluid flow|fluid]], [[geodesic flow]], and [[one-parameter subgroup]]s and the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] in [[Lie group]]s.

===Complete vector fields===
By definition, a vector field is called '''complete''' if every one of its flow curves exist for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharpe, R.|title=Differential geometry|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1997|isbn=0-387-94732-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, [[compact support|compactly supported]] vector fields on a manifold are complete.  If  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a complete vector field on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[one-parameter group]] of [[diffeomorphism]]s generated by the flow along &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; exists for all time. On a compact manifold without boundary, every smooth vector field is complete.  An example of an '''incomplete''' vector field &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; on the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;V(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;.  For, the differential equation &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, with initial condition &lt;math&gt;x(0) = x_0 &lt;/math&gt;, has as its unique solution &lt;math&gt;x(t) = \frac{x_0}{1 - t x_0}&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;x_0 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;x(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; if  &lt;math&gt;x_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;).  Hence for &lt;math&gt;x_0 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined at &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{1}{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; so cannot be defined for all values of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==f-relatedness==
Given a [[smooth function]] between manifolds, ''f'': ''M'' → ''N'', the [[derivative]] is an induced map on [[tangent bundle]]s, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;: ''TM'' → ''TN''. Given vector fields ''V'': ''M'' → ''TM'' and ''W'': ''N'' → ''TN'', we say that ''W'' is ''f''-related to ''V'' if the equation ''W'' ∘ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''V'' holds.

If ''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is ''f''-related to ''W''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, 2, then the [[Lie bracket]] [''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is ''f''-related to [''W''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;].

==Generalizations==
Replacing vectors by [[p-vector|''p''-vectors]] (''p''th exterior power of vectors) yields ''p''-vector fields; taking the [[dual space]] and exterior powers yields [[differential form|differential ''k''-forms]], and combining these yields general [[tensor field]]s.

Algebraically, vector fields can be characterized as [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] of the algebra of smooth functions on the manifold, which leads to defining a vector field on a commutative algebra as a derivation on the algebra, which is developed in the theory of [[differential calculus over commutative algebras]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8570">In [[mathematics]], '''Young's inequality for products''' is a [[inequality (mathematics)|mathematical inequality]] about the product of two numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first1 = W. H. | last1 = Young | author-link = William Henry Young | year = 1912 | title = On classes of summable functions and their Fourier series | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume=87 | pages=225–229 | jfm = 43.1114.12 | jstor = 93236 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1912.0076 | issue = 594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inequality is named after [[William Henry Young]] and should not be confused with [[Young's convolution inequality]].

Young's inequality for products can be used to prove [[Hölder's inequality]]. It is also widely used to estimate the norm of nonlinear terms in [[partial differential equation|PDE theory]], since it allows one to estimate a product of two terms by a sum of the same terms raised to a power and scaled.

==Standard version for conjugate Hölder exponents==
In its standard form, the inequality states that if ''a'' and ''b'' are [[nonnegative]] [[real number]]s and ''p'' and ''q'' are real numbers greater or equal than 1 such that 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then
:&lt;math&gt;ab \le \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q}~.&lt;/math&gt;

The equality holds if and only if {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This form of Young's inequality can be proved by [[Jensen's inequality]] and can be used to prove [[Hölder's inequality]].

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:95%;" class="NavFrame"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#FFFAF0; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;Proof&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;display:none;"&gt;
The claim is certainly true if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Therefore, assume ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 in the following. Put ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''p'', and (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''q''. Then since the [[logarithm]] function is [[concave function|concave]],
:&lt;math&gt; \ln(t a^p + (1-t) b^q) \ge t \ln(a^p) + (1-t) \ln(b^q) =
                          \ln(a) +\ln(b) = \ln(ab)
&lt;/math&gt;
with the equality holding if and only if ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;. Young's inequality follows by exponentiating.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Elementary case==
An elementary case of Young's inequality is the inequality with [[exponent]] 2,

:&lt;math&gt;ab \le \frac{a^2}{2} + \frac{b^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

which also gives rise to the so-called Young's inequality with ''ε'' (valid for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), sometimes called the Peter–Paul inequality.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}},&lt;/ref&gt;  This name refers to the fact that tighter control of the second term is achieved at the cost of losing some control of the first term – one must "rob Peter to pay Paul"

:&lt;math&gt;ab \le \frac{a^2}{2\varepsilon} + \frac{\varepsilon b^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:95%;" class="NavFrame"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#FFFAF0; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;Proof&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;display:none;"&gt;
Young's inequality with exponent 2 is the special case ''p'' = ''q'' = 2. However, it has a more elementary proof.

Start by observing that the square of every real number is zero or positive.  Therefore, for every pair of real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;0\le (a-b)^2&lt;/math&gt; 
Work out the square of the right hand side:
:&lt;math&gt;0\le a^2-2ab+b^2&lt;/math&gt; 
Add '2ab' to both sides:
:&lt;math&gt;2ab\le a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;
Divide both sides by 2 and we have Young's inequality with exponent&amp;nbsp;2:
:&lt;math&gt;ab\le \frac{a^2}{2}+ \frac{b^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Young's inequality with ''ε'' follows by substituting &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b'&lt;/math&gt; as below into Young's inequality with exponent&amp;nbsp;2: 
:&lt;math&gt;a'=a/\sqrt{\varepsilon},\text{ }b'=\sqrt{\varepsilon}b.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Matricial generalization==
T. Ando proved a generalization of Young's inequality for complex matrices ordered 
by [[Loewner order]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=T. Ando|editor1-last=Huijsmans|editor1-first=C. B.|editor2-last=Kaashoek|editor2-first=M. A.|editor3-last=Luxemburg|editor3-first=W. A.

:&lt;math&gt; U^{*} |AB^{*}| U \preceq \frac{1}{p}|A|^{p} + \frac{1}{q} |B|^{q}, &lt;/math&gt;

}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;2.9&lt;/ref&gt; of the inequality,
let ''f'' denote a real-valued, continuous and strictly increasing function on [0,&amp;nbsp;''c''] with ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and ''f''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Let ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; denote the [[inverse function]] of&amp;nbsp;''f''. Then, for all ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''c''] and ''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;''f''(''c'')],

: &lt;math&gt;ab \le \int_0^a f(x)\,dx + \int_0^b f^{-1}(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''a'').

==Generalization using Fenchel–Legendre transforms ==
If ''f'' is a [[convex function]] and its [[Legendre transform]] ([[convex conjugate]]) is denoted by ''g'', then
:&lt;math&gt; ab \le f(a) + g(b). &lt;/math&gt;
This follows immediately from the definition of the Legendre transform.

More generally, if ''f'' is a [[convex function]] defined on a real vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and its [[convex conjugate]] is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f^\star&lt;/math&gt; (and is defined on the [[dual space]] &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt;), then
:&lt;math&gt; \langle u, v \rangle \le f^\star(u) + f(v). &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle : X^\star \times X \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dual pair]]ing.

===Examples===
*The Legendre transform of ''f''(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;/''p'' is ''g''(''b'') = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;/''q'' with ''q'' such that 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and thus Young's inequality for conjugate Hölder exponents mentioned above is a special case.
*The  Legendre transform of ''f''(''a'') = e&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; – 1 is  ''g''(''b'') = 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' ln ''b'', hence ''ab''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;e&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;ln&amp;nbsp;''b'' for all non-negative ''a'' and ''b''. This estimate is useful in [[large deviations theory]] under exponential moment conditions, because ''b'' ln ''b'' appears in the definition of [[relative entropy]], which is the [[rate function]] in [[Sanov's theorem]].
