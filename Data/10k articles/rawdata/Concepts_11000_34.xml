Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite . Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Basis==
In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] the basis of any particular type of classification is the ''way in which objects in the domain resemble each other''. A resemblance of a type that seems appropriate to the classification that we propose, we may call an '''''affinity''''', and when we decide how to classify say, a specimen of rock or butterfly, we justify our decision according to the affinities that we observe. 

Other resemblances we dismiss as being out of context or at least non-cogent; for example, in deciding whether to classify a lizard as having closer affinities to a snake than to a table, biologists rely on affinities such as the scales, blood, physiology, vertebral anatomy, and reproductive system as being more relevant than the possession of four "feet".

==Application and obstacles==
Analysing and determining the proper classification of an organism, a rock, or an astronomic object according to a particular system is often a difficult and treacherous procedure. Problems in such fields of study have tripped up whole generations of workers in recent centuries. When the position is not clear from an early stage, the first step after beginning to determine, evaluate, and describe the [[Variable and attribute (research)|attributes]] of the object, is to determine the affinities and evaluate their significance. 

The number of legs might well be a significant affinity in comparing different types of related organisms such as [[crustacean]]s, but irrelevant in comparing a ten-limbed [[Cephalopoda|cephalopod]] with a ten-limbed [[Solifugae|solifugid]] (including its [[pedipalp]]s as limbs). Such a comparison would be no more cogent than the foregoing example of the lizard and the table.

There are many such examples in nature; we see both a [[lungfish]] and a [[porpoise]] as having closer (but largely different) affinities to a cow than to a [[tuna]], and a [[bat]] as having closer affinities to a [[banteng]] than to a bird or a butterfly, although a banteng has no "wings". These are considerations arising from the principles discussed in articles on [[Homology (biology)]] and [[Analogy (biology)]]. 

It is clear that there is an element of subjectivity to the recognition of affinities; that is implicit in such dictionary definitions as: ""Affinity: the closeness of relation between plants as shown by similarity of important organs."&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; That definition is over a century old, but it is typical of the basis on which taxonomists had to work till recently, and in practice still must use; it is not practical to sequence the genome of every specimen. Nucleic acid analyses are eroding many difficulties, but there is a long way to go.

In [[psychology]], '''apprehension''' (Lat. ''ad'', "to"; ''prehendere'', "to seize") is a term applied to a [[mental model|model]] of [[consciousness]] in which nothing is affirmed or denied of the object in question, but the [[mind]] is merely aware of ("seizes") it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apprehension|volume=2|pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Judgment" (says Reid, ed. Hamilton, i. p.&amp;nbsp;414) "is an act of the mind, specifically different from simple apprehension or the bare conception of a thing". "Simple apprehension or conception can neither be true nor false." This distinction provides for the large class of [[mental function|mental acts]] in which we are simply aware of, or "take in" a number of familiar objects, about which we in general make no judgment, unless our attention is suddenly called by a new feature. Or again, two alternatives may be apprehended without any resultant judgment as to their respective merits.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Similarly, [[George Stout|G.F. Stout]] stated that while we have a very vivid idea of a [[fictional character|character]] or an incident in a work of [[fiction]], we can hardly be said in any real sense to have any [[belief]] or to make any judgment as to its [[existence]] or [[truth]]. With this mental state may be compared the purely [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[contemplation]] of [[music]], wherein apart from, say, a false [[Musical note|note]], the [[wikt:faculty|faculty]] of judgment is for the time inoperative. To these examples may be added the fact that one can fully understand an argument in all its bearings, without in any way judging its [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Without going into the question fully, it may be pointed out that the distinction between judgment and apprehension is relative. In every kind of thought, there is judgment of some sort in a greater or less degree of prominence.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Judgment and [[thought]] are in fact [[psychologically]] distinguishable merely as different, though [[correlation|correlative]], activities of consciousness. Professor Stout further investigates the phenomena of apprehension, and comes to the conclusion that "it is possible to distinguish and identify a whole without apprehending any of its [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] details." On the other hand, if the attention focuses itself for a time on the apprehended object, there is an expectation that such details will, as it were, emerge into consciousness. Hence, he describes such apprehension as "[[implication (pragmatics)|implicit]]", and insofar as the implicit apprehension determines the order of such emergence, he describes it as "[[schematic]]".&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A good example of this process is the use of [[formula]]e in calculations; ordinarily the formula is used without question; if attention is fixed upon it, the steps by which it is shown to be [[universalism|universally]] applicable emerge, and the "schema " is complete in detail. With this result may be compared [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of apprehension as a synthetic act (the "synthesis of apprehension") by which the sensory elements of a [[perception]] are subjected to the formal conditions of [[time]] and [[space]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The '''Bersih 4 rally''' was a series of planned rallies carried out on 29 to 30 August 2015 in major cities in [[Malaysia]], namely [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Kota Kinabalu]] and [[Kuching]].&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/bersih-calls-for-august/2014792.html|title=Bersih calls for August rallies in 3 states to demand PM Najib's resignation|work=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were subsequent rallies in over 70 cities around the world in support of the main rallies in Malaysia.  The rallies were organised by '''The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections''' (Malay: Gabungan Pilihanraya Bersih dan Adil) or '''[[Bersih]]''' (meaning clean in Malay) a coalition of non-government organisations which seeks to reform the current electoral system in Malaysia to ensure free, clean and fair elections.  The rallies were being carried out with the objective to calling for clean and transparent governance in Malaysia as well as strengthening the parliamentary democracy system. The rallies are a followup to similar rallies that were carried out in [[2007 Bersih rally|2007]], [[Bersih 2.0 rally|2011]] and [[Bersih 3.0 rally|2012]]. 30 August is the day before [[Hari Merdeka|National Day]] which is on 31 August.

== Background ==

In the aftermath of the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|general elections in Malaysia]] in 2013 there were accusations by the opposition and non-governmental organisations that the government had cheated its way to another election victory. A [[Malaysia's Post General Election rally 2013|series of rallies in 2013]] were carried out protesting the results of the elections, whereby the opposition garnered a plurality of the votes but still lost the election due to the government gaining the most seats in the [[Westminster system]] of elections.

In 2015, a [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal|corruption scandal]] began to engulf Malaysia, involving a government super fund called [[1Malaysia Development Berhad]] which was chaired by Prime Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]].  There were a series of exposes by online investigative blogs, namely Sarawak Report and major news portal Wall Street Journal that money was being siphoned off from the fund into personal accounts of Najib and his close relations. A Public Accounts Committee compromising government and opposition members of parliament was set up to investigate if there were major wrongdoings on the part of Najib and 1MDB. However, in July, the government began to stifle news reports regarding the 1MDB scandal by blocking the website [[Sarawak Report]], which had been in forefront of exposes revealing the losses incurred by 1MDB and its connection to Najib, from the Malaysian internet community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/20/sarawak-report-whistleblowing-website-blocked-by-malaysia-over-pm-allegations|title=Sarawak Report whistleblowing website blocked by Malaysia after PM allegations|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government then began to withdraw the publishing license of [[The Edge (Malaysia)|The Edge]], a financial and news publication which was reporting the 1MDB scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/24/us-malaysia-1mdb-publishing-idUSKCN0PY0PA20150724|title=Malaysia's home ministry suspends top publications over 1MDB reports|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, on 28 July, Najib began removing detractors in his cabinet and government such as Abdul Gani Patail, the Attorney General of Malaysia who was part of the task force investigating the 1MDB scandal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ganis-removal-in-midst-of-1mdb-probe-fans-najib-conspiracy-theories-say-cri |title=Gani’s removal in midst of 1MDB probe fans Najib conspiracy theories, say critics |work=themalaysianinsider.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921192212/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/ganis-removal-in-midst-of-1mdb-probe-fans-najib-conspiracy-theories-say-cri |archivedate=21 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his deputy [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] and four other ministers who were said to be critical of 1MDB and called for Najib to explain the issue to the Malaysian public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/malaysian-pm-najib-razak-sacks-deputy-after-1mdb-graft-scandal-remarks-20150728-gim93a.html|title=Malaysian PM Najib Razak sacks deputy after 1MDB graft scandal remarks|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Accounts Committee investigating the 1MDB scandal was also suspended indefinitely with the promotion of four of its members to Deputy Ministers by Najib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/1mdb-probe-temporarily-frozen-as-pac-chief-members-made-deputy-ministers|title=1MDB probe temporarily frozen as PAC chief, members made deputy ministers|work=themalaymailonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there is a court case challenging the re-delineation of electoral boundaries in [[Sarawak]], which if carried out would affect [[Next Sarawak state election|the next state elections in Sarawak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/08/07/court-of-appeal-allows-ecs-redelineation-appeal/|title=Court of Appeal allows EC’s redelineation appeal|work=Free Malaysia Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-delineation of  the seats in Sarawak would see an increase of 71 to 82 seats in the state assembly, but the current contention is there was no proper explanation given for the planned increase. Bersih has stated that the case, which has been successfully appealed by the Election Commission, would allow it to carry out acts of gerrymandering and malapportionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/bersih-court-ruling-on-sarawak-redelineation-setback-to-democracy|title=Bersih: Court ruling on Sarawak redelineation setback to democracy|work=themalaymailonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/court-decision-on-sarawak-redelineation-makes-ge14-results-a-foregone-concl|title=Court decision on Sarawak redelineation makes GE14 results a foregone conclusion, says Bersih|work=themalaysianinsider.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810010630/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/court-decision-on-sarawak-redelineation-makes-ge14-results-a-foregone-concl|archivedate=10 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] in which they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind–body problem]] and is in contrast to the traditions of [[mind–body dualism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]].

In the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that:  
* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The term can be applied across a number of disciplines, including:
* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical situations where mental processes act as a major factor affecting medical outcomes are areas where psychosomatic medicine has competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenson| first = James L. | title = Essentials of Psychosomatic Medicine| publisher = American Psychiatric Press Inc|year=2006| isbn = 978-1-58562-246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postural Integration]], a process-oriented, [[body psychotherapy]] originally developed in the late 1960s by Jack Painter &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziehl|first1=Silke|title=Jack Painter - Obituary|url=http://www.icpit.info/documents/Jack%20Painter-Obituary.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1933-2010) in California, USA, after exploration in the fields of [[humanistic psychology]] and the [[human potential movement]]. &lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration'' &lt;br&gt;Postural Integration – Energetic Integration – Psychotherapeutic Postural Integration; &lt;br&gt;Articles by 14 international authors; Hubert W. Holzinger Verlag, Berlin (2012)  {{ISBN|978-3-926396-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method aims to support [[Self-efficacy|personal change]] and [[Personal Development|self development]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpit.info/articles/J_Painter_PosturalIntegration1985_.pdf Painter, Jack: ''Postural Integration, Transformation of the Whole Self'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; through a particular form of [[Manual therapy|manipulative]] [[Holistic health|holistic]] [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]].&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'', Postural Integration; published by &lt;br&gt;The International Centre for Release and Integration, Mill Valley, Calif. USA (1984) (2nd edit. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher [[William H. Poteat]].

In [[biology]], '''constructive development''' refers to the hypothesis that organisms shape their own developmental trajectory by constantly responding to, and causing, changes in both their internal state and their external environment.&lt;ref name="Waddington1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|editor1-last=Waddington|editor1-first=CH|title=Towards a Theoretical Biology|date=1969|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|chapter=Paradigm for an evolutionary process}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewontin1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewontin|first1=RC|editor1-last=Bendall|title=Evolution from Molecules to Men|date=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Gene, organism and environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyama1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oyama|first1=S|title=The Ontology of Information: Developmental Systems and Evolution|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyama2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Oyama|editor1-first=S|editor2-last=Griffiths|editor2-first=PE|editor3-last=Gray|editor3-first=RD|title=Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noble|first1=D|title=The Music of Life|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhart|first1=JC|last2=Kirschner|first2=MW|title=The theory of facilitated variation|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=2007|volume=104|pages=8582–8589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallgrimsson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallgrimsson|first1=B|last2=Hall|first2=BK|title=Epigenetics: Linking genotype and phenotype in development and evolution|date=2011|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructive development can be contrasted with programmed development, the hypothesis that organisms develop according to a genetic program or blueprint.&lt;ref name="Oyama1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=AP|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2015|volume=282|page=20151019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constructivist perspective is found in philosophy, most notably [[developmental systems theory]], and in the biological and social sciences, including [[developmental psychobiology]] and key themes of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]]. Constructive development may be important to [[evolution]] because it enables organisms to produce functional phenotypes in response to genetic or environmental perturbation, and thereby contributes to [[adaptation]] and diversification.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Key themes of constructive development==

===Responsiveness and flexibility===
At any point in time, an organism’s development depends on both the current state of the organism and the state of the environment. The developmental system, including the genome and its epigenetic regulation, responds flexibly to internal and external inputs. One  example is condition-dependent gene expression, but regulatory systems also rely on physical properties of cells and tissues and exploratory behavior among microtubular, neural, muscular and vascular systems.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirschner|first1=M|last2=Gerhart|first2=J|title=The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple modes of inheritance===
Organisms inherit (i.e., receive from their predecessors) a diverse set of developmental resources, including DNA, [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic marks]], organelles, enzymes, hormones, antibodies, transcription factors, symbionts, socially transmitted knowledge and [[Ecological inheritance|environmental conditions modified by parents]].&lt;ref name="Jablonka2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jablonka|first1=E|last2=Lamb|first2=MJ|title=Evolution in Four Dimensions|date=2005|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental environments are constructed===
In the course of development, organisms help shape their internal and external environment, and in this way, influence their own development. Organisms also construct developmental environments for their offspring through various forms of extra-genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name="Badyaev2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badyaev|first1=AV|last2=Uller|first2=T|title=Parental effects in ecology and evolution: mechanisms, processes and implications|journal=Phil Trans R Soc B|date=2009|volume=364|pages=1169–1177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed control===
No single source of influence has central control over an organism's development.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt; Whilst the genetic influence on development is fundamental, causation does not only occur from the bottom up, but also flows [[Downward causation|‘downwards’]]&lt;ref name="Ellis2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=GFR|last2=Noble|first2=D|last3=O’Connor|first3=T|title=Top-down causation: an integrating theme within and across the sciences?|journal=Interface Focus|date=2012|volume=2|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; from more complex levels of organismal organization (e.g., tissue-specific regulation of gene expression). The result is that many features of organisms are emergent properties that are not encoded in the genome.

==Mechanisms of constructive development==

Constructive development is manifest in context-dependent gene expression, physical properties of cells and tissues, exploratory behavior of physiological systems and learning.

===Context-dependent gene expression===
Although all the cells of an organism contain the same [[DNA]], there can be hundreds of different types of cells in a single organism. These diverse cell shapes, behaviors and functions are created and maintained by tissue-specific gene expression patterns and these can be modified by internal and external environmental conditions.

===Physical properties of cells and tissues===
Assembly of organs, tissues, cells and subcellular components are in part determined by their physical properties.&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=SA|last2=Müller|first2=GB|title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|chapter=Morphological Evolution: Epigenetic Mechanisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[cell membrane]] that forms a barrier between the inside and outside of the cell is a lipid bilayer that forms as result of the thermodynamic properties of the [[phospholipids]] it’s made of (hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails).

===Exploratory processes===
Exploratory processes are selective processes that operate within individual organisms during their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt; In many animals, the vascular, immune and nervous systems develop by producing a variety of forms, and the most functional solutions are selected for and retained, while others are lost. For example, the ‘shape’ of the [[circulatory system]] is constructed according to the oxygen and nutrient needs of tissues, rather than being genetically predetermined. Likewise, the [[nervous system]] develops through axonal exploration. Initially muscle fibers are connected to multiple neurons but synaptic competition selects certain connections over others to define the mature pattern of muscle innervation. The shape of a cell is determined by the structure of its [[cytoskeleton]]. A major element of the cytoskeleton are [[microtubules]], which can grow in random directions from their origin. Microtubule-associated proteins can aid or inhibit microtubule growth, guide microtubules to specific cellular locations and mediate interactions with other proteins. Therefore, microtubules can be stabilized in new configurations that give rise to new cell shapes (and potentially new behaviors or functions) without changes to the microtubule system itself.

===Learning===
In animals, many behaviors are acquired through learning. Social learning and cultural transmission are important sources of adaptive [[phenotypic plasticity]], enabling animals to adapt to their environments even if those environments have not frequently been encountered in the evolutionary history of the species. Social learning also enables stable inheritance of many characters. Cross-fostering of [[great tit]] and [[blue tit]] chicks show that social learning can result in stable inheritance of species-typical foraging behaviors (foraging height, prey type, prey size, foraging method) as well as nest site choice, alarm calls, songs, and mate choice.&lt;ref name="Slagsvold2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slagsvold|first1=T|last2=Weibe|first2=KL|title=Learning the ecological niche|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2007|volume=274|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slagsvold2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slagsvold|first1=T|last2=Weibe|first2=KL|title=Social learning in birds and its role in shaping a foraging niche|journal=Phil Trans R Soc B|date=2011|volume=366|pages=969–977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[killer whale]] research has demonstrated the divergence of orcas into several species mediated by learned and socially transmitted differences in diets.&lt;ref name="Whitehead2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehead|first1=H|last2=Rendell|first2=L|title=The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins|date=2015|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructive development and evolution==

Within evolutionary biology, development has been traditionally viewed as under the direction of a genetic program (e.g.&lt;ref name="Mayr1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=The triumph of the evolutionary synthesis|journal=Times Literary Suppl|date=1984|volume=2 November|pages=1261–1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and metaphors such as genetic ‘blueprint’, ‘program’ or ‘instructions' are still widespread in biology textbooks.&lt;ref name="Moczek2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moczek|first1=AP|title=The nature of nurture and the future of evodevo: toward a comprehensive theory of developmental evolution|journal=Integrative Comp Biol|date=2012|volume=52|pages=108–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the constructive development perspective views the genome as a sub-system of the cell shaped by evolution to detect and respond to the signals it receives.&lt;ref name="Keller2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keller|first1=EF|title=From gene action to reactive genomes|journal=J Physiol|date=2014|volume=592|pages=2423–2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different perspectives affect evolutionary interpretations. One example is the evolutionary significance of environmentally induced phenotypes. [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]] famously suggested that responses to the environment can be the starting point for evolutionary change,&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West-Eberhard|first1=MJ|title=Developmental Plasticity and Evolution|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; termed ‘plasticity-led evolution’. From a programmed development perspective, developmental plasticity is considered to be controlled by genetically specified switches or reaction norms. For these   to produce functional responses to environmental change, their reaction norms must have been pre-screened by prior selection. Therefore, ‘plasticity-led evolution’ reduces to the standard evolutionary explanation of natural selection acting on genetic variation. Conversely, ‘plasticity-led evolution’ gains greater significance if development is constructive and open-ended. New functional phenotypes can emerge with little or no initial genetic modification (see [[facilitated variation]] and &lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;), and provide the new raw material on which natural selection can act (e.g.&lt;ref name="Lange2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=A|last2=Nemeschkal|first2=HL|last3=Müller|first3=GB|title=Biased polyphenism in polydactylous cats carrying a single point mutation: the hemingway model for digit novelty|journal=Evol Biol|date=2014|volume=41|pages=262–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The '''divine plane''' ([[hyperplane]] or [[spacetime|continuum]]/[[universe]], enclosing and interpenetrating grosser planes, respectively) is the plane in which [[Brahman]] and [[Om|Om or Aum]], i.e. [[Logos]] or [[Agathon]], i.e. (according to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]) [[spirit]] of [[deity]] (as Brahman, Logos i.e. Agathon, etc.,) i.e. the creative Word (as the [[Pranava]] [[Om]] or Aum, Logos, [[Tohu and Tikkun|Tikkun]], etc.) and ideal, exists.  The term is from the Greek word 'Logos' and is used in the [[Arcane School]] ideas.

==Theosophical differences==

'Classical' 1800s Theosophy does not say whether this [[spiritual plane]] is the only one that has to do with Logos is human, but [[Annie Besant]] &amp; [[Charles Leadbeater]] may have said so, and [[Alice Bailey]] or others, who uses similar ideas, did say so.

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

The '''Forbes 400''' or '''400 Richest Americans''' is a list published by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine of the wealthiest 400 [[United States of America|American]] [[tax residence|residents]], ranked by [[net worth]]. The 400 was started by [[Malcolm Forbes]] in 1982 and the list is published annually around September.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes Oct. 2010 p.17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter W. Bernstein and Annalyn Swan describe the Forbes 400 as capturing "a period of extraordinary individual and entrepreneurial energy, a time unlike the extended postwar years, from 1945 to 1982, when American society emphasized the power of corporations."  Bernstein and Swan also describe it as representing "a powerful argument – and sometimes a dream – about the social value of wealth in contemporary America."&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Peter W. 2007"&gt;Bernstein, Peter W., and Annalyn Swan, eds. All the Money In the World: How the Forbes 400 Make and Spend- Their Fortunes. New York:  Alfred A. Knopf, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel K Ludwig, a self made billionaire, was the first #1 individual to make the  Forbes 400 "Richest Americans" list. Even though Ludwig was one of the wealthiest men of his day, with operations spanning 23 countries,[1] his name was little known. His fortune did not come from an inheritance, but from hard work and a thinking that was way ahead of his time...&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_K._Ludwig&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inherited wealth]] may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a "substantial head start".&lt;ref name="Salon-20140324"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bruenig |first=Matt |title=You call this a meritocracy?

The list of members of the Forbes 400 is updated usually in September of each year.

==Criteria==
The Forbes 400 reports who dominates the wealth in United States. They annually create a list of the richest people in America to exhibit the shape of the economy. The magazine displays the story of someone's rise to fame, their company, age, industrial residence, and education. The list portrays the financial shift of trends, leadership positions, and growing philanthropy intentions.&lt;ref name="2010p23"&gt;Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2016/10/04/groupons-eric-lefkofsky-returns-to-the-forbes-400.htmlGroupon's | title=Eric Lefkofsky returns to the Forbes 400|first=Will|last=Racke|publisher=Chicago Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First list (1982)===
In the first Forbes 400 list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/seankilachand/2012/09/20/the-forbes-400-hall-of-fame-36-members-of-our-debut-issue-still-in-ranks/|title=The Forbes 400 Hall Of Fame: 36 Members Of Our Debut Issue Still In Ranks|first=Sean|last=Kilachand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were only 13 billionaires, and a net worth of {{US$|75}} million secured a spot on the list. The 1982 list represented 2.8% of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] of the United States. The 1982 Forbes 400 had 22.8% of the list composed of oil fortunes, with 15.3% from manufacturing, 9% from finance and only 3% from technology driven fortunes. The state of [[New York (state)|New York]] had the most representation on the list with 77 members followed by [[California]] with 48.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
In the year 2000, Forbes 400 saw the highest percent of the Gross Domestic Product represented by the list at 12.2% driven by the internet boom.&lt;ref&gt;Kroll, Luisa. "The Forbes 400." Forbes October 2010 p.19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===

In April 2018, an ex-''Forbes'' reporter Jonathan Greenberg alleged that [[Donald Trump]] had inflated his actual wealth in order to be included on the Forbes 400 listing. Greenberg provided original audio recordings of his 1984 exchange with "John Barron", one of the [[pseudonyms of Donald Trump]], and eventually included Trump at the end of the Forbes 400 list at $100 million, one fifth of the $500 million which "Barron" was claiming as Donald Trump’s net worth. This figure was later corrected and, following civil proceedings years later, Trump admitted the name was fabricated.&lt;ref name="Borchers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Borchers|first=Callum|title=The amazing story of Donald Trump's old spokesman, John Barron – who was actually Donald Trump himself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/21/the-amazing-story-of-donald-trumps-old-spokesman-john-barron-who-was-actually-donald-trump-himself/|accessdate=July 20, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-lied-to-me-about-his-wealth-to-get-onto-the-forbes-400-here-are-the-tapes/2018/04/20/ac762b08-4287-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=Perspective Trump lied to me about his wealth to get onto the Forbes 400.

==Demographics==

Over the first 25 years of the Forbes 400 list, 1,302 distinct people made the list. In that time period, 97 immigrants (7.5%) and 202 women (15.5%) made the list. Four of the top five richest people in the United States in 2006 were college dropouts: [[Bill Gates]], [[Sheldon Adelson]], [[Larry Ellison]], and [[Paul Allen]].&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Peter W. 2007"/&gt;

A few articles draw on data of the Forbes 400 to test an evolutionary hypothesis referred to as the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]. This hypothesis predicts that parents of high socioeconomic status produce more male offspring than parents of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trivers|first1=Robert L.|last2=Willard|first2=Dan E.|year=1973|title=Natural selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring|journal=Science|volume=179|issue=4068|pages=90–92|doi=10.1126/science.179.4068.90|pmid=4682135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas an earlier study using data on the Forbes 400 shows a strong effect for U.S. billionaires that is consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E. Z. | last2 = Dalerum | first2 = F. | editor1-last = Reby | editor1-first = David | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004195 | title = A Trivers-Willard Effect in Contemporary Humans: Male-Biased Sex Ratios among Billionaires | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4195 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19142225| pmc =2614476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a more recent study shows some caveats: First, the result is only consistent for male, but not female, billionaires. Second, it can only be found among heirs and not self-made billionaires.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnettler | first1 = S. | editor1-last = Sorci | editor1-first = Gabriele | title = Revisiting a Sample of U.S. Billionaires: How Sample Selection and Timing of Maternal Condition Influence Findings on the Trivers-Willard Effect | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0057446 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = e57446 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23437389| pmc = 3578789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has to do with the timing of wealth accumulation: some self-made billionaires had their children before they were rich, but heirs, by definition, were rich before ever becoming parents (see also &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cameron | first1 = E. Z. | title = Facultative adjustment of mammalian sex ratios in support of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: Evidence for a mechanism | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2773 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 271 | issue = 1549 | pages = 1723–1728| year = 2004 | pmid =  15306293| pmc = 1691777}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Third, the size of the effect was largely overestimated, given that male offspring of billionaires as compared to female offspring is easier to find on the Web: Women sometimes change their last name upon marriage which makes some harder to find.

Standard histories of philosophy make him the midpoint in the development of [[German idealism]], situating him between [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], his mentor in his early years, and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his former university roommate, early friend, and later rival. Interpreting Schelling's philosophy is regarded as difficult because of its evolving nature.

Schelling's thought in the large has been neglected, especially in the English-speaking world, as has been his later work on mythology and revelation, much of which remains untranslated. An important factor was the ascendancy of Hegel, whose mature works portray Schelling as a mere footnote in the development of idealism. Schelling's ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' also has been attacked by scientists for its analogizing tendency and lack of empirical orientation.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=schelling |title=Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling |last=Bowie  |first=Andrew|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some later philosophers have shown interest in re-examining Schelling's body of work.

==Life==

===Early life===
Schelling was born in the town of [[Leonberg]] in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] (now [[Baden-Württemberg]]), the son of Joseph Friedrich Schelling and his wife Gottliebin Marie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Richard H. Popkin]]|title=The Columbia History of Western Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ok4F_SawQaEC&amp;pg=PA529 |date=31 December 2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10129-5|page=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[monastic school]] at [[Bebenhausen]], near [[Tübingen]], where his father was chaplain and an [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] professor.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316}} From 1783 to 1784 Schelling attended a Latin school in [[Nürtingen]] and knew [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], who was five years his senior. On 18 October 1790,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Morley]] (ed.), ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'', Voll. 10, 12, London: [[Chapman &amp; Hall]], 1870, [https://books.google.com/?id=LJxCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;dq=1790+%22On+the+18th+October,+Schelling%22 p. 500].&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 15, he was granted permission to enroll at the [[Tübinger Stift]] (seminary of the [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg]]), despite not having yet reached the normal enrollment age of 20. At the Stift, he shared a room with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] as well as Hölderlin, and the three became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419] |isbn=978-1-139-82495-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling studied the [[Church fathers]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. His interest gradually shifted from Lutheran theology to philosophy. In 1792 he graduated with his [[master's thesis]], titled ''Antiquissimi de prima malorum humanorum origine philosophematis [[Book of Genesis|Genes.]] III. explicandi tentamen criticum et philosophicum'',&lt;ref&gt;''History of Philosophy: From Thales to the Present Time'', Volume 2, C. Scribner's Sons, 1874, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The thesis is available online at the [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/resolve/display/bsb10888795.html Munich Digitization Center].&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1795 he finished his [[doctoral thesis]], titled ''De Marcione Paulinarum epistolarum emendatore'' (''On [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] as emendator of the [[Pauline letters]]'') under [[Gottlob Christian Storr]]. Meanwhile, he had begun to study [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], who influenced him greatly.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316–318}}

In 1797, while tutoring two youths of an aristocratic family, he visited [[Leipzig]] as their escort and had a chance to attend lectures at [[Leipzig University]], where he was fascinated by contemporary physical studies including chemistry and biology. He also visited [[Dresden]], where he saw collections of the [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], to which he referred later in his thinking on art. On a personal level, this Dresden visit of six weeks from August 1797 saw Schelling meet the brothers [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schlegel]] and his future wife Caroline (then married to August Wilhelm), and [[Novalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert J. Richards]], ''The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe'' (2002), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jena period===
After two years tutoring, in October 1798, at the age of 23, Schelling was called to [[University of Jena]] as an extraordinary (i.e., unpaid) professor of philosophy. His time at Jena (1798–1803) put Schelling at the center of the intellectual ferment of [[Romanticism]]. He was on close terms with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who appreciated the poetic quality of the ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', reading ''Von der Weltseele''. As the prime minister of the [[Duchy of Saxe-Weimar]], Goethe invited Schelling to Jena. On the other hand, Schelling was unsympathetic to the ethical idealism that animated the work of [[Friedrich Schiller]], the other pillar of [[Weimar Classicism]]. Later, in Schelling's ''Vorlesung über die Philosophie der Kunst'' (''Lecture on the Philosophy of Art'', 1802/03), Schiller's theory on the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] was closely reviewed.

In Jena, Schelling was on good terms with Fichte at first, but their different conceptions, about nature in particular, led to increasing divergence in their thought. Fichte advised him to focus on philosophy in its original meaning, that is, transcendental philosophy: specifically, Fichte's own ''Wissenschaftlehre''. But Schelling, who was becoming the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school, had begun to reject Fichte's thought as cold and abstract.

Schelling was especially close to August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife, [[Caroline Schelling|Caroline]]. A marriage between Schelling and Caroline's young daughter, Auguste Böhmer, was contemplated by both. Auguste died of [[dysentery]] in 1800, prompting many to blame Schelling, who had overseen her treatment. Robert Richards, however, argues in his book ''The Romantic Conception of Life'' that Schelling's interventions were not only appropriate but most likely irrelevant, as the doctors called to the scene assured everyone involved that Auguste's disease was inevitably fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 171 note 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste's death drew Schelling and Caroline closer. Schlegel had moved to Berlin, and a divorce was arranged (with Goethe's help). Schelling's time at Jena came to an end, and on 2 June 1803 he and Caroline were married away from Jena. Their marriage ceremony was the last occasion Schelling met his school friend Hölderlin, who was already mentally ill at that time.

In his Jena period, Schelling had a closer relationship with Hegel again. With Schelling's help, Hegel became a private lecturer (''Privatdozent'') at [[Jena University]]. Hegel wrote a book titled ''Differenz des Fichte'schen und Schelling'schen Systems der Philosophie'' (''Difference between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy'', 1801), and supported Schelling's position against his idealistic predecessors, Fichte and [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]]. Beginning in January 1802, Hegel and Schelling published the ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy'') as co-editors, publishing papers on the philosophy of nature, but Schelling was too busy to stay involved with the editing and the magazine was mainly Hegel's publication, espousing a thought different from Schelling's. The magazine ceased publication in the spring of 1803 when Schelling moved from Jena to [[Würzburg]].

===Move to Würzburg and personal conflicts===
After Jena, Schelling went to [[Bamberg]] for a time, to study Brunonian medicine (the theory of [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]]) with {{ill|Adalbert Friedrich Marcus|de}} and [[Andreas Röschlaub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallen |first=Martin |title=City of Health, Fields of Disease: Revolutions in the Poetry, Medicine, and Philosophy of Romanticism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4hFdAAAAMAAJ |year=2004 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-3542-0 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=4hFdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22After+the+breakup+of+the+Jena+circle,+Schelling+traveled+to+Bamberg+specifically+to+study+Brunonian+medicine+with+two+of+its+major+proponents+in+Germany,+Andreas+Roschlaub+and+Adalbert+Marcus%22 123]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1803 until April 1806 Schelling was professor at the new [[University of Würzburg]]. This period was marked by considerable flux in his views and by a final breach with Fichte and Hegel.

In Würzburg, a conservative Catholic city, Schelling found many enemies among his colleagues and in the government. He moved then to [[Munich]] in 1806, where he found a position as a state official, first as associate of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] and secretary of the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]], afterwards as secretary of the Philosophische Klasse (philosophical section) of the Academy of Sciences. 1806 was also the year Schelling published a book in which he criticized Fichte openly by name. In 1807 Schelling received the manuscript of Hegel's ''[[Phaenomenologie des Geistes]]'' (''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' or ''Mind''), which Hegel had sent to him, asking Schelling to write the foreword. Surprised to find remarks directed at his own philosophical theory, Schelling eventually wrote back, asking Hegel to clarify whether he had intended to mock Schelling's followers who lacked a true understanding of his thought, or Schelling himself. Hegel never replied. In the same year, Schelling gave a speech about the relation between the visual arts and nature at the Academy of Fine Arts; and Hegel wrote a severe criticism of it to one of his friends. After that, they criticized each other in lecture rooms and in books publicly until the end of their lives.

===Munich period===
Without resigning his official position in Munich, he lectured for a short time in [[Stuttgart]] (''Stuttgarter Privatvorlesungen'' [Stuttgart private lectures], 1810), and seven years at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]] (1820–1827).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1809 Karoline died,{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} just before he published ''Freiheitschrift'' (''Freedom Essay'') the last book published during his life. Three years later, introduced by Goethe,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Schelling married one of her closest friends, [[Pauline Gotter]], in whom he found a faithful companion.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

During the long stay at [[Munich]] (1806–1841) Schelling's literary activity came gradually to a standstill. It is possible that it was the overpowering strength and influence of the Hegelian system that constrained Schelling, for it was only in 1834, after the death of Hegel, that, in a preface to a translation by [[Hubert Beckers]] of a work by [[Victor Cousin]], he gave public utterance to the antagonism in which he stood to the Hegelian, and to his own earlier, conception of philosophy. The antagonism certainly was not then a new fact; the Erlangen lectures on the history of philosophy of 1822 express the same in a pointed fashion, and Schelling had already begun the treatment of [[mythology]] and [[religion]] which in his view constituted the true positive complements to the negative of logical or speculative philosophy.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

===Berlin period===
Public attention was powerfully attracted by these vague hints of a new system which promised something more positive, especially in its treatment of religion, than the apparent results of Hegel's teaching. The appearance of critical writings by [[David Friedrich Strauss]], [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]], and [[Bruno Bauer]], and the evident disunion in the Hegelian school itself, express a growing alienation from the then dominant philosophy. In Berlin, the headquarters of the Hegelians, this found expression in attempts to obtain officially from Schelling a treatment of the new system which he was understood to have in reserve. The realization of the desire did not come about till 1841, when the appointment of Schelling as Prussian privy councillor and member of the Berlin Academy, gave him the right, a right he was requested to exercise, to deliver lectures in the university.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} Among those in attendance at his lectures were [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (who said Schelling talked "quite insufferable nonsense" and complained that he did not end his lectures on time),&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]'' by Søren Kierkegaard, 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (who called them "interesting but rather insignificant"), [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]]&lt;ref&gt;Lara Ostaric, ''Interpreting Schelling: Critical Essays'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230106/http://www.egs.edu/library/friedrich-wilhelm-joseph-schelling/biography/ "Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling - Biography"] at [[European Graduate School|egs.edu]]&lt;/ref&gt; (who never accepted Schelling's [[natural philosophy]]),&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas A. Rupke, ''Alexander von Humboldt: A Metabiography'', University of Chicago Press, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Engels]] (who, as a partisan of Hegel, attended to "shield the great man's grave from abuse").&lt;ref&gt;Tristram Hunt, ''Marx's General: The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels'' (Henry Holt and Co., 2009: {{ISBN|0-8050-8025-2}}), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening lecture of his course was listened to by a large and appreciative audience. The enmity of his old foe, [[Heinrich Paulus|H. E. G. Paulus]], sharpened by Schelling's apparent success, led to the surreptitious publication of a verbatim report of the lectures on the philosophy of revelation, and, as Schelling did not succeed in obtaining legal condemnation and suppression of this piracy, he in 1845 ceased the delivery of any public courses.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

==Works==
[[File:Schelling 1848.jpg|thumb|right|A February 1848 [[daguerrotype]] of Schelling]]
In 1793 Schelling contributed to [[Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus]]'s periodical ''Memorabilien''. His 1795 dissertation was ''De Marcione Paullinarum epistolarum emendatore'' (''On [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] as emendator of the [[Pauline letters]]'').{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=316}} In 1794, Schelling published an exposition of Fichte's thought entitled ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Möglichkeit einer Form der Philosophie überhaupt'' (''On the Possibility of a Form of Philosophy in General'').{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=319}} This work was acknowledged by Fichte himself and immediately earned Schelling a reputation among philosophers. His more elaborate work, ''Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie, oder über das Unbedingte im menschlichen Wissen'' (''On Self as Principle of Philosophy, or on the Unrestricted in Human Knowledge'', 1795), while still remaining within the limits of the Fichtean idealism, showed a tendency to give the Fichtean method a more objective application, and to amalgamate [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s views with it. He contributed articles and reviews to the ''Philosophisches Journal'' of Fichte and [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]], and threw himself into the study of physical and medical science. In 1795 Schelling published ''Philosophische Briefe über Dogmatismus und Kritizismus'' (''Philosophical Letters on Dogmatism and Criticism''), consisting of 10 letters addressed to an unknown interlocutor that presented both a defense and critique of the Kantian system.

In the period 1796/97 there was written the seminal manuscript now known as the ''Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus'' ("[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]"). It survives in Hegel's handwriting. On its first publication (1916) by [[Franz Rosenzweig]], it was attributed to Schelling. It has also been claimed for Hegel and Hölderlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crites  |first=Stephen |title=Dialectic and Gospel in the Development of Hegel's Thinking |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz_fL1kLLXsC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=1 November 2010 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=ucUvmQEACAAJ 1998] |publisher=Penn State Press |isbn=978-0-271-04386-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dz_fL1kLLXsC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Das+älteste+Systemprogramm+des+deutschen+Idealismus%22%22Rosenzweig+identified+the+handwriting+as+Hegel's,+identifying+it+as+a+copy+of+a+lost+original+by+Schelling,+who+had+written+it+under+the+considerable+influence+of+Hölderlin%22 62]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797 Schelling published the essay ''Neue Deduction des Naturrechts'' ("New Deduction of Natural Law"), which anticipated Fichte's treatment of the topic in the ''Grundlage des Naturrechts'' (''Foundations of Natural Law''). His studies of physical science bore fruit in the ''Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur'' (''Ideas Concerning a Philosophy of Nature'', 1797), and the treatise ''Von der Weltseele'' (''On the World-Soul'', 1798). In ''Ideen'' Schelling referred to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and quoted from his ''[[Monadology]]''. He held Leibniz in high regard because of his view of nature during his natural philosophy period.

In 1800 Schelling published ''System des transcendentalen Idealismus'' (''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]''). In this book Schelling described transcendental philosophy and nature philosophy as complementary to one another. Fichte reacted by stating that Schelling was working on the basis of a false philosophical principle: in Fichte's theory nature as Not-Self (''Nicht-Ich'' = object) could not be a subject of philosophy, whose essential content is the subjective activity of the human intellect. The breach became unrecoverable in 1801, after Schelling published ''Darstellung des Systems meiner Philosophie'' ("Presentation of My System of Philosophy"). Fichte thought this title absurd, since in his opinion philosophy could not be personalized. Moreover, in this book Schelling publicly expressed his estimation of Spinoza, whose work Fichte had repudiated as dogmatism, and declared that nature and spirit differ only in their quantity, but are essentially identical (''Identität''). According to Schelling, the absolute was the indifference or identity, which he considered to be an essential subject of philosophy.

The "Aphorisms on ''Naturphilosophie''" published in the ''Jahrbücher der Medicin als Wissenschaft'' (1806–1808) are for the most part extracts from the Würzburg lectures, and the ''Denkmal der Schrift von den göttlichen Dingen des Herrn Jacobi''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} was a response to an attack by [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] (the two accused each other of atheism&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland, ''Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007: {{ISBN|0-7546-6118-0}}), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;). A work of significance is the 1809 ''Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände'' (''[[Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom]]''), which carries out, with increasing tendency to [[mysticism]], the thoughts of the previous work, ''Philosophie und Religion'' (''Philosophy and Religion'', 1804).{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} However, in a change from the Jena period works, now evil is not an appearance coming from the quantitative differences between the real and the ideal, but something substantial. This work clearly paraphrased Kant's distinction between intelligible and empirical character. Otherwise, Schelling himself called freedom "a capacity for good and evil".

The tract ''Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; die Gottheiten zu Samothrake'' ("On the Divinities of [[Samothrace]]") appeared in 1815, ostensibly a portion of a greater work, ''[[Weltalter]]'' ("The ages of the world"), frequently announced as ready for publication, but of which little was ever written. Schelling planned ''Weltalter'' as a book in three parts, describing the past, present, and future of the world; however, he began only the first part, rewriting it several times and at last keeping it unpublished. The other two parts were left only in planning. Christopher John Murray describes the work as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Building on the premise that philosophy cannot ultimately explain existence, he merges the earlier philosophies of Nature and identity with his newfound belief in a fundamental conflict between a dark unconscious principle and a conscious principle in God. God makes the universe intelligible by relating to the ground of the real but, insofar as nature is not complete intelligence, the real exists as a lack within the ideal and not as reflective of the ideal itself. The three universal ages — distinct only to us but not in the eternal God — therefore comprise a beginning where the principle of God before God is divine will striving for being, the present age, which is still part of this growth and hence a mediated fulfillment, and a finality where God is consciously and consummately Himself to Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760-1850'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004: {{ISBN|1-57958-422-5}}), pp. 1001–02.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No authentic information on the new positive philosophy (''positive Philosophie'') of Schelling was available until after his death (at Bad [[Ragatz]], on 20 August 1854). His sons then began the issue of his collected writings with the four volumes of Berlin lectures: vol. i. ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology'' (1856); ii. ''Philosophy of Mythology'' (1857); iii. and iv. ''Philosophy of Revelation'' (1858).{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

==Periodization==
Schelling at all stages of his thought called to his aid outward forms of some other system. Fichte, Spinoza, [[Jakob Boehme]] and the mystics, and finally, major Greek thinkers with their [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]], [[gnosticism|Gnostic]], and [[scholasticism|Scholastic]] commentators, give colouring to particular works. In Schelling's own view, his philosophy fell into three stages.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}} These were:
#the transition from Fichte's method to the more objective conception of nature i.e. the advance to ''Naturphilosophie''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}
#the definite formulation of that which implicitly, as Schelling claims, was involved in the idea of ''Naturphilosophie'', that is, the thought of the identical, indifferent, absolute substratum of both nature and spirit, the advance to ''Identitätsphilosophie''{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}
#the opposition of negative and positive philosophy, an opposition which is the theme of his Berlin lectures, though its germs may be traced back to 1804.{{sfn|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=317}}

===''Naturphilosophie''===
{{main|Naturphilosophie}}

The function of Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'' is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real. The change which experience brings before us leads to the conception of  duality, the polar opposition through which nature expresses itself. The dynamical series of stages in nature are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;"The briefest and best account in Schelling himself of Naturphilosophie is that contained in the ''Einleitung zu dem Ersten Entwurf'' (S.W. iii.). A full and lucid statement of Naturphilosophie is that given by K. Fischer in his Gesch. d. n. Phil., vi. 433-692" {{harv|Adamson|Mitchell|1911|p=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation and influence==
Some scholars characterize Schelling as a protean thinker who, although brilliant, jumped from one subject to another and lacked the synthesizing power needed to arrive at a complete philosophical system. Others challenge the notion that Schelling's thought is marked by profound breaks, instead arguing that his philosophy always focused on a few common themes, especially human freedom, the absolute, and the relationship between spirit and nature. Unlike Hegel, Schelling did not believe that the absolute could be known in its true character through rational inquiry alone.

Schelling's thought is still studied, although his reputation has varied over time. His work impressed the English romantic poet and critic [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who introduced his ideas into English-speaking culture, sometimes without full acknowledgment, as in the ''[[Biographia Literaria]]''. Coleridge's critical work was itself influential, and it was he who introduced into English literature Schelling's concept of the unconscious. Schelling's ''[[System of Transcendental Idealism]]'' has been seen as a precursor of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowie |first=Andrew |title=Aesthetics and Subjectivity. From Kant to Nietzsche |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q367AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-719-04011-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=q367AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22The+577+is+a+difficult+work+because+it+tries+to+tell%22%22the+story+of+consciousness,+including+what+happens+before+self-consciousness%22%22analogies+of+this+project+to+what+Freud+was+to+attempt+one+hundred+years+later+in+the+Interpretation+of+Dreams%22 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, Schelling was almost a forgotten philosopher even in Germany. In the 1910s and 1920s, philosophers of neo-Kantianism and neo-Hegelianism, like [[Wilhelm Windelband]] or [[Richard Kroner]], tended to describe Schelling as an episode connecting Fichte and Hegel. His late period tended to be ignored, and his philosophies of nature and of art in the 1790s and first decade of the 19th century were the main focus. In this context [[Kuno Fischer]] characterized Schelling's early philosophy as "aesthetic idealism", focusing on the argument where he ranked art as "the sole document and the eternal organ of philosophy" (''das einzige wahre und ewige Organon zugleich und Dokument der Philosophie''). From socialist philosophers like [[György Lukács]], he received criticism as anachronistic. An exception was [[Martin Heidegger]], who treated Schelling's ''[[On Human Freedom]]'' in his lectures in 1936. Heidegger found there central themes of Western ontology: the issues of being, existence, and freedom.

In the 1950s, the situation began to change. In 1954, the centennial of his death, an international conference on Schelling was held. Several philosophers including [[Karl Jaspers]] gave presentations about the uniqueness and relevance of his thought, the interest shifting toward his later work on being and existence, or, more precisely, the origin of existence. Schelling was the subject of the 1954 dissertation of [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref name=’Habermas’&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com./?id=IOLWAAAAMAAJ |title=Das Absolute und die Geschichte. Von der Zwiespältigkeit in Schellings Denken |first=Jurgen |last=Habermas |date=1954 |publisher=Gummersbach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Jaspers published a book titled ''Schelling'', representing him as a forerunner of the [[existentialist]]s. [[Walter Schulz]], one of organizers of the 1954 conference, published a book claiming that Schelling had made German idealism complete with his late philosophy, particularly with his Berlin lectures in the 1840s. Schulz presented Schelling as the person who resolved the philosophical problems which Hegel had left incomplete, in contrast to the contemporary idea that Schelling had been surpassed by Hegel much earlier. Theologian [[Paul Tillich]] wrote: "what I learned from Schelling became determinative of my own philosophical and theological development".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''A History of Christian Thought'' 438 Simon and Schuster, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] likened his own project of natural ontology to Schelling's in his 1957-58 Course on Nature.

In the 1970s nature was again of interest to philosophers in relation to environmental issues. Schelling's philosophy of nature, particularly his intention to construct a program which covers both nature and the intellectual life in a single system and method, and restore nature as a central theme of philosophy, has been reevaluated in the contemporary context. His influence and relation to the German art scene, particularly to Romantic literature and visual art, has been an interest since the late 1960s, from [[Philipp Otto Runge]] to [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. This interest has been revived in recent years through the work of the environmental philosopher [[Arran Gare]] who has identified a tradition of Schellingian science overcoming the opposition between science and the humanities, and offering the basis for an understanding of ecological science and ecological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2013.03.002 |pmid=23562477 |title=Overcoming the Newtonian paradigm: The unfinished project of theoretical biology from a Schellingian perspective |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=5–24 |year=2013 |last1=Gare |first1=Arran |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/GAROTN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to psychology, Schelling was considered to have coined the term "[[Unconscious mind|unconsciousness]]". [[Slavoj Žižek]] has written two books attempting to integrate Schelling's philosophy, mainly his middle period works including ''Weltalter'', with the work of [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Žižek |first1=Slavoj |title=The indivisible remainder: An essay on Schelling and related matters |date=1996 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=978-1-859-84094-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Žižek|first1=Slavoj|title=The parallax view|date=2009|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0-26251268-8|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition and division in God and thus the problem of evil in God faced by the later Schelling influenced [[Luigi Pareyson]]'s thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braidotti |first=Rosi |authorlink=Rosi Braidotti |title=After Poststructuralism.

==Quotations==
*"Nature is visible Spirit; Spirit is invisible Nature." (''Ideen'', "Introduction")
*"History as a whole is a progressive, gradually self-disclosing revelation of the Absolute." (''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800)
*"Now if the appearance of ''freedom'' is necessarily infinite, the total evolution of the Absolute is also an infinite process, and history itself a never wholly completed revelation of that Absolute which, for the sake of consciousness, and thus merely for the sake of appearance, separates itself into conscious and unconscious, the free and the intuitant; but which ''itself'', however, in the inaccessible light wherein it dwells, is Eternal Identity and the everlasting ground of harmony between the two." (''System of Transcendental Idealism'', 1800)
*"Has creation a final goal? And if so, why was it not reached at once? Why was the consummation not realized from the beginning? To these questions there is but one answer: Because God is ''Life'', and not merely Being." (''[[Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom]]'', 1809)
*"Only he who has tasted freedom can feel the desire to make over everything in its image, to spread it throughout the whole universe." (''Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom'', 1809)
*"As there is nothing before or outside of God he must contain within himself the ground of his existence. All philosophies say this, but they speak of this ground as a mere concept without making it something real and actual." (''Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom'', 1809)
*"[The Godhead] is not divine nature or substance, but the devouring ferocity of purity that a person is able to approach only with an equal purity. Since all Being goes up in it as if in flames, it is necessarily unapproachable to anyone still embroiled in Being." (''The Ages of the World'', c. 1815)
*"God then has no beginning only insofar as there is no beginning of his beginning. The beginning in God is eternal beginning, that is, such a one as was beginning from all eternity, and still is, and also never ceases to be beginning." (Quoted in Hartshorne &amp; Reese, ''Philosophers Speak of God'', Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1953, p.&amp;nbsp;237.)

'''Geologic modelling,'''  '''Geological modelling''' or '''Geomodelling''' is the [[applied science]] of creating [[Digitizing|computerized]] representations of portions of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] based on [[geophysical]] and [[geological]] observations made on and below the Earth surface. A Geomodel is the numerical equivalent of a three-dimensional [[geological map]] complemented by a description of [[physical quantities]] in the domain of interest.&lt;ref name="mallet"&gt;{{cite book

which is a multidisciplinary, interoperable and updatable knowledge base about the subsurface.

Geomodelling is commonly used for managing [[natural resources]], identifying [[natural hazards]], and quantifying [[geology|geological processes]], with main applications to [[Petroleum|oil]] and gas fields, groundwater [[aquifer]]s and [[ore]] deposits.  For example, in the [[oil and gas industry]], realistic geologic models are required as input to [[reservoir simulator]] programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various [[hydrocarbon]] recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and wasteful. Using geological models and [[reservoir simulation]] allows [[reservoir engineers]] to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.

Geologic modelling is a relatively recent subdiscipline of [[geology]] which integrates [[structural geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[paleoclimatology]], and [[diagenesis]];

In 2-dimensions (2D), a [[geologic formation]] or unit is represented by a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) triangulated or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a triangulated mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, often referred to as [[voxel]]s (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.

Geomodelling generally involves the following steps: 
# Preliminary analysis of geological context of the domain of study.
# Interpretation of available data and observations as point sets or polygonal lines (e.g. "fault sticks" corresponding to faults on a vertical seismic section).
# Construction of a structural model describing the main rock boundaries (horizons, unconformities, intrusions, faults)&lt;ref name="StructMod"&gt;Caumon, G., Collon-Drouaillet, P., Le Carlier de Veslud, C., Sausse, J. and Viseur, S. (2009), Surface-based 3D modeling of geological structures, ''Mathematical Geosciences'', 41(9):927-945&lt;/ref&gt;
# Definition of a three-dimensional mesh honoring the structural model to support volumetric representation of heterogeneity (see [[Geostatistics]]) and solving the [[Partial differential equation|Partial Differential Equations]] which govern physical processes in the subsurface (e.g. [[Seismology|seismic wave propagation]], fluid transport in porous media).

== Geologic modelling components ==

=== Structural framework ===
Incorporating the spatial positions of the major formation boundaries, including the effects of [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], [[Fold (geology)|folding]], and [[erosion]] ([[unconformity|unconformities]]).  The major stratigraphic divisions are further subdivided into layers of cells with differing geometries with relation to the bounding surfaces (parallel to top, parallel to base, proportional).  Maximum cell dimensions are dictated by the minimum sizes of the features to be resolved (everyday example:  On a digital map of a city, the location of a city park might be adequately resolved by one big green pixel, but to define the locations of the basketball court, the baseball field, and the pool, much smaller pixels - higher resolution - need to be used).

=== Rock type ===
Each cell in the model is assigned a rock type.  In a coastal [[clastic|clastic environment]], these might be beach sand, high water energy marine [[upper shoreface]] sand, intermediate water energy marine [[lower shoreface]] sand, and deeper low energy marine [[silt]] and [[shale]].  The distribution of these rock types within the model is controlled by several methods, including map boundary polygons, rock type probability maps, or statistically emplaced based on sufficiently closely spaced well data.

=== Reservoir quality ===
Reservoir quality parameters almost always include [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], but may include measures of clay content, cementation factors, and other factors that affect the storage and deliverability of fluids contained in the pores of those rocks. [[Geostatistics|Geostatistical]] techniques are most often used to populate the cells with porosity and permeability values that are appropriate for the rock type of each cell.

=== Fluid saturation ===
[[Image:MODFLOW 3D grid.png|thumb|right|A 3D [[finite difference]] grid used in [[MODFLOW]] for simulating groundwater flow in an aquifer.]]
Most rock is completely [[aquifer|saturated]] with [[groundwater]].  Sometimes, under the right conditions, some of the pore space in the rock is occupied by other liquids or gases.  In the energy industry, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] are the fluids most commonly being modelled.  The preferred methods for calculating hydrocarbon saturations in a geologic model incorporate an estimate of pore throat size, the [[density|densities]] of the fluids, and the height of the cell above the [[water contact]], since these factors exert the strongest influence on [[capillary action]], which ultimately controls fluid saturations.

=== Geostatistics ===
An important part of geologic modelling is related to [[geostatistics]]. In order to represent the observed data, often
not on regular grids, we have to use certain interpolation techniques. The most widely used technique is [[kriging]]
which uses the spatial correlation among data and intends to construct the interpolation via semi-variograms. To reproduce more realistic spatial variability and help assess spatial uncertainty between data, geostatistical simulation based on variograms, training images, or parametric geological objects is often used.

=== Mineral Deposits ===
Geologists involved in [[mining]] and [[mineral exploration]] use geologic modelling to determine the geometry and placement of [[mineral]] deposits in the subsurface of the earth.  Geologic models help define the volume and concentration of minerals, to which [[Economic geology|economic constraints]] are applied to determine the economic value of the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].  Mineral deposits that are deemed to be economic may be developed into a [[mining|mine]].

== Technology ==

Geomodelling and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] share a lot of common technologies. Software is usually implemented using object-oriented programming technologies in [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] on one or multiple computer platforms. The graphical user interface generally consists of one or several 3D and 2D graphics windows to visualize spatial data, interpretations and modelling output. Such visualization is generally achieved by exploiting [[graphics hardware]]. User interaction is mostly performed through mouse and keyboard, although 3D pointing devices and [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|immersive environments]] may be used in some specific cases. GIS (Geographic Information System) is also a widely used tool to manipulate geological data.

Geometric objects are represented with parametric curves and surfaces or discrete models such as [[polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]].&lt;ref name="StructMod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet02"&gt;Mallet, J.-L., Geomodeling, Applied Geostatistics Series.

== History ==

In the 70's, geomodelling mainly consisted of automatic 2D cartographic techniques such as contouring, implemented as [[FORTRAN]] routines communicating directly with [[plotter|plotting hardware]]. The advent of workstations with [[3D graphics]] capabilities during the 80's gave birth to a new generation of geomodelling software with graphical user interface which became mature during the 90's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html Dynamic Graphics History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725233528/http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocad.org/w4/index.php/gocad/origin Origin of the Gocad software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Mallet, P. Jacquemin, and N. Cheimanoff (1989). GOCAD project: Geometric modeling of complex geological surfaces, SEG Expanded Abstracts 8, 126, {{doi|10.1190/1.1889515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, geomodelling has been mainly motivated and supported by oil and gas industry.

==Geologic modelling software==
Software developers have built several packages for geologic modelling purposes. Such software can display, edit, digitise and automatically calculate the parameters required by engineers, geologists and surveyors. Current software is mainly developed and commercialized by oil and gas or mining industry software vendors:

'''Hempel's dilemma''' is a question first asked (at least on record) by the philosopher [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]].&lt;ref name=Hempel&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has relevance to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] and [[physicalism]] in philosophy, and to [[philosophy of mind]].

==Overview==
[[Physicalism]], in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the [[physical law|laws of nature]], in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena.  This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics.  There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory.

On the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]]. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories.

On the other hand, if we say that some future, "ideal" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The "ideal" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world.  In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.

[[Carlo Beenakker|Beenakker]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0702072v1 Carlo Beenakker (2007), "Hempel's dilemma and the physics of computation"]&lt;/ref&gt; to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: "The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe".

Hempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as [[consciousness]], [[knowledge representation|representation]], and [[intentionality]] are very hard to come by using current physics although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]]) hold to physicalism.

"'''Hīnayāna'''"&lt;!--Please do not insert other languages as the term Hinayana derives from Sanskrit and not other languages.--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|iː|n|ə|ˈ|j|ɑː|n|ə}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] term literally meaning the "inferior vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=hina&amp;script=&amp;direct=se&amp;link=didse&amp;mode=3|title=Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ehindunames.com/meaningof?foldername=knowyourname&amp;pagename=meaningresults&amp;username=hina|title=Meaning of hina {{!}} hina meaning in sanskrit {{!}} origin and history of hina {{!}} sanskrit syllables and sounds and text in hina {{!}} eHindunames.com|website=www.ehindunames.com|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan teachers translate it "smaller vehicle".&lt;ref name="Kalu Rinpoche 1995 p. 15"&gt;Kalu Rinpoche (1995) ''Profound Buddhism From Hinayana To Vajrayana'': p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The term was applied to the ''[[Śrāvakayāna]]'', the Buddhist path followed by a [[śrāvaka]] who wished to become an [[arhat]]. This pejorative term appeared around the first or second century. Hīnayāna was often contrasted with ''[[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]'', which means the "great vehicle".

In 1950 the [[World Fellowship of Buddhists]] declared that the term Hīnayana should not be used when referring to any form of Buddhism existing today.

In the past, the term was widely used by Western scholars to cover "the earliest system of Buddhist doctrine", as the ''Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' put it.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Oxford, 1899), "Proper Noun: simpler or lesser vehicle. Name of the earliest system of Buddhist doctrine (opposite to the later Mahayana; see [[Yana (Buddhism)|Yana]])."&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Buddhist scholarship has deprecated the pejorative term, and uses instead the term ''[[Nikaya Buddhism]]'' to refer to [[early Buddhist schools]]. 

''Hinayana'' has also been used as a synonym for [[Theravada]], which is the main tradition of Buddhism in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]]; this is considered inaccurate and derogatory. [[Robert Thurman]] writes, "'Nikaya Buddhism' is a coinage of Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of [[Harvard University]], who suggested it to me as a usage for the eighteen schools of Indian Buddhism to avoid the term 'Hinayana Buddhism,' which is found offensive by some members of the [[Theravada]] tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Thurman and Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University: . Robert Thurman, in ''The Emptiness That is Compassion'', footnote 10, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within Mahayana Buddhism, there were a variety of interpretations as to whom or to what the term ''Hinayana'' referred. [[Kalu Rinpoche]] stated the "lesser" or "greater" designation "did not refer to economic or social status, but concerned the spiritual capacities of the practitioner".&lt;ref name="Kalu Rinpoche 1995 p. 15"/&gt;
{{quote|The Small Vehicle is based on becoming aware of the fact that all we experience in samsara is marked by suffering. Being aware of this engenders the will to rid ourselves of this suffering, to liberate ourselves on an individual level, and to attain happiness. We are moved by our own interest.

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]], who visited India in the [[7th century]], distinguished Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2008 p. 5"&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''hīnayāna'' is formed of ''hīna'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit | url= http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=hina+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; "little", "poor", "inferior", "abandoned", "deficient", "defective"; and ''yāna'' (यान):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title= Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit | url= http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;tinput=yaana&amp;country_ID=&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU | accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "vehicle", where "vehicle" means "a way of going to enlightenment". The Pali Text Society's ''Pali-English Dictionary'' (1921–25) defines ''hīna'' in even stronger terms, with a semantic field that includes "poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible", and "despicable".

The term was translated by [[Kumārajīva]] and others into [[Classical Chinese]] as "small vehicle" (小 meaning "small", 乘 meaning "vehicle"), although earlier and more accurate translations of the term also exist. In Mongolian (''Baga Holgon'') the term for hinayana also means "small" or "lesser" vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;"It is also certain that Buddhist groups and individuals in [[China]] (including [[Tibet]]), [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Japan]] have in the past, as in the very recent present, identified themselves as Mahayana Buddhists, even if the polemical or value claim embedded in that term was only dimly felt, if at all.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', 2004, page 492&lt;/ref&gt; while in Tibetan there are at least two words to designate the term, ''theg chung'' meaning "small vehicle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/theg_chung |title=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionary:theg chung |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[Rangjung Yeshe Wiki]] |publisher=Tsadra Foundation |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''theg dman'' meaning "inferior vehicle" or "inferior spiritual approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/theg_dman |title=Rangjung Yeshe Wiki - Dharma Dictionary:theg dman |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[Rangjung Yeshe Wiki]] |publisher=Tsadra Foundation |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thrangu Rinpoche]] has emphasized that ''hinayana'' is in no way implying "inferior". In his translation and commentary of [[Asanga]]'s ''Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata'', he writes, "all three traditions of hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana were practiced in Tibet and that the hinayana which literally means "lesser vehicle" is in no way inferior to the mahayana."&lt;ref name="Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Dharma and Dharmata, note 5"&gt;Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. ''Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata.'' 1999. p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to Jan Nattier, it is most likely that the term Hīnayāna postdates the term Mahāyāna and was only added at a later date due to antagonism and conflict between the bodhisattva and śrāvaka ideals. The sequence of terms then began with the term ''Bodhisattvayāna'' "bodhisattva-vehicle", which was given the epithet Mahāyāna "Great Vehicle". It was only later, after attitudes toward the bodhisattva teachings had become more critical, that the term Hīnayāna was created as a back-formation, contrasting with the already established term Mahāyāna.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term Mahāyāna as an epithet and synonym for Bodhisattvayāna, but the term Hīnayāna is comparatively rare in early texts, and is usually not found at all in the earliest translations. Therefore, the often-perceived symmetry between Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna can be deceptive, as the terms were not actually coined in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], "the deep-rooted misconception concerning an unfailing, ubiquitous fierce criticism of the Lesser Vehicle by the [Mahāyāna] is not supported by our texts."&lt;ref name="Williams, Jane 2004. p. 43"&gt;Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 3.'' 2004. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Williams states that while evidence of conflict is present in some cases, there is also substantial evidence demonstrating peaceful coexistence between the two traditions.&lt;ref name="Williams, Jane 2004. p. 43"/&gt;

==Mahāyāna members of the early Buddhist schools==
Although the 18–20 [[early Buddhist schools]] are sometimes loosely classified as Hīnayāna in modern times, this is not necessarily accurate. There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school of Buddhism but rather as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]] has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]]s and [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]]s adhering to the Mahāyāna formally adheres to the vinaya of an early school. This continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] ordination lineage in East Asia and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] ordination lineage in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mahāyāna was never a separate sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] wrote about the relationship between the various "vehicles" and the early Buddhist schools in India. He wrote, "There exist in the West numerous subdivisions of the schools which have different origins, but there are only four principal schools of continuous tradition." These schools are the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Nikāya, [[Sthavira nikāya]], Mūlasarvāstivāda Nikāya, and [[Saṃmitīya]] Nikāya.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining their doctrinal affiliations, he then writes, "Which of the four schools should be grouped with the Mahāyāna or with the Hīnayāna is not determined." That is to say, there was no simple correspondence between a Buddhist school and whether its members learn "Hīnayāna" or "Mahāyāna" teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph (2005) ''Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture'': pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

To identify entire schools as "Hīnayāna" that contained not only śrāvakas and [[pratyekabuddha]]s but also Mahāyāna bodhisattvas would be attacking the schools of their fellow Mahāyānists as well as their own. Instead, what is demonstrated in the definition of ''Hīnayāna'' given by Yijing is that the term referred to individuals based on doctrinal differences.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2008 p. 5"/&gt;

==Hīnayāna as Śrāvakayāna==

Scholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although "the Mahāyāna ... very occasionally referred  to earlier Buddhism as the Hinayāna, the Inferior Way, [...] the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts." She notes that the term [[Śrāvakayāna]] was "the more politically correct and much more usual" term used by Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Onians, "Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm," D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 72&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Silk has argued that the term "Hinayana" was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A Silk. What, if anything, is Mahayana Buddhism? Numen 49:4 (2002):335-405. Article reprinted in Williams, ''Buddhism, Vol III'', Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hīnayāna and Theravāda==

===Views of Chinese pilgrims===
In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] describes the concurrent existence of the [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihara]] and the [[Abhayagiri vihāra]] in Sri Lanka. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the "Hīnayāna Sthaviras" and the monks of Abhayagiri vihāra as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang further writes, "The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical differences===
Mahayanists were primarily in philosophical dialectic with the [[Vaibhāṣika]] school of [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], which had by far the most "comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics" of the nikāya schools.&lt;ref&gt;""one does not find anywhere else a body of doctrine as organized or as complete as theirs". . . "Indeed, no other competing schools have ever come close to building up such a comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics as the Vaibhāśika." ''The Sautrantika theory of seeds (bija) revisited: With special reference to the ideological continuity between Vasubandhu's theory of seeds and its Srilata/Darstantika precedents'' by Park, Changhwan, PhD, University of California, Berkeley, 2007 pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind it is sometimes argued that the Theravada would not have been considered a "Hinayana" school by Mahayanists because, unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada]] school, the primary object of Mahayana criticism, the Theravada school does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]]; in this it maintains the attitude of [[early Buddhism]]. Additionally, the concept of the bodhisattva as one who puts off enlightenment rather than reaching awakening as soon as possible, has no roots in Theravada textual or cultural contexts, current or historical. Aside from the Theravada schools being geographically distant from the Mahayana, the Hinayana distinction is used in reference to certain views and practices that had become found within the Mahayana tradition itself. Theravada, as well as Mahayana schools stress the urgency of one's own awakening in order to end suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Frank J. Hoffman and Deegalle Mahinda, ''Pāli Buddhism.'' Routledge Press 1996, page 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought.'' Edinburgh University Press, 1999, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika, Nyaponika Thera, Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time.'' Wisdom Publications, 1998, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Theravadin figures have thus indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahayana philosophy found in the ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez and Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel, ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel.'' University of Chicago Press 2006, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.196.57.144/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=7DF9961A731248CCA21C89D2694999FC Gil Fronsdal, in ''Tricycle,'' posted online on November 8, 2007]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahayanists were bothered by the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrāntika|Sautrāntikins]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[śūnyatā]], David Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravadins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikins (and followers of other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravada arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinions of scholars===
Most western scholars regard the Theravada school to be one of the Hinayana schools referred to in Mahayana literature, or regard Hinayana as a synonym for Theravada.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism in Its Connexion with Brāhmanism and Hindūism: And in Its Contrast with Christianity|author=Monier-Williams, M.|date=1889|publisher=John Murray|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis. 1988.

'''Homage''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|m|ᵻ|dʒ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|m|ᵻ|dʒ}}) is a show or demonstration of [[respect]] or [[dedication]] to someone or something, sometimes by simple declaration but often by some more oblique reference, artistic or poetic.  The term is often used in the arts for where one author or artist shows respect to another by allusion or imitation; this is often pronounced like the French ''hommage'' ({{IPAc-en|əʊ|ˈ|m|ɑː|ʒ}}).&lt;ref name="onlanguage"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/magazine/07FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=1&amp;ref=onlanguage|title=Homage|first=Ben |last=Zimmer |at=On Language | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It was originally a [[Homage (feudal)|declaration of fealty]] in the [[feudal system]]—swearing that one was the{{Dubious|date=February 2015|reason= "a" rather than "the" is common sense, since many men owed homage to any lord worthy of the title.

Provide page and wording that justifies "the [man of]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept then became used figuratively for an acknowledgement of quality or superiority.  For example, a man might give homage to a lady, so honouring her beauty and other graces.  In German scholarship, followers of a great scholar developed the custom of honouring their mentor by producing papers for a ''[[festschrift]]'' dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESFS7XXhujAC&amp;pg=PA75 |title=An author's guide to scholarly publishing |author=Robin M.

In music homage can take the form of a composition (''[[Homage to Paderewski]]''), a [[tribute album]] (''[[Homage to Charles Parker]]'') or a [[sampling (music)|sample]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tz5YpijuksC&amp;pg=PA616 |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World |author=John Shepherd |chapter=Rock Homage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of | 2010}}, the digital techniques used to generate many forms of media make it easy to borrow from other works and this [[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)#Remediation|remediation]] may be used in homage to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA497 |title=Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory |author=Richard Grusin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[social psychology]], '''illusory superiority''' is a condition of [[cognitive bias]] whereby a person overestimates their own qualities and abilities, in relation to the same qualities and abilities of other persons. Illusory superiority is one of many [[positive illusions]], relating to the [[self]], that are evident in the study of [[intelligence]], the effective performance of tasks and tests, and the possession of desirable personal characteristics and personality traits.

The term ''illusory superiority'' first was used by the researchers Van Yperen and Buunk, in 1991. The condition is also known as the '''Above-average effect''', the '''superiority bias''', the '''leniency error''', the '''sense of relative superiority''', the '''''primus inter pares'' effect''',

Illusory superiority has been found in individuals' comparisons of themselves with others in a variety of aspects of life, including performance in academic circumstances (such as class performance, exams and overall intelligence), in working environments (for example in [[job performance]]), and in social settings (for example in estimating one's [[popularity]], or the extent to which one possesses desirable personality traits, such as [[honesty]] or [[confidence]]), and in everyday abilities requiring particular skill.&lt;ref name="hoorens" /&gt;

For ''illusory'' superiority to be demonstrated by social comparison, two logical hurdles have to be overcome. One is the ambiguity of the word "average". It is logically possible for nearly all of the set to be above the [[mean]] if the distribution of abilities is highly [[skewed]]. For example, the mean number of legs per human being is slightly lower than two because some people have fewer than two and almost none have more. Hence experiments usually compare subjects to the [[median]] of the peer group, since by definition it is impossible for a majority to exceed the median.

A further problem in inferring inconsistency is that subjects might interpret the question in different ways, so it is logically possible that a majority of them are, for example, more generous than the rest of the group each on "their own understanding" of generosity.&lt;ref name="Colvin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1= C. Randall Colvin |author2=Jack Block |author3=David C.

As subjects evaluated themselves on a specific, well-defined attribute, illusory superiority remains.&lt;ref name="dunning_meyerowitz"&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =David Dunning |author2= Judith A.

=== Cognitive ability ===

==== IQ ====
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Downing effect]] --&gt;
One of the main effects of illusory superiority in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] is the "Downing effect". This describes the tendency of people with a below-average IQ to overestimate their IQ, and of people with an above-average IQ to underestimate their IQ. This tendency was first observed by C.&amp;nbsp;L. Downing, who conducted the first [[cross-cultural studies]] on perceived intelligence. His studies also showed that the ability to accurately estimate other people's IQs was proportional to one's own IQ (i.e., the lower the IQ, the less capable of accurately appraising other people's IQs). People with high IQs are better overall at appraising other people's IQs, but when asked about the IQs of people with similar IQs as themselves, they are likely to rate them as having higher IQs.

The disparity between actual IQ and perceived IQ has also been noted between genders by British psychologist [[Adrian Furnham]], in whose work there was a suggestion that, on average, men are more likely to overestimate their intelligence by 5 points, while women are more likely to underestimate their IQ by a similar margin.&lt;ref&gt;Janet E. Davidson and C. L. Downing, [https://books.google.com/?id=7ry1NpFtZKkC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=Contemporary%20models%20of%20intelligence "Contemporary Models of Intelligence"] in Robert J. Sternberg, ''Handbook of Intelligence'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= [[Adrian Furnham]]| author2= Joanna Moutafi| author3 = Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic |title=Personality and Intelligence: Gender, the Big Five, Self-Estimated and Psychometric Intelligence|journal =International Journal of Selection and Assessment|  date= March 2005| volume=13| issue=1|pages=11–24 |doi=10.1111/j.0965-075X.2005.00296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
Illusory superiority has been found in studies comparing [[memory]] self-reports, such as Schmidt, Berg &amp; Deelman's research in older adults. This study involved participants aged between 46 and 89 years of age comparing their own memory to that of peers of the same age group, 25-year-olds and their own memory at age 25. This research showed that participants exhibited illusory superiority when comparing themselves to both peers and younger adults, however the researchers asserted that these judgments were only slightly related to age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iris W. Schmidt |author2=Ina J. Berg |author3=Betto G. Deelman |year= 1999 |title = Illusory Superiority in Self-Reported Memory of Older Adults |journal= Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition  |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=288–301 |doi= 10.1076/1382-5585(199912)06:04;1-B;FT288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive tasks ====
{{Main|Dunning–Kruger effect}}
In Kruger and Dunning's experiments participants were given specific tasks (such as solving [[logic problem]]s, analyzing [[grammar]] questions, and determining whether jokes were funny), and were asked to evaluate their performance on these tasks relative to the rest of the group, enabling a direct comparison of their actual and perceived performance.&lt;ref name="unskilled" /&gt;

Results were divided into four groups depending on actual performance and it was found that all four groups evaluated their performance as above average, meaning that the lowest-scoring group (the bottom 25%) showed a very large illusory superiority bias. The researchers attributed this to the fact that the individuals who were worst at performing the tasks were also worst at recognizing skill in those tasks. This was supported by the fact that, given training, the worst subjects improved their estimate of their rank as well as getting better at the tasks.&lt;ref name="unskilled"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments |first= Justin |last= Kruger |author2 =David Dunning |journal =[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=1121–34 |year=1999 |pmid=10626367 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, titled "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments", won an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |title= The 2000 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |publisher= Improbable Research |access-date= 27 May 2008 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110225074430/http://improb.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2000 |archivedate= 25 February 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Dunning and Joyce Ehrlinger, also of [[Cornell University]], published a study that detailed a shift in people's views of themselves influenced by external cues. Cornell undergraduates were given tests of their knowledge of geography, some intended to positively affect their self-views, others intended to affect them negatively. They were then asked to rate their performance, and those given the positive tests reported significantly better performance than those given the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Joyce Ehrlinger |author2= David Dunning |date= January 2003 |title =How Chronic Self-Views Influence (and Potentially Mislead) Estimates of Performance |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–17 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |doi =10.1037/0022-3514.84.1.5 |pmid=12518967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Ames and Lara Kammrath extended this work to sensitivity to others, and the subjects' perception of how sensitive they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mind-Reading and Metacognition: Narcissism, not Actual Competence, Predicts Self-Estimated Ability |journal = Journal of Nonverbal Behavior |publisher= Springer Netherlands |author1 = Daniel R.

Dunning, Kruger, and coauthors' latest paper on this subject comes to qualitatively similar conclusions after making some attempt to test alternative explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Why the Unskilled Are Unaware: Further Explorations of (Absent) Self-Insight Among the Incompetent |journal= Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes |volume=105 |year=2008 |pages=98–121 |doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2007.05.002 |first=Joyce |last=Ehrlinger |first2 =Kerri |last2=Johnson |first3=Matthew |last3=Banner |first4=David |last4=Dunning |first5=Justin |last5=Kruger |pmid=19568317 |pmc=2702783 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Academic ability and job performance ====
In a survey of faculty at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]], 68% rated themselves in the top 25% for teaching ability, and more than 90% rated themselves as above average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[K. Patricia Cross]] |year= Spring 1977 |title= Not Can But Will College Teachers Be Improved? |journal =New Directions for Higher Education |volume=1977 | issue = 17 |pages=1–15 |doi =10.1002/he.36919771703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar survey, 87% of [[Master of Business Administration]] students at [[Stanford University]] rated their academic performance as above the median.&lt;ref&gt;"It's Academic." 2000. ''Stanford GSB Reporter'', 24 April, pp.14–5. via {{Cite journal |author= Zuckerman |first= Ezra W. |author2 = John T. Jost |year=2001 |title= What Makes You Think You're So Popular?

Illusory superiority has also explained phenomena such as the large amount of [[stock market]] trading (as each [[Stock trader|trader]] thinks they are the best, and most likely to succeed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/0022-1082.00078 | author1 =[[Terrance Odean]] |date=December 1998  | title = Volume, Volatility, Price, and Profit When All Traders Are Above Average | url = http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/vvpp.pdf | journal = [[Journal of Finance]] | volume = 53 | issue = 6| pages = 1887–1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of lawsuits that go to trial (because, due to illusory superiority, many lawyers have an inflated belief that they will win a case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neale | first1 = Margaret A. | last2 = Bazerman | first2 = Max H. | year = 1985 | title = The Effects of Framing and Negotiator Overconfidence on Bargaining Behaviors and Outcomes | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 34–49 | doi=10.2307/256060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self, friends, and peers ===
One of the first studies that found illusory superiority was carried out in the [[United States]] by the [[College Board]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun"&gt;{{cite book |author1 =Mark D. Alicke |author2 = Olesya Govorun |title= The Self in Social Judgment |editor= Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I. Krueger |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2005 |series=Studies in Self and Identity |pages=85–106 |chapter= The Better-Than-Average Effect |isbn=978-1-84169-418-4 |oclc=58054791}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey was attached to the [[SAT]] exams (taken by one million students annually), asking the students to rate themselves relative to the median of the sample (rather than the average peer) on a number of vague positive characteristics. In ratings of [[leadership]], 70% of the students put themselves above the median. In ability to get on well with others, 85% put themselves above the median; 25% rated themselves in the top 1%.

A 2002 study on illusory superiority in social settings, with participants comparing themselves to friends and other peers on positive characteristics (such as punctuality and sensitivity) and negative characteristics (such as [[naivety]] or inconsistency). This study found that participants rated themselves more favorably than their friends, but rated their friends more favorably than other peers (but there were several moderating factors).&lt;ref name="suls_lemos_stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Jerry Suls |author2 = Katherine Lemos |author3 = H.&amp;nbsp;Lockett Stewart |year= 2002 |title=Self-Esteem, Construal, and Comparisons With the Self, Friends, and Peers | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher =American Psychological Association |volume=82 |pages=252–261 |doi =10.1037/0022-3514.82.2.252 |url = http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/82_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_252_(Suls).pdf |pmid=11831414 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Perloff and Fetzer,&lt;ref name="Perloff 1986 502–510"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1986 |title= Self–Other Judgments and Perceived Vulnerability to Victimization |journal =Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=50 |pages=502–510 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.502 |issue=3|last1= Perloff |first1= Linda S. |last2= Fetzer |first2= Barbara K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown,&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/soco.1986.4.4.353 |last=Brown |first =Jonathan D. |year=1986 |title = Evaluations of Self and Others: Self-Enhancement Biases in Social Judgments  |journal= Social Cognition |volume =4 |issue=4 |pages=353–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John C.

Tajfel and Turner attributed this to an "[[In-group favoritism|ingroup bias]]" and suggested that this was motivated by the individual's desire for a "[[Social identity theory|positive social identity]]".

==== Popularity ====
In Zuckerman and Jost's study, participants were given detailed questionnaires about their [[friendship]]s and asked to assess their own [[popularity]]. Using [[social network analysis]], they were able to show that participants generally had exaggerated perceptions of their own popularity, especially in comparison to their own friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Zuckerman, Ezra W. |author2=John T. Jost |year =2001 |title=What Makes You Think You're So Popular? Self Evaluation Maintenance and the Subjective Side of the 'Friendship Paradox' | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=207–223 |url= http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Zuckerman%20&amp;%20Jost%20(2001)%20What%20Makes%20You%20Think%20You're%20So%20Popular1.pdf |doi=10.2307/3090112 |access-date=29 August 2009 |jstor=3090112 |publisher =American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that most people in the study believed that they had more friends than their friends, a 1991 study by sociologist Scott L. Feld on the [[friendship paradox]] shows that on average, due to [[sampling bias]], most people have fewer friends than their friends have.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = Scott L. |last = Feld |year = 1991 |title = Why your friends have more friends than you do |journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume = 96 |issue = 6 |pages = 1464–1477 |jstor = 2781907 |doi = 10.1086/229693 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship happiness ====
Researchers have also found illusory superiority in relationship satisfaction. For example, one study found that participants perceived their own relationships as better than others' relationships on average, but thought that the majority of people were happy with their relationships. It also found evidence that the higher the participants rated their own relationship happiness, the more superior they believed their relationship was—illusory superiority also increased their own relationship satisfaction. This effect was pronounced in men, whose satisfaction was especially related to the perception that one's own relationship was superior as well as to the assumption that few others were unhappy in their relationships. On the other hand, women's satisfaction was particularly related to the assumption that most people were happy with their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buunk |first= Bram P. |date=December 2001 |title=Perceived Superiority of One's Own Relationship and Perceived Prevalence of Happy and Unhappy Relationships |journal = British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages= 565–574 |doi= 10.1348/014466601164984}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} found that participants became [[Defence mechanisms|defensive]] when their spouse or partner were perceived by others to be more successful in any aspect of their life, and had the tendency to exaggerate their success and understate their spouse or partner's success.

=== Health ===
Illusory superiority was found in a [[self-report study]] of [[health]] behaviors (Hoorens &amp; Harris, 1998) that asked participants to estimate how often they and their peers carried out healthy and unhealthy behaviors. Participants reported that they carried out healthy behaviors more often than the average peer, and unhealthy behaviors less often. The findings held even for expected future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08870449808407303|year=1998 |title=Distortions in Reports of Health Behaviours: The Time Span Effect and Illusory Superiority | journal = Psychology and Health |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=451–466|last1=Hoorens |first1=Vera |last2=Harris |first2=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Driving ability ===
Svenson (1981) surveyed 161 students in [[Sweden]] and the [[United States]], asking them to compare their [[Driving#Driving skills|driving skills]] and [[Road traffic safety|safety]] to other people. For driving skills, 93% of the U.S. sample and 69% of the Swedish sample put themselves in the top 50%; for safety, 88% of the U.S. and 77% of the Swedish put themselves in the top 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Svenson |first= Ola | url = http://heatherlench.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/svenson.pdf |title= Are We All Less Risky and More Skillful Than Our Fellow Drivers? |journal= Acta Psychologica |volume=47 |issue=2 |date=February 1981 |pages=143–148 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(81)90005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCormick, Walkey and Green (1986) found similar results in their study, asking 178 participants to evaluate their position on eight different dimensions of driving skills (examples include the "dangerous–safe" dimension and the "considerate–inconsiderate" dimension). Only a small minority rated themselves as below the median, and when all eight dimensions were considered together it was found that almost 80% of participants had evaluated themselves as being an above-average driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Iain A. McCormick  |author2 = Frank H. Walkey |author3= Dianne E. Green  |date=June 1986 |title= Comparative Perceptions of Driver Ability: A Confirmation and Expansion | journal= Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume =18 |issue=3 |pages=205–208 |doi= 10.1016/0001-4575(86)90004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One commercial survey showed that 36% of drivers believed they were an above-average [[Mobile phones and driving safety|driver while texting]] or sending emails compared to other drivers; 44% considered themselves average, and 18% below average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cheapcarinsurance.net/24-of-drivers-admit-to-coming-close-to-causing-an-accident-while-texting&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immunity to bias ===
{{Main|Bias blind spot}}
Subjects describe themselves in positive terms compared to other people, and this includes describing themselves as less susceptible to bias than other people. This effect is called the "[[bias blind spot]]" and has been demonstrated independently.

== Cultural differences ==
A vast majority of the literature on illusory superiority originates from studies on participants in the [[United States]]. However, research that only investigates the effects in one specific population is severely limited as this may not be a true representation of human psychology. More recent research investigating [[self-esteem]] in other countries suggests that illusory superiority depends on culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= In Search of East Asian Self-Enhancement |journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review |year=2007|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–27|doi=10.1177/1088868306294587 |pmid=18453453|author1 = Heine|first1 = S. J.|last2 = Hamamura|first2 = T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies indicate that [[East Asian]]s tend to underestimate their own abilities in order to improve themselves and get along with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= DeAngelis |first=Tori |title=Why We Overestimate Our Competence |work =Monitor on Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |date=Feb 2003 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate.aspx |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=60 |doi= 10.1037/e300052003-031|access-date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Falk | first1 = Carl F. | last2 = Heine | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Yuki | first3 = Masaki | last4 = Takemura | first4 = Kosuke | year = 2009 | title = Why Do Westerners Self-Enhance More than East Asians? | url = http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~heine/docs/WhyWesternersSelfEnhance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 183–203 | doi = 10.1002/per.715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-esteem ==
{{Main|Self-esteem}}
Illusory superiority's relationship with self-esteem is uncertain. The theory that those with high self-esteem maintain this high level by rating themselves highly is not without merit—studies involving non-[[Depression (mood)|depressed]] college students found that they thought they had more control over positive outcomes compared to their peers, even when controlling for performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = David J. | last2 = Abramson | first2 = Lyn Y. | last3 = Alloy | first3 = Lauren B. |date=January 1984 | title =Illusion of Control for Self and Others in Depressed and Non-Depressed College Students | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 46 | issue =1 | pages = 126–136 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-depressed students also actively rate peers below themselves as opposed to rating themselves higher. Students were able to recall a great deal more negative personality traits about others than about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1521/soco.1982.1.3.223 | last1 = Kuiper | first1 = Nicholas A. | last2 = Macdonald | first2 = M. R. | year = 1982 | title = Self and Other Perception in Mild Depressives | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 223–239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted though, that in these studies there was no distinction made between people with legitimate and illegitimate high self-esteem, as other studies have found that absence of [[positive illusions]]  mainly coexist with high self-esteem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0191-8869(92)90177-Q | last1 = Compton | first1 = William C. | year = 1992 | title =Are Positive Illusions Necessary for Self-Esteem: A Research Note | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 13 | issue = 12| pages = 1343–1344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Grit (personality trait)|determined]] individuals bent on growth and learning are less prone to these illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knee | first1 = C. Raymond | last2 = Zuckerman | first2 = Miron |date=June 1998 | title = A Nondefensive Personality: Autonomy and Control as Moderators of Defensive Coping and Self-Handicapping  | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 115–130 | doi = 10.1006/jrpe.1997.2207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it may be that while illusory superiority is associated with undeserved high self-esteem, people with legitimate high self-esteem do not necessarily exhibit it.

== Relation to mental health ==
{{Main|Depressive realism}}
[[Psychology]] has traditionally assumed that generally accurate self-perceptions are essential to good [[mental health]]. This was challenged by a 1988 paper by Taylor and Brown, who argued that mentally healthy individuals typically manifest three cognitive illusions—illusory superiority, [[illusion of control]], and [[optimism bias]].&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; This idea rapidly became very influential, with some authorities concluding that it would be therapeutic to deliberately induce these biases.&lt;ref name="shedler" /&gt; Since then, further research has both undermined that conclusion and offered new evidence associating illusory superiority with negative effects on the individual.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt;

One line of argument was that in the Taylor and Brown paper, the classification of people as mentally healthy or unhealthy was based on self-reports rather than objective criteria.&lt;ref name="shedler" /&gt; Hence it was not surprising that people prone to [[self-enhancement]] would exaggerate how well-adjusted they are. One study claimed that "mentally normal" groups were contaminated by "defensive deniers", who are the most subject to positive illusions.&lt;ref name="shedler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shedler |first=Jonathan |author2=Martin Mayman |author3=Melvin Manis  |year=1993 |title=The 'Illusion' of Mental Health |journal= American Psychologist |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=48 |issue=11 |pages=1117–1131 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.48.11.1117 |pmid=8259825}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[longitudinal study]] found that self-enhancement biases were associated with poor [[social skill]]s and psychological maladjustment.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; In a separate experiment where videotaped conversations between men and women were rated by independent observers, self-enhancing individuals were more likely to show socially problematic behaviors such as hostility or irritability.&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt; A 2007 study found that self-enhancement biases were associated with psychological benefits (such as subjective well-being) but also inter- and intra-personal costs (such as [[anti-social behavior]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sedikides |first= Constantine | author2 =Robert S.

== Neuroimaging ==
The degree to which people view themselves as more desirable than the average person links to reduced activation in their [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. This is suggested to link to the role of these areas in processing "cognitive control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beer |first1=Jennifer S. |last2=Hughes |first2=Brent L. |year=2010 |title=Neural systems of social comparison and the "above-average" effect |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/BeerLAB/beerhughesaboveaverage.pdf |journal=NeuroImage |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=2671–2679 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.075 |pmid=19883771 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314235213/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/BeerLAB/beerhughesaboveaverage.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== Noisy mental information processing ===
A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' suggests that illusory superiority (as well as other biases) can be explained by a simple [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | year = 2012 | title = Toward a Synthesis of Cognitive Biases: How Noisy Information Processing Can Bias Human Decision Making | url = http://martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 138 | issue = 2| pages = 211–237 | doi = 10.1037/a0025940 | pmid = 22122235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests that the underlying cognitive mechanism is essentially similar to the noisy mixing of memories that can cause the [[conservatism bias]] or [[overconfidence]]: after our own performance, we readjust our estimates of our own performance more than we readjust our estimates of others' performances. This implies that our estimates of the scores of others are even more conservative (more influenced by the previous expectation) than our estimates of our own performance (more influenced by the new evidence received after giving the test). The difference in the conservative bias of both estimates (conservative estimate of our own performance, and even more conservative estimate of the performance of others) is enough to create illusory superiority. Since mental noise is a sufficient explanation that is much simpler and straightforward than any other explanation involving [[heuristics]], behavior, or social interaction,&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; [[Occam's razor]] would argue in its favor as the underlying generative mechanism (it is the hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions).

=== Selective recruitment ===
Selective recruitment is the notion that, when making peer comparisons, an individual selects their own strengths and the other's weaknesses in order that they appear better on the whole. This theory was first tested by Weinstein (1980); however, this was in an experiment relating to [[optimism bias|optimistic bias]], rather than the better-than-average effect. The study involved participants rating certain behaviors as likely to increase or decrease the chance of a series of life events happening to them. It was found that individuals showed less optimistic bias when they were allowed to see others' answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Weinstein |first= Neil D. |year=1980 |title= Unrealistic Optimism About Future Life Events |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher =American Psychological Association |volume=39  | url = http://heatherlench.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/weinstein.pdf |pages= 806–820 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806 |issue =5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perloff and Fetzer (1986) suggested that when making peer comparisons on a specific characteristic, an individual chooses a comparison target—the peer to whom he is being compared—with lower abilities. To test this theory, Perloff and Fetzer asked participants to compare themselves to specific comparison targets like a close friend, and found that illusory superiority decreased when they were told to envision a specific person rather than vague constructs like "the average peer". However these results are not completely reliable and could be affected by the fact that individuals like their close friends more than an "average peer" and may as a result rate their friend as being higher than average, therefore the friend would not be an objective comparison target.&lt;ref name="Perloff 1986 502–510" /&gt;

=== Egocentrism ===
{{Main|Egocentrism}}
Another explanation for how the better-than-average effect works is egocentrism. This is the idea that an individual places greater importance and significance on their own abilities, characteristics, and behaviors than those of others. Egocentrism is therefore a less overtly self-serving bias. According to egocentrism, individuals will overestimate themselves in relation to others because they believe that they have an advantage that others do not have, as an individual considering their own performance and another's performance will consider their performance to be better, even when they are in fact equal. Kruger (1999) found support for the egocentrism explanation in his research involving participant ratings of their ability on easy and difficult tasks. It was found that individuals were consistent in their ratings of themselves as above the median in the tasks classified as "easy" and below the median in the tasks classified as "difficult", regardless of their actual ability. In this experiment the better-than-average effect was observed when it was suggested to participants that they would be successful, but also a [[worse-than-average effect]] was found when it was suggested that participants would be unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kruger |first= Justin |year=1999 |title= Lake Wobegon Be Gone! The 'Below-Average Effect' and the Egocentric Nature of Comparative Ability Judgments |journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=77 |pages=221–232 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.2.221 |pmid= 10474208 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focalism ===
{{Main|Focalism}}
Yet another explanation for the better-than-average effect is "focalism", the idea that greater significance is placed on the object that is the focus of attention. Most studies of the better-than-average effect place greater focus on the self when asking participants to make comparisons (the question will often be phrased with the self being presented before the comparison target—"compare yourself to the average person"). According to focalism this means that the individual will place greater significance on their own ability or characteristic than that of the comparison target. This also means that in theory if, in an experiment on the better-than-average effect, the questions were phrased so that the self and other were switched (e.g., "compare the average peer to yourself") the better-than-average effect should be lessened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =David A. Schkade |author2=[[Daniel Kahneman]] |date=September 1998 |title= Does Living in California Make People Happy? A Focusing Illusion in Judgments of Life Satisfaction |journal =Psychological Science |volume=9 |pages=340–346 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00066 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into focalism has focused primarily on optimistic bias rather than the better-than-average effect. However, two studies found a decreased effect of optimistic bias when participants were asked to compare an average peer to themselves, rather than themselves to an average peer.&lt;ref name="Otten"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Otten |first= W. |author2=J.&amp;nbsp;Van der Pligt |year=1966 |title=Context effects in the measurement of comparative optimism in probability judgments |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume=15 |pages= 80–101 | doi = 10.1521/jscp.1996.15.1.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =J.&amp;nbsp;Richard Eiser |author2 =Sabine Pahl| author3 = Yyvonne R.&amp;nbsp;A.

Windschitl, Kruger &amp; Simms (2003) have conducted research into focalism, focusing specifically on the better-than-average effect, and found that asking participants to estimate their ability and likelihood of success in a task produced results of decreased estimations when they were asked about others' chances of success rather than their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Paul D.

=== "Self versus aggregate" comparisons ===
This idea, put forward by Giladi and Klar, suggests that when making comparisons any single member of a group will tend to evaluate themselves to rank above that group's statistical mean performance level or the median performance level of its members. For example, if an individual is asked to assess his or her own skill at driving compared to the rest of the group, he or she is likely to rate him/herself as an above-average driver. Furthermore, the majority of the group is likely to rate themselves as above average. Research has found this effect in many different areas of human performance and has even generalized it beyond individuals' attempts to draw comparisons involving themselves.&lt;ref name="giladi" /&gt; Findings of this research therefore suggest that rather than individuals evaluating themselves as above average in a self-serving manner, the better-than-average effect is actually due to a general tendency to evaluate any single person or object as better than average.

=== Better-than-average heuristic ===
Alicke and Govorun proposed the idea that, rather than individuals consciously reviewing and thinking about their own abilities, behaviors and characteristics and comparing them to those of others, it is likely that people instead have what they describe as an "automatic tendency to assimilate positively-evaluated social objects toward ideal trait conceptions".&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; For example, if an individual evaluated themselves as honest, they would be likely to then exaggerate their characteristic towards their perceived ideal position on a scale of honesty. Importantly, Alicke noted that this ideal position is not always the top of the scale; for example, with honesty, someone who is always brutally honest may be regarded as rude—the ideal is a balance, perceived differently by different individuals.

=== Non-social explanations ===
The better-than-average effect may not have wholly social origins—judgments about inanimate objects suffer similar distortions.&lt;ref name="giladi"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1 =Eilath E. Giladi |author2= Yechiel Klar |date=December 2002 |title= When Standards Are Wide of the Mark: Nonselective Superiority and Inferiority Biases in Comparative Judgments of Objects and Concepts |journal = [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] |volume =131 |pages=538–551 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.131.4.538 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moderating factors ==
While illusory superiority has been found to be somewhat self-serving, this does not mean that it will predictably occur—it is not constant. The strength of the effect is moderated by many factors, the main examples of which have been summarized by Alicke and Govorun (2005).&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt;

=== Interpretability/ambiguity of trait ===
This is a phenomenon that Alicke and Govorun have described as "the nature of the judgement dimension" and refers to how subjective (abstract) or objective (concrete) the ability or characteristic being evaluated is.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; Research by Sedikides &amp; Strube (1997) has found that people are more self-serving (the effect of illusory superiority is stronger) when the event in question is more open to interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = Constantine | last2 = Strube | first2 = Michael J. | year = 1997 | chapter =  Self-Evaluation: To Thine Own Self Be Good, To Thine Own Self Be Sure, To Thine Own Self Be True, and To Thine Own Self be Better | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 209–269 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60018-0 | title = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | isbn = 9780120152292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example social constructs such as [[popularity]] and [[attractiveness]] are more interpretable than characteristics such as intelligence and physical ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.86.1.61 | last1 = Reeder | first1 = Glenn D. | last2 = Brewer | first2 = Marilynn B. |date=January 1979 | title = A Schematic Model of Dispositional Attribution in Interpersonal Perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 86 | issue =1 | pages = 61–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been partly attributed also to the need for a believable self-view.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Swann, Jr. and Michael D. Buhrmester (2003). [https://books.google.com/?id=kGK-dfHpM4gC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;lpg=PA405#v=onepage&amp;q=Self%20Verification%3A%20The%20search%20for%20coherence "Self-Verification: The Search for Coherence"]. In Mark R. Leary and June Price Tangney (Eds.), ''Handbook of Self and Identity'' (pp. 367–383). New York: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that ambiguity moderates illusory superiority has empirical research support from a study involving two conditions: in one, participants were given criteria for assessing a trait as ambiguous or unambiguous, and in the other participants were free to assess the traits according to their own criteria. It was found that the effect of illusory superiority was greater in the condition where participants were free to assess the traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.6.1082 | last1 = Dunning | first1 = David | last2 = Meyerowitz | first2 = Judith A. | last3 = Holzberg | first3 = Amy D. | year = 1989 | title = Ambiguity and Self-Evaluation: The Role of Idiosyncratic Trait Definitions in Self-Serving Assessments of Ability | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1082–1090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of illusory superiority have also been found to be strongest when people rate themselves on abilities at which they are totally incompetent. These subjects have the greatest disparity between their actual performance (at the low end of the distribution) and their self-rating (placing themselves above average). This [[Dunning–Kruger effect]] is interpreted as a lack of [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] ability to recognize their own incompetence.&lt;ref name="unskilled" /&gt;

=== Method of comparison ===
The method used in research into illusory superiority has been found to have an implication on the strength of the effect found. Most studies into illusory superiority involve a comparison between an individual and an average peer, of which there are two methods: direct comparison and indirect comparison. A direct comparison—which is more commonly used—involves the participant rating themselves and the average peer on the same scale, from "below average" to "above average"&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alicke | first1 = Mark D. | last2 = Klotz | first2 = M. L. | last3 = Breitenbecher | first3 = David L. | last4 = Yurak | first4 = Tricia J. | last5 = Vredenburg | first5 = Debbie S. | year = 1995 | title = Personal Contact, Individuation, and the Better-Than-Average Effect | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 68 | issue = 5| pages = 804–825 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.68.5.804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and results in participants being far more self-serving.&lt;ref name="Otten" /&gt; Researchers have suggested that this occurs due to the closer comparison between the individual and the average peer, however use of this method means that it is impossible to know whether a participant has overestimated themselves, underestimated the average peer, or both.

The indirect method of comparison involves participants rating themselves and the average peer on separate scales and the illusory superiority effect is found by taking the average peer score away from the individual's score (with a higher score indicating a greater effect). While the indirect comparison method is used less often it is more informative in terms of whether participants have overestimated themselves or underestimated the average peer, and can therefore provide more information about the nature of illusory superiority.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

=== Comparison target ===
The nature of the comparison target is one of the most fundamental moderating factors of the effect of illusory superiority, and there are two main issues relating to the comparison target that need to be considered.

First, research into illusory superiority is distinct in terms of the comparison target because an individual compares themselves with a hypothetical average peer rather than a tangible person. Alicke et al. (1995) found that the effect of illusory superiority was still present but was significantly reduced when participants compared themselves with real people (also participants in the experiment, who were seated in the same room), as opposed to when participants compared themselves with an average peer. This suggests that research into illusory superiority may itself be biasing results and finding a greater effect than would actually occur in real life.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

Further research into the differences between comparison targets involved four conditions where participants were at varying proximity to an interview with the comparison target: watching live in the same room; watching on tape; reading a written transcript; or making self-other comparisons with an average peer. It was found that when the participant was further removed from the interview situation (in the tape observation and transcript conditions) the effect of illusory superiority was found to be greater. Researchers asserted that these findings suggest that the effect of illusory superiority is reduced by two main factors—individuation of the target and live contact with the target.

Second, Alicke et al.'s (1995) studies investigated whether the negative connotations to the word "average" may have an effect on the extent to which individuals exhibit illusory superiority, namely whether the use of the word "average" increases illusory superiority. Participants were asked to evaluate themselves, the average peer and a person whom they had sat next to in the previous experiment, on various dimensions. It was found that they placed themselves highest, followed by the real person, followed by the average peer, however the average peer was consistently placed above the mean point on the scale, suggesting that the word "average" did not have a negative effect on the participant's view of the average peer.&lt;ref name="alicke_klotz" /&gt;

=== Controllability ===
An important moderating factor of the effect of illusory superiority is the extent to which an individual believes they are able to control and change their position on the dimension concerned. According to Alicke &amp; Govorun positive characteristics that an individual believes are within their control are more self-serving, and negative characteristics that are seen as uncontrollable are less detrimental to self-enhancement.&lt;ref name="alicke_govorun" /&gt; This theory was supported by Alicke's (1985) research, which found that individuals rated themselves as higher than an average peer on positive controllable traits and lower than an average peer on negative uncontrollable traits. The idea, suggested by these findings, that individuals believe that they are responsible for their success and some other factor is responsible for their failure is known as the [[self-serving bias]].

=== Individual differences of judge ===
Personality characteristics vary widely between people and have been found to moderate the effects of illusory superiority, one of the main examples of this is self-esteem. Brown (1986) found that in self-evaluations of positive characteristics participants with higher self-esteem showed greater illusory superiority bias than participants with lower self-esteem.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; Additionally, another study found that participants pre-classified as having high self-esteem tended to interpret ambiguous traits in a self-serving way, whereas participants pre-classified as having low self-esteem did not do this.&lt;ref name="suls_lemos_stewart" /&gt;

== Worse-than-average effect ==
{{Main|Worse-than-average effect}}
In contrast to what is commonly believed, research has found that better-than-average effects are not universal. In fact, much recent research has found the opposite effect in many tasks, especially if they were more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.005 | last1 = Moore | first1 = Don A. |date=January 2007 | title = Not So Above Average After All: When People Believe They Are Worse Than Average and Its Implications for Theories of Bias in Social Comparison | ssrn = 775086 | journal = Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 42–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first online community to use the term "incel" was started in 1993 when a Canadian college student known only by her first name, Alana, created a website in order to discuss her sexual inactivity with others.&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/24/incel-sexual-frustration-rebellion-at-center-toronto-attack.html|title='Incel' sexual frustration 'rebellion' at center of Toronto attack|last=Schallhorn|first=Kaitlyn|date=April 24, 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/08/intel-involuntary-celibate-movement-218324|title=How 'Incel' Got Hijacked|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|date=May 8, 2018|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/news/a34512/woman-who-started-incel-movement/|title=The Woman Who Accidentally Started the Incel Movement|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=March 1, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website, titled "Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project",&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; was used by people of all genders to share their thoughts and experiences.  In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to "incel", where it was defined as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time".&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455|title=The woman who founded the 'incel' movement|last=Taylor|first=Jim|date=August 30, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 30, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her college career and after, she realized she was [[queer]], and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; When speaking about the website in 2018, Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years."&lt;ref name="bbcaug302018" /&gt;

The message board love-shy.com was founded in 2003 as a place for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy of potential partners to discuss their situations.&lt;ref name="Dewey2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[/r/incels]] [[subreddit]], a forum on the website [[Reddit]], became a particularly active incel community. The subreddit was known as a place where men blamed women for their involuntary celibacy, sometimes advocated for rape or other violence, and were misogynistic and often racist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html|title=Reddit Bans Nazi Groups and Others in Crackdown on Violent Content|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=October 26, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; One post titled "general question about how rapists get caught" was asked by a member pretending to be a woman, saying they wanted to know how a woman who was drugged and raped would begin finding her rapist.&lt;ref name="Solon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41926687|title=Reddit bans 'involuntarily celibate' community|last=Bell|first=Chris|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alana read about the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], and the way parts of the incel subculture glorified the perpetrator, Elliot Rodger,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; she wrote, "Like a scientist who invented something that ended up being a weapon of war, I can't uninvent this word, nor restrict it to the nicer people who need it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alana expressed regret at the change in usage from her original intent of creating an "inclusive community" for men and women who were sexually deprived due to social awkwardness, marginalization, or mental illness.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/woman-who-invented-incel-movement-interview-toronto-attack|title=Woman behind 'incel' says angry men hijacked her word 'as a weapon of war'|last1=Kassam|first1=Ashifa|date=April 26, 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since started a new project, "Love Not Anger", which she describes as "a project to research how lonely people might find respectful love, instead of being stuck in anger".&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Reddit announced a new policy that would ban "content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  and banned the /r/incels subreddit on November 7, 2017, under its purview. At the time of the ban, the community had around 40,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=November 9, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Incels came to wider public notice with the banning of the subreddit and when a series of mass murders were committed by men who either self-identified as involuntarily celibate or shared similar ideologies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a33782/involuntary-celibacy/|title=What Happens to Men Who Can't Have Sex|last=Baker|first=Peter|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However the incel community continued to inhabit Reddit.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Increased interest in incel communities has been attributed to the feeling of "aggrieved entitlement" by some men, who feel they are being denied rights they deserve and blame women instead of society's expectation of [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The incel subculture includes people who are in [[sexless marriage]]s (or other sexless relationships) but who wish to be sexually active. It is considered to be distinct from [[asexuality]] and from voluntary [[Abstinence|sexual abstinence]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Denise|last2=Burgess|first2=Elisabeth|last3=Anderson|first3=Sally|last4=Davis|first4=Regina|last5=Dillard|first5=Joy|date=2001|title=Involuntary Celibacy: A life course analysis|url=http://cda.morris.umn.edu/~meeklesr/celibacy.html|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|volume=38|issue=2|pages=159–169|doi=10.1080/00224490109552083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
"Involuntary celibacy" is not a medical or psychological condition. Some people who identify as incel suffer from physical disabilities or psychological disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], and [[body dysmorphic disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/2018/05/we-must-try-understand-how-unwanted-virginity-leads-self-hating-incels-murder|title=We must try to understand how unwanted virginity leads self-hating incels to murder|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=May 8, 2018|website=[[New Statesman]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some visitors of incel forums attribute their inability to find a partner to physical or mental ailments, some others attribute it to extreme introversion.

== Mass murders and violence ==
Some mass murders and other violent attacks in North America have been committed or are suspected to have been committed by men who have self-identified as involuntarily celibate, or whose statements align with incel ideologies.

On May 23, 2014, Elliot Rodger [[2014 Isla Vista killings|killed six people and injured fourteen others]] before killing himself in [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], [[California]], near the campus of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. These killings drew media attention to the concept of involuntary celibacy, and particularly the misogyny and glorification of violence that are a mainstay of many incel communities. Rodger self-identified as an incel and left behind a 137-page manifesto and [[YouTube]] videos detailing his involuntary celibacy and discussing how he wanted revenge for being rejected by women.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/05/24/the-disturbing-internet-footprint-of-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/ |title=The Disturbing Internet Footprint Of Santa Barbara Shooter Elliot Rodger|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|date=May 24, 2014|work=[[Forbes]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html|title=Elliot O.

Rodger is among several attackers who are regularly praised by members of incel communities. The perpetrator of the [[2009 Collier Township shooting]], George Sodini, has been embraced by some of these communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] by [[Stephen Paddock]] (a man with unclear motive), some of the involuntarily celibate community celebrated the shooter, who they felt was a hero who was targeting "normies".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The trend has since continued—after the 2018 Toronto van attack, a poster on a website created to supersede /r/incels wrote about suspected perpetrator Alek Minassian, "I hope this guy wrote a manifesto because he could be our next new saint."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; After the 2018 [[Danforth shooting]], posters on an incel message board expressed excitement with the possibility that the perpetrator might be an incel, although no motive has been identified.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/incels-looksmaxing-obsession_us_5b50e56ee4b0de86f48b0a4f|title=Inside Incels' Looksmaxing Obsession: Penis Stretching, Skull Implants And Rage|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 24, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2015, Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and injured eight others before killing himself in a [[Umpqua Community College shooting|shooting at the Umpqua Community College]] campus in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]]. He left a manifesto at the scene, outlining his interest in other mass murders including the Isla Vista killings, anger at not having a girlfriend, and animus towards the world.

On December 7, 2017, William Atchison killed two people before killing himself in [[Aztec, New Mexico|Aztec]], [[New Mexico]], in a [[Aztec High School shooting|shooting at Aztec High School]], where he had previously been a student. He had used the pseudonym "Elliot Rodger" on several online forums, and praised "the supreme gentleman" (a term Rodger had used to describe himself, which has since been adopted as a moniker by incel communities).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180205/alt-right-killing-people|title=The Alt-Right is Killing People|last=Hankes|first=Keegan|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|access-date=May 14, 2018|last2=Amend|first2=Alex|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Incel communities have been widely criticized in the media and by researchers as violent, misogynist, and extremist.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":WaPo-Houston-etc" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst working for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has cautioned that exposure to violent content on incel forums "play[s] a very large role" in the radicalization of incels, and describes violent posts on the forums as "more&amp;nbsp;... than I'm used to seeing on even white supremacist sites".&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Journalist [[David Futrelle]] has described incel communities as "violently misogynistic", and is among critics who attribute worsening violent rhetoric on incel forums to the growth of the alt-right and white supremacy, and the overlap between incel communities and online hate groups.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-extremism-radical-misogyny_us_5b491358e4b0bc69a787458f|title=Internet Giants Are Banning Extremists (Just Not The Ones Targeting Women)|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=July 27, 2018|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4167152/toronto-van-attack-incel-alek-minassian-violence/|title=Expert traces link between violent online alt-right fantasies and real-world attacks|last=Cain|first=Patrick|date=April 27, 2018|work=[[Global News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior research fellow at the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] (ISD), [[Amarnath Amarasingam]], has criticized some incel communities where calls for violence are commonplace, saying "under the right set of psychological and personal circumstances, these kinds of forums can be dangerous and push people into violence".&lt;ref name="dark-side" /&gt; Another researcher at the ISD, Jacob Davey, compared the radicalization of incels in incel forums to teenagers being urged to go to extreme measures on online [[Pro-ana|forums that promote anorexia and other eating disorders]] and to online campaigns convincing people to join [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape". [[University of Portsmouth]] lecturer Lisa Sugiura has described incel forums as a "networked misogyny", and urged the posts in such forums be taken seriously not only in the context of [[hate speech]] but also as a form of grooming that could radicalize "impressionable and vulnerable disillusioned young men".&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/rise-women-haters-inside-dark-world-british-incels/|title=Rise of the women haters: Inside the dark world of the British 'incels'|last=Tait|first=Amelia|date=August 18, 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=September 1, 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on incels by media outlets following the incel-related attacks during the 2010s has been criticized for its "breathless" coverage, normalizing incel communities by describing them as "sexually frustrated", and directing readers to incel communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/toronto-attack-incel-alek-minassian|title=After the Toronto attack don't explain Incel ideology, ban it|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 26, 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reporting has also been criticized for [[victim blaming]] by implying that women and peers who rejected the attackers held some responsibility for provoking the attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/21/no-girls-and-women-dont-provoke-mass-murderers/|title=No, girls and women don't 'provoke' mass murderers|last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth|date=May 21, 2018|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for giving attackers notoriety by reporting on them at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44321469|title=The problem with mass shootings and the media|last=Cooper|first=Kelly-Leigh|date=May 31, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=August 11, 2018|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Representation of Lake of Wada.jpg|thumb|Representation of Lake of Wada]]
In [[mathematics]], the {{nihongo|'''lakes of Wada'''|和田の湖|Wada no mizuumi}} are three [[disjoint set|disjoint]] [[connected set|connected]] [[open set]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] or open unit square with the [[counterintuitive]] property that they all have the same [[boundary (topology)|boundary]]. In other words, for any point selected on the boundary of ''one'' of the lakes, the other two lakes' boundaries also contain that point.

More than two sets with the same boundary are said to have the '''Wada property'''; examples include '''Wada basins''' in [[dynamical system]]s. This property is rare in real-world systems.

The lakes of Wada were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Kunizo Yoneyama|first=Kunizō|last= Yoneyama|year= 1917|loc=page 60}}, who credited the discovery to [[Takeo Wada]]. His construction is similar to the construction by {{harvtxt|Brouwer|1910}} of an [[indecomposable continuum]], and in fact it is possible for the common boundary of the three sets to be an indecomposable continuum.

==Construction of the lakes of Wada==
[[Image:Lakes of Wada.jpg|thumb|243px|right|First five stages of the Lakes of Wada]]

The Lakes of Wada are formed by starting with a closed unit square of dry land, and then digging 3 lakes according to the following rule:
*On day ''n'' = 1, 2, 3,... extend lake ''n'' mod 3 (=0, 1, 2) so that it is open and connected and passes within a distance 1/''n'' of all remaining dry land. This should be done so that the remaining dry land remains homeomorphic to a closed unit square.

After an infinite number of days, the three lakes are still disjoint connected open sets, and the remaining dry land is the boundary of each of the 3 lakes.

For example, the first five days might be (see the image on the right):
# Dig a blue lake of width 1/3 passing within {{radic|2}}/3 of all dry land.
# Dig a red lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Dig a green lake of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land.
# Extend the blue lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The small channel connects the thin blue lake to the thick one, near the middle of the image.)
# Extend the red lake by a channel of width 1/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; passing within {{radic|2}}/3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of all dry land. (The tiny channel connects the thin red lake to the thick one, near the top left of the image.)

A variation of this construction can produce a countable infinite number of connected lakes with the same boundary: instead of extending the lakes in the order 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, ...., extend them in the order 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...and so on.

==Wada basins==
[[Image:Newtroot 1 0 0 m1.png|thumb|200px|right|Wada basins of attraction for {{nowrap|z&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1 {{=}} 0;}} all three disconnected open basins have the same boundary]]
Wada basins are certain special [[basins of attraction]] studied in the [[mathematics]] of non-linear systems. A basin having the property that every neighborhood of every point on the boundary of that basin intersects at least three basins is called a '''Wada basin''', or said to have the '''Wada property'''. Unlike the Lakes of Wada, Wada basins are often disconnected.

An example of Wada basins is given by the [[Newton's method|Newton–Raphson method]] applied to a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, such as {{nowrap|''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1;}} see the picture.

A physical system that demonstrates Wada basins is the pattern of reflections between three spheres in contact—see [[chaotic scattering]].

==Wada basins in chaos theory==
In [[chaos theory]], Wada basins arise very frequently. Usually, the Wada property can be seen in the  basin of attraction of dissipative dynamical systems. 
But the exit basins of Hamiltonian system can also show the Wada property. In the context of the chaotic scattering of systems with multiple exit, basin of exit shows the Wada property. 
[[Miguel Angel Fernández Sanjuán|M. A. F. Sanjuán]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wada basins and chaotic invariant sets in the  Henon-Heiles system, Phys. Rev. E 64, 066208 (2001) |url=http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v64/i6/e066208}}&lt;/ref&gt; had shown that in the [[Hénon-Heiles equation|Henon-Heiles system]] the exit basins have this Wada property.

{{More citations needed|date=October 2013}}
The '''letter of introduction''', along with the [[visiting card]], was an important part of polite social interaction in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It remains important in formal situations, such as an [[ambassador]] presenting his or her [[credential]]s (a [[letter of credence]]), and in certain business circles.

In general, a person would not interact socially with others unless they had been properly introduced, whether in person or by letter.  A person of lower social status would request a patron of higher social status to write a letter of introduction to a third party, also of higher social status than the first person, but lower than the second person.  It was important to observe the niceties of [[etiquette]] in requesting, writing and presenting such letters, in such matters as the quality of the paper used, and whether it would be delivered unsealed to allow the requesting party to read it.  For example, it was best practice to deliver a letter of introduction to the intended recipient with a [[visiting card]], to allow the recipient to reciprocate by calling upon the sender the next day.

When [[Benjamin Franklin]] served as Ambassador to France (1776–1785) he was besieged by those traveling to America who desired letters of introduction. With his inimitable sense of style and humor, Ambassador Franklin drafted the following letter: 
{{quote|The bearer of this, who is going to America, presses me to give him a letter of recommendation, though I know nothing of him, not even his name. This may seem extraordinary, but I assure you that it is not uncommon here. Sometimes, indeed, one unknown person brings another, equally unknown, to recommend him; and sometimes they recommend one another. As to this gentleman, I must refer you to himself for his character and merits, with which he is certainly better acquainted than I can possibly be. I recommend him, however, to those civilities which every stranger of whom one knows no harm has a right to; and I request you will do him all good offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenbrun |first=David  |title=Triumph in Paris: The Exploits of Benjamin Franklin |url= |accessdate= |year=1976 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013854-8 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Life-cycle assessment''' ('''LCA''', also known as '''life-cycle analysis''', '''ecobalance''', and '''cradle-to-grave analysis''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdrc.org/uem/lca/lca-define.html "Defining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 17 October 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling. Designers use this process to help critique their products. LCAs can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental concerns by:
* Compiling an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases;
* Evaluating the potential impacts associated with identified inputs and releases;
* Interpreting the results to help make a more informed decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/lca/lca.html "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."] US Environmental Protection Agency. 6 August 2010. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and purpose==

The goal of LCA is to compare the full range of environmental effects assignable to products and services by quantifying all inputs and outputs of material flows and assessing how these material flows affect the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Overview|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/400/life-cycle-assessment-lca-overview|website=sftool.gov|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is used to improve processes, support policy and provide a sound basis for informed decisions.&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"&gt;[http://ecometrica.com/services/#lca "GHG Product Life Cycle Assessments"]. ''Ecometrica''. Retrieved on: 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''life cycle'' refers to the notion that a fair, [[holistic]] assessment requires the assessment of raw-material production, manufacture, [[Sustainable distribution|distribution]], use and [[Waste management|disposal]] including all intervening transportation steps necessary or caused by the product's existence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

There are two main types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to establish (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, at a point in time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic implications of a decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118063849/http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/pdf/DTIx1164xPA-guidelines_sLCA.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}, United Nations Environment Programme, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as a different approach to [[Life Cycle Thinking|life cycle thinking]] intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The procedures of life cycle assessment (LCA) are part of the [[ISO 14000]] environmental management standards: in ISO 14040:2006 and 14044:2006. (ISO 14044 replaced earlier versions of ISO 14041 to ISO 14043.) [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] product life cycle assessments can also comply with specifications such as [[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 2050 and the [[Carbon emissions reporting#Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 28GHGP.29|GHG Protocol Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard]].&lt;ref name="ecometrica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/forms/PASs/PAS-2050 "PAS 2050:2011 Specification for the assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of goods and services"].

==Four main phases==
[[File:PhasesOfLifeCycleAnalysis.png|250px|right|thumb|Illustration of LCA phases]]

According to the ISO 14040&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14040 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Principles and framework, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; and 14044&lt;ref&gt;ISO 14044 (2006): Environmental management – Life cycle assessment – Requirements and guidelines, International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), Geneve&lt;/ref&gt; standards, a Life Cycle Assessment is carried out in four distinct phases as illustrated in the figure shown to the right. The phases are often interdependent in that the results of one phase will inform how other phases are completed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Goal and scope===

An LCA starts with an explicit statement of the goal and scope of the study, which sets out the context of the study and explains how and to whom the results are to be communicated. This is a key step and the ISO standards require that the goal and scope of an LCA be clearly defined and consistent with the intended application. The goal and scope document therefore includes technical details that guide subsequent work:
* '''the functional unit''', which defines what precisely is being studied and quantifies the service delivered by the product system, providing a reference to which the inputs and outputs can be related. Further, the functional unit is an important basis that enables alternative goods, or services, to be compared and analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Rebitzer, G. et al. (2004). Life cycle assessment
Part 1: Framework, goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, and applications. Environment International. 30(2004), 701-720.&lt;/ref&gt; So to explain this a functional system which is inputs, processes and outputs contains a functional unit, that fulfills a function, for example paint is covering a wall, making a functional unit of 1m² covered for 10 years. The functional flow would be the items necessary for that function, so this would be a brush, tin of paint and the paint itself. 
* '''the system boundaries'''; which are delimitations of which processes that should be included in the analysis of a product system.&lt;ref&gt;Finnveden, G., Hauschild, M.Z., Ekvall, T., Guinée, J., Heijungs, R., Hellweq, S., Koehler, A., Pennington, D. &amp; Suh, S. (2009). Recent developments in Life Cycle Assessment.
Journal of Environmental Management 91(1), 1-21. 
&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''any assumptions and limitations''';{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
* '''the allocation methods''' used to partition the environmental load of a process when several products or functions share the same process; allocation is commonly dealt with in one of three ways: system expansion, substitution and partition. Doing this is not easy and different methods may give different results{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

and
* '''the impact categories''' chosen for example human [[toxicity]], [[smog]], [[global warming]], [[eutrophication]].

===Life cycle inventory===
[[File:LCI Diagram.png|thumb|This is an example of a Life-cycle inventory (LCI) diagram]]

Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis involves creating an inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities that are going to be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The data must be related to the functional unit defined in the goal and scope definition. Data can be presented in tables and some interpretations can be made already at this stage. The results of the inventory is an LCI which provides information about all inputs and outputs in the form of elementary flow to and from the environment from all the unit processes involved in the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Inventory flows can number in the hundreds depending on the system boundary. For product LCAs at either the generic (i.e., representative industry averages) or brand-specific level, that data is typically collected through survey questionnaires. At an industry level, care has to be taken to ensure that questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of producers, leaning toward neither the best nor the worst, and fully representing any regional differences due to energy use, material sourcing or other factors. The questionnaires cover the full range of inputs and outputs, typically aiming to account for 99% of the mass of a product, 99% of the energy used in its production and any environmentally sensitive flows, even if they fall within the 1% level of inputs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

One area where data access is likely to be difficult is flows from the technosphere. The technosphere is more simply defined as the man-made world. Considered by geologists as secondary resources, these resources are in theory 100% recyclable; however, in a practical sense, the primary goal is salvage.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbach, V. and Wellmer, F. (May 2010). "Review: Consumption and Use of Non-Renewable Mineral and Energy Raw Materials from an Economic Geology Point of View." Sustainability. 2(5), pgs. 1408-1430. Retrieved from &lt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/5/1408&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For an LCI, these technosphere products (supply chain products) are those that have been produced by man and unfortunately those completing a questionnaire about a process which uses a man-made product as a means to an end will be unable to specify how much of a given input they use. Typically, they will not have access to data concerning inputs and outputs for previous production processes of the product. The entity undertaking the LCA must then turn to secondary sources if it does not already have that data from its own previous studies. National databases or data sets that come with LCA-practitioner tools, or that can be readily accessed, are the usual sources for that information. Care must then be taken to ensure that the secondary data source properly reflects regional or national conditions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===LCI Methods===
* Process LCA

===Life cycle impact assessment===

Inventory analysis is followed by impact assessment. This phase of LCA is aimed at evaluating the significance of potential environmental impacts based on the LCI flow results. Classical life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) consists of the following mandatory elements:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* selection of impact categories, category indicators, and characterization models;
* the classification stage, where the inventory parameters are sorted and assigned to specific impact categories; and
* impact measurement, where the categorized LCI flows are characterized, using one of many possible LCIA methodologies, into common equivalence units that are then summed to provide an overall impact category total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In many LCAs, characterization concludes the LCIA analysis; this is also the last compulsory stage according to ISO 14044:2006. However, in addition to the above mandatory LCIA steps, other optional LCIA elements – [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]], grouping, and weighting – may be conducted depending on the goal and scope of the LCA study. In normalization, the results of the impact categories from the study are usually compared with the total impacts in the region of interest, the U.S. for example. [[Grouped data|Grouping]] consists of sorting and possibly [[ranking]] the impact categories. During [[weighting]], the different environmental impacts are weighted relative to each other so that they can then be summed to get a single number for the total environmental impact. ISO 14044:2006 generally advises against weighting, stating that “weighting, shall not be used in LCA studies intended to be used in comparative assertions intended to be disclosed to the public”. This advice is often ignored, resulting in comparisons that can reflect a high degree of subjectivity as a result of weighting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Life cycle impacts can also be categorized under the several phases of the development, production, use, and disposal of a product. Broadly speaking, these impacts can be divided into "First Impacts,"&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Brian D. Future-Proof Building Materials: A Life Cycle Analysis. Intersections and Adjacencies. Proceedings of the 2015 Building Educators’ Society Conference, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT. Gines, Jacob, Carraher, Erin, and Galarze, Jose, editors. Pp. 123-130.&lt;/ref&gt; use impacts, and end of life impacts. "First Impacts" include extraction of raw materials, manufacturing (conversion of raw materials into a product), transportation of the product to a market or site, construction/installation, and the beginning of the use or occupancy. Use impacts include physical impacts of operating the product or facility (such as energy, water, etc.), maintenance, renovation and repairs (required to continue to use the product or facility). End of life impacts include demolition and processing of waste or recyclable materials.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Interpretation===

Life Cycle Interpretation is a systematic technique to identify, quantify, check, and evaluate information from the results of the life cycle inventory and/or the life cycle impact assessment. The results from the inventory analysis and impact assessment are summarized during the interpretation phase. The outcome of the interpretation phase is a set of conclusions and recommendations for the study. According to ISO 14040:2006, the interpretation should include:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* identification of significant issues based on the results of the LCI and LCIA phases of an LCA;
* evaluation of the study considering completeness, sensitivity and consistency checks; and
* conclusions, limitations and recommendations.

A key purpose of performing life cycle interpretation is to determine the level of confidence in the final results and communicate them in a fair, complete, and accurate manner. Interpreting the results of an LCA is not as simple as "3 is better than 2, therefore Alternative A is the best choice"! Interpreting the results of an LCA starts with understanding the accuracy of the results, and ensuring they meet the goal of the study. This is accomplished by identifying the data elements that contribute significantly to each impact category, [[Sensitivity analysis|evaluating the sensitivity]] of these significant data elements, assessing the completeness and consistency of the study, and drawing conclusions and recommendations based on a clear understanding of how the LCA was conducted and the results were developed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

More specifically, the best alternative is the one that the LCA shows to have the least cradle-to-grave environmental negative impact on land, sea, and air resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curran |first=Mary Ann |title=Life Cycle Analysis: Principles and Practice |url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |publisher=Scientific Applications International Corporation |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018024516/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/chapter1_frontmatter_lca101.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LCA uses==

Based on a survey of LCA practitioners carried out in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cooper | first = J.S. | last2 = Fava | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Life Cycle Assessment Practitioner Survey: Summary of Results

LCA is mostly used to support business strategy (18%) and R&amp;D (18%), as input to product or process design (15%), in education (13%) and for labeling or product declarations (11%). LCA will be continuously integrated into the built environment as tools such as the European ENSLIC Building project guidelines for buildings or developed and implemented, which provide practitioners guidance on methods to implement LCI data into the planning and design process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmqvist|first=T|last2=Glaumann|first2=M| last3= Scarpellini|first3=S|last4=Zabalza|first4=I|last5=Aranda|first5=A|title=Life cycle assessment in buildings: The ENSLIC simplified method and guidelines|journal=Energy|date=April 2011|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1900–1907|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544210001453|accessdate=31 October 2012|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major corporations all over the world are either undertaking LCA in house or commissioning studies, while governments support the development of national databases to support LCA. Of particular note is the growing use of LCA for ISO Type III labels called Environmental Product Declarations, defined as "quantified environmental data for a product with pre-set categories of parameters based on the ISO 14040 series of standards, but not excluding additional environmental information".&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenstandard.org/EPD_System.html EPD_System] – '''www.thegreenstandard.org'''&lt;/ref&gt; These third-party certified LCA-based labels provide an increasingly important basis for assessing the relative environmental merits of competing products. Third-party certification plays a major role in today's industry. Independent certification can show a company's dedication to safer and environmental friendlier products to customers and NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

LCA also has major roles in [[environmental impact assessment]], integrated [[waste management]] and pollution studies. A recent study evaluated the LCA of a laboratory scale plant for oxygen enriched air production coupled with its economic evaluation in an holistic eco-design standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galli|first=F|last2=Pirola|first2=C| last3= Previtali|first3=D|last4=Manenti|first4=F|last5=Bianchi|first5=C|title=Eco design LCA of an innovative lab scale plant for the production of oxygen-enriched air.

==Data analysis==

A life cycle analysis is only as valid as its [[data]]; therefore, it is crucial that data used for the completion of a life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, it is crucial that equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Scientific Applications International Corporation |title=Life cycle assessment: principles and practice |page=88 |date=May 2006 |url=http://www.epa.gov/NRMRL/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf 
 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123001105/http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lcaccess/pdfs/600r06060.pdf |archivedate=23 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic types of LCA data – unit process data and environmental input-output data (EIO), where the latter is based on national economic input-output data.&lt;ref name=greet/&gt; Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest, carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data validity is an ongoing concern for life cycle analyses. Due to [[globalization]] and the rapid pace of [[research and development]], new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected, data validity is not a problem. However, [[consumer electronics]] such as [[cell phones]] can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29258026/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/planned-obsolescence-cell-phone-models/|title=Planned obsolescence: cell phone models | author= Suzanne Choney|date=24 February 2009|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a need for ongoing data collection.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The life cycle considered usually consists of a number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or [[manufacturing cost]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Data sources are typically large databases, it is not appropriate to compare two options if different data sources have been used to source the data.

Calculations for impact can then be done by hand, but it is more usual to streamline the process by using software. This can range from a simple spreadsheet, where the user enters the data manually to a fully automated program, where the user is not aware of the source data.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Variants==

===Cradle-to-grave===

Cradle-to-grave is the full Life Cycle Assessment from resource extraction ('cradle') to use phase and disposal phase ('grave'). For example, trees produce paper, which can be recycled into low-energy production [[cellulose]] (fiberised paper) [[Building insulation|insulation]], then used as an energy-saving device in the ceiling of a home for 40 years, saving 2,000 times the [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy used in its production. After 40 years the [[cellulose]] fibers are replaced and the old fibers are disposed of, possibly incinerated. All inputs and outputs are considered for all the phases of the life cycle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Cradle-to-gate===

Cradle-to-gate is an assessment of a ''partial'' product life cycle from resource extraction (''cradle'') to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for [[environmental product declarations]] (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environdec.com/pageId.asp?id=301&amp;menu=2,2,26 EPD-The Green Yardstick]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin Associates, A Division of Eastern Research Group|title=Cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|publisher=The Plastics Division of the American Chemistry Council|accessdate=31 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206012658/http://www51.honeywell.com/sm/chemicals/enovate/common/documents/FP_Enovate_July_2010_Report_by_the_American_Chemistry_Council_Manual.pdf|archivedate=6 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cradle-to-cradle or closed loop production===
{{see also|Cradle to Cradle Design}}

Cradle-to-cradle is a specific kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a [[recycling]] process. It is a method used to minimize the environmental impact of products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development.&lt;ref&gt;"Cradle-to-cradle definition." Ecomii. 19 October 2010. Web. &lt;http://www.ecomii.com/ecopedia/cradle-to-cradle&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Allocation of burden for products in open loop production systems presents considerable challenges for LCA. Various methods, such as the [[avoided burden]] approach have been proposed to deal with the issues involved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Gate-to-gate===

Gate-to-gate is a partial LCA looking at only one value-added process in the entire production chain. Gate-to-gate modules may also later be linked in their appropriate production chain to form a complete cradle-to-gate evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Jiménez-González, C.; Kim, S.; Overcash, M. Methodology for developing gate-to-gate Life cycle inventory information. The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 2000, 5, 153–159.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Well-to-wheel===

Well-to-wheel is the specific LCA used for [[transport]] [[fuel]]s and vehicles. The analysis is often broken down into stages entitled "well-to-station", or "well-to-tank", and "station-to-wheel" or "tank-to-wheel", or "plug-to-wheel". The first stage, which incorporates the feedstock or fuel production and processing and fuel delivery or energy transmission, and is called the "upstream" stage, while the stage that deals with vehicle operation itself is sometimes called the "downstream" stage. The well-to-wheel analysis is commonly used to assess total energy consumption, or the [[energy conversion efficiency]] and [[Exhaust gas|emission]]s impact of [[marine vessel]]s, [[aircraft]] and [[motor vehicle]]s, including their [[carbon footprint]], and the fuels used in each of these transport modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/339.pdf|title=Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced Fuel/Vehicle Systems — A North American Study of Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Criteria Pollutant Emissions|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|first1=Norman|last1= Brinkman|first2=Michael|last2=Wang|first3=Trudy |last3= Weber|first4=Thomas|last4=Darlington|date=May 2005|accessdate=28 February 2011}} ''See EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – ES.1 Background, pp1''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VDI&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Electrification - Quo Vadis|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233987248_Vehicle_Electrification_-_Quo_Vadis__Fahrzeugelektrifizierung_-_Quo_Vadis | last1=Brinkman| first1=Norman| first2=Ulrich| last2=Eberle|first3=Volker|last3=Formanski|first4=Uwe-Dieter|last4=Grebe|first5=Roland|last5=Matthe|publisher=[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] |date=15 April 2012| accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-600-2007-004/CEC-600-2007-004-REV.PDF|title=Full Fuel Cycle Assessment: Well-To-Wheels Energy Inputs, Emissions, and Water Impacts|publisher=California Energy Commission|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |title=Green Car Glossary: Well to wheel |publisher=[[Car Magazine]] |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504030517/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Green-car-landing-page/Green-car-glossary/ |archivedate= 4 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; WtW analysis is useful for reflecting the different efficiencies and emissions of energy technologies and fuels at both the upstream and downstream stages, giving a more complete picture of real emissions.

The well-to-wheel variant has a significant input on a model developed by the [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model was developed to evaluate the impacts of new fuels and vehicle technologies. The model evaluates the impacts of fuel use using a well-to-wheel evaluation while a traditional cradle-to-grave approach is used to determine the impacts from the vehicle itself. The model reports energy use, [[greenhouse gas emission]]s, and six additional pollutants: [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[nitrogen oxide]] (NOx), [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] with size smaller than 10 micrometre (PM10), particulate matter with size smaller than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5), and [[sulfur oxide]]s (SOx).&lt;ref name=greet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greet.es.anl.gov/|title=How Does GREET Work?|publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]]|date=3 September 2010|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative values of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a [[Battery Electric Vehicle]] in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) finds out that an electric vehicle can save the 50-60% of GHG &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles | journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment | doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while an hybrid LCA-WTW method, considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emission savings 10-13% lower, compared to the WTW. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4.|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic input–output life cycle assessment===

Economic input–output LCA ([[EIOLCA]]) involves use of aggregate sector-level data on how much environmental impact can be attributed to each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, C. T., Lave, L. B., and Matthews, H. S. (2005). ''Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Goods and Services: An Input–Output Approach'', Resources for the Future Press {{ISBN|1-933115-24-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages that may or may not be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiolca.net/Method/Limitations.html Limitations of the EIO-LCA Method and Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecologically based LCA===

While a conventional LCA uses many of the same approaches and strategies as an Eco-LCA, the latter considers a much broader range of ecological impacts. It was designed to provide a guide to wise management of human activities by understanding the direct and indirect impacts on ecological resources and surrounding ecosystems. Developed by Ohio State University Center for resilience, Eco-LCA is a methodology that quantitatively takes into account regulating and supporting services during the life cycle of economic goods and products. In this approach services are categorized in four main groups: supporting, regulating, provisioning and cultural services.&lt;ref name=Singh&amp;baksshi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Singh |author2=B.

concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported
and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Life cycle energy analysis==

Life cycle energy analysis (LCEA) is an approach in which all [[energy]] inputs to a product are accounted for, not only direct energy inputs during manufacture, but also all energy inputs needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was ''energy analysis''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

With LCEA, the ''total life cycle energy input'' is established.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Energy production===
{{see|energy production}}
It is recognized that much energy is lost in the production of energy commodities themselves, such as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[photovoltaic]]
[[electricity]] or high-quality [[petroleum products]]. ''Net energy content'' is the energy content of the product minus energy input used
during extraction and [[energy conversion|conversion]], directly or indirectly. A controversial early result of LCEA claimed that manufacturing
[[solar cell]]s requires more energy than can be recovered in using the solar cell {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. The result was refuted.&lt;ref&gt;David MacKay [http://www.withouthotair.com/ Sustainable Energy] 24 February 2010 p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
Another new concept that flows from life cycle assessments is [[Energy Cannibalism]]. Energy Cannibalism refers to an effect where rapid
growth of an entire energy-intensive industry creates a need for [[energy]] that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power
plants. Thus during rapid growth the industry as a whole produces no energy because new energy is used to fuel the [[embodied energy]] of
future power plants. Work has been undertaken in the UK to determine the life cycle energy (alongside full LCA) impacts of a number of renewable technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McManus, M |title=Life cycle impacts of waste wood biomass heating systems: A case study of three UK based systems|journal= Energy |volume =35|issue =10|year=2010|pages =4064–4070|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.06.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, S.R., G.P.

===Energy recovery===
{{see|energy recovery}}
If materials are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed and used for [[electricity production]]. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with [[coal]] and natural gas&lt;ref&gt;Damgaard, A, et al. ''Life-cycle-assessment of the historical development of air pollution control and energy recovery in waste incineration.'' Waste Management 30 (2010) 1244–1250.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[incineration]] produces more [[greenhouse gas]] emissions than [[landfilling]], the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from landfilling (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when [[landfill gas]] is recovered for electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;Liamsanguan, C., Gheewala, S.H., ''LCA: A decision support tool for environmental assessment of MSW management systems.'' Jour. of Environ. Mgmt. 87 (2009) 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and that it should not be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} For example, simple energy analysis does not take into account the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hammond | first = Geoffrey P. | title = Engineering sustainability: thermodynamics, energy systems, and the environment | journal = [[International Journal of Energy Research]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 613–639 | year = 2004 | url = http://www.etcs.ipfw.edu/~mueller/me427/Engineering_sustainability.pdf| doi = 10.1002/er.988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Incorporating '''Dynamic LCAs''' of renewable energy technologies (using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pehnt | first = Martin | title = Dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable energy technologies | journal = Renewable Energy: an International Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–71 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the literature on life cycle assessment of [[energy technology]] has begun to reflect the interactions between the current [[electrical grid]] and future [[energy technology]]. Some papers have focused on [[energy]] life cycle,&lt;ref name="Pearce2"&gt;J.M. Pearce, [http://me.queensu.ca/people/pearce/publications/documents/asp3.pdf "Optimizing Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Strategies to Suppress Energy Cannibalism"] 2nd Climate Change Technology Conference Proceedings, p. 48, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joshua M.

If this is not done, a given class of [[energy technology]] may emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over its lifetime than it mitigates.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A problem the energy analysis method cannot resolve is that different energy forms ([[heat]], [[electricity]], [[chemical energy]] etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, as a consequence of the two main laws of [[thermodynamics]]. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is [[exergy]]. According to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the [[second law of thermodynamics|second law]] diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The conflict is resolved in one of these ways:
* value difference between energy inputs is ignored,
* a value ratio is arbitrarily assigned (e.g., a [[joule]] of [[electricity]] is 2.6 times more valuable than a joule of heat or fuel input),
* the analysis is supplemented by economic (monetary) cost analysis,
* [[exergy]] instead of energy can be the metric used for the life cycle analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cornelissen | first = Reinerus Louwrentius | title = Thermodynamics and sustainable development; the use of exergy analysis and the reduction of irreversibility | year = 1997|work=Thesis, University of Twente, Netherlands | url = http://doc.utwente.nl/32030/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

Life cycle assessment is a powerful tool for analyzing [[wikt:commensurable|commensurable]] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the [[boundary critique]] to [[systems thinking]]. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on [[average]]s, [[Sampling error|unrepresentative sampling]], or outdated results.&lt;ref&gt;Malin, Nadav, [http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2002/3/1/Life-Cycle-Assessment-for-Buildings-Seeking-the-Holy-Grail/?&amp;printable=yes Life-cycle assessment for buildings: Seeking the Holy Grail.] Building Green, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Gaines and Frank Stodolsky [http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/TA/104.pdf Life-Cycle Analysis: Uses and Pitfalls]. Argonne National Laboratory. Transportation Technology R&amp;D Center&lt;/ref&gt; There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a lot of room for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Streamline LCA===

This process includes three steps.
First, a proper method should be selected to combine adequate accuracy with acceptable cost burden in order to guide decision making. Actually, in LCA process, besides streamline LCA, Eco-screening and complete LCA are usually considered as well. However, the former one only could provide limited details and the latter one with more detailed information is more expensive.
Second, single measure of stress should be selected. Typical LCA output includes [[resource consumption]], energy consumption, water consumption, emission of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], toxic residues and so on. One of these outputs is used as the main factor to measure in streamline LCA. Energy consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission are often regarded as “practical indicators”.
Last, stress selected in step 2 is used as standard to assess phase of life separately and identify the most damaging phase. For instance, for a family car, energy consumption could be used as the single stress factor to assess each phase of life. The result shows that the most energy intensive phase for a family car is the usage stage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The '''Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination''' (MCAD) is the primary agency for [[civil rights]] [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], outreach, and training in the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]. Following the recommendation of a 1944 committee appointed by [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Maurice Tobin]] to establish a commission to enforce laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religious creed, national origin, or ancestry, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] created the Fair Employment Practices Commission in 1946. The Commission took 96 complaints, conducted 60 interviews, and handled 500 phone inquiries in its first year alone.&lt;ref name="MCAD history"/&gt; The name was changed to the current name in 1950 to reflect the expansion of its jurisdiction and power from employment to housing and public accommodations.&lt;ref name="MCAD history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/mcad/history.html |title=The History of MCAD |accessdate=2008-08-12 |publisher=Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===

New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes.

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything.

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|The [[metric expansion of space]]. The [[inflationary epoch]] is the expansion of the [[metric tensor]] at left.]]

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M. Churchland |authorlink=Paul Churchland |title=A Neurocomputational Perspective: The Nature of Mind and the Structure of Science |publisher=MIT Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0262531061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daniel Clement Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Consciousness Explained |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |date=1991 |isbn=978-0316180665|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]]. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, [[parapsychologist]]s have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.&lt;ref name="Akers"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Akers, C. |title=Methodological Criticisms of Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 4 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1986 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104093732/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances4rape/7_Methodological_Criticisms.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Child, I.L. |title=Criticism in Experimental Parapsychology, Advances in Parapsychological Research 5 |publisher=PesquisaPSI |date=1987 |url=http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223410/http://www.pesquisapsi.com/books/advances5/6_Criticism_in_Experimental.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiseman |first=Richard |author2=Smith, Matthew |display-authors=etal |title=Exploring possible sender-to-experimenter acoustic leakage in the PRL autoganzfeld experiments – Psychophysical Research Laboratories |journal=The Journal of Parapsychology |date=1996 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709230555/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2320/is_n2_v60/ai_18960809 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lobach |first=E. |author2=Bierman, D. |title=The Invisible Gaze: Three Attempts to Replicate Sheldrake's Staring Effects |work=Proceedings of the 47th PA Convention |url=http://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |date=2004 |pages=77–90 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810173433/https://www.parapsych.org/papers/07.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life]. Webpages.uidaho.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism====
{{Main article|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====
{{Further information|Secular Humanism}}
[[File:HumanismSymbol.PNG|left|thumb|The "[[Happy Human]]" symbol representing [[Secular Humanism]].]]

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). "Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?" (Chapter 4). In E. Morscher, ed., ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McNaughton |first=David |date=August 1988 |title=Moral Vision: An Introduction to Ethics |chapter=Section 1.5: Moral Freedom and the Meaning of Life |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0631159452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[logical positivists]] said:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} "Expressed in language, the question is meaningless"; because, ''in'' life the statement the "meaning of x", usually denotes the ''consequences'' of x, or the ''significance'' of x, or ''what is notable'' about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals "x", in the statement the "meaning of x", the statement becomes [[recursion|recursive]], and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144956/http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.

&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bahá'í Faith====
[[File:Ringstone.svg|thumb|The [[Bahá'í symbols#Ringstone symbol|Ringstone symbol]] represents humanity's connection to God]]

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] emphasizes the unity of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |date=2007 |title="Bahaism." The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the [[Manifestation of God|prophets]] were sent by God to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |date=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |pages=325–328 |isbn=978-1851681846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed Bahá'í perspective, see {{cite web |title={{-'}}The Purpose of Life' Bahá'í Topics An Information Resource of the Bahá'í International Community |url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829233333/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |archive-date=29 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism'', Menachem Kellner, Littman Library; particularly the parable of the King's Palace in divine worship, in the [[Guide for the Perplexed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |date=2003 |isbn=978-0415236614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0826408020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world to come,&lt;ref name="Shuchat"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |date=2006 |isbn=978-1932687316}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randolph L. Braham |title=Contemporary Views on the Holocaust |publisher=Springer |date=1983 |isbn=978-0898381412}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simeon the Just|Simeon the Righteous]] says, "the world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness." The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality]. Bc.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name="weightman"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |date=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=978-0140514803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |date=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1421265311 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=978-1421265315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s ''All is Vanity,'' an example of ''[[vanitas]],'' depicts a young [[woman]] amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the [[mirror]] of her [[lowboy|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baggini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeffeth"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Glenn Yeffeth |title=The Anthology at the End of the Universe: Leading Science Fiction Authors on Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |publisher= BenBella Books, Inc |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932100563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Badke"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William B.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it. Six by nine… forty-two! I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===To love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living===
* To love more.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To love those who mean the most. Every life you touch will touch you back.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To treasure every enjoyable sensation one has.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To seek [[beauty]] in all its forms.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To have fun or enjoy life.&lt;ref name="Cappannelli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan &amp; Pace" /&gt;
* To seek pleasure&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt; and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book |author=T.W. Mitchell |title=Problems in Psychopathology |publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; company, inc. |date=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To be compassionate.&lt;ref name="Cook" /&gt;
* To be moved by the tears and pain of others, and try to help them out of love and compassion.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To love others as best we possibly can.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* To eat, drink, and be merry.&lt;ref name="Ecclesiastes8:15"&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ecclesiastes|8|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* Life has no meaning, but as humans we try to associate a meaning or purpose so we can justify our existence.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Advisory Office of The President on UN Affairs (SAOP UN-Affairs) has established in early 2017 at the office of The President as policy and advisory body. The SAOP UN-Affairs worked on One UN for Afghanistan, a strategic framework that has replaced The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Afghanistan. The advisory also successfully drafted a mutual accountability framework between the government of Afghanistan and the United Nations. The One UN or Delivering As One (DAO) was one of the most challenging task for the UN family and the Afghan government, but the SAOP was able to do it successfully.

Hamdam said that corruption is the biggest problem, which feeds insecurity in Afghanistan as well as the insurgency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncaccoalition.org/learn-more/articles/199-an-open-letter-to-president-karzai-and-president-obama |title=An Open Letter to President Karzai and President Obama |publisher=UNCAC Coalition |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130828134802/http://www.uncaccoalition.org/learn-more/articles/199-an-open-letter-to-president-karzai-and-president-obama |archivedate=2013-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; poppy cultivation, drug processing and drug trafficking. He formed the biggest ever group of volunteer social activists from across Afghanistan

to fight corruption, the most dangerous and toughest job in one of the most [[Corruption in Afghanistan|corrupt]] and unstable country in the world. Through peaceful demonstration and protests such a 5&amp;nbsp;km countrywide race against corruption, he mobilized thousands of citizens to pressure the government for reform, through 5&amp;nbsp;km race against corruption. He has also mobilized youth, students and women to take part in the fight against corruption. He is an outspoken activist, who has disclosed cases of senior corrupt official and he has advocated for the trail and persecution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.khaama.com/aacn-statement-about-the-governments-recent-actions-against-corruption-741|title = AACN Statement about the Government's Recent Actions Against Corruption|publisher = Khaama Press (KP)|date = |accessdate = 2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cabinet members and senior politicians. Hamdam exposed land garbing, corruption of senior government officials and cabinet members. He has advocated for election transparency and reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sismec.org/2014/05/15/afghan-election-fraud-who-is-responsible/|title = Afghan Election Fraud–Who is Responsible?|date = |accessdate = |website = SISMEC|publisher = SISMEC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also played a key role in exposing Kabul Bank corruption, where near on billion USD was looted in corruption and resulted in the collapse of the bank.

Hamdam was a critic of Karzai government for not taking firm steps to fight corruptions. In his interview with the CBS TV he said that corruption starts from the street and goes to the palace and he called Karzai's government the most corrupt government ever. He has repeatedly called and pressured Afghan government for fighting corruption and he looks at corruption as a major problem for the country.

== Afghanistan's affairs ==
[[File:Dr. Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam During a Conference on Afghanistan in Brussels.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam at the [[Security &amp; Defence Agenda]] Conference in Brussels 2013]]

Hamdam is closely following Afghanistan and regional countries developments. Following Afghanistan's affairs as an observer, He has attended [[International Conference on Afghanistan, The Hague (2009)|International Conference on Afghanistan, The Hague]] 2009 in Netherlands, [[2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit|NATO 60 Summit]] in Strasburg and Kehl, France in 2009, Kabul International conference in 2010, [[2010 Lisbon summit|NATO Summit in Lisbon]] Portugal in 2010, [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2011)|2nd International Bonn Conference]] about Afghanistan, the NATO Chicago Summit in 2011  and tens of other national and international conferences on Afghanistan. As an observer he observed Afghanistan presidential elections in 2004 and 2009, Afghan parliamentary and [[provincial elections]] in 2005 and Traditional Loya Jirga on the Afghanistan and the U.S. Strategic Partnership Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.khaama.com/afghanistan-is-not-alone-by-shafiq-hamdam-29612|title = Afghanistan is note alone|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Khamma Press|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocating for a closer relationship with the western allies, Hamdam played a key role in signing the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) between Afghanistan and US. Among other Afghan leaders and activists, he also signed the letter to president Obama advocating for the BSA and the letter said: We strongly echo the endorsement of the Bilateral Security Agreement last month at the ''Loya Jirga ''and reiterate that the agreement should be signed without delay. Our voice reflects a growing chorus from all segments of the Afghan society, including our religious and business community leaders, who remain concerned about the future of our country and wish to see the expeditious finalization of the BSA.
[[File:Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam Help IDPs.jpg|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam during the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the needy family of internally displaced people in Afghanistan.]]
Representing Afghanistan in the European parliament, he advocates for accountability, transparency and fighting corruption. He urged leaderships of European Union, European Parliament and European Commission to support Afghans in the fight against corruption. He wrote in one of his articles to EU leaders: Afghanistan alone cannot reach its goal of reducing corruption; it requires the support of the international community. Without delay, serious actions should be taken to eliminate the problem. These actions should include empowering civil society organizations and the media to play a bigger role in the fight against corruption. If Afghanistan is to qualify for aid over the coming years, seriousness, strong commitment, political determination, and practical decisions will be needed in order to implement the laws and strategies required to overcome the problem of corruption in Afghanistan.

Hamdam was often criticized for his pro-western opinions by some Afghan politicians and through some anti-western figures. He is seen as a pro-west. As a Senior NATO Public Diplomacy Adviser, he has often defended NATO policies and by extremist he is seen as a NATO-backed activist. Hamdam has defended in many occasions NATO's position and he has advocated for Afghanistan to become a NATO member. He was widely criticized by Muslim extremists and regional actors for his article, where he clearly stated that Afghanistan should be a NATO member. After completion of ISAF mission, he advised in one of his articles that "Afghan government and NATO should be able to enter a new, comprehensive, closer, stronger and mutual relationship. It should be based on mutual commitment and long-term cooperation with full respect to the sovereignty of Afghanistan. The relation which can possibly make Afghanistan a NATO member country in the future."  While some analyst called the ISAF mission as a failure, but Hamdam called that a historic and major success.

[[File:Dr. Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam and Senior U.S Senator Lindsey Graham.JPG|thumb|Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam with US Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] ]]
He writes for ''The Huffington Post''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mohammad-shafiq-hamdam/s|title = Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam's Biography|date = 2016-02-22|access-date = 2016-02-22|website = Mohammad Shafiq Hamdam Blog|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Mohammad Shafiq|first = Hamdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many leading Afghan papers and journals on political, security and foreign affairs. Talking about the corruption related issues and Afghanistan's affairs he has been appearing in numbers of national and International media outlets, such as Tolo TV, Ariana TV, RFE/RL, BBC, CBS, AFP, ARD, VOA, TRT TV, Aljazeera TV, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and other key national and international media outlets.

He is optimistic about Afghanistan. After the end of one decade ISAF mission in Afghanistan, he wrote on the Open Think Thank on Foreign Policy that Afghanistan of 2001 is not comparable with the Afghanistan of 2015. With 352,000 strong Afghan National Security Forces, backed by the US and NATO, an increasingly vibrant civil society sector, and a large youth population, Afghans are hopeful that their country will never return to the dark era. For this to remain effective, Afghanistan and its partners must continue to broaden those achievements over the next decade, ushering in a new era of transformation.

Hamdam looks at democracy as a new phenomenon in Afghanistan and emphasizes on reform and fighting corruption. He wrote in Unipath is a professional military magazine published quarterly by the Commander of the United States Central Command as an international forum for military personnel in the Middle East and Central Asia region:  Governments and institutions work differently in democratic societies. So it's not only fighting terrorism and extremists, but good governance that is a key priority for Afghanistan. Weak rule of law and the existence of "impunity circles" and safe havens for corrupt individuals and officials in Afghanistan and abroad have contributed to violations of human rights and injustice.

He believes that the Afghan and US government were not able to define their relationship during more than a decade. Hamdam wrote in his opinion editorial, ''A Decade of Relations Without Definition'', that the Afghan-U.S. relationship should not be only based on dying and killing for each other, but it should be based on social, economic and political interests as well. Numerous opportunities already exist to build that long-term and stable relationship. At the moment, some Afghans see the presence of the U.S. in Afghanistan as a world policing and a force against Al-Qaeda and Taliban. What if there are no more Taliban and war in Afghanistan? How will the U.S. and Afghan government justify their relations? Should this relationship remain merely a donor-recipient exchange, a relationship only to finance, train and advise Afghan National Security Forces? These questions are urgent. The two countries must, through inclusive dialogue, define their relationship and must reach for a vision beyond a militarized association.

'''Multiple-criteria decision-making''' ('''MCDM''') or '''multiple-criteria decision analysis''' ('''MCDA''') is a sub-discipline of [[operations research]] that explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in [[decision making]] (both in daily life and in settings such as business, government and medicine).  Conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options: [[cost]] or price is usually one of the main criteria, and some measure of quality is typically another criterion, easily in conflict with the cost.  In purchasing a car, cost, comfort, safety, and fuel economy may be some of the main criteria we consider – it is unusual that the cheapest car is the most comfortable and the safest one.  In [[Investment management|portfolio management]], we are interested in getting high returns but at the same time reducing our risks, but the stocks that have the potential of bringing high returns typically also carry high risks of losing money.  In a service industry, customer satisfaction and the cost of providing service are fundamental conflicting criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Madurika, HKGM, &amp; Hemakumara, GPTS. (2015).

International Journal of Scientific &amp; Technology Research, 4(8), 96-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In our daily lives, we usually weigh multiple criteria implicitly and we may be comfortable with the consequences of such decisions that are made based on only [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rew, L.| year=1988| title=Intuition in Decision‐making| journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship| volume=20| number=3| pp=150-154| doi=10.1111/j.1547-5069.1988.tb00056.x| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, when stakes are high, it is important to properly structure the problem and explicitly evaluate multiple criteria.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In making the decision of whether to build a nuclear power plant or not, and where to build it, there are not only very complex issues involving multiple criteria, but there are also multiple parties who are deeply affected by the consequences.

Structuring complex problems well and considering multiple criteria explicitly leads to more informed and better decisions.  There have been important advances in this field since the start of the modern multiple-criteria decision-making discipline in the early 1960s.

==Foundations, concepts, definitions==

MCDM or MCDA are well-known acronyms for ''multiple-criteria decision-making'' and ''multiple-criteria decision analysis''; Stanley Zionts helped popularizing the acronym with his 1979 article "MCDM – If not a Roman Numeral, then What?", intended for an entrepreneurial audience. 

MCDM is concerned with structuring and solving decision and planning problems involving multiple criteria. The purpose is to support decision-makers facing such problems. Typically, there does not exist a unique [[optimum|optimal]] solution for such problems and it is necessary to use decision-maker's preferences to differentiate between solutions.

"Solving" can be interpreted in different ways. It could correspond to choosing the "best" alternative from a set of available alternatives (where "best" can be interpreted as "the most preferred alternative" of a decision-maker).  Another interpretation of "solving" could be choosing a small set of good alternatives, or grouping alternatives into different preference sets. An extreme interpretation could be to find all "efficient" or "[[nondominated]]" alternatives (which we will define shortly).
	
The difficulty of the problem originates from the presence of more than one criterion. There is no longer a unique optimal solution to an MCDM problem that can be obtained without incorporating preference information. The concept of an optimal solution is often replaced by the set of nondominated solutions. A nondominated solution has the property that it is not possible to move away from it to any other solution without sacrificing in at least one criterion.  Therefore, it makes sense for the decision-maker to choose a solution from the nondominated set. Otherwise, she/he could do better in terms of some or all of the criteria, and not do worse in any of them. Generally, however, the set of nondominated solutions is too large to be presented to the decision-maker for the final choice. Hence we need tools that help the decision-maker focus on the preferred solutions (or alternatives). Normally one has to "tradeoff" certain criteria for others.

MCDM has been an active area of research since the 1970s. There are several MCDM-related organizations including the International Society on Multi-criteria Decision Making,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdmsociety.org/|title=Multiple Criteria Decision Making - International Society on MCDM|author=|date=|website=www.mcdmsociety.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003052248/http://www.mcdmsociety.org/|archivedate=3 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euro Working Group on MCDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/ewgmcda/|title=Welcome to EWG-MCDA website|author=|date=|website=www.cs.put.poznan.pl|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007035425/http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/ewgmcda/|archivedate=7 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and INFORMS Section on MCDM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informs.org/Community/MCDM/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811111549/http://www.informs.org/Community/MCDM |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a history see: Köksalan, Wallenius and Zionts (2011).&lt;ref name="Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Köksalan, M., Wallenius, J., and Zionts, S.|title=Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MCDM draws upon knowledge in many fields including:

* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Decision analysis]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[Computer technology]]
* [[Software engineering]]
* [[Information systems]]

===A typology===

There are different classifications of MCDM problems and methods.  A major distinction between MCDM problems is based on whether the solutions are explicitly or implicitly defined.

* ''Multiple-criteria evaluation problems'': These problems consist of a finite number of alternatives, explicitly known in the beginning of the solution process.  Each alternative is represented by its performance in multiple criteria.  The problem may be defined as finding the best alternative for a decision-maker (DM), or finding a set of good alternatives.  One may also be interested in "sorting" or "classifying" alternatives.  Sorting refers to placing alternatives in a set of preference-ordered classes (such as assigning credit-ratings to countries), and classifying refers to assigning alternatives to non-ordered sets (such as diagnosing patients based on their symptoms). Some of the MCDM methods in this category have been studied in a comparative manner in the book by Triantaphyllou on this subject, 2000.&lt;ref name='MCDMbook'&gt;{{cite book | last = Triantaphyllou | first = E. | title = Multi-Criteria Decision Making:  A Comparative Study | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers (now Springer) | year = 2000 | location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands | page = 320 | url = http://www.csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-7923-6607-7 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022632/http://csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm | archivedate = 24 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Multiple-criteria design problems (multiple objective mathematical programming problems)'':  In these problems, the alternatives are not explicitly known. An alternative (solution) can be found by solving a mathematical model.  The number of alternatives is either infinite and not countable (when some variables are continuous) or typically very large if countable (when all variables are discrete).

Whether it is an evaluation problem or a design problem, preference information of DMs is required in order to differentiate between solutions.  The solution methods for MCDM problems are commonly classified based on the timing of preference information obtained from the DM.

There are methods that require the DM's preference information at the start of the process, transforming the problem into essentially a single criterion problem.  These methods are said to operate by "prior articulation of preferences".  Methods based on estimating a value function or using the concept of "outranking relations", analytical hierarchy process, and some decision rule-based methods try to solve multiple criteria evaluation problems utilizing prior articulation of preferences.  Similarly, there are methods developed to solve multiple-criteria design problems using prior articulation of preferences by constructing a value function.  Perhaps the most well-known of these methods is goal programming.  Once the value function is constructed, the resulting single objective mathematical program is solved to obtain a preferred solution.

Some methods require preference information from the DM throughout the solution process.  These are referred to as interactive methods or methods that require "progressive articulation of preferences". These methods have been well-developed for both the multiple criteria evaluation (see for example Geoffrion, Dyer and Feinberg, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;An Interactive Approach for Multi-Criterion Optimization, with an Application to the Operation of an Academic Department,

Multiple-criteria design problems typically require the solution of a series of mathematical programming models in order to reveal implicitly defined solutions.  For these problems, a representation or approximation of "efficient solutions" may also be of interest.  This category is referred to as "posterior articulation of preferences", implying that the DM's involvement starts posterior to the explicit revelation of "interesting" solutions (see for example Karasakal and Köksalan, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karasakal, E. K. and Köksalan, M.|title=Generating a Representative Subset of the Efficient Frontier in Multiple Criteria Decision Making|journal=Operations Research|year=2009|volume=57|pages=187–199|doi=10.1287/opre.1080.0581|first1=E.|last2=Koksalan|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

When the mathematical programming models contain integer variables, the design problems become harder to solve.  Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) constitutes a special category of such problems posing substantial computational difficulty (see Ehrgott and Gandibleux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ehrgott, M.  |author2=Gandibleux, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization|year=2002|series=Multiple Criteria Optimization, State of the Art Annotated Bibliographic Surveys|pages=369–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002, for a review).

===Representations and definitions===

The MCDM problem can be represented in the criterion space or the decision space.  Alternatively, if different criteria are combined by a weighted linear function, it is also possible to represent the problem in the weight space.  Below are the demonstrations of the criterion and weight spaces as well as some formal definitions.

====Criterion space representation====

Let us assume that we evaluate solutions in a specific problem situation using several criteria.  Let us further assume that more is better in each criterion.  Then, among all possible solutions, we are ideally interested in those solutions that perform well in all considered criteria.  However, it is unlikely to have a single solution that performs well in all considered criteria.  Typically, some solutions perform well in some criteria and some perform well in others.  Finding a way of trading off between criteria is one of the main endeavors in the MCDM literature.

Mathematically, the MCDM problem corresponding to the above arguments can be represented as

::{{math|"max" &lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

:: subject to

:::{{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}}

where {{math|'''q'''}} is the vector of ''k'' criterion functions (objective functions) and {{math|'''Q'''}} is the feasible set, {{math|'''Q''' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

If {{math|'''Q'''}} is defined explicitly (by a set of alternatives), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria evaluation problem.

If {{math|'''Q'''}} is defined implicitly (by a set of constraints), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria design problem.

The quotation marks are used to indicate that the maximization of a vector is not a well-defined mathematical operation.  This corresponds to the argument that we will have to find a way to resolve the trade-off between criteria (typically based on the preferences of a decision maker) when a solution that performs well in all criteria does not exist.

====Decision space representation====

The decision space corresponds to the set of possible decisions that are available to us.  The criteria values will be consequences of the decisions we make.  Hence, we can define a corresponding problem in the decision space.  For example, in designing a product, we decide on the design parameters (decision variables) each of which affects the performance measures (criteria) with which we evaluate our product.

Mathematically, a multiple-criteria design problem can be represented in the decision space as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\max q &amp; = f(x) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \\
\text{subject to} \\
q\in Q &amp; = \{f(x) : x\in X,\, X\subseteq \mathbb R^n\}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is the feasible set and {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''x'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is the decision variable vector of size n.

A well-developed special case is obtained when {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is a polyhedron defined by linear inequalities and equalities. If all the objective functions are linear in terms of the decision variables, this variation leads to multiple objective linear programming (MOLP), an important subclass of MCDM problems.

There are several definitions that are central in MCDM.  Two closely related definitions are those of nondominance (defined based on the criterion space representation) and efficiency (defined based on the decision variable representation).

''Definition 1.''  {{math|'''q*''' ∈ '''Q'''}} is nondominated if there does not exist another {{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}} such that {{math|'''q''' ≥ '''q*'''}} and {{math|'''q''' ≠ '''q*'''}}.

Roughly speaking, a solution is nondominated so long as it is not inferior to any other available solution in all the considered criteria.

''Definition 2.''  {{math|'''x*''' ∈ '''X'''}} is efficient if there does not exist another {{math|'''x''' ∈ '''X'''}} such that {{math|'''f'''('''x''') ≥ '''f'''('''x'''*)}} and {{math|'''f'''('''x''') ≠ '''f'''('''x'''*)}}.

If an MCDM problem represents a decision situation well, then the most preferred solution of a DM has to be an efficient solution in the decision space, and its image is a nondominated point in the criterion space.  Following definitions are also important.

''Definition 3.''  {{math|'''q*''' ∈ '''Q'''}} is weakly nondominated if there does not exist another {{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}} such that {{math|'''q''' &gt; '''q*'''}}.

''Definition 4.''  {{math|'''x*''' ∈ '''X'''}} is weakly efficient if there does not exist another {{math|'''x''' ∈ '''X'''}} such that {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''f'''('''x''') &gt; '''f'''('''x'''*)}}.

Weakly nondominated points include all nondominated points and some special dominated points.  The importance of these special dominated points comes from the fact that they commonly appear in practice and special care is necessary to distinguish them from nondominated points.  If, for example, we maximize a single objective, we may end up with a weakly nondominated point that is dominated. The dominated points of the weakly nondominated set are located either on vertical or horizontal planes (hyperplanes) in the criterion space.

''Ideal point'': (in criterion space) represents the best (the maximum for maximization problems and the minimum for minimization problems) of each objective function and typically corresponds to an infeasible solution.

''Nadir point'': (in criterion space) represents the worst  (the minimum for maximization problems and the maximum for minimization problems) of each objective function among the points in the nondominated set and is typically a dominated point.

The ideal point and the nadir point are useful to the DM to get the "feel" of the range of solutions (although it is not straightforward to find the nadir point for design problems having more than two criteria).

====Illustrations of the decision and criterion spaces====

The following two-variable MOLP problem in the decision variable space will help demonstrate some of the key concepts graphically.

[[File:MCDMFigure1.png|thumb|Figure 1. Demonstration of the decision space
]]

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\max f_1(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = -x_1 + 2x_2 \\
\max f_2(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = 2x_1 - x_2 \\
\text{subject to} \\
x_1 &amp; \le 4 \\
x_2 &amp; \le 4 \\
x_1+x_2 &amp; \le 7 \\
-x_1+x_2 &amp; \le 3 \\
x_1 - x_2 &amp; \le 3 \\
x_1, x_2 &amp; \ge 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
In Figure 1, the extreme points "e" and "b" maximize the first and second objectives, respectively. The red boundary between those two extreme points represents the efficient set. It can be seen from the figure that, for any feasible solution outside the efficient set, it is possible to improve both objectives by some points on the efficient set. Conversely, for any point on the efficient set, it is not possible to improve both objectives by moving to any other feasible solution.  At these solutions, one has to sacrifice from one of the objectives in order to improve the other objective.

Due to its simplicity, the above problem can be represented in criterion space by replacing the {{math| &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;'s}} with the {{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; 's}} as follows:

[[File:MCDMFigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2. Demonstration of the solutions in the criterion space]]

::{{math|Max &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}

::{{math|Max &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}

:: subject to

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 12}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;2f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 12}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 7}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 9}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 9}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ &lt;/var&gt; 0}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;2f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ &lt;/var&gt; 0}}

We present the criterion space graphically in Figure 2.  It is easier to detect the nondominated points (corresponding to efficient solutions in the decision space) in the criterion space. The north-east region of the feasible space constitutes the set of nondominated points (for maximization problems).

===Generating nondominated solutions===

There are several ways to generate nondominated solutions.  We will discuss two of these.  The first approach can generate a special class of nondominated solutions whereas the second approach can generate any nondominated solution.

* ''Weighted sums'' (Gass &amp; Saaty, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gass|first=S.|author2=Saaty, T.|title=Parametric Objective Function Part II|journal=Operations Research|year=1955|volume=3|pages=316–319|doi=10.1287/opre.2.3.316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

If we combine the multiple criteria into a single criterion by multiplying each criterion with a positive weight and summing up the weighted criteria, then the solution to the resulting single criterion problem is a special efficient solution.  These special efficient solutions appear at  corner points of the set of available solutions.  Efficient solutions that are not at corner points have special characteristics and this method is not capable of finding such points.  Mathematically, we can represent this situation as

::{{math|max &lt;var&gt; '''w'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.'''q'''&lt;/var&gt;}} = {{math|&lt;var&gt; '''w'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.'''f(x)''', '''w'''&gt; &lt;/var&gt;0}}

:: subject to

:::{{math|&lt;var&gt;'''x''' ∈ '''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

By varying the weights, weighted sums can be used for generating efficient extreme point solutions for design problems, and supported (convex nondominated) points for evaluation problems.

* ''Achievement scalarizing function'' (Wierzbicki, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wierzbicki|first=A.|title=The Use of Reference Objectives in Multiobjective Optimization|journal=Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems|year=1980|volume=177|series=Springer, Berlin|pages=468–486|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48782-8_32}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:MCDMFigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3. Projecting points onto the nondominated set with an Achievement Scalarizing Function]]

Achievement scalarizing functions also combine multiple criteria into a single criterion by weighting them in a very special way.  They create rectangular contours going away from a reference point towards the available efficient solutions.  This special structure empower achievement scalarizing functions to reach any efficient solution.  This is a powerful property that makes these functions very useful for MCDM problems.

Mathematically, we can represent the corresponding problem as

::{{math|Min &lt;var&gt;s('''g, q, w,''' ρ)&lt;/var&gt;}} =  {{math|Min  {max&lt;var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [(g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)/w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ] + ρ ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;- q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}}},	

::subject to

:::{{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

The achievement scalarizing function can be used to project any point (feasible or infeasible) on the efficient frontier. Any point (supported or not) can be reached. The second term in the objective function is required to avoid generating inefficient solutions. Figure 3 demonstrates how a feasible point, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, and an infeasible point, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, are projected onto the nondominated points, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, respectively, along the direction {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''w'''&lt;/var&gt;}} using an achievement scalarizing function.  The dashed and solid contours correspond to the objective function contours with and without the second term of the objective function, respectively.

===Solving MCDM problems===

Different schools of thought have developed for solving MCDM problems (both of the design and evaluation type). For a bibliometric study showing their development over time, see Bragge, Korhonen, H. Wallenius and J. Wallenius [2010].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bragge|first=J. |author2=Korhonen, P. |author3=Wallenius, H. |author4=Wallenius, J.|title=Bibliometric Analysis of Multiple Criteria Decision Making/Multiattribute Utility Theory|journal=IXX International MCDM Conference Proceedings, (Eds.)

'''''Multiple objective mathematical programming school'''''

(1) ''Vector maximization'': The purpose of vector maximization is to approximate the nondominated set; originally developed for Multiple Objective Linear Programming problems (Evans and Steuer, 1973;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=J.|author2=Steuer, R.|title=A Revised Simplex Method for Linear Multiple Objective Programs|journal=Mathematical Programming|year=1973|volume=5|pages=54–72|doi=10.1007/BF01580111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu and Zeleny, 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=P.L.|author2=Zeleny, M.|title=The Set of All Non-Dominated Solutions in Linear Cases and a Multicriteria Simplex Method|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|year=1975|volume=49|pages=430–468|doi=10.1016/0022-247X(75)90189-4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

(2) ''Interactive programming'': Phases of computation alternate with phases of decision-making (Benayoun et al., 1971;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benayoun|first=R.|author2=deMontgolfier, J. |author3=Tergny, J. |author4=Larichev, O. |title=Linear Programming with Multiple Objective Functions: Step-method (STEM)|year=1971|volume=1|pages=366–375 |doi=10.1007/bf01584098 |journal=Mathematical Programming}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrion, Dyer and Feinberg, 1972;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geoffrion|first=A. |author2=Dyer, J. |author3=Feinberg, A.|title=An Interactive Approach for Multicriterion Optimization with an Application to the Operation of an Academic Department|journal=Management Science|year=1972|volume=19|pages=357–368|doi=10.1287/mnsc.19.4.357|issue=4–Part–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zionts and Wallenius, 1976;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zionts|first=S.|author2=Wallenius, J.|title=An Interactive Programming Method for Solving the Multiple Criteria Problem|journal=Management Science|year=1976|volume=22|pages=652–663|doi=10.1287/mnsc.22.6.652|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korhonen and Wallenius, 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korhonen|first=P.|author2=Wallenius, J.|title=A Pareto Race|journal=Naval Research Logistics|volume=35|pages=615–623|doi=10.1002/1520-6750(198812)35:6&lt;615::AID-NAV3220350608&gt;3.0.CO;2-K|year=1988|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;). No explicit knowledge of the DM's value function is assumed.

'''''[[Goal programming|Goal programming school]]'''''

The purpose is to set apriori target values for goals, and to minimize weighted deviations from these goals. Both importance weights as well as lexicographic pre-emptive weights have been used (Charnes and Cooper, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charnes, A. and [[William W. Cooper|Cooper, W.W.]]|title=Management Models and Industrial Applications of Linear Programming|year=1961|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Fuzzy-set theorists'''''

Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=L.|title=Fuzzy Sets|journal=Information and Control|year=1965|volume=8|pages=338–353|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an extension of the classical notion of sets. This idea is used in many MCDM algorithms to model and solve fuzzy problems.

'''''Multi-attribute utility theorists'''''

[[Multi-attribute utility]] or value functions are elicited and used to identify the most preferred alternative or to rank order the alternatives. Elaborate interview techniques, which exist for eliciting linear additive utility functions and multiplicative nonlinear utility functions, are used (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keeney, R.  |author2=Raiffa, H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Decisions with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value Tradeoffs|year=1976|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''French school'''''

The French school focuses on decision aiding, in particular the [[ELECTRE]] family of outranking methods that originated in France during the mid-1960s. The method was first proposed by Bernard Roy (Roy, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=B.|title=La méthode ELECTRE|journal=Revue d'Informatique et de Recherche Opérationelle (RIRO)|year=1968|volume=8|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Evolutionary multiobjective optimization school (EMO)'''''

EMO algorithms start with an initial population, and update it by using processes designed to mimic natural survival-of-the-fittest principles and genetic variation operators to improve the average population from one generation to the next. The goal is to converge to a population of solutions which represent the nondominated set (Schaffer, 1984;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=J.D.|title=Some Experiments in Machine Learning Using Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms, PhD thesis|year=1984|publisher=Vanderbilt University|location=Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Srinivas and Deb, 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Srinivas|first=N.|author2=Deb, K.|title=Multiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms|journal=Evolutionary Computation|year=1994|volume=2|pages=221–248|doi=10.1162/evco.1994.2.3.221|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  More recently, there are efforts to incorporate preference information into the solution process of EMO algorithms (see Deb and Köksalan, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deb|first=K.|author2=Köksalan, M.|title=Guest Editorial Special Issue on Preference-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|year=2010|volume=14|pages=669–670|doi=10.1109/TEVC.2010.2070371|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''[[Analytic hierarchy process|Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)]]'''''

The AHP first decomposes the decision problem into a hierarchy of subproblems. Then the decision-maker evaluates the relative importance of its various elements by pairwise comparisons. The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values (weights or priorities), which are used to calculate a score for each alternative (Saaty, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saaty|first=T.L.|title=The Analytic Hierarchy Process: Planning, Priority Setting, Resource Allocation|year=1980|publisher=McGraw-Hill,|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A consistency index measures the extent to which the decision-maker has been consistent in her responses. AHP is one of the more controversial techniques listed here, with some researchers in the MCDA community believing it to be flawed. The underlying mathematics is also more complicated, though it has gained some popularity as a result of commercially available software.

'''Non-fatal offences against the person''',  under [[English law]], are generally taken to mean offences which take the form of an attack directed at another person, that do not result in the death of any person. Such offences where death occurs are considered [[Homicide in English law|homicide]], whilst [[Sexual offences in the United Kingdom|sexual offences]] are generally considered separately, since they differ substantially from other offences against the person in theoretical basis and composition. Non-fatal offences against the person mainly derive from the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], although no definition of assault or battery is given there.

[[Offences against the person]] include minor forms of [[battery (crime)|battery]] (any unlawful touching of another person); its complimentary offence, [[assault]] (causing the apprehension of a battery, even when one has not yet occurred); and various more serious offences which are based on assault and battery (together called "common assault"). This includes [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]], where the victim suffers injuries such as bruising or skin abrasions (the converse being an injury that is "transient and trifling"); wounding (a piercing of all layers of the skin); and causing grievous bodily harm (injuries more serious than in actual bodily harm, for example broken bones). The latter two offences may be committed "with intent", meaning there is an additional ''[[mens rea]]'' component that makes the defendant more culpable for their actions. Whilst [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] is sufficient for most offences against the person &amp;ndash; that the defendant foresaw the risk of the proscribed injury occurring without necessarily intending it to happen &amp;ndash; this is insufficient for crimes of intent.

==General characteristics==
[[File:Non-fatal offences against the person graph.png|thumb|right|250px|Number of recorded crimes (2009&amp;ndash;10). Categories approximate non-fatal offences against the person.]]
Common to all crimes against the person is the infringement of the right to [[bodily integrity]]. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no [[harm principle|physical harm]] actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the [[right to liberty]].&lt;ref name="simester425"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the [[right to privacy]] under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt; The central statute on this topic is [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.&lt;ref name="simester425"/&gt;

In the context of the [[inchoate offences in English law|law of attempts]], the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] advises that "where the evidence demonstrates that the suspect intended to cause an injury that is substantially more serious than that (if any) which was in fact caused, prosecutors should consider the circumstances of the case as a whole as well as the relevant sentencing guideline to determine the appropriate charge." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/ |title=Offences Against The Person |accessdate=5 July 2013 |publisher=Crown Prosecution Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assault and battery==
A distinction is drawn between the offence of [[assault]] and that of [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault is the ''apprehension'' of the possibility of immediate unlawful violence, and battery that of the ''infliction'' of such violence. Several proposals, including one from the [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] in 1980 have proposed merging the offences. However, the distinction was confirmed in ''[[DPP v Little]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1992] QB 645 (DC)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992. There, the [[conflation]] of assault and battery was criticised as [[Duplicity (law)|duplicitous]].&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith412"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; If D throws a punch at V, who dodges, this is likely to be an assault but not a battery; if V is attacked from behind, this may constitute a battery without an assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 426&amp;ndash;427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith413"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which constitute ordinary daily life are not considered assault or battery, for example, jostling on a crowded train.&lt;ref name="simester428"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "common assault" is used to refer to either a technical assault or a battery.&lt;ref name="smith412"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offences_against_the_person/#P92_3540 |title=Offences against the Person, incorporating the Charging Standard |publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]] |year=2009 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault===
{{main|Common assault}}
Assault is a [[summary offence]] in England and Wales, with the case heard only at a [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith415"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''R v Little'' considered assault a statutory offence, none of the statutes referred to contain any definition of assault.&lt;ref name="smith413"/&gt; The ''[[actus reus]]'', endorsed in ''[[R v Ireland]]'',&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; is any act by D that causes V to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 427&amp;ndash;428.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "force" rather than "violence" is used by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS).&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; As a definition, this has proven stable, but its interpretation has varied.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The force must be unlawful &amp;ndash; outside the realm of [[Self-defence in English law|defensive]] or preventative force, for example. Consent of the victim may be enough to prevent the commission of a crime. There is to debate as to whether lack of consent is an element of the ''actus reus'', making it inherent to the commission of a crime, or whether consent is a defence. [[Andrew Simester]] and [[Bob Sullivan (legal writer)|Bob Sullivan]] argue that the former is more correct, since lack on consent is vital to the crime; since the act may not constitute a harm even if enacted. The disregard for the victim's [[autonomy]] and privacy is the actionable part of the offence.&lt;ref name="simester428"/&gt; The victim need not be frightened by the apprehension of violence, merely not want the person concerned to do it.&lt;ref name="simester429"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault requires a positive act, not an [[omission (criminal law)|omission]]. Mere lawful presence in a location is not enough to satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal [[trespass to land|trespass]], however, is sufficient.&lt;ref name="simester429"/&gt; [[John Cyril Smith]] has suggested that wilfully refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt; It is arguable that there was once a rule that "mere words" could not constitute an assault, but the case of ''R v Ireland'' confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 429&amp;ndash;430.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elliott139"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[R. v Constanza]]'' added threatening letters to this category.&lt;ref name="elliott139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester430"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although assault involves a threat of an immediate battery, the perpetrator need not actually intend to carry out that battery.&lt;ref name="smith414"/&gt; It is enough that he, intentionally or recklessly, caused the victim to apprehend such an occurrence.&lt;ref name="simester430"/&gt; The term "immediate" has also been used in different ways. Following ''Ireland'', it seems likely that even where the victim knew the defendant was some distance away, this may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lord Steyn]] said there, "what, if not the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about?".&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 430&amp;ndash;431.&lt;/ref&gt; This would widen the crime of assault considerably. It is perfectly conceivable that the victim was fearful, but did not believe an attack was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; That she actually apprehended "immediate violence", rather than merely "immediately apprehended", is doubtful.&lt;ref name="smith414"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Constanza'', it was sufficient for the prosecution to show that the victim feared an attack in the future, which may have been imminent. It also suggested that the anticipated harm could be psychological rather than physical.&lt;ref name="elliott142"&gt;Elliott, Quinn (2006). p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Blake v Barnard]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1840) 9 C &amp; P 626; 173 [[English Reports|ER]] 985&lt;/ref&gt; established a rule that conditional threats could not amount to an assault. However, the court's reliance on ''[[Tuberville v Savage]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1669) 1 Mod Rep 3; 86 ER 684&lt;/ref&gt; was tenuous at best. Such threats would normally be considered assault.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 431&amp;ndash;432.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement is that the defendant must have intend to, or recklessly, cause the victim to fear the possibility of immediate unlawful violence.&lt;ref name="simester432"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no authority that suggests that "intend" or "recklessly" ought to mean something from their normal meanings. ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant himself foresaw the risk of harm &amp;ndash; is applied.&lt;ref name="elliott142"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; Assault is a crime of "basic intent" for the purposes of the [[Majewski test]] concerning [[Voluntary intoxication in English law|voluntary intoxication]].&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;

===Battery===
The defendant commits a [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if they intentionally or recklessly apply unlawful force to another, without their consent.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt; It is subject to the same "everyday life" exception common to assault.&lt;ref name="simester432"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith416"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases have included kissing,&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Dungey (1864) 4 F&amp;F 99, 102; 176 ER 487&lt;/ref&gt; spitting&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith (1866) F&amp;F 1066; 176 ER 910&lt;/ref&gt; and cutting someone's hair without their consent.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Smith [2006] EWHC 94 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 432&amp;ndash;433.&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes contact with the victim's clothing,&lt;ref name="simester433"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; a rule dating back to 1845 in ''[[R v Day]]''. It is not necessary that the victim feels the touching.&lt;ref name="smith416"/&gt;

The required [[causation (law)|causation]] may be quite oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Martin (1881) 8 QBD 54 (CCR)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; The general law on [[Omissions in English criminal law|liability for omissions]] also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner|Fagan v MPC]]'') and of a [[duty of care]].&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt; However, in ''R v Ireland''&lt;ref name="ireland" group="c"/&gt; the court ruled out psychological injury by means of a telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought.&lt;ref name="simester433"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith417"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.&lt;ref name="smith417"/&gt;

The case of ''[[R v Brown]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1994] 1 AC 212&lt;/ref&gt; established a further requirement: hostility. This is not easily called an ''actus reus'' nor ''mens rea'' requirement. It was not clear what role it played in that case, but could apply to other cases as a way of clarifying the "everyday behaviour" guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been strongly criticised by [[Lord Goff]] and other judicial and academic writers. It could apply to future cases where the bodily harm was unintended or unforeseen.&lt;ref name="simester435"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''mens rea'' requirement for battery is similar to assault. It is the intention to apply unlawful force to another, or be reckless as to whether such force is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; It employs ''[[Recklessness (law)|Cunningham recklessness]]'' &amp;ndash; that the defendant must have foreseen the risk of the infliction of unlawful force upon V.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 418&amp;ndash;419.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, at least, combining the ''mens rea'' of battery with the ''actus reus'' of assault, or vice versa, is not a crime.&lt;ref name="smith419"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Majewski test]] is applied to cases of voluntary intoxication, as battery is also a crime of "basic intent" in this scenario.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith419"/&gt;

==Assault occasioning actual bodily harm==
[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] carries a maximum sentence of 5 years under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.&lt;ref name="simester435"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/47 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 47 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[triable either way]].&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith436"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Both assault (fear of violence) and battery (infliction of violence) are included,&lt;ref name="simester436"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible to consider section 47 as creating two offences &amp;ndash; one involving an assault, and one a battery.&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt; "Occasioning" is generally taken to mean "causing" although [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]] has argued that it is wider than that.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; In discussing causation, 'frightened' people are not expected to act entirely rationally; instead, a relevant test is that of ''[[R v Roberts]]''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;56 Cr App R 95 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt; There, any conduct of the victim short of "daft" could be considered caused by the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Only the seriousness of the injury separates an assault from an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt;

The concept of "actual bodily harm" is wide. Almost all injuries are included &amp;ndash; for example, [[bruising]] or [[Abrasion (medical)|skin abrasion]]s. Injuries are not included if they are "transient or trifling",&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Donovan [1934] 2 KB 498 CCA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpscharging"/&gt; but this did not cover even momentary unconsciousness.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;T v DPP [2003] EWHC 266 (admin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; The wide range of injuries give prosecutors considerable discretion about which charge to bring against a defendant.&lt;ref name="simester436"/&gt; Psychological injury is included,&lt;ref name="smith437"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it forms a recognised medical condition.&lt;ref name="simester436437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 436&amp;ndash;437.&lt;/ref&gt; Mere fright or anxiety is insufficient for actual bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; It is limited only by the need for an actual assault or battery to have taken place.&lt;ref name="simester436437"/&gt;

There is no separate ''mens rea'' element from the assault or battery, making this a crime of [[constructive liability]].&lt;ref name="smith436"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester437"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been defended by John Gardner, a proponent of the [[moral threshold]] theory.&lt;ref name="simester437"/&gt; However, this is opposed by Simester and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 437&amp;ndash;438.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maliciously wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm==
{{main|Grievous bodily harm}}
Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 criminalises "whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/20 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 20 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty, five years, is the same as that for actual bodily harm, but a section 20 offence is considered more serious by the courts and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]].&lt;ref name="simester438"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; A judge is free on the facts of the case to allow a jury find a defendant guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm where a defendant is charged with a section 20 offence.&lt;ref name="smith438"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''actus reus'' is the wound or infliction of grievous bodily harm (GBH). A "wound" is something that breaks all layers of the [[skin]], and must have an external component &amp;ndash; [[internal bleeding]], however serious, is not a wound.&lt;ref name="simster438439"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 438&amp;ndash;439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith439"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; Serious wounds would also fall under grievous bodily harm, but some qualifying wounds (a pin prick, for example) are very minor.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; Some wounds would therefore not qualify as grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref name="smith439"/&gt;

The phrase "really serious harm" was used to describe grievous bodily harm in ''R v Metheram''.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1961] 3 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simester438"/&gt; The case of ''R v Grundy''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1977] Crim LR 543&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that injuries should be taken in their totality; that many small injuries may form a serious harm.&lt;ref name="simster438439"/&gt; ''R v Bollom''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] 2 Cr App R 50&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the ''Grundy'' approach, and also showed that grievous bodily harm against a child was likely to require less bodily harm than that against an adult. ''[[R v Burstow]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1998] AC 147&lt;/ref&gt; extended "bodily harm" to include psychological trauma if it formed a recognised serious mental condition. Simester ''et al'' said that this could have wide-reaching consequences, but it is unlikely to be taken to include commonplace occurrences (relationship breakups, verbal cruelty, broken promises) &amp;ndash; in ''Burstow'', the conduct included a prolonged and intense campaign of harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, ''[[R v Clarence]]'' was taken as an authority on the meaning of "inflict", which the court took to mean "an assault or battery of which a wound or grievous bodily harm is the manifest immediate and obvious result".&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1888) 22 QBD 23&lt;/ref&gt; This narrow definition was extended in ''R v Martin''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;(1881) 8 QBD 54&lt;/ref&gt; and ''R v Halliday''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[1886&amp;ndash;90] All ER 1028&lt;/ref&gt; to include, for example, injuries sustained during an attempt of the victim to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; An injury is said to be "inflicted" if it is the result of an impact or percussion set in motion by the defendant; the injury must relate directly to the impact or percussion, but the impact or percussion may be an indirect effect of the defendant's actions.&lt;ref name="simester441"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; ''R v Burstow'' established that "inflict" was a near synonym of cause: in [[David Hope, Baron Hope of Craighead|Lord Hope]]'s view, they were synonymous, except that the outcome of the former must be unpleasant.&lt;ref name="smith441"&gt;Smith (2002). p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; This was applied in ''[[R v Dica]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2004] QB 1257&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[R v Konzani]]'',&lt;ref group="c"&gt;[2005] EWCA Crim 706&lt;/ref&gt; two cases of [[Criminal transmission of HIV|knowingly risking passing on HIV]] without explicit consent.&lt;ref name="simester441"/&gt;

The ''mens rea'' element is that of "malice", which means either intention or recklessness.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 441&amp;ndash;442.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cunningham recklessness'' is applied.&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Savage [1992] 1 AC 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt; However, for the purposes of recklessness, foresight of even minor harm is sufficient &amp;ndash; it does not require foresight of serious harm.&lt;ref name="smith441"/&gt;&lt;ref name="simester442"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised since it breaks the correspondence principle, that the ''mens rea'' should match the ''actus reus'' of an offence.&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt;

==Wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent==
The crime of [[Grievous bodily harm#Section 18|wounding with intent]] is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It reads, since amended, as:
"Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person... with intent...  to do some...  grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/18 |title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861: Section 18 |work=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates four forms of the offence: unlawfully and maliciously wounding, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (1) or resist arrest (2); and unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to either do grievous bodily harm (3) or resist arrest (4).&lt;ref name="simester442"/&gt; Thus forms (1) and (3) differ from section 20 offences mainly in that there is a specific intention to cause serious harm rather than some harm, and they are therefore the more serious charges. On an [[indictment]] under section 18, the jury is open to convict under section 20 or section 47 if properly directed.&lt;ref name="smith438"/&gt;

"Wounding" and "causing grievous bodily harm" are defined in the same way as they are in the crime of maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm includes serious psychological trauma and serious infection; however, these are less controversial here because of the inclusion of intent.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 442&amp;ndash;443.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent narrows the crime considerably, and the term "inflict" is not used.&lt;ref name="simester443"&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (3), intent can be simply decided in the case of a direct attack, or "virtual certainty", with knowledge of the virtual certainty &amp;ndash; the ''[[R v Woollin|Woollin]]''&lt;ref group="c"&gt;Woollin [1999] AC 82 (HL)&lt;/ref&gt; principle.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In form (1), where an injury does not amount to grievous bodily harm, intent to cause grievous bodily harm (in the advancement of a different cause) must be shown. Practically, the "virtual certainty" clause cannot come into force, since grievous bodily harm was not actually caused, by definition.&lt;ref name="simester443"/&gt; In forms (2) and (4), the concept of "malice" has a role to play that it does not in (1) and (3). The defendant must foresee the risk of wounding or grievous bodily harm, where the core intent is to resist arrest. The defendant cannot be reckless to the resisting of arrest, it must be an intention.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). pp. 443&amp;ndash;444.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the requirement to resist a ''lawful'' arrest, the defendant only lacks the required ''mens rea'' if he believes in facts which, if true, would make the arrest unlawful; not just that he believes the facts as they are make the arrest illegal &amp;ndash; a [[mistake of fact]] suffices, a [[mistake of law]] does not.&lt;ref&gt;Simester et al. (2010). p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other offences and issues==
There also exist alternative forms of aggravated assault in English law, for example: assault or battery with intent to resist arrest (as above, the arrest must be lawful); and assault on, resistance to, and obstruction of [[constable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 426&amp;ndash;436.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], it is also possible to commit a racially aggravated assault. This is where the commission of the assault in combination to hostility towards the victim, based on their race or believed race, or association with a race. "Race" includes skin colour, nationality, citizenship, and ethnic or national origins.&lt;ref name="smith437"/&gt; Administering poison, either contrary to section 23 or 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, is also an offence; as is false imprisonment &amp;ndash; including unlawful arrest, kidnap and hostage situations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp. 443&amp;ndash;457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation aimed at the possession or use of firearms may also come into this category, as may [[bomb hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). pp.457&amp;ndash;465.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also offences of aggravated assault, created under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, that now go almost completely unused: for example, assaulting or obstructing a clergyman in the discharge of his duties, and assaulting a [[magistrate]] or other person in the exercise of his duties concerning the preservation of a vessel in distress or a wreck.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2002). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

An assault is not caused if a defendant threatens to shoot the victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, it would be the ''actus reus'' of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for [[attempted assault]]. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.&lt;ref name="smith415"/&gt;

'''Petro-sexual politics''' is a lens used to better understand the relationships between [[petroleum]] and gender violence and the role [[colonial powers]] possess.  The underlying theme of petro-sexual politics is that gender violence is part of a larger [[political economy]] of violence.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Contextualizing petro-sexual politics|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political|date=June 2011|volume=3|issue=36|pages=200–220|doi=10.1177/0304375411418597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Petro-sexual politics can yield new methods of theorizing [[global politics]],&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Petro-sexual politics: global oil, legitimate violence and transnational justice|journal=Doctoral Dissertation|date=June 2008|pages=1–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as explained here for the [[Nigeria]]n case of the "[[natural resource curse]]".

==Introduction==
[[File:Location Nigeria AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Nigeria (dark blue)]]

Typically petro-violence is lumped together with the term [[ethnic conflict]].  These conflicts have deep colonial roots driving them.  These colonial powers label conflicts with terms such as "[[terrorist activity]]" or "[[gang violence]]" in order to retain colonial power and maintain global [[hierarchies]] and inequality within a region.  As colonial powers control [[local politics]], occurrences of [[domestic violence]] and other forms of gender violence can be observed.  A Western view of domestic violence skews the ability of the population to see that this domestic violence is not simply occurring at the personal level.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;   
According to Turcotte, there is a common ground between [[petroleum]] production and gender-[[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; These factors have been used as machines of war and the framework for [[nation building]].  Justification of sexual violence in times of war allows for the mutual existence of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and petroleum industry.  The state's growth is fueled solely by the growth of the [[petroleum industry]] in the region, thus leading to the existence of petro-sexual politics.

==Niger Delta==

[[Transnational feminism|Transnational]] and [[African feminism]] argues that the [[nation-state]] relies upon [[capitalist]] and colonial violence.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe&gt;{{cite book|last=Mudimbe|first=V|title=The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-20468-4|pages=1–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The production of petroleum in the [[Niger Delta]] is a direct result of colonial endeavors.  This colonization has directly imposed social arrangements and altered the pre-colonial population, creating a new population under colonial-imperial regulation.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe /&gt; According to Turcotte, gender violence, a precursor to [[colonization]], was vital to colonization itself.  The United Kingdom, controlling oil production in the area, was able to impose imperial rule onto the colony.  Once [[Nigeria]] gained its independence in 1960, colonial ideals were still held in place.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;
[[File:STS61C-42-72.jpg|left|thumbnail|The Niger Delta as viewed from space]]

===Biafran War===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}

While the Nigerian Civil War (also known as the Biafran War) is often thought of as a [[civil war]], the colonial roots that caused much of the tension leading to the conflict cannot be ignored.  Scholars have suggested that this conflict illustrates the link between gender violence and petroleum. Emecheta depicts a war in which sexual violence was used as a tactic of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emecheta|first=Buchi|title=Destination Biafra|year=1988|publisher=Heinemann|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-0435909925|pages=1–256|translator-first=Olof|translator-last=Hoffsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations shared a direct correlation to the protection of local oil investments.  Through this example, the Nigerian Civil War can be seen as a moment when sexual violence was ultimately utilized to protect the oil industry and is a prime example of petro-sexual political actions.

===Legitimate violence and transnational justice===

The Niger Delta was considered a [[terrorist]] region in 2000 by the United States State Department.  Following this declaration, [[US military]] funding to the region greatly increased to protect off-shore extraction and production of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerson|first=Joseph|title=U.S. foreign military bases &amp; military colonialism|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531231151/http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|deadurl=unfit|publisher=ZNet|archivedate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action has raised questions of whether or not the U.S. intended to eradicate the terrorist threats or simply protect its oil investments. Turcotte suggests that this [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|violence in the Niger Delta region]] is brought about by the promotion of capitalist democracy through interstate systems.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;
In the 1990s, the discourse around conflict in the Delta increasing focus on male youth groups activity against the industry as "militant attacks"; by 2000, these men were translated into terrorists by the interstate system.  The history of protests in Nigeria suggests that petro-protest developed from strategies of community justice within women's organizations often supported by male youth groups.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;

===Petroleum extraction and violence===

According to Watts, oil has seven properties that aid in the explanation as to why violence is often found in areas of [[petroleum extraction]].&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Michael J.|title=Violent Environments|chapter=Petro-violence: community, extraction, and political ecology of a mythic commodity|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|pages=189–212|editor1-first=Nancy Lee|editor1-last=Peluso|editor2-first=Michael J.|editor2-last=Watts|isbn=978-0801487118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Oil is money:  As a source of immediate wealth, the value of oil brings about an ambition and weakening of moral fiber that has been called the élan vital, vital force, of growth.
# Petro-State and Nation:  The presence of oil in a nation creates power within a state.  This power leads to the segregation of who will and will not have access to the resource and the revenue it generates in global markets.
# Petro-imperialism:  When oil is discovered, world powers become involved instantly.  A deal is soon formed between the oil nation and an imperial power.  This deal greatly hinders the oil nation's autonomy.
# Evacuative extraction: The extraction of oil leads to a variety of movement.  The oil flows from the land, but ecological repercussions and the relocation of indigenous populations are also observed.
# Hyper-centralization: The state becomes fully dependent on its oil commodity.  Political endeavors become intertwined with the business aspect of oil- petro-politics.
# The El Dorado effect:  The idea that oil leads to wealth without effort.  Oil and the revenue it will generate will propel the nation or state into the future.  Disregard of values and morals previously seen as vital are stereotypical.
# Valorization of territory:  Debate over who controls how the commodity of oil will be handled.  Disputes are often concerning issues of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], rights and [[citizenship]]. 
In the instance of the Niger Delta, constant exploitation from international oil companies distorted the pre-colonial views of the region.  This distortion has led to violence in the region.  Over 2,000 deaths have occurred as a direct result of this episode.&lt;ref name=Watts /&gt;

===Non-violent forms of activism===

"Blood may be thicker than water, but oil is thicker than both." —Perry Anderson, "Scurrying toward Bethlehem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Perry|title=Scurrying towards Bethlehem|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/10/perry-anderson-scurrying-towards-bethlehem|journal=New Left Review|volume=10|date=July–August 2001|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to colonial institutions, females headed the Nigerian villages.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;  Nigerian women were leaders of the palm oil industry that dominated the region prior to the conversion to petroleum.  Due to the fact that these women were seen as reproducers and heads of the family, if instance of abuse were seen, the women could threaten to leave.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; However, once [[petroleum]] was taken as the region's main resource, the women rapidly lost this power.
Hanna exemplifies different types of protests commonly utilized by Nigerian women: dance, song and nakedness.&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=J|title=Dance, Protest, and Women's Wars: cases from Nigeria and the US|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195065176|editor=Guida West and Rhoda Blumberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's protests consist of storming en masse into the compounds of offending men and holding a man 'hostage' by dancing, singing and threatening their nakedness on him."&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt;
Women's protest during the colonial era has been numerous given their social status prior to colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mba|first=N|title=Nigerian women mobilized|year=1982|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0877251484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these protests, violence against women persisted as global oil initiatives grew in the region. The increasing oil economy of the Delta not only affected the physical well-being of the women in the area, but also affected their livelihoods. Local fishing industries and food staples have all been compromised due to oil-related pollution.&lt;ref name=Patch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patch|first=J.|title=Women and non-violent forms of activism in the Niger Delta oil resource conflict|journal=Undercurrent|year=2008|volume=5|issue=3|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As instances of female-led non-violent protests increase, so does militant-based political activism among the male populace.  The variance in protest from violent and non-violent actions has called the legitimacy of the protests into question.  Ultimately, imperial labeling of these protests as "[[terrorist activities]]" perpetuates the existence of the oil companies and regional violence that accompanies the oil industry's presence.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

It seems that these non-violent protests led by community women's organizations have been the most successful in bringing about awareness of the issue to the [[United Nations|UN]] and other [[grass-roots]] organizations.  Through continued use of non-violent protests, the women of the region have been able to establish credibility to their claims that had been previously disregarded as a result of violence and counter-violence in the area.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

===MEND: violent protests of petro-sexual politics===

One source of violent protest to the petro-sexual politics that currently hold the Niger Delta under imperial power lies with the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND). The militant group is driven to violent protests by pollution, marginalization and political repression.&lt;ref name=Courson&gt;{{cite book|last=Courson|first=E|title=Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)|year=2009|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|location=Uppsala|isbn=978-91-7106-657-2|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As previously noted, the violence in the region between militant groups such as MEND and the government-controlled military can be attributed to [[economic inequality]], the legacy of colonialism, and the lack of a [[democratic government]]. Courson also notes that the gap in wealth in the Niger Delta has grown significantly since foreign oil companies have impacted the region.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; MEND emerged onto the resistance scene late in 2005 after attacking two Shell pipelines.  From the beginning, MEND attempted to make its intentions clear; it did not want to combat the people of the region or the oil companies, but the oppressive economy that held the people of the Delta in poverty.  To gain media attention, MEND took two western nationals hostage.  However, the retaliation by the government was not what the MEND resistance had hoped.  An increase in military presence led to human rights abuse, rape, and the destruction of communities, all in the name of fighting MEND, which has earned the title "terrorist" by the [[Nigerian government]]. However, Bushra states that labeling resistance efforts as terrorist acts does not look far enough into the reasons why groups such as MEND have been forced to take up arms.&lt;ref name=Bushra&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushra|first=S.|title=Nigeria wages war for its own oil|journal=The Stanford Progressive|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bushra continues in saying that MEND's response was necessary due to the fact that previous peace negotiations had failed.&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

Throughout this conflict, MEND has called for international intervention and refutes the terrorist tags that they have been labeled with, saying they fight for survival and equality.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; Individuals such as Brusha and Courson believe that military retaliation is not the answer to the problems that petro-sexual politics have imposed on the region. Further violence will lead to additional implications facing the marginalized women and youth that have been objectified as vessels of war in this conflict.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

'''PlayStation mentality''' refers to the disassociation between combatants and the consequences of their actions, as a result of the use of weapon interfaces which resemble [[video games]].  The effect is named after the [[PlayStation]] games console, and is commonly cited in discussions of the problems of [[drone strike|drone warfare]], such as that conducted by the [[CIA]] in the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Pakistan tribal areas]], typically using [[predator drones]].

'''Positive illusions''' are unrealistically favorable attitudes that people have towards themselves or to people that are close to them. Positive illusions are a form of [[self-deception]] or [[self-enhancement]] that feel good, maintain [[self-esteem]] or stave off discomfort, at least in the short term. There are three broad kinds: [[illusory superiority|inflated assessment of one's own abilities]], [[optimism bias|unrealistic optimism]] about the future, and an [[illusion of control]].&lt;ref name="notso"&gt;{{harvnb|Kruger|Chan|Roese|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "positive illusions" originates in a 1988 paper by [[Shelley Elizabeth Taylor|Taylor]] and Brown.&lt;ref name="notso"/&gt; "[[#CITEREFTaylorBrown1988|Taylor and Brown's (1988)]] model of mental health maintains that certain positive illusions are highly prevalent in normal thought and predictive of criteria traditionally associated with mental health."{{sfn|Taylor|Brown|1994}}

There are controversies about the extent to which people reliably demonstrate positive illusions, and also about whether these illusions are beneficial to the people who have them.&lt;ref name="notso"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "mckay"&gt;{{harvnb|McKay|Dennett|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="colvinandblock"&gt;{{harvnb|Colvin|Block|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birinci"&gt;{{harvnb|Birinci|Dirik|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In the [[illusory superiority|above-average effect]], people regard themselves more positively than they regard others and less negatively than others regard them. Moreover, positive attributes are judged to be more descriptive of themselves than of an average person, whereas negative ones are judged to be less descriptive of themselves than of an average person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alicke|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that it is statistically impossible for most people to be superior to their peers, rather than being equally aware of ones strengths and weaknesses, people are more aware of their strengths and not very aware of their weaknesses. This effect has been widely recognized across traits&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and abilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including the realm of driving ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Svenson|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; parenting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wenger|Fowers|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; leadership ability, teaching ability, ethics, and health. This effect is also evident in memory; most people also tend to perceive their ability to remember as better than it actually is.{{sfn|Crary|1966}}

The [[illusion of control]] is an exaggerated assessment of the individual's personal control over environmental circumstances such as the roll of dice or flip of coin.{{sfn|Fleming|Darley|1989}}

[[Optimism bias]] is a tendency for people to overestimate their likelihood of experiencing a wide variety of pleasant events, such as enjoying their first job or having a gifted child, and somewhat underestimate their risk of succumbing to negative events, such as getting divorced or falling victim to a chronic disease. This illusory nature of optimism is also evident in peoples' under-estimation of the time taken for a variety of tasks.{{sfn|Buehler|Griffin|Ross|1994}}

==Origins==
Like many forms of human perception, self-perception is prone to illusion. Positive illusions have been commonly understood as one of the apparent effects of [[self-enhancement]], a desire to maximize the positivity of one's self-views&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{harvnb|Leary|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a function of boosting [[self-esteem]]. It might be due to the desire to see oneself more favorably relative to one's peers.{{sfn|Lewinsohn|Mischel|Chaplin|Barton|1980}} These kinds of [[self-serving bias|self-serving attributions]] seemed to be displayed by positive self-viewers only. In fact, the negative-viewers were found to display the opposite pattern.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{harvnb|Swann|Predmore|Griffin|Gaines|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there may be modest genetic contributions to the ability to develop positive illusions.{{sfn|Owens|Goldfine|Evangelista|Hoza|2007}}{{vague|date=December 2012}} Early environment also plays an important role: people are more able to develop these positive beliefs in nurturing environments than in harsh ones.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Alternative explanations involve dimensions like the easiness and commonness of the tasks. In addition, tasks that shifted attention from the self to the comparative target would stop people overly optimising.{{sfn|Eiser|Pahl|Prins|2001}}

The cultural prevalence also has a significant role in positive illusions. Although it is easy to document positive illusions in individualistic Western cultures, people in collectivist East Asian cultures are much less likely to self-enhance and, indeed, are often self-effacing instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heine|Hamamura|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most studies find that people tend to have inflated views of themselves. The research indicates that the relationship between people's self-evaluations and objective assessments is relatively weak. One explanation for this is that most people only have mild positive illusions.{{sfn|Taylor|Armor|1996}}

However, according to recent studies there is evidence that there are significant individual differences between the strength of positive illusions people have. Therefore, some people may have extremely inflated self-views, some mild and some very little and when examined across a population this effect appears weak.&lt;ref name="Robins &amp; Beer, 2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|Beer|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and liabilities==
Positive illusions can have advantages and disadvantages for the individual, and there is a controversy over whether they are evolutionarily adaptive.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; The illusions may have direct health benefits by helping the person cope with stress, or by promoting work towards success.&lt;ref name=mckay/&gt; On the other hand, unrealistically positive expectations may prevent people from taking sensible preventative action for medical risks.&lt;ref name="flawed"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunning|Heath|Suls|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research in fact provides evidence that people who have positive illusions may have both short term benefits and long term costs. Specifically, self-enhancement is not correlated with academic success or graduation rates in college.&lt;ref name="Robins &amp; Beer, 2001"/&gt;

===Mental health===
{{Main|Depressive realism}}
[[Shelley Elizabeth Taylor|Taylor]] and Brown's Social Psychological Model of mental health has assumed that positive beliefs would be tied to psychological well-being, and that positive self-evaluations, even unrealistic, would promote good [[mental health]]. The reference to well-being here means the ability to feel good about oneself, to be creative and/or productive in one's work, to form satisfying relationships with other people and to effectively combat stress when necessary.{{sfn|Taylor|Brown|1988}} Positive illusions are particularly useful for helping people to get through major stressful events or traumas, such as life-threatening illnesses or serious accidents. People who are able to develop or maintain their positive beliefs in the face of these potential setbacks tend to cope more successfully with them, and show less psychological distress than those less able. For example, psychological research shows that cancer survivors often report a higher [[quality of life]] than people who have never had cancer at all.{{sfn|Taylor|1983}} This could be physiologically protective because they have been able to use the traumatic experience to evoke an increased sense of meaning and purpose.{{sfn|Taylor|Kemeny|Reed|Bower|2000}} This relates to the concept of [[psychological resilience]] or an individual's ability to cope with challenges and stress. Self-enhancing was found to be correlated with resilience in the face of the [[9/11]] tragedy among participants either in or near the towers.{{sfn|Bonanno|Rennicke|Dekel|2005}}

People also hold positive illusions because such beliefs often enhance their productivity and persistence with tasks on which they might otherwise give up.{{sfn|Greenwald|1980}} When people believe they can achieve a difficult goal, this expectation often creates a sense of energy and excitement, resulting in more progress than would otherwise have been the case.

Positive illusions can be argued to be adaptive because they enable people to feel hopeful in the face of uncontrollable risks.{{sfn|Janoff-Bulman|Brickman|1982}}

In addition, there seems to be a relationship between illusions and positive mood. Studies have found that the direction of this relationship is that positive illusions cause positive mood states.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{harvnb|McFarland |Ross|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recent findings found that all forms of illusion, positive or not, were associated with more depressive symptoms&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{harvnb|Joiner|Kistner|Stellrecht|Merrill|2006}} or {{harvnb|Moore|Fresco|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and various other studies reject the link between positive illusions and mental health, well-being or [[life satisfaction]], maintaining that accurate perception of reality is compatible with [[happiness]].&lt;ref name="Birinci"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Such as {{harvnb|Fu et al. |2003}}, {{harvnb|Carson et al. |2010}} and {{harvnb|Boyd-Wilson et al.|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When studying the link between self-esteem and positive illusions, {{harvtxt|Compton|1992}} identified a group which possessed high self-esteem without positive illusions, and that these individuals weren't depressed, neurotic, psychotic, maladjusted nor personality disordered, thus concluding that positive illusions aren't necessary for high self-esteem. Compared to the group with positive illusions and high self-esteem, the nonillusional group with high self-esteem was higher on self-criticism and personality integration and lower on psychoticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Compton|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[meta-analysis]] of 118 studies including 7013 subjects found that slightly more studies supported the idea of depressive realism, but these studies were poorer in quality, used non-clinical samples, were more readily generalized, used self-reports instead of interviews and used [[attentional bias]] or judgment of contingency as a method of measuring depressive realism, as methods such as recall of feedback and evaluation of performance showed results counter to depressive realism.{{sfn|Moore|Fresco|2007}}

Another recent meta-analysis supports Taylor and Browns central claim. Its results indicate that different forms of self-enhancement are positively linked to personal adjustment (high subjective well-being and low depressiveness). Self-enhancement was not only linked to self-ratings of personal adjustment, but also to adjustment ratings made by informants (including clinical experts). Furthermore, self-enhancement was also a longitudinal predictor of personal adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dufner|first=|last2=Gebauer, Sedikides, Denissen|year=2018|title=Self-Enhancement and Psychological Adjustment: A Meta-Analytic Review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=online first|pages=108886831875646|doi=10.1177/1088868318756467|pmid=29534642}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Physical health===
Apart from having better psychological adjustment with more active coping,{{sfn|Taylor|Kemeny|Aspinwall|Schneider|1992}} the ability to develop and sustain positive beliefs in the face of setbacks has its health benefits. Research with men who had the [[HIV]] virus, or already diagnosed with [[AIDS]] has shown that those who hold unrealistically positive assessments of their abilities to control their health conditions take longer to develop symptoms, experience a slower course of illness, as well as other positive cognitive outcomes, such as acceptance of the loss.{{sfn|Bower |Kemeny |Taylor| Fahey |1998}}

===Potential liabilities===
There are several potential risks that may arise if people hold positive illusions about their personal qualities and likely outcomes. First of all, they might set themselves up for unpleasant surprises for which they are ill-prepared when their overly optimistic beliefs are disconfirmed. They may also have to tackle the consequences thereafter. However, research suggests that, for the most part, these adverse outcomes do not occur. People's beliefs are more realistic at times when realism serves them particularly well: for example, when initially making plans; when accountability is likely or following [[negative feedback]] from the environment. Following a setback or failure, all is still not lost, as people's overly positive beliefs may be used again in a new undertaking.&lt;ref name="ArmorTaylor1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Armor|Taylor|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second risk is that people who hold positive illusions will set goals, or undertake courses of actions which are more likely to produce failure than success. This concern appears to be largely without basis. Research shows that when people are deliberating future courses of actions for themselves, such as whether to take a particular job or go to graduate school, their perceptions are fairly realistic, but they can become overly optimistic when they turn to implementing their plans. Although there is no guarantee that one's realistic prediction would turn out to be accurate,&lt;ref name="ArmorTaylor1998"/&gt; the shift from realism to optimism may provide the fuel needed to bring potentially difficult tasks from conception to fruition.{{sfn|Taylor|Gollwitzer|1995}}

A third risk is that positive self-perceptions may have social costs. A specific source of evidence of the self-serving pattern in ability assessment examined the use of [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] definitions of traits and abilities.{{sfn|Dunning| Meyerowitz|Holzberg|1989}} The authors suggested that the social costs occur when one's definition of ability is perceived to be the only one relevant to achievement outcomes. In other words, wherever people fail to recognise when other plausible definitions of ability are relevant for success, estimates of their future well-being will be overstated.

A fourth risk is that it may be harmful to realize that one's actual competence does not match up to their illusions. This can be harmful to the ego and result in actually performing worse in situations such as college.&lt;ref name="Robins &amp; Beer, 2001"/&gt;

Although positive illusions may have short-term benefits, they come with long-term costs. Positive illusions have been linked with decreasing levels of self-esteem and well-being, as well as [[narcissism]] and lower academic achievement among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|Beer|2001}}; {{harvnb|Yang |Chuang|Chiou|2009}}; {{harvnb|John|Robins|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative counterparts==
Although more academic attention has focused on positive illusions, there are systematic negative illusions that are revealed under slightly different circumstances.&lt;ref name="notso"/&gt; For example, while college students rate themselves as more likely than average to live to 70, they believe they are less likely than average to live to 100. People regard themselves as above average on easy tasks such as riding a bicycle but below average on difficult tasks like riding a unicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kruger|1999}} as cited in {{harvnb|Sedikides |Gregg|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Moore named the latter effect the "[[worse-than-average effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, people overestimate their relative standing when their absolute standing is high and underestimate it when their absolute standing is low.&lt;ref name="notso"/&gt;

==Mitigation==
[[Depressive realism]] suggests that depressed people actually have a more realistic view of themselves and the world than mentally healthy people. The nature of [[depression (mood)|depression]] seems to have its role in diminishing positive illusions. For example, individuals who are low in [[self-esteem]], slightly depressed, or both, are more balanced in self-perceptions.{{sfn|Coyne|Gotlib|1983}} Likewise, these mildly depressed individuals are found to be less vulnerable to overestimations of (their) control over events{{sfn|Golin et al.|1979}} and to assess future circumstances in biased fashion.{{sfn|Ruehlman|West|Pasahow|1985}}

However, these findings may not be because depressed people have less illusions than nondepressed.  Studies such as {{harvtxt|Dykman et al.|1989}} show that depressed people believe they have no control in situations where they actually do, so their perspection is not more accurate overall. It might also be that the [[pessimism bias|pessimistic bias]] of depressives results in "depressive realism" when, for example, measuring estimation of control when there is none, as proposed by {{harvtxt|Allan et al.|2007}}. Also, {{harvtxt|Msetfi et al.|2005}} and {{harvtxt|Msetfi et al.|2007}} found that when replicating Alloy and Abramson's findings{{which?|date=June 2016}} the overestimation of control in nondepressed people only showed up when the interval was long enough, implying that this is because they take more aspects of a situation into account than their depressed counterparts.

Two hypotheses have been stated in the literature with regard to avoiding the drawbacks of positive illusions: firstly by minimising the illusions in order to take the full advantage of the benefits,&lt;ref name="baumeister1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baumeister|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly through making important decisions.{{sfn|Gollwitzer|Kinney|1989}} According to Roy Baumeister, a small amount of positive distortion may be optimal. He hypothesizes that those who fall within this optimal margin of illusion may provide for the best mental health.&lt;ref name="baumeister1989" /&gt;

After a [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]], victims are often subjected to [[scrutiny]] and, in some cases, [[Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims#Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse|mistreatment]].  Victims undergo medical examinations and are interviewed by police.  If there is a criminal trial, victims suffer a loss of [[privacy]] and their [[credible witness|credibility]] may be challenged.  Victims may also become the target of [[slut-shaming]], abuse, [[social stigma]]tization, [[sexual slur]]s and [[cyberbullying]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Various laws have been created with a motive to protect victims.  During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] protect victims from excessive public scrutiny.  Laws may also prohibit defence lawyers from obtaining a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records.   [[Statutory rape]] laws set the age of legal consent for sexual activity and prohibits perpetrators from alleging the victim consented to the activity.  Victims in some jurisdictions can seek damages from police and institutions if warnings were not issued.  Numerous victims' rights groups operate to improve the treatment of victims.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Examination and investigation of victim==
{{See|Rape#Treatment}}

===Medical examination ===
{{Main| Rape kit}}
Examiners may also collect fingernail scrapings and pluck head and pubic hairs.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Rebecca|last2=Feeney|first2=Hannah|last3=Fehler-Cabral|first3=Giannina|last4=Shaw|first4=Jessica|last5=Horsford|first5=Sheena|title=The National Problem of Untested Sexual Assault Kits (SAKs): Scope, Causes, and Future Directions for Research, Policy, and Practice|journal=Trauma, Violence, &amp; Abuse|date=December 23, 2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1177/1524838015622436}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the facility has the means, and the victim consents, the examiner will also take photographs of genital injuries.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits" /&gt;  A '[[rape kit]]' contains the items used by medical personnel for gathering and preserving physical evidence.

Many "rape kits" are untested because they are never submitted to [[crime lab]]s or because crime labs have insufficient resources to [[DNA profiling|test]] all of the submitted kits.&lt;ref name="Untested Kits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RAINN backlog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Addressing the Rape Kit Backlog|url=https://rainn.org/public-policy/legislative-agenda/fighting-sexual-violence-with-DNA|website=Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|publisher=RAINN|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell (2016) re Serial Rapists"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=R.|last2=Feeney|first2=H.|last3=Pierce|first3=S.

The [[Sexual Assault Survivors' Rights Act|Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016]] was enacted by the United States federal government on October 7, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text?resultIndex=3|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act gives victims the right: 
* to request the preservation of sexual assault evidence collection kit or its probative contents.
* to have the sexual assault evidence collection kit preserved, without charge, for the duration of the maximum applicable statute of limitations or 20 years, whichever is shorter
* to be informed of any result of a sexual assault evidence collection kit, including a DNA profile match, toxicology report, or other information collected as part of a medical forensic examination, if such disclosure would not impede or compromise an ongoing investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5578 - Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5578/text|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 October 2016|location=Chapter 238 - Section 3772|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interview by police===
As part of police investigations, victims are interviewed by police.  The interview is usually recorded, a transcript may be prepared and the interview may be made available to the public.  Discrepancies between the victim's statements to police and other evidence are grounds for the defence lawyer to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the [[credible witness|credibility]] of the victim.

In investigations involving [[acquaintance rape|acquaintance]] or [[date rape]], the electronic communications between the accused and the victim may be reviewed in order to determine if the victim [[consent]]ed to the sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Zuker|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Court of Justice|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 52 to 55|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[People v. Jovanovic]]'', the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|New York appeals court]] determined that emails from the alleged victim should be included in evidence and that the [[rape shield law]] did not apply.  The alleged victim had written about her sadomasochistic interests and experiences.

In Canada, a defense lawyer may be allowed to obtain copies of the victim's e-mails and other private documents using a legal procedure called a third-party records application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sarah Boesveld|authorlink1=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/news/how-did-ghomehis-defence-get-hold-of-5000-messages-between-complainants/|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=Chatelaine|title=How did Ghomeshi's defence get hold of 5,000 messages between complainants?|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If police believe the reported victim is making a [[false accusation of rape]], they may interrogate that person as a suspect rather than a victim.  In some cases, harsh questioning and social stigmatization has caused even actual victims of rape to recant and then be charged with making a false report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America |year=2018 |last=Miller |first=T. Christian |isbn= 978-1524759933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidentiality, harassment, smear campaigns and silencing===
{{See also|Nate Parker#1999 rape charges}}
In Canada, pursuant to sections 278.1 to 278.91 of the ''Criminal Code'' defence counsel are not allowed to obtain a victim's medical, psychiatric or therapeutic records .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 278.1 - Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-65.html#docCont|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada even though it limited the accused ability to provide a full answer and defence; see [[R v Mills|''R. v Mills'']].

An accused may hire a private investigator to investigate and harass a victim.  For example, according to the complaint in the civil lawsuit against Penn State University,  [[Nate Parker]] hired a private investigator to investigate and harass an 18-year-old student.  The student alleged she was raped by Parker and another student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kate Briquelet|author2=M.L.

(Parker was found not guilty of the rape charges.

Institutions may attempt to cover up sexual abuse, as seen in the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases]]. The movie ''[[Spotlight (film)|Spotlight]]'' deals with the coverup of sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

[[Dennis Hastert]] allegedly promised to pay $5 million to his victim in exchange for agreeing not to discuss the sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christy Gutowski|title=Judge may rule whether lawsuit filed by Dennis Hastert victim can proceed|accessdate=|agency=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=October 14, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities may fail to investigate allegations of sexual assault because the victims are perceived to be unreliable witnesses.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Girls: who is Sara Rowbotham?

The [[BBC One]] miniseries ''[[Three Girls (miniseries)|Three Girls]]'' deals with the systematic sexual abuse of young girls by a group of older Asian men in [[Rochdale child sex abuse ring|Rochdale]].  Authorities were slow to respond even though more than 100 referrals were made to the police and social services.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

[[Harvey Weinstein]] dispatched defense lawyers and publicists to undermine the credibility of his accusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haag|first1=Matthew|title=Harvey Weinstein Accused in Lawsuit of Sexually Assaulting Producer for Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F05%2F02%2Fnyregion%2Fharvey-weinstein-sexual-assault.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click|accessdate=2 May 2018|agency=New York Times|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus sexual assault victims==

In the United States, various legislation, government agencies, and initiatives have been created to deal with [[campus sexual assault]].  These include:

* [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]]
* [[Title IX]] requires schools receiving federal funds to protect students from gender-based violence and harassment – including sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title IX and Sexual Violence in Schools|url=https://www.aclu.org/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools?redirect=womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=12 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office for Civil Rights]]  investigates [[Title IX]] sexual violence complaints.
* The [[Campus Accountability and Safety Act]] (CASA) is a United States bill to reform the sexual assault investigation process and protect victims.  CASA includes a requirement that colleges and universities publish statistics relating to crime on their campuses.
* The [[Safe Campus Act]] is proposed U.S. legislation that would require schools to report allegations of sexual assault to law enforcement, but only if the victim consents.  However, if the victim does not consent the statute prohibits schools from initiating their own internal disciplinary procedures.

''[[The Hunting Ground]]'' is a critically acclaimed American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States.  Its creators say college administrations are failing to respond adequately to claims of sexual assault, while its critics have countered that the film was based on misleading statistics and biased against the alleged perpetrator.

==Sexual assault victims in the military==
Sexual Assault in the military is more prevalent than outside of the military and it is frequently under reported. In the United States, [[Sexual Assault Prevention Response]] (SAPR) is a training program designated to educate military service members and provide support and treatment to service members and their families.  Individuals are assigned to a SAPR Advocate to assist them with the different treatment options that are available to them and to educate them about their rights.

==Sexual assault of prisoners==

The [[Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003|''Prison Rape Elimination Act'']] is United States legislation enacted for the purpose of preventing sexual assaults in U.S. prisons.  The legislation requires reporting and information gathering.

{{Main|Prison rape in the United States}}

==Publication bans, duty to warn and self-censorship==

===Publication of victim's name and publication bans===
{{Main|Publication ban}}

In the United States, laws prohibiting the publication of a victim's name have been found to be unconstitutional and struck down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/directions/chap13.htm New Directions from the Field: Victims Rights and Services for the 21st Century] (Chapter 13), accessed October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn]]''  {{ussc|420|469|1975}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a Georgia statute that imposed civil liability on media for publishing a rape victim's name was unconstitutional.  The Court stated: "the First and Fourteenth Amendments command nothing less than that the States may not impose sanctions on the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection."  Also see ''[[Florida Star v. B. J. F.]]'', {{ussc|491|524|1989}} and ''State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp.'', 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994).

In Canada, the [[Canadian Press]] generally does not publish the names of alleged sexual assault victims without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alleged victim in Quebec politician sex assault case speaks|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/politics/alleged-victim-in-quebec-politician-sex-assault-speaks/ar-AAjeZaj?li=AAggFp5&amp;ocid=mailsignout|accessdate=22 October 2016|agency=The Canadian Press|date=October 21, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a court order may operate to prohibit publication.  Pursuant to paragraph 486.4(1)(a) of the ''[[Criminal Code]]'', the court may make an order "directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness" not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paragraph 486.4 of Criminal Code of Canada|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-106.html#docCont|website=Department of Justice (Canada)|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=21 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The victim has the option of waiving the [[publication ban]].

===Victim may be prohibited from discussing the assault===

In cases where the accused is under 18 years of age, the court may impose a [[publication ban]] to protect the privacy of the offender.

Seventeen-year-old [[Sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich|Savannah Dietrich]] was sexually assaulted by two teenagers.  The court ordered Dietrich not to discuss the case and she was threatened to be found in [[contempt of court|contempt]] when she published the names of the perpetrators on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plait |first=Phil |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/23/savannah_dietrich_outs_her_rapists_on_twitter_and_facebook.html |title=Savannah Dietrich outs her rapists on Twitter and Facebook |publisher=Slate.com |date=2012-07-23 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the section 110 of the  ''[[Youth Criminal Justice Act]]'' generally prohibits the publication of the name of the offender if the offender was under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Criminal Justice Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/y-1.5/page-21.html#h-33|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=29 October 2016|page=Section 110|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Youth Criminal Justice Act#Privacy}}

===Duty to warn the public===
{{Main|Duty to warn#Criminal Activity and Sexual Assault}}

The police, colleges and universities may be required to warn the public that a sexual assault has occurred.  Women should be warned of the risk they face and have the opportunity to take any specific measures to protect themselves from future attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice Macfarland|title=Doe v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Commissioners of Police, 1998 CanLII 14826 (ON SC)|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/1998/1998canlii14826/1998canlii14826.html?autocompleteStr=jane%20doe&amp;autocompletePos=2|publisher=Ontario Court (General Division)|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=English|date=July 3, 1998|quote=Ms. Doe brings a suit against the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force (hereafter referred to as MTPF) on two bases; firstly she suggests that the MTPF conducted a negligent investigation in relation to the balcony rapist and failed to warn women whom they knew to be potential targets of Callow of the fact that they were at risk. She says, as the result of such conduct, Callow was not apprehended as early as he might otherwise have been and she was denied the opportunity, had she known the risk she faced, to take any specific measures to protect herself from attack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may sue for damages if warnings are not issued.  In 1998, a sexual assault victim successfully sued the Toronto police for their failure to warn her that a serial rapist was active in her neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe v.

In the United States, the [[Clery Act]] imposes fines on colleges and universities that fail to warn students of criminal activity on or near campuses.  The law is named after Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University student who was raped and murdered in her campus hall of residence in 1986.  In relation to the [[Jerry Sandusky]] sexual abuse scandal, U.S. federal investigators are seeking to fine Penn State University $2.4 million for failing to warn of threats to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nick Anderson|title=Feds seek record $2.4 million fine against Penn State in Sandusky scandal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/feds-seek-record-24-million-fine-against-penn-state-in-sandusky-scandal/2016/11/03/7fbe7bf8-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_pennstate-250pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory|accessdate=4 November 2016|agency=Washington Post|date=November 3, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship by travel websites===
[[TripAdvisor]] apologized for repeatedly deleting forum posts about a resort where the victim had been raped by a security guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karen Schwartz|title=TripAdvisor to flag hotels where sexual assault occurred|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/11/09/tripadvisor-to-indicate-hotels-where-sexual-assault-occurred.html|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=10 November 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-censorship  ===
Self-censorship is when publications or people self-censor themselves in order to withhold information to protect their image or avoid receiving backlash. Some instances include:

* '''Self-censorship because subject is distasteful''' – Newspapers may [[self-censor]], choosing not to publish material about a sexual assault on the grounds that the subject is distasteful.  For example, there were complaints when [[The Des Moines Register]]  published stories about the rape of [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]].  One reader complained: 
::The disgusting and degrading details of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's rape have no place in a family newspaper the caliber of The Register.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Margolick|title=A Name, a Face and a Rape: Iowa Victim Tells Her Story|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/us/a-name-a-face-and-a-rape-iowa-victim-tells-her-story.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=13 February 2017|agency=New York Times|date=March 25, 1990|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-censorship because of ethnicity of the accused''' – Publication of information regarding sexual assaults may be suppressed because of fears of being thought racist.&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Katie Hall|title=Real or imagined: Racism 'fear' over Rotherham child abuse|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-28951612|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=9 October 2016|language=English|date=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 report regarding the child sexual assaults in Rotherham, England stated: "It is believed by a number of workers that one of the difficulties that prevent this issue [child sexual exploitation] being dealt with effectively is the ethnicity of the main perpetrators."&lt;ref name="BBC News Online"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Alexis Jay OBE|title=Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham (1997 – 2013)|url=http://www.rotherham.gov.uk/downloads/file/1407/independent_inquiry_cse_in_rotherham|publisher=Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council|accessdate=9 October 2016|pages=2|language=English|quote=By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue.

Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: With respect to the [[Rochdale child sex abuse ring]], it was suggested that police and social work departments failed to act when details of the gang emerged for fear of appearing racist, and vulnerable white teenagers being groomed by Pakistani men were ignored.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Self-censorship because "women would become hysterical"''' – In 1998, the Toronto police did not issue warnings regarding a serial rapist "because women would become hysterical or panic" and "the rapist would flee and the investigation would be compromised".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justice MacFarland|title=Doe v.

==Financial costs==
Victims may incur various financial costs because of the sexual assault; for example, costs related to moving (to get away from the perpetrator), a new mattress, legal fees, lost wages, lost tuition fees, new clothing, therapy and medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court to hear appeal in Mandi Gray sex assault case|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2017/03/13/court-to-hear-appeal-in-mandi-gray-sex-assault-case.html|accessdate=14 March 2017|agency=Toronto Star|date=March 14, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduct of legal proceedings==
{{Main|Laws regarding rape}}

===Statutes of limitations===
A [[statute of limitations]] law may preclude a victim from pressing criminal charges.  Limitations periods vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  For example, in Pennsylvania charges must be filed within 12 years of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sydney Ember|author2=Graham Bowley|title=After Bill Cosby, States Shift on Statutes of Limitations in Sexual Assault Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/arts/television/after-bill-cosby-states-shift-sexual-assault-statutes-of-limitations.html|accessdate=7 November 2016|agency=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=November 7, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory rape===
[[Statutory rape]] is sexual activity in which one of the individuals is below the [[age of consent]].  The age of consent is the age at which a young person is capable of [[consent]]ing to sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen v. Omar Abdallah Hajar|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2016/2016abca222/2016abca222.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAPImFnZSBvZiBjb25zZW50AAAAAAE&amp;resultIndex=7|publisher=Alberta Court of Appeal|accessdate=18 November 2016|location=Para. 30|language=English|date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These laws were enacted to recognize the inherent power imbalance between adults and children and that children are incapable of giving true consent to sexual acts with adults.  The laws protect children from undue influence, persuasion and manipulation.

In 2016, the Government of Turkey proposed legislation that would overturn a man conviction for child sex assault if they married their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=AFP in Turkey|title=Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry their victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-
marry-their-victims|accessdate=19 November 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 16, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consent===
Defence counsel may argue the victim consented to the sexual activity.  Determining if the victim consented can be problematic when the victim is intoxicated.  A [[Nova Scotia]] court found there was no sexual assault because the prosecution could not prove the sexual activity was non-consensual.  In that case, the sexual activity occurred in the back of a taxi cab between a taxi driver and an intoxicated customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael Gorman|title=Crown appeals acquittal in taxi sex assault case where judge said 'drunk can consent'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/sex-assault-taxi-drunk-1.4013364|accessdate=7 March 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 7, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cindy Gladue bled to death from an 11-centimetre cut in her vagina.  At trial, the accused said Ms. Gladue died after a night of consensual, rough sex in an Edmonton motel.  He was acquitted.  The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Chris Purdy |title=Supreme Court to hear questions in case of Ontario trucker acquitted in death of Edmonton woman |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/supreme-court-cindy-gladue-sexual-assault-1.4855218 |accessdate=13 October 2018 |agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=October 9, 2018 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Rape shield laws===
In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government: ALRC: [http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/20.%20Matters%20Outside%20the%20Uniform%20Evidence%20Acts/rape-shield-laws 20. Matters Outside the Uniform Evidence Acts - Rape shield laws]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and the United States, the prior sexual history of the victim is generally not admissible as evidence during a criminal proceeding.  These laws are referred to as [[rape shield laws]].

In Canada, the constitutionality of the [[rape shield law]] was challenged on the grounds that it hampers a defendant's ability to present a defence.  The law was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada: see ''[[R v Darrach]]''.

===Victim representation===
In Canadian criminal proceedings, the Crown prosecutor does not act on behalf of the victim and is not the victim's lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''29. Who represents the victim during the trial? Should I get a lawyer to ensure that my rights are met during the trial?'''&lt;br /&gt;
Crown counsel is not and can never function as the victim's lawyer. Although the Crown appears to be representing the interests of the victim, the Crown is the lawyer for the Queen and the government during the trial. In Canadian criminal cases, the harm is perceived to have been committed against the State. This is why cases are referred to as Regina v. Smith (or R. v. Smith), Regina being the Queen in Latin. The Crown is truly representing the society, of which you are a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Victim's Guide to the Canadian Criminal Justice System: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.crcvc.ca/docs/A_Victims_Guide_to_the_Canadian_CJS_07.pdf|publisher=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=19 September 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other===
Sexual assault cases commonly involve multiple complainants.  In these cases, the defence is likely to apply for separate trials for each offence.
[[Joinder]] of multiple counts is only permitted in certain circumstances.

The decision to have separate trials is discretionary and is exercised in order to prevent prejudice to the defendant.  The threshold question for holding a joint trial is whether or not each complainant's evidence will be admissible in respect of the charges involving the other complainants (that is, whether such evidence is 'cross-admissible'). Decisions to hold separate trials or refuse to admit relevant tendency or propensity evidence about a defendant's sexual behaviour can be seen as barriers to the successful prosecution of sex offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Violence—A National Legal Response|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/26.%20Reporting%2C%20Prosecution%20and%20Pre-trial%20Processes/joint-or-separate-trial|publisher=Government of Australia - Law Reform Commission|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Section 26 - Joint or separate trial|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sexual assault charges against [[Jian Ghomeshi]] involved multiple complainants and were dealt with in two separate proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mark Gollom|title=Jian Ghomeshi found not guilty on choking and all sex assault charges|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/jian-ghomeshi-sexual-assault-trial-ruling-1.3505446|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=March 24, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second trial did not proceed after Ghomeshi agreed to issue an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBC apologizes to Kathryn Borel over handling of Jian Ghomeshi complaint|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cbc-apology-kathryn-borel-ghomeshi-peace-bond-1.3577223|accessdate=29 October 2016|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=May 11, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A victim of sexual assault may be subjected to speculative allegations of wrongdoing during [[cross-examination]].  For example, in ''R. v. Sofyan Boalag''&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v Sofyan Boalag|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlpc/doc/2016/2016nlpc113/2016nlpc113.html?resultIndex=3|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=19 September 2016|location=Paragraph 105|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the defence lawyer asserted during the cross-examination that the victim was in fact asking for money in exchange for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rosie Mullaley|title='This man raped me'|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-13/article-4557844/%26lsquo%3BThis-man-raped-me%26rsquo%3B/1|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=The Telegram|date=June 13, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, the accused was convicted of 13 criminal offences involving six victims including multiple sexual assaults at knife point.&lt;ref name="R. v Sofyan Boalag"/&gt;

A victim's alcohol consumption at the time of the assault may undermine the victim's ability to remember the assault and his or her ability to provide credible [[testimony]].  As noted by Justice Zuker of the Ontario Court of Justice: &lt;blockquote&gt;[414] What makes someone a perfect target in the context of alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults may make that person a poor witness in any ensuing proceedings due to his or her inability to remember part or all of what happened.  
[415] One of the more challenging (and ever-present) issues to evaluate in sexual assault is the question of [[consent]]. Sexual assaults may involve alcohol consumption by one or both parties. Frequently, parties to an incident will have limited or no memory of the events in question, and the court will be required to obtain and evaluate information provided by other witnesses or other corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v. Ururyar - Ontario Court of Justice 2016 448|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2016/2016oncj448/2016oncj448.html?autocompleteStr=urur&amp;autocompletePos=1|website=www.Canlii.org|publisher=Ontario Superior Court of Justice|accessdate=20 September 2016|location=Paragraphs 414 and 415}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During cross examination a victim's attire may be scrutinized and they may be accused of wearing revealing clothing.  For example, a Toronto woman, who alleged she was sexually assaulted by three police officers after a party, was asked about her choice of wearing a top described as "really low cut with open sleeves" to a party mostly attended by "young men ... who would be drinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Trevor Dunn|title=Complainant denies defence's claim she wanted sex with Toronto officers accused of assaulting her|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/trial-tps-cross-examination-1.4151926|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=June 8, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[cross-examination]], a victim's criminal record may be noted in order to [[witness impeachment|impeach]] their [[Credible witness|credibility]]. This tactic was unsuccessfully used in the trial of [[Daniel Holtzclaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury convicts ex-Oklahoma cop Daniel Holtzclaw of rape, sodomy charges; faces life in prison|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/jury-convicts-ex-oklahoma-rape-charges-article-1.2462256|accessdate=10 October 2016|agency=Daily News|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-assault social stigma, mistreatment and abuse==
Victims of sexual assault are often subjected to [[social stigma]]. The victim may be subject to inappropriate post-assault behaviour or language by medical personnel or other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell R, Raja S |title=Secondary victimization of rape victims: insights from mental health professionals who treat survivors of violence |journal=Violence Vict |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=261–75 |year=1999 |pmid=10606433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slut-shaming]] is the practice of [[victim blaming|blaming the victim]] for [[rape]] and other forms of [[sexual assault]].  It rests on the idea that sexual assault is caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex,&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for it: a first-hand account from slutwalk |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.

The [[SlutWalk]] challenges the idea of explaining or excusing rape by referring to any aspect of a woman's appearance.  The [[SlutWalk]] was created in response to comments by a Toronto Police officer who said: "I've been told I'm not supposed to say this – however, women should avoid dressing like [[sluts]] in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for it: a first-hand account from slutwalk |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2012.699777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Indian politicians suggested that women's clothing choices could invite sexual assault.   The comments were made after a number of women were molested at a New Year's Eve party in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Amy Wang|title=Indian politicians cause outrage after blaming alleged groping on women's 'Western' clothes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/04/indian-politicians-cause-outrage-after-blaming-alleged-groping-on-womens-western-clothes/?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-in-the-news%3Apage%2Fin-the-news|accessdate=4 January 2017|agency=Washington Post|date=January 4, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the U.S. television program ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', [[Joy Behar]] referred to [[Bill Clinton sexual misconduct allegations|Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers]] as "[[Tramp#Tramp as promiscuous woman|tramps]]".

Sexual assault victims may stay away from work in order to avoid contact with the perpetrator.   For example, Caroline Lamarre, an office worker who was sexually assaulted at work, has not returned to work in order to avoid contact with her assailant.  The assailant was convicted of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Convicted of sexual assault, Quebec mayor still presides while victim 'becomes the villain'|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/victim-becomes-the-villain-sexually-assaulted-by-quebec-mayor-woman-is-out-of-work-while-he-continues-to-preside|accessdate=28 February 2017|publisher=National Post|date=February 28, 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of sexual assault may be subjected to [[cyberbullying]], as in the case of the [[suicide of Audrie Pott]], [[suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons]] and [[sexual assault of Savannah Dietrich]].

The [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Audrie &amp; Daisy]]'' is about two American high school students who were sexually assaulted by other students.  At the time they were assaulted, [[Audrie Pott]] was 15 and [[Daisy Coleman]] was 14 years old.  After the assaults, the victims and their families were subjected to abuse and [[cyberbullying]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Nosheen Iqbal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/19/audrie-and-daisy-high-school-sexual-assault-netflix-shame-bullying-teenagers-online|accessdate=19 September 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=September 19, 2016|title=Audrie and Daisy: an unflinching account of high-school sexual assault|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie ''[[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story]]'' is the true story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer, an Iowa resident who was raped in 1991.  Her story was groundbreaking because she spoke openly about her experiences including her interactions with hospital staff, the police, prosecutors, the accused, and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/2|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Des Moines Register won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]] in 1991 for publishing the story of Nancy Ziegenmeyer's sexual assault.  At the time the article was published it was unusual to publish the victim's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1991 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Public Service|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/des-moines-register|website=Pulitzer.ort|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ziegenmeyer wrote a book, ''Taking Back My Life'', to encourage women to seek help after they've been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Ziegenmeyer Interview|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/9927|website=CharlieRose.com|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, rape victims are at very high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. These acts may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.  In addition, the relatives of the victim may threaten the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/rape-victim-threatened-to-withdraw-case-in-up_694364.html |title=Rape victim threatened to withdraw case in UP |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2011-03-19 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |title=Stigmatization of Rape &amp; Honor Killings |publisher=WISE Muslim Women |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108041415/http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harter |first=Pascale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 |title=BBC News - Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-06-14|accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, girls and women who are raped are forced by their families to marry their rapist.  A [[arranged marriage|marriage is arranged]] because victims are deemed to have their "reputation" tarnished.  There is extreme [[social stigma]] related to being the victim of rape and the loss of [[virginity]].  Marriage is claimed to be advantageous for both the victim—who does not remain unmarried and doesn't lose social status—and of the rapist, who avoids punishment.

In 2012, the [[Suicide of Amina Filali|suicide of a 16-year-old Moroccan girl]]—who, after having been forced by her family to marry her rapist at the suggestion of the prosecutor, and who subsequently endured abuse by the rapist after they married—sparked protests from activists against the law which allows the rapist to marry the victim in order to escape criminal sanctions, and against this social practice which is common in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |publisher=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the government of [[Turkey]] introduced legislation which would overturn a man's conviction for child sex assault if he married his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fury at Turkish bill to clear men of child sex assault if they marry victims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/18/turkish-bill-to-clear-men-of-child-sex-assault-if-the-marry-their-victims|accessdate=27 December 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=November 22, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim support==
Victims often receive support from the community and other victims.  For example, when [[Taking Back My Life: The Nancy Ziegenmeyer Story|Nancy Ziegenmeyer]] went public regarding her experience, "she was inundated with letters and phone calls of support, thanks and praise for her courage in going public. Many of the letters were from women who had been raped and had lived with their secrets, often telling no one, often blaming themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Catharine Reeve|title=Taking Back Her Life - Public Disclosure Helps One Victim Of Rape Become A Survivor|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-02-23/features/9201170624_1_nancy-ziegenmeyer-parking-lot-grabbed/3|accessdate=13 February 2017|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=February 23, 1992|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victims' rights==
{{Main|Victims' rights}}

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'' report was published in response to allegations of sexual abuse made against English DJ and BBC Television presenter [[Jimmy Savile]].  The Director of Public Prosecutions described the report as marking a "watershed moment" and apologised for "shortcomings" in the handling of prior abuse claims. The report's publication resulted in some highlighting what could be systemic failure because of the number of complainants and institutions identified, but others criticised it for treating allegations as facts.

In the United States, the [[Crime Victims' Rights Act]] grants rights to victims including the right to be reasonably protected from the accused.  Similarly, in Canada the ''Canadian Victims Bill of Rights'' provides rights to victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Victims Bill of Rights|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-23.7/index.html|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=30 October 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are victims' rights groups. [[Rise (non-governmental organization)|Rise]] is an NGO working to implement a bill of rights for sexual assault victims. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN) is an American group which carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and to ensure that rapists are brought to justice. The [[Victim Rights Law Center]] is an American non-profit organization that provides free legal services to victims of [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]]. In the United States, the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] works to administer justice and strengthen services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In South Africa, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA) is a women's rights organisation that provides services and engages in advocacy to promote women's rights and improve women's quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People Opposing Women Abuse website|url=http://www.powa.co.za/POWA/about-us/|accessdate=13 November 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Problem-solving courts''' (PSC) address the underlying problems that contribute to criminal behavior and are a current trend in the legal system of the [[United States]]. In 1989, a judge in Miami began to take a hands-on approach to drug addicts, ordering them into treatment, rather than perpetuating the revolving door of court and prison. The result was creation of [[drug court]], a [[diversion program]]. That same concept began to be applied to difficult situations where legal, social and human problems mesh.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=In Problem-Solving Court, Judges Turn Therapist| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/26/nyregion/26courts.html |accessdate=10 April 2012| newspaper=New York Times|date=April 26, 2005| author=Kaufman, Leslie| author2=Eaton, Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were over 2,800 problem-solving courts in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=A New Way of doing Business|journal=Journal of Court Innovation|date=Summer 2009|format=PDF|pages=1|url=https://www.bja.gov/publications/cci_ps_roundtable.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to provide a method of resolving the problem in order to reduce [[recidivism]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Efforts ==
[[Judith Kaye]] was [[Chief Judge]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] from 1993–2008 where she was most responsible for implementing court reform utilizing problem-solving courts in her state, one of the first in the nation. She also co-founded the [[Center for Court Innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org |title=The Center for Court Innovation |publisher=Courtinnovation.org |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a non-profit [[think tank]] headquartered in New York that helps courts and criminal justice agencies decrease crime, provide aid to victims and increase the public's confidence in the justice system.&lt;ref name="Center for Court Innovation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/10th_Anniversary1.pdf |title=A Decade of Change: The First 10 Years of the Center for Court Innovation|format=PDF |publisher=Center for Court Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Center for Court Innovation researchers explored whether problem-solving justice always requires a specialized court or if core principles and practices from these specialized courts are transferable to conventional courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/Applying%20Problem-SolvingModel.pdf|title=Applying the problem-solving model outside of problem-solving courts |format=PDF |publisher=Judicature}}&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing judges, attorneys and representatives from probation departments and service providers, researchers concluded that a number of principles—such as judicial monitoring and linking offenders to services—could be transferable. The study, conducted in cooperation with the Collaborative Justice Courts Advisory Committee of the Judicial Council of California, was the first of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/California_Story.pdf|title=California's Collaborative Justice Courts|publisher=Courtinfo.ca.gov|format=PDF|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, [[The New Press]] published ''Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman |first=Greg |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1565849736/ |title=Good Courts: The Case For Problem-solving Justice (9781565849730): Greg Berman, John Feinblatt, Sarah Glazer: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to describe the problem-solving court movement in detail, ''Good Courts'' features profiles of Center demonstration projects. The book is being used in law schools and public policy schools, due in part to a law school course on problem-solving justice that the Center piloted at [[Fordham Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research/Good Courts: The Case for Problem-Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/research/good-courts-case-problem-solving-justice-0|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PSJ-course&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/_uploads/documents/psjlawschoolcourse.pdf |title=Problem-Solving Justice: A Law School Course |format=PDF |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Association of Drug Court Professionals]] had more than 25,000 members working in 2,663 drug courts and 1,219 other problem-solving courts as of late 2011. Their annual conference offers education and training from experts for problem-solving professionals world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NADCP 18th Annual Training Conference|url=http://www.policyoptions.org/camden/article/nadcp-18th-annual-training-conference|publisher=Policy Options, Inc.|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both problem-solving courts and the use of [[therapeutic jurisprudence]] greatly improved the outcomes of most cases. Programs have been established for [[teen court]], [[DWI court]], re-entry court&lt;ref name=Re&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=Reentry Courts: Looking Ahead|url=https://www.bja.gov/Publications/CCI_ReentryCourts.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Justice Assistance|format=PDF|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community court]], [[Domestic violence court]], Sex offense court,&lt;ref name=SEX&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Kristine|title=Sex Offense Courts: The Next Step in Community Management?|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/research/sex-offense-courts-next-step-community-management|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mental health court]], and [[veterans' court]].&lt;ref name=VETS&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMichael|first=William H.|title=The Battle on the Home Front: Special Courts Turn to Vets to Help Other Vets|journal=ABA Journal|date=November 1, 2011|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_battle_on_the_home_front_special_courts_turn_to_vets_to_help_other_vets/|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
According to the Center for Court Innovation, there are six principles required for problem-solving courts to be effective. There must be ''better information'' available to the staff through training, and comprehensive defendant information for justice officials.
''Community engagement'' with the public will encourage cooperation of witnesses, jurors, &amp; community watch groups, and foster trust.
''Collaboration'' between legal officials (judges/prosecutors/attorneys/probation officers), social service providers, victim groups and schools will keep everyone focused on the goal.
''Individualized Justice'' links offenders to the services they need and provides services for victims to aid in their recovery.
Offenders must be held ''accountable'' with compliance monitoring and consequences for non-compliance.
''Outcomes'' need to be analyzed for cost versus benefit, and to provide continuous improvement of the process.&lt;ref name=Prin&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Robert V.|title=Principles of Problem Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/topic/problem-solving-justice |publisher=Bureau of Justice Assistance|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences ==
Problem-solving courts look just like traditional courts, but defendants are referred to as "clients" and the judge has extensive knowledge about the client and talks with them directly. A client placed in a treatment program is monitored by the judge for months or years, and will return to court periodically to assess progress and/or problems. The judge can order the client to serve jail time as a punishment while in a treatment program, and the judge decides when the client is to be released from the program.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Criticism ==
A 2005 article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that because judges have total discretion, the results can be inconsistent. When that situation existed in the criminal justice system, mandatory sentencing guidelines were instituted. Legal scholars have warned that judges may also force their values upon defendants from different cultures. Those critical of the system say many treatment programs are unnecessarily harsh, and any deviation from the rules is punished.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Some public defenders have criticized the use of problem-solving courts because accused persons who accept intervention are implicitly treated as guilty; the courts do not allow an accused person to receive a determination of innocence or guilt.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; New York Supreme Court Judge James A. Yates has characterized their use as a trend toward "an inquisitorial system of justice".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Judges in problem-solving courts need other skills beyond a knowledge of the law; they also must sometimes function as a social worker, therapist, and accountant. Law schools have only recently begun to provide courses on problem-solving justice,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name=PSJ-course /&gt; and New York Judge Fern Fisher commented that not all judges have the patience and attitude necessary to be effective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== Federal guidance ==
The [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]] (BJA) is the branch of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] tasked with proving the concept and providing guidelines to state court systems that seek to implement a program. The BJA identified ten projects and provided funding to demonstrate the theories in practice and document their results. They also provide hands-on assistance for any judicial entity seeking to establish a problem-solving court.&lt;ref name=PSJ-site&gt;{{cite web|title=Problem-Solving Justice|url=http://www.courtinnovation.org/topic/problem-solving-justice|publisher=Center for Court Innovation|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49272">In [[biology]], '''quorum sensing''' is the ability to detect and to respond to cell [[population density]] by [[gene regulation]]. As one example, quorum sensing (QS) enables [[bacteria]] to restrict the expression of specific [[gene]]s to the high cell densities at which the resulting [[phenotype]]s will be most beneficial. Many species of [[bacteria]] use quorum sensing to coordinate [[gene expression]] according to the density of their local population. In similar fashion, some [[social insects]] use quorum sensing to determine where to nest.

In addition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics. In general, quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any [[decentralized system]] in which the components have: (a) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Bacteria==
Some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of [[bacteria]]. Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain [[phenotype]] expressions, which in turn, coordinate their behaviours. Some common phenotypes include [[biofilm]] formation, [[virulence]] factor expression, and [[motility]]. Certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate [[bioluminescence]], [[nitrogen fixation]] and [[Spore|sporulation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Jiachuan|last2=Ren |first2=Dacheng |date=2009-11-01 |title=Quorum sensing inhibitors: a patent overview|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/13543770903222293 |journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|volume=19 |issue=11|pages=1581–1601 |doi=10.1517/13543770903222293|issn=1354-3776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing functions based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Melissa B.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2001-10-01|title=Quorum Sensing in Bacteria|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|journal=Annual Review of Microbiology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=165–199 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|issn=0066-4227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur within a single bacterial species, as well as between diverse species. Both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] bacteria use quorum sensing, but there are some major differences in their mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassler|first=Bonnie L|title=How bacteria talk to each other: regulation of gene expression by quorum sensing|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369527499000259|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=2|issue=6|pages=582–587 |doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)00025-9|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
For the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively, they must possess three characteristics: to secrete a signaling molecule, an [[autoinducer]], to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules, and to regulate gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] as a response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is highly dependent on the [[diffusion]] mechanism of the signaling molecules. QS Signaling&amp;nbsp;molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria. At low cell density, the molecules may just diffuse away. At high cell density, the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level, and trigger changes in gene expressions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Gram-positive Bacteria====
Gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptide (AIP) as their autoinducers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Steven T.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2012-11-01|title=Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Its Role in Virulence and Possibilities for Its Control|url=http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/2/11/a012427|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine |volume=2|issue=11|pages=a012427 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a012427| pmid=23125205|pmc=3543102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of AIP in the environment, AIP bind to a receptor to activate [[kinase]]. The kinase phosphorylates a [[transcription factor]], which regulated gene transcription. This is called a [[Two-component regulatory system|two-component system]].

Another possible mechanism is that AIP is transported into the cytosol, and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Gram-negative Bacteria====
Gram-negative bacteria produce [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone|N-acyl homoserine lactones]] (AHL) as their signaling molecule.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually AHLs do not need additional processing, and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell.pdf|thumb|Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell]]

===Examples===

====''Aliivibrio fischeri''====
Quorum sensing was first observed in ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'', a bioluminescent bacterium that lives as a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[symbiont]] in the [[photophore]] (or light-producing organ) of the [[Hawaiian bobtail squid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nealson |first=K. |last2=Platt |first2=T. |last3=Hastings |first3=J.W. |year=1970 |title=The cellular control of the synthesis and activity of the bacterial luminescent system |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/104/1/313 |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=313–22 |pmid=5473898 |pmc=248216}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''A. fischeri'' cells are free-living (or [[plankton]]ic), the autoinducer is at low concentration, and, thus, cells do not show luminescence. However, when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore (about {{10^|11}} cells/ml), transcription of [[luciferase]] is induced, leading to [[bioluminescence]].

====''Escherichia coli''====
In the Gram-negative bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), cell division may be partially regulated by [[AI-2]]-mediated quorum sensing. This species uses AI-2, which is produced and processed by the ''[[Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor|lsr]]'' [[operon]]. Part of it encodes an [[ABC transporter]], which imports AI-2 into the cells during the early stationary (latent) phase of growth. AI-2 is then phosphorylated by the LsrK [[kinase]], and the newly produced phospho-AI-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress LsrR, a repressor of the ''lsr'' operon (thereby activating the operon). Transcription of the ''lsr'' operon is also thought to be inhibited by [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) through its competitive binding to LsrR. [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] has also been shown to inhibit the ''lsr'' operon through [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-CAPK-mediated inhibition. This explains why, when grown with [[glucose]], ''E. coli'' will lose the ability to internalize AI-2 (because of [[catabolite repression]]). When grown normally, [[AI-2]] presence is transient.

''E. coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' do not produce AHL signals commonly found in other Gram-negative bacteria. However, they have a receptor that detects AHLs from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other "quorate" populations of Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahmer, B.M. |title=Cell-to-cell signalling in ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' |journal=Mol. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=933–45 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15130116 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gram Positive Bacteria Quorum Sensing.pdf|thumb|213x213px|Gram positive bacteria quorum sensing]]

====''Salmonella enterica''====
''[[Salmonella]]'' encodes a LuxR homolog, SdiA, but does not encode an AHL synthase. SdiA detects AHLs produced by other species of bacteria including ''Aeromonas hydrophila'', ''Hafnia alvei'', and ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael, B. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Swift, S. |author4=Heffron, F. |author5=Ahmer, B.M. |title=SdiA of Salmonella enterica is a LuxR homolog that detects mixed microbial communities |journal= J. Bacteriol. |volume=183 |issue=19 |pages=5733–42 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11544237 |pmc=95466 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.19.5733-5742.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AHL is detected, SdiA regulates the ''rck'' operon on the ''Salmonella'' virulence plasmid (''pefI-srgD-srgA-srgB-rck-srgC'') and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome ''srgE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ahmer, B.M. |author2=van Reeuwijk, J. |author3=Timmers, C.D. |author4=Valentine, P.J. |author5=Heffron, F. |title=Salmonella typhimurium encodes an SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor of the LuxR family, that regulates genes on the virulence plasmid |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=180 |issue=5 |pages=1185–93 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9495757 |pmc=107006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.N. |author2=Ahmer, B.M. |title=Detection of other microbial species by Salmonella: expression of the SdiA regulon |journal=J.

However, SdiA does become activated when ''Salmonella'' transits through turtles colonized with ''Aeromonas hydrophila'' or mice infected with ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.N. |author2=Dyszel, J.L. |author3=Soares, J.A. |title=SdiA, an N-acylhomoserine lactone receptor, becomes active during the transit of Salmonella enterica through the gastrointestinal tract of turtles |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e2826 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002826 |pmid=18665275 |pmc=2475663 |editor=Ausubel, Frederick M.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dyszel, J.L. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Lucas, D.E. |title=Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can detect acyl homoserine lactone production by Yersinia enterocolitica in mice |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=192 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |date=January 2010 |pmid=19820103 |doi=10.1128/JB.01139-09 |pmc=2798265|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''Salmonella'' appears to use SdiA to detect the AHL production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora.

====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====
The opportunistic pathogen ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of [[biofilm]], [[swarming motility]], [[exopolysaccharide]] production, virulence, and cell aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis Sauer, K. |author2=Camper, A. |author3=Ehrlich, G. |author4=Costerton, J. |author5=Davies, D. |title=Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during development as a biofilm |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=184 |issue=4 |pages=1140–54 |year=2002 |issn=0021-9193 |doi=10.1128/jb.184.4.1140-1154.2002 |pmid=11807075 |pmc=134825}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria can grow within a host without harming it, until they reach a threshold concentration. Then they become aggressive, developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host's [[immune system]], and form a [[biofilm]], leading to [[disease]] within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacteria population. Another form of [[gene regulation]] that allows the [[bacteria]] to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling. Recent studies have discovered that [[anaerobiosis]] can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing.

Certain bacteria can produce enzymes called [[lactonase]]s that can target and inactivate AHLs.
Researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria (Quorum quenching). mBTL is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = CT. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = A quorum-sensing inhibitor blocks Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm formation | journal = PNAS | volume = 110 | issue = 44| pages = 17981–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1316981110 | pmid=24143808 | pmc=3816427}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds (such as [[caffeine]]) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norizan | first1 = S. | last2 = Chan | first2 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Caffeine as a potential quorum-sensing inhibitor | url = | journal = Sensors | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 5117–5129 | doi = 10.3390/s130405117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area has been promising and could lead to the development of natural compounds as effective therapeutics.

===Evolution===

====Sequence analysis====
The majority of quorum sensing systems that fall under the "two-gene" (an autoinducer synthase coupled with a receptor molecule) paradigm as defined by the ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'' system occur in the [[Gram-negative]] [[Proteobacteria]]. A comparison between the Proteobacteria [[phylogeny]] as generated by [[16S ribosomal RNA]] sequences and phylogenies of LuxI-, LuxR-, or LuxS-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity. Overall, the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the Proteobacteria phylum as a whole. This indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient, and arose very early in the Proteobacteria lineage.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gray, K.M. |author2=Garey, J.R. |title=The evolution of bacterial LuxI and LuxR quorum sensing regulators |journal=Microbiology |volume= 147 |year=2001 |pages=2379–87 |pmid=11496014 |issue=Pt 8 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-147-8-2379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerat, E. |author2=Moran, N.A. |title=Evolutionary history of quorum-sensing systems in bacteria |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |year=2004 |pages=903–13 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh097 |pmid=15014168 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although examples of [[horizontal gene transfer]] are apparent in LuxI, LuxR, and LuxS phylogenies, they are relatively rare. This result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome. A recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree. Given that the majority of autoinducer–synthase/receptor occurs in tandem in bacterial genomes, it is also rare that they switch partners and so pairs tend to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

In quorum sensing genes of [[Gammaproteobacteria]], which includes ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', the LuxI/LuxR genes form a functional pair, with LuxI as the auto-inducer synthase and LuxR as the receptor. Gamma Proteobacteria are unique in possessing quorum sensing genes, which, although functionally similar to the LuxI/LuxR genes, have a markedly divergent sequence.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt; This family of quorum-sensing [[homology (biology)|homologs]] may have arisen in the gamma Proteobacteria ancestor, although the cause of their extreme sequence divergence yet maintenance of functional similarity has yet to be explained. In addition, species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the gamma Proteobacteria, and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

====Controversy====
As quorum sensing implies a cooperative behavior, this concept has been challenged by the evolutionary implication of cooperative cheaters. This is circumvented by the concept of ''diffusion sensing'', which has been an alternative and complementary model to quorum sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redfield|first1=RJ|title=Is quorum sensing a side effect of diffusion sensing|journal=Trends in Microbiology|date=2002|volume=10|issue=8|pages=365–370|pmid=12160634|doi=10.1016/s0966-842x(02)02400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both explanations face the problems of signalling in either complex (multiple species sharing the same space) or simple (one single cell confined to a limited volume) environments where the spatial distribution of the cells can be more important for sensing than the cell population density. A new model, ''efficiency sensing'', which takes into account both problematics, population density and spatial confinement, has been proposed as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hense, B.A. |author2=Kuttler, C. |author3=Müller, J. |author4=Rothballer, M. |author5=Hartmann, A. |author6=Kreft, J.U. |title=Does efficiency sensing unify diffusion and quorum sensing? |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=5 |pages=230–39 |year=2007 |pmid=17304251 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n3/full/nrmicro1600.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1600 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the probable reasons for controversy is that current terminologies (quorum sensing, diffusion sensing, efficiency sensing) arise from different models of how natural selection has acted to shape and maintain the process.  Since each of the various models does apply under some circumstances but not others, a sensible resolution to these controversies could be to return the terminology of the process to autoinduction, as originally described by Hastings and coworkers, as this term does not imply understanding of the function of the process.

====Interaction of quorum-sensing molecules with mammalian cells and its medical applications====
Next to the potential antimicrobial functionality, quorum-sensing derived molecules, especially the peptides, are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well, including immunology, central nervous system disorders and oncology.

====''Methanosaeta harundinacea'' 6Ac====

==Plants==
Quorum sensing could be described when it was known that bacteria possess the ability to communicate. In the last few years, interactions between bacteria and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] hosts, such as plants, have been shown. These interactions are facilitated by quorum-sensing molecules and play a major role in maintaining the pathogenicity of bacteria towards other hosts, such as humans. This mechanism can be understood by looking at the effects of [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL), one of the quorum sensing-signalling molecules in [[gram-negative bacteria]], on plants. The model organism used is ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Götz-Rösch |first=Christine |last2=Sieper |first2=Tina |last3=Fekete |first3=Agnes |last4=Schmitt-Kopplin |first4=Philippe |last5=Hartmann |first5=Anton |last6=Schröder |first6=Peter |date=2015-04-10 |title=Influence of bacterial N-acyl-homoserine lactones on growth parameters, pigments, antioxidative capacities and the xenobiotic phase II detoxification enzymes in barley and yam bean |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00205 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4392610 |pmid=25914699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of AHLs having long carbon-chains (C12, C14), which have an unknown receptor mechanism, is less well understood than AHLs having short carbon-chains (C4, C6, C8), which are perceived by the [[G protein-coupled receptor]]. A phenomenon called "AHL priming", which is a dependent signalling pathway, enhanced our knowledge of long-chain AHLs. The role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories: host physiology–based impact of quorum sensing molecules; ecological effects; and cellular signaling. Calcium signalling and [[calmodulin]] have a large role in short-chain AHLs response in ''Arabidopsis''. Research was also conducted on [[barley]] and crop [[Pachyrhizus erosus|yam bean]] that reveals the AHLs determining the detoxification enzymes called [[Glutathione S-transferase|GST]] were found less in yam bean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hartmann |first=Anton |last2=Schikora |first2=Adam |date=2015-08-19 |title=Editorial: Plant responses to bacterial quorum sensing molecules |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00643 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4541025 |pmid=26347761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing-based regulatory systems are necessary to plant-disease-causing bacteria. Looking towards developing new strategies based on plant-associated microbiomes, the aim of further study is to improve the quantity and quality of the food supply.

==Social insects==
Social insect colonies are an excellent example of a [[decentralized system]], because no individual is in charge of directing or making decisions for the colony. Several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making.

===Examples===

====Ants====
Colonies of the ant ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' nest in small crevices between rocks. When the rocks shift and the nest is broken up, these ants must quickly choose a new nest to move into. During the first phase of the decision-making process, a small portion of the workers leave the destroyed nest and search for new crevices. When one of these scout ants finds a potential nest, she assesses the quality of the crevice based on a variety of factors including the size of the interior, the number of openings (based on light level), and the presence or absence of dead ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Dornhaus, A. |title=Not everything that counts can be counted: ants use multiple metrics for a single nest trait |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1583 |pages=165–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16555783 |pmc=1560019 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3312|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Hooper, J. |title=Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants |journal=Biology Letters |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=190–2 |year=2005 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302 |pmid=17148163 |pmc=1626204|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worker then returns to the destroyed nest, where she waits for a short period before recruiting other workers to follow her to the nest that she has found, using a process called [[tandem running]]. The waiting period is inversely related to the quality of the site; for instance, a worker that has found a poor site will wait longer than a worker that encountered a good site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mallon, E.B. |author2=Pratt, S.C. |title=Individual and collective decision-making during nest site selection by the ant ''Leptothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=352–9 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002650100377|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the new recruits visit the potential nest site and make their own assessment of its quality, the number of ants visiting the crevice increases. During this stage, ants may be visiting many different potential nests. However, because of the differences in the waiting period, the number of ants in the best nest will tend to increase at the greatest rate. Eventually, the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold, indicating that the quorum number has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pratt, S.C. |title=Quorum sensing by encounter rates in the ant ''Temnothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=488–96 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ari020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ants sense a quorum, they return to the destroyed nest and begin rapidly carrying the brood, queen, and fellow workers to the new nest. Scouts that are still tandem-running to other potential sites are also recruited to the new nest, and the entire colony moves. Thus, although no single worker may have visited and compared all of the available options, quorum sensing enables the colony as a whole to quickly make good decisions about where to move.

====Honey bees====
[[Honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera'') also use quorum sensing to make decisions about new nest sites. Large colonies reproduce through a process called [[swarming (honeybee)|swarming]], in which the queen leaves the hive with a portion of the workers to form a new nest elsewhere. After leaving the nest, the workers form a swarm that hangs from a branch or overhanging structure. This swarm persists during the decision-making phase until a new nest site is chosen.

The quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by ''[[Temnothorax]]'' ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and recruits other workers to her cavity using the honey bee [[waggle dance]]. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent on the quality of the site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10–20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in nest-site selection by honey bees |journal=Apidologie |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=101–16 |year=2004 |doi=10.1051/apido:2004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in honey bee swarms |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=220–9 |year=2006 |doi=10.1511/2006.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing and robotics==
Quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the SECOAS (Self-Organizing Collegiate Sensor) environmental monitoring system. In this system, individual nodes sense that there is a population of other nodes with similar data to report. The population then nominates just one node to report the data, resulting in power savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=M. |last2=Sacks |first2=L. |title=The SECOAS Project—Development of a Self-Organising, Wireless Sensor Network for Environmental Monitoring |journal=SANPA |year=2004 |url=http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216223909/http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing, by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Peysakhov, M. |author2=Regli, W. |booktitle=Proceedings 2005 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005.

Quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms. Using a process similar to that used by ''Temnothorax'' ants, robots can make rapid group decisions without the direction of a controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Sahin |first=E. |last2=Franks |first2=N. |title=Measurement of Space: From Ants to Robots |booktitle=Proceedings of WGW 2002: EPSRC/BBSRC International Workshop |year= 2002 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.6407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Randolph-diagram-disjunction.svg|thumb|250px|'''Randolph diagram''' that represents the logical statement &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; ([[Logical disjunction|disjunction]]).]]

A '''Randolph diagram''' ('''R-diagram''') is a simple way to visualize logical expressions and combinations of sets. Randolph diagrams were created by mathematician John F. Randolph in 1965, while he was teaching at the [[University of Arkansas]].

== Overview ==
Randolph diagrams can be interpreted most easily by defining each line as ''belonging to'' or ''relating to'' one logical statement or set. Any dot above the line indicates truth or inclusion and below the line indicates falsity or exclusion. Using this system, one can represent any combination of sets or logical statements using intersecting lines.

Though [[Venn diagram]]s are more commonly used to represent combinations of sets, Randolph diagrams have the advantage of being able to cleanly represent combinations of more than 3 sets. Venn diagrams require either extension into higher spatial dimensions or the use of more complicated shapes while Randolph diagrams evenly subdivide for every additional set.&lt;ref name="Sets and Randolph Diagrams"&gt;{{cite web |author-last=Barksdale, Jr. |author-first=James B. |title=Sets and Randolph Diagrams |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED045458.pdf |work=Paper presented at the Louisville Regional Convention of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics |location=Louisville, Kentucky |date=October 1970 |publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]] |access-date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a comparison between a Venn diagram and R-diagram for 5 sets or logical statements:

[[File:Randolph-diagram-n5.svg|260px|A Randolph diagram for five sets]]

== History ==
In his introductory paper on the subject, ''Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations'',&lt;ref name="Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Randolph |author-first=John F. |title=Cross-Examining Propositional Calculus and Set Operations |jstor=2310972 |work=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=72 |number=2 |date=February 1965 |pages=117-127 |doi=10.1080/00029890.1965.11970498 |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph mentions that the first use of crosses and dots to represent logical relationships was introduced by [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|W. S. McCulloch]], a neurophysiologist and Randolph's contemporary. Randolph modified McCulloch's system with a new way of representing combinations and relationships of more than two logical statements or sets, namely subdividing each section of the R-diagram with a new diagonal line for each new element introduced. Randolph's paper suggests that his original notion was to use R-diagrams to represent logical relationships, and then expanded the idea to be applied to set theory as well. Throughout the paper, R-diagrams are used in conjunction with normal logical and set binary operation symbols.

== Application to logic theory ==
{{See also|Mathematical logic}}

When applying R-diagrams to logic theory, [[Truth value|logical statements]] p, q, and r can each become a line or multiple lines to visually display the validity of each element in a larger statement. Generally, p is thought to be represented by an upward sloping line (/) while q is represented by a downward sloping line (\). A dot in the diagram above a slanting line indicates truth for that statement; likewise, a dot below indicates falsity. The R-diagrams for p and q are shown below, respectively:

[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|100px]]
[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|100px]]

For more than two statements, the four spaces formed by the intersection of lines p and q must be subdivided into more lines. In the case of r, a single upward sloping line (/) is added in each of the four spaces. The R-diagram for r is shown below:

[[File:R-diagram-r.svg|150px]]

This method can be extended for any number of truth values:

[[File:Randolph-diagram-subdivisions.svg|600px|Randolph-diagram-subdivisions]], etc.

R-diagrams are primarily used to represent logical expressions. Given a logical proposition, R-diagrams are able to display the outcome of every possible true/false variation of each element, creating an alternative way to represent a [[truth table]].

=== Simplifying logical expressions ===
R-diagrams can be used to easily simplify complicated logical expressions, using a step-by-step process. Using order of operations, logical operators are applied to R-diagrams in the proper sequence. Finally, the result is an R-diagram that can be converted back into a simpler logical expression.

For example, take the following expression:

: &lt;math&gt;(Q \leftrightarrow P) \lor (\lnot P \land Q) \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can be simplified using R-diagrams as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \lor (&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-negation.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Randolph-diagram-bicondition.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-qminusp.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-implication.svg|40px]]

which is equal to:

: &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q. \, &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proving logical arguments ===
Similarly, R-diagrams can be used to prove or disprove logical arguments. Take, for instance, the well known argument [[modus ponens]], also known as implication elimination:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q, P}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be converted into a [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] logical expression,

: &lt;math&gt;((P \to Q) \land P) \to Q&lt;/math&gt;

which can then be simplified using R-diagrams:

: &lt;math&gt;((&lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \land &lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

&lt;math&gt;(&lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-implication.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;[[File:R-diagram-p.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt;) \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-conjunction.svg|40px]]&lt;math&gt; \to &lt;/math&gt;[[File:Randolph-diagram-q.svg|40px]]

[[File:Randolph-diagram-tautology.svg|40px]]

The result is an R-diagram in which every space has a dot. This means the argument is a tautology; it is true in all cases. An R-diagram in which no space has a dot is a [[contradiction]], a statement that is never true.

== Application to set theory ==
{{See also|Set theory}}

R-diagrams are also used in [[set theory]], as an alternative to Venn diagrams. In set theory, each line represents a set instead of a logical statement; A replaces p and B replaces q. When used for sets, a dot above the line represents inclusion, where a dot below represents exclusion. As in logic, basic set operations can be represented visually using R-diagrams:

In [[economics]], [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[artificial intelligence]], a '''rational agent''' is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that has clear [[preferences]], models [[uncertainty]] via [[expected values]] of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions. A rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm, machine, or software.

Rational agents are also studied in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[ethics]], and philosophy, including the philosophy of [[practical reason]].

==Economics==
In reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a [[free market]]. This concept is one of the assumptions made in [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]]. The concept of economic [[rationality]] arises from a tradition of [[marginal analysis]] used in neoclassical economics. The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], as detailed by philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s theory of the [[felicific calculus]], also known as the hedonistic calculus.

The action a rational agent takes depends on:
* the preferences of the agent
* the agent's information of its environment, which may come from past experiences
* the actions, duties and obligations available to the agent
* the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions.

In [[game theory]] and classical [[economics]], it is often assumed that the [[actor]]s, people, and firms are rational.  However, the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate.  Economists often assume the models of [[rational choice theory]] and [[bounded rationality]] to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms.  Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the [[traveler's dilemma]].

=== Criticisms === 
Many economic theories reject [[utilitarianism]] and rational agency, especially those that might be considered [[heterodox]].

For example, [[Thorstein Veblen]], known as the father of [[institutional economics]], rejects the notion of hedonistic calculus and pure rationality saying: "The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact."

Veblen instead perceives human economic decisions as the result of multiple complex cumulative factors: "It is the characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces. He is ... a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity. ... They are the products of his hereditary traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions conventionalities, and material circumstances; and they afford the point of departure for the next step in the process. The economic life history of the individual is a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process."
[[Evolutionary economics]] also provides criticisms of the Rational Agent, citing the "parental bent" (the idea that biological impulses can and do frequently override rational decision making based on utility). Arguments against rational agency have also cited the enormous influence of [[marketing]] as proof that humans can be persuaded to make economic decisions that are "non-rational" in nature.

=== Alternate theories ===
[[Neuroeconomics]] is a concept that uses [[neuroscience]], social [[psychology]] and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions.  Unlike rational agent theory, [[neuroeconomics]] does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.

==Artificial intelligence==
[[Artificial intelligence]] has borrowed the term "rational agents" from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and decision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to ''[[intelligent agent]]s'', autonomous software programs that display intelligence.

In [[set theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''reflection principle''' says that it is possible to find sets that resemble the class of all sets. There are several different forms of the reflection principle depending on exactly what is meant by "resemble". Weak forms of the reflection principle are theorems of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZF set theory]] due to {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}}, while stronger forms can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory. 

The name "reflection principle" comes from the fact that properties of the universe of all sets are "reflected" down to a smaller set.

==Motivation==

A naive version of the reflection principle states that "for any property of the universe of all sets we can find a set with the same property". This leads to an immediate contradiction: 
the universe of all sets contains all sets, but there is no set with the property that it contains all sets. To get useful (and non-contradictory) reflection principles we need to be more careful about what we mean by "property" and what properties we allow. 

To find non-contradictory reflection principles we might argue informally as follows. Suppose that we have some collection ''A'' of methods for forming sets (for example, taking powersets, subsets, the axiom of replacement, and so on). We can imagine taking all sets obtained by repeatedly applying all these methods, and form these sets into a class ''V'', which can be thought of as a model of some set theory. But now we can introduce the following new principle for forming sets: "the collection of all sets obtained from some set by repeatedly applying all methods in the collection ''A'' is also a set". If we allow this new principle for forming sets, we can now continue past ''V'', and consider the class ''W'' of all sets formed using the principles ''A'' and the new principle. In this class ''W'', ''V'' is just a set, closed under
all the set-forming operations of ''A''. In other words the universe ''W'' contains a ''set'' ''V'' which resembles ''W'' in that it is closed under all the methods ''A''.

We can use this informal argument in two ways. We can try to formalize it in (say) ZF set theory; by doing this we obtain some theorems of ZF set theory, called reflection theorems. 
Alternatively we can use this argument to motivate introducing new axioms for set theory.

==In ZFC==

In trying to formalize the argument for the reflection principle of the previous section in ZF set theory, it turns out to be necessary to add some conditions about the collection of properties ''A'' (for example, ''A'' might be finite). Doing this produces 
several closely related "reflection theorems" of ZFC all of which state that we can find a set that is almost a model of ZFC. 

One form of the reflection principle in ZFC says that for any '''finite''' set of axioms of ZFC we can find a countable [[set model|transitive model]] satisfying these axioms. (In particular this proves that, unless inconsistent, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable because if it were it would prove the existence of a model of itself, and hence prove its own consistency, contradicting Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.) This version of the reflection theorem is closely related to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]]. 

Another version of the reflection principle says that for any '''finite''' number of formulas of ZFC we can find a set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[cumulative hierarchy]] such that all the formulas in the set are [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolute]] for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; (which means very roughly that they hold in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if they hold in the universe of all sets). So this says that the set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; resembles the universe of all sets, at least as far as the given finite number of formulas is concerned. In particular for any formula of ZFC there is a theorem of ZFC that the formula is logically equivalent to a version of it with all quantifiers relativized to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; See {{harv|Jech|2002|p=168}}.

If &amp;kappa; is a strong inaccessible, then there is a closed unbounded subset ''C'' of &amp;kappa;, such that for every α∈''C'', the identity function from V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; to V&lt;sub&gt;&amp;kappa;&lt;/sub&gt; is an elementary embedding.

==As new axioms==

Bernays used a reflection principle as an axiom for one version of set theory (not [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], which is a weaker theory). His reflection principle stated roughly that if ''A'' is a class with some property, then one can find a transitive set ''u'' such that ''A∩u'' has the same property when considered as a subset of the "universe" ''u''. This is quite a powerful axiom and implies the existence of several of the smaller [[large cardinal]]s, such as [[inaccessible cardinal]]s. (Roughly speaking, the class of all ordinals in ZFC is an inaccessible cardinal apart from the fact that it is not a set, and the reflection principle can then be used to show that there is a set which has the same property, in other words which is an inaccessible cardinal.) Unfortunately, this cannot be axiomatized directly in ZFC, and a class theory like [[Morse–Kelley set theory|MK]] normally has to be used. The consistency of Bernays's reflection principle is implied by the existence of a [[Erdős cardinal|ω-Erdős cardinal]]. 

There are many more powerful reflection principles, which are closely related to the various large cardinal axioms. For almost every known large cardinal axiom there is a known reflection principle that implies it, and conversely all but the most powerful known reflection principles are implied by known large cardinal axioms {{harv|Marshall R.|1989}}. An example of this is the [[wholeness axiom]], which implies the existence of [[huge cardinal|super-n-huge cardinal]]s for all finite n and its consistency is implied by an I3 [[rank-into-rank|rank-into-rank cardinal]].

'''Dr. Robert J. Goldstein''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Conspiracies (Television)|conspirator]] who plotted with two accomplices to destroy the Islamic Education Center in [[Pinellas County]], [[Florida]] with homemade [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]].{{when?|date=January 2017}} A police search of the Goldstein home found a list of 50 Islamic worship centers on Florida, home-made explosives and a mission statement to "Kill all rags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/08/23/florida.explosives/index.html |title=Florida man plotted mosque attacks, feds say |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=2006-12-18 | date=2002-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein admitted that he planned to destroy the center and plead guilty to conspiracy to violate civil rights, conspiracy to damage religious property, and possession of unlicensed [[destructive device]]s. He was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison.

Ahmed Bedier, a spokesman for the [[Council for American-Islamic Relations]] who worshipped at the Pinellas County mosque, alleged double standards in the treatment of Goldstein and argued that Goldstein should have been prosecuted as a terrorist, but prosecutors said the facts of the case didn't warrant such a charge. "I'm happy he's behind bars and will serve some time, but it's nowhere enough for the damage he intended to do," Bedier said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cair-florida.org/podiatrist_guilty.htm |title=Podiatrist Pleads Guilty in Plot to Attack Islamic Center |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2006-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007071622/http://www.cair-florida.org/podiatrist_guilty.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|right|thumb|From an edition of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio's]] ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' showing Lady Fortune spinning her wheel.]]
In medieval and ancient philosophy the '''Wheel of Fortune''', or '''''Rota Fortunae''''', is a symbol of the capricious nature of [[destiny|Fate]]. The wheel belongs to the goddess [[Fortuna (mythology)|Fortuna]] (Greek equivalent [[Tyche]]) who spins it at random, changing the positions of those on the wheel: some suffer great misfortune, others gain windfalls.  Fortune appears on all paintings as a woman, sometimes blindfolded, "puppeteering" a wheel.

==Origins==
The origin of the word is from the "wheel of fortune" - the [[zodiac]], referring to the [[Celestial spheres]] of which the 8th holds the stars, and the 9th is where the signs of the zodiac are placed. The concept was first invented in Babylon and later developed by the [[Hellenistic Greece|ancient Greeks]].

The concept somewhat resembles the ''[[Bhavacakra]]'', or Wheel of Becoming, depicted throughout Ancient Indian art and literature, except that the earliest conceptions in the Roman and Greek world involve not a two-dimensional wheel but a three-dimensional sphere, a metaphor for the world.  It was widely used in the Ptolemaic perception of the universe as the [[zodiac]] being a wheel with its "signs" constantly turning throughout the year and having effect on the world's fate (or fortune).

[[Image:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|225px|right|thumb|Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with [[epicycle]], eccentric [[deferent]] and [[equant]] point.  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum'', 1474.]]
[[Vettius Valens]], a second century BC astronomer and astrologer, wrote:
::There are many wheels, most moving from west to east, but some move from east to west.
::Seven wheels, each hold one heavenly object, the first holds the moon...
::Then the eighth wheel holds all the stars that we see...

::And the ninth wheel, the wheel of fortunes, moves from east to west, 
::and includes each of the twelve signs of fortune, the twelve signs of the zodiac.
::Each wheel is inside the other, like an onion's peel sits inside another peel, and there is no empty space between them.{{cite quote|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Christine de Pizan, Folio 41r 'Wheel of Fortune' from Epitre d'Othéa; Les Sept Sacrements de l'Eglise, c. 1455 at Waddesdon Manor (cropped).jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jean Mielot]] to [[Christine de Pizan]]'s ''Epitre d'Othéa; Les Sept Sacrements de l'Eglise'', c. 1455 at [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]

In the same century, the Roman tragedian [[Pacuvius]] wrote:

{{quote|text=Fortunam insanam esse et caecam et brutam perhibent philosophi,&lt;br /&gt;
Saxoque instare in globoso praedicant volubili:&lt;br /&gt;
Id quo saxum inpulerit fors, eo cadere Fortunam autumant.&lt;br /&gt;
Caecam ob eam rem esse iterant, quia nihil cernat, quo sese adplicet; &lt;br /&gt;
Insanam autem esse aiunt, quia atrox, incerta instabilisque sit; &lt;br /&gt;
Brutam, quia dignum atque indignum nequeat internoscere.

Philosophers say that Fortune is insane and blind and stupid,&lt;br /&gt;
and they teach that she stands on a rolling, spherical rock:&lt;br /&gt;
they affirm that, wherever chance pushes that rock, Fortuna falls in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;
They repeat that she is blind for this reason: that she does not see where she's heading;&lt;br /&gt;
they say she's insane, because she is cruel, flaky and unstable;&lt;br /&gt;
stupid, because she can't distinguish between the worthy and the unworthy.|sign=[[Pacuvius]]|source=''Scaenicae Romanorum Poesis Fragmenta. Vol. 
1'', ed. O. Ribbeck, 1897}}

The idea of the rolling ball of fortune became a [[literary topos]] and was used frequently in declamation.  In fact, the ''Rota Fortunae'' became a prime example of a trite topos or [[meme]] for [[Tacitus]], who mentions its rhetorical overuse in the ''[[Dialogus de oratoribus]]''.

===Boethius===

The goddess and her Wheel were eventually absorbed into Western medieval thought. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] philosopher [[Boethius]] (c. 480-524) played a key role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patch|first1=H.R.|title=The Goddess Fortuna in Medieval Literature|date=1927|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing both her and her Wheel in his ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|Consolatio Philosophiae]]''. For example, from the first chapter of the second book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I know the manifold deceits of that monstrous lady, Fortune; in particular, her fawning friendship with those whom she intends to cheat, until the moment when she unexpectedly abandons them, and leaves them reeling in agony beyond endurance.

[...]

Having entrusted yourself to Fortune's dominion, you must conform to your mistress's ways. What, are you trying to halt the motion of her whirling wheel? Dimmest of fools that you are, you must realize that if the wheel stops turning, it ceases to be the course of chance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boethius|title=The Consolation of Philosophy|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954054-9|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In the middle ages ==
[[Image:Edward Burne-Jones - The Wheel of Fortune.jpg|thumb|left|''The Wheel of Fortune'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1875-83]]

===Religious instruction===
The Wheel was widely used as an [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegory]] in medieval literature and art to aid religious instruction. Though classically Fortune's Wheel could be favourable and disadvantageous, medieval writers preferred to concentrate on the tragic aspect, dwelling on downfall of the mighty - serving to remind people of the temporality of earthly things. In the [[morality play]] ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' (c. 1495), for instance, Death comes unexpectedly to claim the protagonist. Fortune's Wheel has spun Everyman low, and Good Deeds, which he previously neglected, are needed to secure his passage to heaven.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used the concept of the tragic Wheel of Fortune a great deal. It forms the basis for the ''[[Monk's Tale]]'', which recounts stories of the great brought low throughout history, including [[Lucifer]], [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], [[Samson]], [[Hercules]], [[Nebuchadnezzar]], [[Belshazzar]], [[Nero]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]] and, in the following passage, [[Peter I of Cyprus]].

:O noble Peter, Cyprus' lord and king,
:Which Alexander won by mastery,
:To many a heathen ruin did'st thou bring;
:For this thy lords had so much jealousy,
:That, for no crime save thy high chivalry,
:All in thy bed they slew thee on a morrow.
:And thus does Fortune's wheel turn treacherously
:And out of happiness bring men to sorrow.
~ Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', The Monk's Tale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/gchaucer/bl-gchau-can-monk.htm |title=The Monk's Tale, Modern English - Canterbury Tales - Geoffrey Chaucer (1340?-1400) |publisher=Classiclit.about.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortune's Wheel often turns up in medieval art, from manuscripts to the great [[Rose window]]s in many medieval cathedrals, which are based on the Wheel. Characteristically, it has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left ''regnabo'' (I shall reign), on the top ''regno'' (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right ''regnavi'' (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked ''sum sine regno'' (I am without a kingdom). [[Dante]] employed the Wheel in the ''[[The Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' and a "[[Wheel of Fortune (Tarot card)|Wheel of Fortune]]" trump-card appeared in the [[Tarot]] deck (circa 1440, Italy).

===Political instruction===
[[Image:CarminaBurana wheel.jpg|thumb|right|The wheel of fortune from the ''[[Carmina Burana|Burana Codex]]''; The figures are labelled "Regno, Regnavi, Sum sine regno, Regnabo": I reign, I reigned, My reign is finished, I shall reign]]
In the medieval and renaissance period, a popular genre of writing was "'''[[Mirror-of-princes writing|Mirrors for Princes]]'''", which set out advice for the ruling classes on how to wield power (the most famous being ''[[The Prince]]'' by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]). Such political treatises could use the concept of the Wheel of Fortune as an instructive guide to their readers. [[John Lydgate]]'s ''Fall of Princes'', written for his patron [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] is a noteworthy example.

Many [[Arthurian]] [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] of the era also use the concept of the Wheel in this manner, often placing the [[Nine Worthies]] on it at various points.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...fortune is so variant, and the wheel so moveable, there nis none constant abiding, and that may be proved by many old chronicles, of noble [[Hector]], and [[Troilus]], and [[Alexander the Great|Alisander]], the mighty conqueror, and many mo other; when they were most in their royalty, they alighted lowest. 
~ [[Lancelot]] in [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Chapter XVII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/epics/LeMortedArthur/chap247.html |title=Le Morte d' Arthur - Chapter XVII |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411043318/http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/lit/epics/LeMortedArthur/chap247.html |archivedate=2016-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the Mirrors for Princes, this could be used to convey advice to readers. For instance, in most romances, Arthur's greatest military achievement - the conquest of the [[Roman Empire]] - is placed late on in the overall story. However, in Malory's work the Roman conquest and high point of [[King Arthur]]'s reign is established very early on. Thus, everything that follows is something of a decline. Arthur, Lancelot and the other [[Knights of the Round Table]] are meant to be the paragons of [[chivalry]], yet in Malory's telling of the story they are doomed to failure. In medieval thinking, only [[God]] was perfect, and even a great figure like King Arthur had to be brought low. For the noble reader of the tale in the Middle Ages, this moral could serve as a warning, but also as something to aspire to. Malory could be using the concept of Fortune's Wheel to imply that if even the greatest of chivalric knights made mistakes, then a normal fifteenth-century noble didn't have to be a paragon of virtue in order to be a good knight.

===Carmina Burana===
The Wheel of Fortune motif appears significantly in the ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (or ''Burana Codex''), albeit with a postclassical phonetic spelling of the genitive form ''Fortunae''.  Excerpts from two of the collection's better known poems, "''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi'' (Fortune, Empress of the World)" and "''Fortune Plango Vulnera'' (I Bemoan the Wounds of Fortune)," read:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-4}}

==Later usage==
Fortune and her Wheel have remained an enduring image throughout history. Fortune's wheel can also be found in Thomas More's ''Utopia''.

===Shakespeare===
[[File:Wheel of fortune.png|thumb|210px|Wheel of fortune in [[Sebastian Brant]]`s ''[[Narrenschiff]]'', woodcut by A. Dürer]]
[[William Shakespeare]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' wrote of the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" and, of fortune personified, to "break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel." And in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', Act 3 Scene VI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/shakespeare/henryV/16/ |title=King Henry V by William Shakespeare: Act 3. Scene VI |publisher=Online-literature.com |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the lines:

:''Pistol:''
:''Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart
:''And of buxom valor, hath by cruel fate''
:''And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel''
:''That goddess blind,''
:''That stands upon the rolling restless stone—''
:''Fluellen:''
:''By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation. And her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls.''
:''Pistol:''
:''Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;''
Shakespeare also references this Wheel in ''[[King Lear]]''. The Earl of Kent, who was once held dear by the King, has been banished, only to return in disguise. This disguised character is placed in the stocks for an overnight and laments this turn of events at the end of Act II, Scene 2:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/70/4322.html |title=Act II. Scene II. King Lear. Craig, W.J., ed. 1914. The Oxford Shakespeare |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Fortune, good night, smile once more; turn thy wheel!''

In Act IV, scene vii, King Lear also contrasts his misery on the "wheel of fire" to Cordelia's "soul in bliss".

Rosalind and Celia also discuss Fortune, especially as it stands opposed to Nature, in ''As You Like It'', Act I, scene ii.

===Victorian era===
In [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novel ''[[The Way We Live Now]]'', the character Lady Carbury writes a novel entitled ''The Wheel of Fortune'' about a heroine who suffers great financial hardships.

===Modern day===
Selections from the ''Carmina Burana'', including the two poems quoted above, were set to new music by twentieth-century classical composer [[Carl Orff]], whose well-known "[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|O Fortuna]]" is based on the poem ''Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi''.

==== Literature ====
[[Fortuna]] does occasionally turn up in modern literature, although these days she has become more or less synonymous with [[wiktionary:Lady Luck|Lady Luck]]. Her Wheel is less widely used as a symbol, and has been replaced largely by a reputation for fickleness. She is often associated with gamblers, and [[dice]] could also be said to have replaced the Wheel as the primary metaphor for uncertain fortune. In his novel, ''[[The Club Dumas]]'', [[Arturo Pérez-Reverte]] includes a wheel of fortune in one of the [http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4495/3071/1600/8NGc.jpg illustrations that accompany the text]. Ignatius J. Reilly, the central protagonist of [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'', states that he believes the Rota Fortunae to be the source of all men's fate.

==== Popular music ====
[[Jerry Garcia]] recorded a song entitled "The Wheel" (co-written with [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] and [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) for his 1972 solo album ''Garcia'', and performed the song regularly with the [[Grateful Dead]] from 1976 onward. The song "[[Wheel in the Sky]]" by [[Journey (band)|Journey]] from their 1978 release ''[[Infinity (Journey album)|Infinity]]'' also touches on the concept through the lyrics "''Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin' / I don't know where I'll be tomorrow''". The song "Throw Your Hatred Down" by [[Neil Young]] on his 1995 album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]'', recorded with [[Pearl Jam]], has the verse "The wheel of fortune / Keeps on rollin' down". The Trip-Hop group Massive Attack refer to the Wheel of Fortune on their track "Hymn Of The Big Wheel" on the 1991 album [[Blue Lines]].

==== Folk music====
Several old folk tunes mention the wheel of fortune, most notably 'Fakenham Fair' with its chorus lyrics of 'So spin me around on the merry-go-round/Give the wheel of fortune a whirl'.

==== Film and television ====
Various games of chance involve spinning a wheel marked with preset outcomes, mirroring the "wheel of fortune" concept. This is notably done on the long-running, internationally syndicated game show [[Wheel of Fortune in different countries|''Wheel of Fortune'']], where contestants win or lose money determined by the spin of the wheel. Such a wheel is also featured in the game show ''[[The Price Is Right]]'', in the "[[Showcase Showdown]]" segment. In the 1985 film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', such a wheel was used to determine punishments for criminals.

The 1994 film ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' refers often to the Rota Fortunae concept, especially in its use of circles as a visual motif. In the TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (2002), the main character, Malcolm Reynolds, says "The Wheel never stops turning, Badger" to which Badger replies "That only matters to the people on the rim". In the science fiction TV series ''[[Farscape]]'', the third-season episode "Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel" has main character Crichton mention that his grandmother told him that fate was like a wheel, alternately bringing fortunes up and down.

==== Games ====
The video game series character [[Kain (Legacy of Kain)]] used the wheel of fate. In the&amp;nbsp;[[Fable (video game series)|''Fable''&amp;nbsp;video game series]], the wheel of fortune appears twice, somehow perverted. The Wheel of Unholy Misfortune is a torture device in&amp;nbsp;''[[Fable II]]''. It is found in the Temple of Shadows in Rookridge. The Hero can use the wheel to sacrifice followers to the shadows. In&amp;nbsp;''[[Fable III]]'', Reaver's Wheel of Misfortune is a device that, once activated, sends to The Hero a round of random monsters.

The Wheel of Fortune is featured in a ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' card by that name that forces all players to discard their hands and draw new ones.

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence''].

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G. (1982). ''Coercive family process''. Eugene, OR: Castalia. {{ISBN|0-916154-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1995). Coercion as a basis for early age of onset for arrest. In J. McCord (Ed.), ''Coercion and punishment in long-term perspectives'' (pp. 81–105). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.). Abusive home environments can inhibit the growth of social cognitive skills needed, for example, to understand the intentions of others.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge, Pettit"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.104.4.632 | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders.

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Scientific [[essentialism]]''', a view espoused by [[Saul Kripke]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hanna | first1 = R. | title = A Kantian Critique of Scientific Essentialism | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 497–528 | doi = 10.2307/2653754 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that there exist essential properties that objects possess (or instantiate) necessarily. In other words, having such and such essential properties is a necessary condition for membership in a given natural kind. For example, tigers are tigers in virtue of possessing a particular set of genetic properties, but identifying (or appearance-based) properties are nonessential properties. If a tiger lost a leg, or didn't possess stripes, we would still call it a tiger. They are not necessary for being a member of the class of tigers.

It is important, however, that the set of essential properties of an object not be used to identify or be identified with that object because they are not ''necessary and sufficient'', but only necessary. Having such and such a genetic code does not suffice for being a tiger. We wouldn't call a piece of tiger tail a tiger, even though a piece of tiger tail contains the genetic information essential to being a tiger.

Other advocates of scientific essentialism include [[Brian David Ellis|Brian Ellis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-521-03774-7 |title = Scientific Essentialism (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy) |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7715358M/Scientific_Essentialism_(Cambridge_Studies_in_Philosophy) |author = Brian Ellis |publication-date = July 23, 2007 |oclc = 124025546 |id = 0521037743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caroline Lierse]],&lt;ref name="BJPoS1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bigelow | first1 = J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = B. | last3 = Lierse | first3 = C. | title = The World as One of a Kind: Natural Necessity and Laws of Nature | journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–388 | doi = 10.1093/bjps/43.3.371 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bigelow]],&lt;ref name="BJPoS1992" /&gt; and [[Alexander Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], USA |isbn = 978-0-19-922701-3 |title = Nature's Metaphysics |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL10145956M/Nature's_Metaphysics |author = Alexander Bird |publication-date = August 31, 2007 |id = 0199227012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sensory garden''' is a self-contained [[garden]] area that allows visitors to enjoy a wide variety of sensory experiences.&lt;ref name=sensorytrust&gt;{{cite web |title=Sensory garden design advice 1.

Sensory gardens can be designed in such a way as to be accessible and enjoyable for both [[disabled]] and non-disabled users. A sensory garden, for example, may contain features accessible to the disabled individual such as: scented and edible plants, sculptures and sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying-glass screens, braille and audio [[induction loop]] descriptions.  Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the play needs of younger users with their sensory needs.

Many sensory gardens devote themselves to providing experience for multiple senses; those specialising in scent are sometimes called [[scented gardens]], those specialising in music/sound are sound gardens where the equipment doubles up to provides an enhanced opportunity for strategic developmental, learning and educational outcomes.

Sensory Gardens usually have an enhanced infrastructure to permit [[wheelchair access]] and meet other accessibility concerns; the design and layout provides a stimulating journey through the senses, heightening awareness, and bringing positive learning experiences.

{{Sex (biology) sidebar}}
'''Sexual dimorphism''' is the condition where the two [[sex]]es of the same species exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. The condition occurs in many animals and some plants. Differences may include [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, size, weight, color, markings, and may also include behavioral and cognitive differences. These differences may be subtle or exaggerated, and may be subjected to [[sexual selection]]. The opposite of dimorphism is ''monomorphism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://human-biology.key-spot.ru/search.php?key=sexual+monomorphism|title=Dictionary of Human Evolution and Biology|website=Human-biology.key-spot.ru|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamentation and coloration===
Common and easily identified types of dimorphism are [[Biological ornament|ornamentation]] and coloration, though not always apparent. A difference in coloration of sexes within a given species is called sexual dichromatism, which is commonly seen in many species of birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Armenta J. K. |author2=Dunn P. O. |author3=Whittingham L. A. | year = 2008 | title = Quantifying avian sexual dichromatism: a comparison of methods | url = | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 211 | issue = 15| pages = 2423–2430 | doi=10.1242/jeb.013094 | pmid=18626076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual selection leads to the exaggerated dimorphic traits that are used predominantly in competition over mates. The increased fitness resulting from ornamentation offsets its cost to produce or maintain suggesting complex evolutionary implications, but the costs and evolutionary implications vary from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zahavi A | year = 1975 | title = Mate selection-a selection for a handicap | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 205–214 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 | pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exaggerated ornamental traits are used predominantly in the competition over mates, implying [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Andersson, 1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornaments may be costly to produce or maintain, which has complex evolutionary implications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Amotz Zahavi]] |year=1975 |title=Mate selection&amp;nbsp;– a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |pmid=1195756 |url=http://eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/dornhaus/courses/materials/papers/other/Zahavi%20sexual%20selection%20handicap%20model%20signal.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the costs and implications differ depending on the nature of the ornamentation (such as the colour mechanism involved).

The [[peafowl]] constitute conspicuous illustrations of the principle. The ornate [[plumage]] of peacocks, as used in the courting display, attracts [[peahen]]s. At first sight one might mistake peacocks and peahens for completely different species because of the vibrant colours and the sheer size of the male's plumage; the peahen being of a subdued brown coloration.&lt;ref name="Zi"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zi J. |author2=Yu X. |author3=Li Y. |author4=Hu X. |author5=Xu C. |author6=Wang X. |author7=Fu R. | year = 2003 | title = Coloration strategies in peacock feathers | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 22| pages = 12576–12578 | doi=10.1073/pnas.2133313100|pmid=14557541 | pmc=240659|bibcode=2003PNAS..10012576Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plumage of the peacock increases its vulnerability to predators because it is a hindrance in flight, and it renders the bird conspicuous in general.&lt;ref name="Zi" /&gt;  Similar examples are manifold, such as in [[bird-of-paradise|birds of paradise]] and [[argus (bird)|argus pheasants]].

Another example of sexual dichromatism is that of the nestling [[blue tit]]s. Males are chromatically more yellow than females. It is believed that this is obtained by the ingestion of green lepidopteran larvae, which contain large amounts of the carotenoids lutein and [[zeaxanthin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=T. | last1=Slagsvold  |first2=J. T. | last2=Lifjeld  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1985 |title=Variation in plumage colour of the Great tit ''Parus major'' in relation to habitat, season and food |journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=206 |issue=3 |pages=321–328 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1985.tb05661.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This diet also affects the sexually dimorphic colours in the human-invisible UV spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stefan | last1=Andersson | first2=Jonas | last2=Örnborg  |first3=Malte | last3=Andersson  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=Ultraviolet sexual dimorphism and assortative mating in blue tits |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=265 |issue=1395 |pages=445–450 |pmc=1688915 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sarah | last1=Hunt | first2=Andrew T. D. | last2=Bennett | first3=Innes C. | last3=Cuthill | authorlink3=Innes Cuthill | first4=Richard | last4=Griffiths |year=1998 |title=Blue tits are ultraviolet tits |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=265 |issue=1395 |pages=451–455 |jstor=50814 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0316 |pmc=1688906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the male birds, although appearing yellow to humans actually have a violet-tinted plumage that is seen by females. This plumage is thought to be an indicator of male parental abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. C. Senar, J. Figuerola &amp; J. Pascual |year=2002 |title=Brighter yellow blue tits make better parents |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=269 |issue=1488 |pmc=1690890 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1882 |pages=257–261 |pmid=11839194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps this is a good indicator for females because it shows that they are good at obtaining a food supply from which the carotenoid is obtained. There is a positive correlation between the chromas of the tail and breast feathers and body condition.&lt;ref name="blue tits"&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Johnsen, K. Delhey, S. Andersson &amp; B. Kempenaers |year=2003 |title=Plumage colour in nestling blue tits: sexual dichromatism, condition dependence and genetic effects |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |issue=1521 |pages=1263–1270 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2375 |pmid=12816639 |pmc=1691364 |jstor=3558810 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/1521/1263.full.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carotenoids play an important role in [[immune function]] for many animals, so carotenoid dependent signals might indicate health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=George A. Lozano |year=1994 |title=Carotenoids, parasites, and sexual selection |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=309–311 |url=http://www.georgealozano.com/papers/mine/Lozano1994Carotenoids.pdf |format=PDF |jstor=3545643 |doi=10.2307/3545643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frogs constitute another conspicuous illustration of the principle. There are two types of dichromatism for frog species: ontogenetic and dynamic. Ontogenetic frogs are more common and have permanent color changes in males or females. [[Litoria lesueuri]] is an example of a dynamic frog that has temporary color changes in males during breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, S. C., &amp; Mahony, M. J. (2004). Allozyme, chromosomal and morphological variability in the Litoria lesueuri species group (Anura : Hylidae), including a description of a new species. Australian Journal of Zoology&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperolius ocellatus]] is an ontogenetic frog with dramatic differences in both color and pattern between the sexes. At sexual maturity, the males display a bright green with white dorsolateral lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, R. C., &amp; Zamudio, K. R. (2012). Sexual dichromatism in frogs: natural selection, sexual selection and unexpected diversity. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the females are rusty red to silver with small spots. The bright coloration in the male population serves to attract females and as an [[Aposematism|aposematic]] sign to potential predators.

Females often show a preference for exaggerated male [[secondary sexual characteristics]] in mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryan M. J. |author2=Rand S. | year = 1993 | title = Species Recognition and Sexual Selection as a Unitary Problem in Animal Communication | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 647–657 | doi=10.2307/2410076|jstor=2410076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexy son hypothesis explains that females prefer more elaborate males and select against males that are dull in color, independent of the species’ vision.&lt;ref name="Rubolini"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rubolini D. |author2=Spina F. |author3=Saino N. | year = 2004 | title = Protandry and sexual dimorphism in trans-Saharan migratory birds | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 592–601 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arh048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar sexual dimorphism and mating choice are also observed in many fish species. For example, male [[guppy|guppies]] have colorful spots and ornamentations while females are generally grey in color. Female guppies prefer brightly colored males to duller males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zunYrumtsR8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=sexuaql+dimorphism+guppies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja5NLT16LXAhUCORoKHSw-BZEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Differences Between the Sexes|first1=R. V.|last1=Short|first2=E.|last2=Balaban|date=4 August 1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiological differentiation===
{{expand section|date=April 2016}}
In [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blennies]], only the male fish develops an organ at the anal-urogenital region that produces antimicrobial substances. During parental care, males rub their anal-urogenital regions over their nests' internal surfaces, thereby protecting their eggs from microbial infections, one of the most common causes for mortality in young fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giacomello|first=Eva|title=A male sexually dimorphic trait provides antimicrobials to eggs in blenny fish|journal=Biology Letters|year=2006|volume=2|issue=3|pages=330–333|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0492|pmid=17148395|pmc=1686180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants==
Most flower plants are [[hermaphroditic]] but approximately 6% have separate males and females ([[dioecy]]).&lt;ref name="Renner and Ricklefs 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renner|first=Susanne|author2=Ricklefs, Robert E |title=Dioecy and its correlates in the flowering plants|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=1995|volume=82|issue=5|pages=596–606|doi=10.2307/2445418|jstor=2445418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males and females in [[insect-pollinated]] species generally look similar to one another because plants provide rewards (e.g. [[nectar]]) that encourage [[pollinators]] to visit another similar [[flower]], completing [[pollination]]. ''[[Catasetum]]'' orchids are one interesting exception to this rule. Male ''Catasetum'' [[orchids]] violently attach [[pollinia]] to [[euglossine]] bee pollinators. The bees will then avoid other male flowers but may visit the female, which looks different from the males.&lt;ref name="Romero and Nelson 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=Gustavo|author2=Nelson, Craig E. |title=Sexual Dimorphism in Catasetum Orchids: Forcible Pollen Emplacement and Male Flower Competition|journal=Science|year=1986|volume=232|issue=4757|pages=1538–1540|bibcode = 1986Sci...232.1538R |doi = 10.1126/science.232.4757.1538|pmid=17773505|jstor=1698050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other dioecious exceptions, such as ''[[Loxostylis alata]]'' have visibly different genders, with the effect of eliciting the most efficient behaviour from pollinators, who then use the most efficient strategy in visiting each gender of flower instead of searching say, for pollen in a nectar-bearing female flower.

Some plants, such as some species of ''[[Pollination|Geranium]]'' have what amounts to serial sexual dimorphism. The flowers of such species might for example present their anthers on opening, then shed the exhausted anthers after a day or two and perhaps change their colours as well while the pistil matures; specialist pollinators are very much inclined to concentrate on the exact appearance of the flowers they serve, which saves their time and effort and serves the interests of the plant accordingly. Some such plants go even further and change their appearance again once they have been fertilised, thereby discouraging further visits from pollinators. This is advantageous to both parties because it avoids damage to the developing fruit and avoids wasting the pollinator's effort on unrewarding visits. In effect the strategy ensures that the pollinators can expect a reward every time they visit an appropriately advertising flower.

Females of the aquatic plant ''[[Vallisneria americana]]'' have floating flowers attached by a long [[flower stalk]] that are fertilized if they contact one of the thousands of free floating flowers released by a male.&lt;ref name="Vallisneria americana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/eelgr.html|title=Eel Grass (aka wild celery, tape grass)|website=[[University of Massachusetts]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712075849/http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/eelgr.html|archivedate=12 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual dimorphism is most often associated with [[Pollination syndrome|wind-pollination]] in plants due to selection for efficient [[pollen]] dispersal in males vs pollen capture in females, e.g. ''Leucadendron rubrum''.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Barrett 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Jannice|author2=Barrett, Spencer |title=Wind of change: new insights on the ecology and evolution of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants|journal=Annals of Botany|year=2009|volume=103|pages=1515–1527|doi=10.1093/aob/mcp035|pmid=19218583|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/9/1515.short|issue=9|pmc=2701749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism in plants can also be dependent on reproductive development. This can be seen in ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', a type of hemp, which have higher photosynthesis rates in males while growing but higher rates in females once the plants become sexually mature.&lt;ref name=Gebe99&gt;{{Cite book |last=Geber |first=Monica A. |year=1999 |title=Gender and sexual dimorphism in flowering plants |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pUo2T34ppKUC&amp;pg=PA206 |isbn=3-540-64597-7 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin }} p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

It also should be borne in mind that every sexually reproducing extant species of vascular plant actually has an alternation of generations; the plants we see about us generally are [[Ploidy|diploid]] [[sporophyte]]s, but their offspring really are not the seeds that people commonly recognise as the new generation. The seed actually is the offspring of the [[Ploidy|haploid]] generation of [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] ([[pollen]]) and [[Gametophyte|megagametophytes]] (the [[embryo sac]]s in the [[ovules]]). Each pollen grain accordingly may be seen as a male plant in its own right; it produces a sperm cell and is dramatically different from the female plant, the megagametophyte that produces the female gamete.

==Spiders and sexual cannibalism==
[[File:Male and female A. appensa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Female (left) and male (right) ''[[Argiope appensa]]'', displaying typical sexual differences in spiders, with dramatically smaller males]]

Size dimorphism shows a correlation with [[sexual cannibalism]], which is prominent in spiders (it is also found in insects such as [[praying mantis]]es). In the size dimorphic [[wolf spider]], food-limited females cannibalize more frequently.&lt;ref name="Wilder"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilder S. M. |author2=Rypstra A. L. | year = 2008 | title = Sexual size dimorphism mediates the occurrence of state-dependent sexual cannibalism in a wolf spider | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.12.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is a high risk of low fitness for males due to pre-copulatory cannibalism, which led to male selection of larger females for two reasons: higher fecundity and lower rates of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Wilder"/&gt; In addition, female fecundity is positively correlated with female body size and large female body size is selected for, which is seen in the family [[Orb-weaver spider|Araneidae]]. All ''Argiope'' species, including ''[[Argiope bruennichi]]'', use this method. Some males evolved ornamentation{{vague|date=July 2018}} including binding the female with silk, having proportionally longer legs, modifying the female's web, mating while the female is feeding, or providing a nuptial gift in response to sexual cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Wilder"/&gt; Male body size is not under selection due to cannibalism in all spider species such as ''[[Nephila pilipes]]'', but is more prominently selected for in less dimorphic species of spiders, which often selects for larger male size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Foellmer M.

==Fish==
Ray finned fish are an ancient and diverse class, with the widest degree of sexual dimorphism of any Animal class. Fairbairn notes that "females are generally larger than males but males are often larger in species with male-male combat or male paternal care ... [sizes range] from dwarf males to males more than 12 times heavier than females"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairbairn|first1=Daphne|title=Odd Couples: Extraordinary Differences between the Sexes in the Animal Kingdom|date=28 April 2013|publisher=Princeton|isbn=0691141967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are cases where males are substantially larger than females. An example is ''[[Lamprologus callipterus]]'', a type of cichlid fish. In this fish, the males are characterized as being up to 60 times larger than the females. The male's increased size is believed to be advantageous because males collect and defend empty snail shells in each of which a female breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kazutaka Ota, Masanori Kohda  |author2=Tetsu Sato  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |title=Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females |journal=[[Journal of Biosciences]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=257–265 |doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males must be larger and more powerful in order to collect the largest shells. The female's body size must remain small because in order for her to breed, she must lay her eggs inside the empty shells. If she grows too large, she will not fit in the shells and will be unable to breed. Another example is the [[dragonet]], in which males are considerably larger than females and possess longer fins.

The female's small body size is also likely beneficial to her chances of finding an unoccupied shell. Larger shells, although preferred by females, are often limited in availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Tetsu Sato |year=1994 |title=Active accumulation of spawning substrate: a determinant of extreme polygyny in a shell-brooding cichlid fish |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=669–678 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the female is limited to the growth of the size of the shell and may actually change her growth rate according to shell size availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dolores Schütz  |author2=Michael Taborsky  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Mate choice and sexual conflict in the size dimorphic water spider ''Argyroneta aquatica'' (Araneae: Argyronetidae) |journal=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=767–775 |doi=10.1636/S03-56.1 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v33_n3/arac-033-03-0767.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the male's ability to collect large shells depends on his size. The larger the male, the larger the shells he is able to collect. This then allows for females to be larger in his brooding nest which makes the difference between the sizes of the sexes less substantial. Male-male competition in this fish species also selects for large size in males. There is aggressive competition by males over territory and access to larger shells. Large males win fights and steal shells from competitors. Sexual dimorphism also occurs in hermaphroditic fish. These species are known as [[sequential hermaphrodites]]. In fish, [[Life history theory|reproductive histories]] often include the sex-change from female to male where there is a strong connection between growth, the sex of an individual, and the mating system it operates within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark I.

Social organization plays a large role in the changing of sex by the fish. It is often seen that a fish will change its sex when there is a lack of dominant male within the social hierarchy. The females that change sex are often those who attain and preserve an initial size advantage early in life. In either case, females which change sex to males are larger and often prove to be a good example of dimorphism.

In other cases with fish, males will go through noticeable changes in body size, and females will go through morphological changes that can only be seen inside of the body.  For example, in [[sockeye salmon]], males develop larger body size at maturity, including an increase in body depth, hump height, and snout length.  Females experience minor changes in snout length, but the most noticeable difference is the huge increase in gonad size, which accounts for about 25% of body mass.&lt;ref name=Secondary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendry|first=Andrew P.|author2=Ole K.

Sexual selection was observed for female ornamentation in ''[[Gobiusculus flavescens]]'', known as two-spotted gobies.&lt;ref name="Amundsen"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Amundsen T. |author2=Forsgren E. | year = 2001 | title = Male mate choice selects for female coloration in a fish | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 23| pages = 13155–13160 | doi=10.1073/pnas.211439298|pmid=11606720 | pmc=60840|bibcode=2001PNAS...9813155A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional hypotheses suggest that male-male competition drives selection. However, selection for ornamentation within this species suggests that showy female traits can be selected through either female-female competition or male mate choice.&lt;ref name="Amundsen"/&gt;  Since carotenoid-based ornamentation suggests mate quality, female two-spotted guppies that develop colorful orange bellies during the breeding season are considered favorable to males.&lt;ref name="Svensson"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Svensson P.

==Amphibians and non-avian reptiles==
In amphibians and reptiles, the degree of sexual dimorphism varies widely among [[taxonomic groups]]. The sexual dimorphism in amphibians and reptiles may be reflected in any of the following: anatomy; relative length of tail; relative size of head; overall size as in many species of [[viperidae|vipers]] and [[lizards]]; coloration as in many [[amphibians]], [[snakes]], and lizards, as well as in some [[turtles]]; an ornament as in many [[newts]] and lizards; the presence of specific sex-related behaviour is common to many lizards; and vocal qualities which are frequently observed in [[frogs]].

Sexual dimorphism in birds can be manifested in size or plumage differences between the sexes. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case, e.g. [[birds of prey]], [[hummingbird]]s, and some species of flightless birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|1994|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Becoming Different But Staying Alike: Patterns of Sexual Size and Shape Dimorphism in Bills of Hummingbirds|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9206-3|journal = Evolutionary Biology|date = 2012-11-11|issn = 0071-3260|pages = 246–260|volume = 40|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s11692-012-9206-3|first = Chelsea M.|last = Berns|first2 = Dean C.|last2 = Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or coloration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly colored sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=K.

Sexual dimorphism is a product of both genetics and environmental factors. An example of [[sexual polymorphism]] determined by environmental conditions exists in the [[red-backed fairywren]]. Red-backed fairywren males can be classified into three categories during [[breeding season]]: black breeders, brown breeders, and brown auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; These differences arise in response to the bird's body condition: if they are healthy they will produce more androgens thus becoming black breeders, while less healthy birds produce less androgens and become brown auxiliaries.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; The reproductive success of the male is thus determined by his success during each year's non-breeding season, causing reproductive success to vary with each year's environmental conditions.

Migratory patterns and behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms. This aspect also stems back to the size dimorphism in species. It has been shown that the larger males are better at coping with the difficulties of migration and thusly are more successful in reproducing when reaching the breeding destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubolini | first1 = Diego | last2 = Spina | first2 = Fernando | last3 = Saino | first3 = Nicola | year = 2004 | title = Protandry and sexual dimorphism in trans-saharan migratory birds | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 592–601 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arh048}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewing this in an evolutionary standpoint many theories and explanations come to consideration. If these are the result for every migration and breeding season the expected results should be a shift towards a larger male population through sexual selection. Sexual selection is strong when the factor of environmental selection is also introduced. The environmental selection may support a smaller chick size if those chicks were born in an area that allowed them to grow to a larger size, even though under normal conditions they would not be able to reach this optimal size for migration. When the environment gives advantages and disadvantages of this sort, the strength of selection is weakened and the environmental forces are given greater morphological weight. The sexual dimorphism could also produce a change in timing of migration leading to differences in mating success within the bird population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kissner | first1 = K. J. | last2 = Weatherhead | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Francis | first3 = C. M. | year = 2003 | title = Sexual size dimorphism and timing of spring migration in birds | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 154–162 | doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2003.00479.x| pmid = 14635890 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the dimorphism produces that large of a variation between the sexes and between the members of the sexes multiple evolutionary effects can take place. This timing could even lead to a speciation phenomenon if the variation becomes strongly drastic and favorable towards two different outcomes.

[[Grouse|Sexual dimorphism]] is maintained by the counteracting pressures of natural selection and sexual selection. For example, sexual dimorphism in coloration increases the vulnerability of bird species to predation by European sparrowhawks in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Moller"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anders Pape Møller  |author2=Jan Tøttrup Nielsen  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title=Prey vulnerability in relation to sexual coloration of prey |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/5838v731471n881w/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF | journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=227–233 |doi=10.1007/s00265-006-0160-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, increased sexual dimorphism means males are brighter and more conspicuous, leading to increased predation.&lt;ref name="Moller"/&gt; Moreover, the production of more exaggerated ornaments in males may come at the cost of suppressed immune function.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; So long as the reproductive benefits of the trait due to sexual selection are greater than the costs imposed by natural selection, then the trait will propagate throughout the population. Reproductive benefits arise in the form of a larger number of offspring, while natural selection imposes costs in the form of reduced survival. This means that even if the trait causes males to die earlier, the trait is still beneficial so long as males with the trait produce more offspring than males lacking the trait. This balance keeps the dimorphism alive in these species and ensures that the next generation of successful males will also display these traits that are attractive to the females.

Such differences in form and reproductive roles often cause differences in behavior. As previously stated, males and females often have different roles in reproduction. The courtship and mating behavior of males and females are regulated largely by hormones throughout a bird's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Adkins-Regan |year=2007 |title=Hormones and the development of sex differences in behavior |journal=[[Journal of Ornithology]] |volume=148 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S17–S26 |doi=10.1007/s10336-007-0188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activational hormones occur during puberty and adulthood and serve to 'activate' certain behaviors when appropriate, such as territoriality during breeding season.&lt;ref name="Adkins"/&gt; Organizational hormones occur only during a critical period early in development, either just before or just after hatching in most birds, and determine patterns of behavior for the rest of the bird's life.&lt;ref name="Adkins"/&gt; Such behavioral differences can cause disproportionate sensitivities to anthropogenic pressures.&lt;ref name="Grubler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin U.

P. F., Short, R.V.,. (1995). Hormonal basis of sexual dimorphism in birds: Implications for new theories of sexual selection. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution., 10(REF), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism may also influence differences in parental investment during times of food scarcity. For example, in the [[blue-footed booby]], the female chicks grow faster than the males, resulting in booby parents producing the smaller sex, the males, during times of food shortage. This then results in the maximization of parental lifetime reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velando|first=Alberto|title=Experimental Manipulation of Maternal Effort Produces Differential Effects in Sons and Daughters: Implications for Adaptive Sex Ratios in the Blue-footed Booby|journal=Behavioral Ecology|year=2002|volume=13|issue=4|pages=443–449|doi=10.1093/beheco/13.4.443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual dimorphism may also only appear during mating season, some species of birds only show dimorphic traits in seasonal variation. The males of these species will molt into a less bright or less exaggerated color during the off breeding season.&lt;ref&gt;The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds

Consequently, sexual dimorphism has important ramifications for conservation. However, sexual dimorphism is not only found in birds and is thus important to the conservation of many animals.

Sexual dimorphism in elephant seals is associated with the ability of a male to defend territories, which correlates with polygynic behavior. The large sexual size dimorphism is due to sexual selection, but also because females reach reproductive age much earlier than males.

In humans, biological sex is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a Y chromosome, the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[sex hormone]]s, the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]] in females), and the external genitalia.&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOXAp27iQkC&amp;pg=PT64 Choices in Relationships: An Introduction to Marriage and the Family]''. 11 ed. Cengage Learning; 2011-10-10 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, the five factors are either all male or all female.  Sexual ambiguity is rare in humans, but wherein such ambiguity does occur, the individual is biologically classified as [[intersex]].

Sexual dimorphism among humans includes differentiation among gonads, internal genitals, external genitals, breasts, muscle mass, height, the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects. Human sexual differentiation is effected primarily at the gene level, by the presence or absence of a Y-chromosome, which encodes biochemical modifiers for sexual development in males.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9967/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Clark Spencer Larsen, modern day ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' show a range of sexual dimorphism, with average body mass difference between the sexes being roughly equal to 15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Clark Spencer|title=Equality for the sexes in human evolution?

The average [[basal metabolic rate]] is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females tend to convert more food into [[fat]], while males convert more into [[muscle]] and expendable circulating energy reserves.

Overall, about 6500 genes have been found to have sex-differential expression in at least one tissue. Many of these genes are not directly associated with reproduction, but rather linked to more general biological features. In addition, it has been shown that genes with sex specific expression undergo reduced selection efficiency, which lead to higher population frequencies of deleterious mutations and contributing to the prevalence of several human diseases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12915-017-0352-z|pmid=28173793|pmc=5297171|title=The landscape of sex-differential transcriptome and its consequent selection in human adults|journal=BMC Biology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=7|year=2017|last1=Gershoni|first1=Moran|last2=Pietrokovski|first2=Shmuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms5438|pmid=25014762|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E4438G|title=Reduced selection and accumulation of deleterious mutations in genes exclusively expressed in men|journal=Nature Communications|volume=5|pages=4438|last1=Gershoni|first1=Moran|last2=Pietrokovski|first2=Shmuel|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductively advantageous==
In theory, larger females are favored by competition for mates, especially in polygamous species. Larger females offer an advantage in fertility, since the physiological demands of reproduction are limiting in females. Hence there is a theoretical expectation that females tend to be larger in species that are monogamous.
Females are larger in many species of [[insect]]s, many [[spider]]s, many [[fish]], many reptiles, [[owl]]s, birds of prey and certain mammals such as the [[spotted hyena]], and baleen whales such as [[blue whale]]. As an example, in some species, females are sedentary, and so males must search for them. Fritz Vollrath and [[Geoff Parker]] argue that this difference in behaviour leads to radically different selection pressures on the two sexes, evidently favouring smaller males.&lt;ref name="vollrathparker" /&gt; Cases where the male is larger than the female have been studied as well,&lt;ref name="vollrathparker"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fritz Vollrath  |author2=Geoff A.

One example of this type of sexual size dimorphism is the bat ''[[Myotis nigricans]]'', (black myotis bat) where females are substantially larger than males in terms of body weight, skull measurement, and forearm length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=R. I. Bornholdt, L. R. Oliveira &amp; M. E.

Females bear the energetic cost of producing eggs, which is much greater than the cost of making sperm by the males. The fecundity advantage hypothesis states that a larger female is able to produce more offspring and give them more favorable conditions to ensure their survival; this is true for most ectotherms. A larger female can provide parental care for a longer time while the offspring matures. The gestation and lactation periods are fairly long in ''M. nigricans'', the females suckling their offspring until they reach nearly adult size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Virginia Hayssen |author2=T.

Smaller male size may be an adaptation to increase maneuverability and agility, allowing males to compete better with females for food and other resources.

Some species of [[anglerfish]] also display extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are more typical in appearance to other fish, whereas the males are tiny rudimentary creatures with stunted digestive systems. A male must find a female and fuse with her: he then lives parasitically, becoming little more than a sperm-producing body in what amounts to an effectively hermaphrodite composite organism. A similar situation is found in the Zeus water bug ''Phoreticovelia disparata'' where the female has a glandular area on her back that can serve to feed a male, which clings to her (note that although males can survive away from females, they generally are not free-living).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Göran Arnqvist, Therésa M.

Another complicated example of sexual dimorphism is in ''[[Vespula squamosa]]'', the southern yellowjacket.  In this wasp species, the female workers are the smallest, the male workers are slightly larger, and the female queens are significantly larger than her female worker and male counterparts.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Sexual dimorphism by size is evident in some extinct species such as the [[velociraptor]]. In the case of velociraptors the sexual size dimorphism may have been caused by two factors: male competition for hunting ground to attract mates, and/or female competition for nesting locations and mates, males being a scarce breeding resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsen|first1=Jerry|last2=Olsen|first2=Penny|title=Sexual Size Dimorphism in Raptors: Intrasexual Competition in the Larger Sex for a Scarce Breeding Resource, the Smaller Se|journal=Emu|date=5 August 1986|volume=87|doi=10.1071/MU9870059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, [[Charles Darwin]] advanced the [[theory of sexual selection]], which related sexual dimorphism with [[sexual selection]].

It has been proposed that the earliest sexual dimorphism is the size differentiation of sperm and eggs ([[anisogamy]]), but the evolutionary significance of sexual dimorphism is more complex than that would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Deborah Charlesworth]] &amp; Judith E. Mank |year=2010 |title=The birds and the bees and the flowers and the rrees: lessons from genetic mapping of sex determination in plants and animals |journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=9–31 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.117697|pmc=2940314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anisogamy]] and the usually large number of small male gametes relative to the larger female gametes usually lies in the development of strong [[sperm competition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G. A. Parker |year=1982 |title=Why are there so many tiny sperm? Sperm competition and the maintenance of two sexes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=281–294 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(82)90225-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jiang-Nan Yang |year=2010 |title=Cooperation and the evolution of anisogamy |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=264 |issue=1 |pages=24–36 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.01.019 |pmid=20097207}}&lt;/ref&gt; because small sperm enable organisms to produce a large number of sperm, and make males (or male function of hermaphrodites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G. Bell |year=1985 |title=On the function of flowers |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=224 |issue= 1235|pages=223–266 |jstor=36033 |bibcode=1985RSPSB.224..223B |doi=10.1098/rspb.1985.0031}}&lt;/ref&gt;) more redundant. This intensifies male competition for mates and promotes the evolution of other sexual dimorphism in many species, especially in [[vertebrates]] including [[mammals]]. However, in some species, the females can be larger than males, irrespective of gametes, and in some species females (usually of species in which males invest a lot in rearing offspring and thus no longer considered as so redundant) compete for mates in ways more usually associated with males.

In many non-monogamous species, the benefit to a male's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple females is large, whereas the benefit to a female's reproductive fitness of mating with multiple males is small or nonexistent.&lt;ref name="futuyma330"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these species, there is a [[selection pressure]] for whatever traits enable a male to have more matings. The male may therefore come to have different traits from the female.

[[File:Sumatran orangutan family in Toronto Zoo.JPG|thumb|Male (left), offspring, and female (right) Sumatran [[orangutan]]s.]]
These traits could be ones that allow him to fight off other males for control of territory or a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]], such as large size or weapons;&lt;ref name="futuyma331"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; or they could be traits that females, for whatever reason, prefer in mates.&lt;ref name="futuyma332"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Male-male competition]] poses no deep theoretical questions&lt;ref name="ridley328"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[mate choice]] does.

Females may choose males that appear strong and healthy, thus likely to possess "good [[allele]]s" and give rise to healthy offspring.&lt;ref name="futuyma335"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, however, females seem to choose males with traits that do not improve offspring survival rates, and even traits that reduce it (potentially leading to traits like the peacock's tail).&lt;ref name="ridley328" /&gt; Two hypotheses for explaining this fact are the [[sexy son hypothesis]] and the [[handicap principle]].

The sexy son hypothesis states that females may initially choose a trait because it improves the survival of their young, but once this preference has become widespread, females must continue to choose the trait, even if it becomes harmful. Those that do not will have sons that are unattractive to most females (since the preference is widespread) and so receive few matings.&lt;ref name="ridley330"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handicap principle states that a male who survives despite possessing some sort of handicap thus proves that the rest of his genes are "good alleles". If males with "bad alleles" could not survive the handicap, females may evolve to choose males with this sort of handicap; the trait is acting as a hard-to-fake signal of fitness.&lt;ref name="ridley332"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|2004|p=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''small penis rule''' is an informal strategy used by authors to evade [[libel]] lawsuits. It was described in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 1998:

{{quote|"For a fictional portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem linking the two," said Mr. Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as "the small penis rule". One way authors can protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Mr. Friedman said. "Now no male is going to come forward and say, 'That character with a very small penis, that's me!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E7DD1F3DF937A15753C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | title=Writers as Plunderers; Why Do They Keep Giving Away Other People's Secrets? | author=Dinitia Smith | work=The New York Times | date=24 October 1998 | accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Human penis size|small penis]] rule was referenced in a 2006 dispute between [[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]] and [[Michael Crichton]]. Crowley alleged that after he wrote an unflattering review of Crichton's novel ''[[State of Fear]]'', Crichton included a character named "Mick Crowley" in the novel ''[[Next (novel)|Next]]''. The character is a [[Child sexual abuse|child rapist]], described as being a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based journalist and [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate with a small penis.&lt;ref name="next"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/books/14cric.html | title=Columnist Accuses Crichton of ‘Literary Hit-and-Run’ | author=Felicia R.

The [[YouTube]] [[video hosting service]] constitutes a social networking website on which practically any individual or organization with Internet access can upload videos that can be seen almost immediately by wide audiences. As the world's largest video platform, YouTube has had impact in many fields, with some individual YouTube videos having directly shaped world events.

In his 2010 [[TED (conference)|TED Talk]] on crowd-accelerated innovation, TED [[curator]] [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]] preliminarily noted that human brains are "uniquely wired" to decode high-bandwidth video, and that unlike written text, face-to-face communication of the type that online videos convey has been "fine-tuned by millions of years of evolution."&lt;ref name=TED201007Anderson/&gt;  Referring to several YouTube contributors, Anderson asserted that "what [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] did for writing, online video can now do for face-to-face communication," that it's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may be about to launch "the biggest learning cycle in human history."&lt;ref name=TED201007Anderson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation.html |title=How web video powers global innovation |last=Anderson |first=Chris |date=July 2010 |publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6M8aa7tLF?url=http://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation.html |archivedate=December 25, 2013 }} (click on "Show transcript" tab) • Corresponding [https://www.webcitation.org/6M8ap1TVP?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnQcCgS7aPQ YouTube video] from official TED channel was titled "How YouTube is driving innovation."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on values and standards===
YouTube was included in ''Entertainment Weekly's'' "100 Greatest" list in 2009—though with the ironic praise, "a safe home for piano-playing cats, celeb goof-ups, and overzealous lip-synchers since 2005".&lt;ref name=EntWeekly20091204&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20324138,00.html |title=100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, and More |date=December 4, 2009 |website=Entertainment Weekly |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MkOc60zc?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20324138,00.html |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, citing YouTube's then most viewed video ''[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]'' as an example of viewers not choosing what might have traditionally been judged "quality", ''Advertising Age'' journalist Michael Learmonth asserted that for information and entertainment the Internet had both killed and redefined the concept of quality.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; Learmonth reasoned that online journalism, being based on "greatly diminished economics and expectations", is intrinsically inaccurate and a de-professionalized version of offline journalism.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; In this vein, [[GroupM]]'s CEO was quoted as saying there seemed to be a bigger premium on popularity than authority.&lt;ref name=AdAge20100222/&gt; Concerning these phenomena, the CEO of Associated Content (now [[Yahoo!

In 2008, cultural anthropologist [[Michael Wesch]] observed that both YouTube [[Video blog|vloggers]] and their viewers can experience a profound sense of connection, the distance and anonymity between them enabling them to avoid the constraining effect of conventional social norms (such as not staring at people).&lt;ref name=WeschLoC2008/&gt; This sense of connection is said to occur in an era of "cultural inversion" in which we are driven to express our individualism and independence, yet still value community and relationships.&lt;ref name=WeschLoC2008&gt;{{cite web |title=An Anthroplogical Introduction to YouTube |last=Wesch |first=Michael |date=June 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPAO-lZ4_hU |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/WeschYouTube| archivedate=February 17, 2017 |deadurl=no }} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170922165546/http://www.allreadable.com/6a6b3DUK Transcript]).

YouTube served as a platform for individuals to voice their views about the parliamentary and presidential elections (2011, 2012) in Russia, in either a serious or satirical manner, one of which—the satire "Arrest of [[Vladimir Putin]]: a report from the courtroom"—was viewed enough times to make the list of most popular videos on YouTube for two consecutive weeks.&lt;ref name=PewTopStoriesYT20120716&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/07/16/top-stories/ |title=YouTube and News: Top Stories |last=Journalism Project Staff |date=July 17, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MGFsXlgy?url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/07/16/top-stories/ |archivedate=December 30, 2013 }} Original video title: "Арест Владимира Путина: репортаж из зала суда"&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in September 2018 by Data &amp; Society Research Institute reported that a collection of far-right political [[Influencer marketing|influencers]] use YouTube's [[Recommender system|recommendation engine]]—in concert with conventional brand-building techniques such as cross-marketing—to attract followers, and profit from monetization of engagements thus obtained.&lt;ref name=ColJournRvw20180919&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ingram |first1=Mathew |title=YouTube’s secret life as an engine for right-wing radicalization |url=https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php |work=Columbia Journalism Review |date=September 19, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200822/https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php |archivedate=September 23, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, given the tendency of YouTube's recommendation engine to suggest more radical videos, researcher Rebecca Lewis wrote that such networking "makes it easy for audience members to be incrementally exposed to, and come to trust, ever more extremist political positions".&lt;ref name=ColJournRvw20180919/&gt;&lt;ref name=DataSocietyPaper20180918&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lewis |first1=Rebecca |title=Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube |url=https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DS_Alternative_Influence.pdf |publisher=Data &amp; Society Research Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927022801/https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DS_Alternative_Influence.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2018 |date=September 18, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Klein wrote on ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' that "this is arguably the first time we’ve seen a distinctive ideological coalition emerging atop social media platforms and under the influence of social media algorithms".&lt;ref name=Vox20180924&gt;{{cite web |last1=Klein |first1=Ezra |title=The rise of YouTube’s reactionary right - How demographic change and YouTube’s algorithms are building a new right |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/24/17883330/dave-rubin-ben-shapiro-youtube-reactionary-right-peterson |website=Vox |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924162247/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/24/17883330/dave-rubin-ben-shapiro-youtube-reactionary-right-peterson |archivedate=September 24, 2018 |date=September 24, 2018 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expression of racial minorities and minority viewpoints===
''The Washington Post'' reported that a disproportionate share—8 of 20 in April 2012—of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream American television, in which the stars are largely white.&lt;ref name="WashPost20120420"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-online-video-minorities-find-an-audience/2012/04/20/gIQAdhliWT_story.html |title=In online video, minorities find an audience |last=Tsukayama |first=Hayley |date=April 20, 2012 |website=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MhzkT8Bw?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-online-video-minorities-find-an-audience/2012/04/20/gIQAdhliWT_story.html |archivedate=January 18, 2014 }} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6GQYXAelq?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-online-video-minorities-find-an-audience/2012/04/20/gIQAdhliWT_story_1.html archive of p. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such channels thus target an audience largely neglected by traditional networks, which feel pressure to appeal to a broader audience.&lt;ref name="WashPost20120420"/&gt; According to the study, online media offer a way to push back against enduring stereotypes.&lt;ref name="WashPost20120420"/&gt;

===Sharing of personal information===

====Benefits of sharing personal information====
After the 2010 repeal of the U.S military's [[Don't ask, don't tell]] policy, numerous [[coming out]] videos—characterized as possibly being crucial to the individuals' self-actualization and growth, and even preventing suicide—were posted to YouTube.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 20111014"/&gt;  Uploaders were able to limit viewership of their videos, which were facilitated by what a clinical psychologist characterized as a disappearance of stigma surrounding the sharing of personal information.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 20111014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Considine |first=Austin |title=Coming Out to the World on the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/fashion/after-dont-ask-dont-tell-coming-out-on-the-web.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NMWVmsBX?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/fashion/after-dont-ask-dont-tell-coming-out-on-the-web.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People, especially the elderly, post "[[Wiktionary:legacy|legacy]] project" videos to share their life stories, and can receive feedback from viewers allowing them to expand their social contacts.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20070410/&gt; This interaction is particularly beneficial to those with limited mobility.&lt;ref name=NYTimes20070410&gt;{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Keith |title=For Keeps: Lives on the Record and on the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/retirement/10web.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NaO0NMjP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/retirement/10web.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dangers of sharing personal information====
Some personal-information videos, such as those depicting uploaders' [[self-harm]], may have a negative impact on viewers.&lt;ref name=Pediatrics20110221/&gt; Such videos may encourage, normalize or sensationalize self-injury, may trigger viewers to self-injury, and may reinforce harmful behavior through regular viewing.&lt;ref name=Pediatrics20110221&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Stephen P. |last2=Heath |first2=Nancy L. |last3=St. Denis |first3=Jill M. |last4=Noble |first4=Rick |title=The Scope of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury on YouTube |journal=Pediatrics |date=February 21, 2011 |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2317 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/02/21/peds.2010-2317.full.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NPgkKWHb?url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/02/21/peds.2010-2317.full.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2014 |volume=127 |pages=e552–e557}}  ([http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/02/21/peds.2010-2317 Abstract in html]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of videos to bring fame to oneself or humiliation to others, has motivated physical violence, such as the video-recorded beating of a 16-year-old Florida cheerleader by six teenage girls over a half-hour time period, causing a concussion and temporary loss of hearing and sight,&lt;ref name=TampaBayTimes20090409/&gt; generating international media attention,&lt;ref name=TampaBayTimes20090409&gt;{{cite news |last=Ave |first=Melanie |title=Video of Lakeland teen's beating evokes outrage |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/video-of-lakeland-teens-beating-evokes-outrage/450274 |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=April 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NXmKqDCc?url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/video-of-lakeland-teens-beating-evokes-outrage/450274 |archivedate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspiring the 2011 [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime television network]] movie ''[[Girl Fight]].''&lt;ref name=Ledger20111002&gt;{{cite news |last=Pleasant |first=Matthew |title=Local Teen Beating Inspires Movie |url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20111002/NEWS/111009875/-1/NEWS32?p=all |newspaper=The Ledger |date=October 2, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NXmpA2Kk?url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20111002/NEWS/111009875/-1/NEWS32?p=all |archivedate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some YouTube content creators have taken advantage of their perceived celebrity status and have abused their relationships with fans, sometimes perpetrating [[emotional manipulation]] or sexual abuse on teenagers younger than the age of consent.&lt;ref name=TechGeekAU20140320/&gt; While, conversely, online creators have sometimes been the victims of false accounts of abuse, some ''bona fide'' victims do not report actual abuse out of victim-shaming by other fans, victims' self-blame, repression, fear of retribution, or delay in processing what had happened.&lt;ref name=TechGeekAU20140320&gt;{{cite web |last=Huynh |first=Terence |title=Crossing the line: YouTube community in crisis as sexual assault allegations are made public |url=http://techgeek.com.au/2014/03/20/crossing-the-line/ |publisher=Tech Geek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324190122/http://techgeek.com.au/2014/03/20/crossing-the-line/ |archivedate=March 24, 2014 |date=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube has focused on developing channels rather than creating content ''per se'', the channels fragmenting the audience into niches in much the same way that decades earlier hundreds of niche-audience cable TV channels fragmented the audience previously dominated by the [[Big Three television networks]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker20120116"/&gt; Based on YouTube's channel development plans, including [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|YouTube Original Channels]], journalist [[John Seabrook]] projected that "the niches will get nichier", with audiences being more engaged and much more quantifiable, enabling advertising to be more highly focused.&lt;ref name="NewYorker20120116"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/16/120116fa_fact_seabrook?currentPage=all |title=Streaming Dreams / YouTube turns pro|website=The New Yorker |last= Seabrook |first=John |date=January 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MVASRAtr?url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/16/120116fa_fact_seabrook?currentPage=all |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement of mainstream opinion===
In the year following its 2005 formation, YouTube, with its display of view counts, was likened to "a survey of cultural whims", whose more popular artists attracted the interest of established production companies.&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060611/NEWS/606110552/1011/FEATURES |title=Video makers find a vast and eager audience |last=Feifer |first=Jason |date=June 11, 2006 |website=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MWhLHDsU?url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060611/NEWS/606110552/1011/FEATURES |archivedate=January 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In YouTube's first years, however, music labels had trouble gauging the commercial value of online popularity, perceiving that the Internet's "convenience factor" made an artist's online following less indicative of audience attachment than direct measures such as CD sales and concert attendance.&lt;ref name=Reuters20070225/&gt; By early 2013 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' had announced that it was factoring YouTube streaming data into calculation of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the Hot 100 formula-based genre charts.&lt;ref name=Billboard20130220&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549399/hot-100-news-billboard-and-nielsen-add-youtube-video-streaming-to-platforms |title=Hot 100 News: Billboard and Nielsen Add YouTube Video Streaming to Platforms |author=''Billboard'' staff  |date=February 20, 2013 |website=Billboard |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Mje9ORDm?url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549399/hot-100-news-billboard-and-nielsen-add-youtube-video-streaming-to-platforms |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Putting online listens on the same footing as actual song purchases to determine hits was described as reflecting "the latest shift in power in the music industry: from record labels and radio DJs to listeners".&lt;ref name=NewRepublic20121116&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/110246/jukeboxes-youtube-how-billboard-catching-the-times |title=From Jukeboxes to YouTube: How Billboard Is Catching Up With The Times |last=Diamond |first=Jason |date=November 16, 2012 |website=The New Republic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MjeNprI9?url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/110246/jukeboxes-youtube-how-billboard-catching-the-times |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2013, ''[[Forbes]]''' Katheryn Thayer noted that, though booking the right concert venues and radio and television stations once propelled artists to fame, social media activity had become "unquestionably important".&lt;ref name=Forbes20131029/&gt; Emphasizing the importance of the way the 2013 [[YouTube Music Awards]] determined winners—social media statistics informing nominations and social media shares determining winners—Thayer asserted that digital-era artists' work must not only be of high quality, but must elicit reactions on the YouTube platform and social media.&lt;ref name=Forbes20131029&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherynthayer/2013/10/29/the-youtube-music-awards-why-artists-should-care/ |title=The Youtube Music Awards: Why Artists Should Care |last=Thayer |first=Katheryn |date=October 29, 2013 |website=Forbes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KupXHvTe?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/katherynthayer/2013/10/29/the-youtube-music-awards-why-artists-should-care/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of YouTube as a platform for individuals and companies===
Within the year following YouTube's 2005 launch—which one commentator called "the biggest jolt to Internet video"&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611/&gt;—entertainment industry executives and casting agents were researching video sharing websites.&lt;ref name=LATimes20060619/&gt; When a video hit big it was not uncommon for its creator to hear from production companies.&lt;ref name=Telegram20060611/&gt; By June 2006, recognized Hollywood and music industry firms had begun to establish formal business ties with "homegrown" YouTube talent—the first believed to be comedian blogger [[Brooke Brodack|Brooke "Brookers" Brodack]] (through [[Carson Daly]]),&lt;ref name=LATimes20060619&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/entertainment/et-channel19 |title=Now she has their attention |last=Collins |first=Scott |date=June 19, 2006 |website=Los Angeles Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MfxAU28P?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/19/entertainment/et-channel19 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then singer [[Justin Bieber]] (through [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]),&lt;ref name=Billboard20100319&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959001/justin-bieber-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0%2C1 |title=Justin Bieber - The Billboard Cover Story |last=Herrera |first=Monica |date=March 19, 2010 |website=Billboard |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MfyFel8l?url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959001/justin-bieber-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0,1 |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and physician-become-political satirist [[Bassem Youssef]] (through an Egyptian television network).&lt;ref name=CBS60Minutes20140316/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeutscheWelle20140207/&gt;

In 2016, YouTube's demonetization of user videos that had "controversial or sensitive subjects and events ... even if graphic imagery is not shown”—thereby disallowing ad revenue—angered content creators who perceived the policy as "rampant censorship" and inspired a #YouTubeIsOverParty [[hashtag]] on social media.&lt;ref name=WashPost20160901&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dewey |first1=Caitlin |title=Why YouTubers are accusing the site of rampant ‘censorship’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/01/why-youtubers-are-accusing-the-site-of-rampant-censorship/ |work=The Washington Post |date=September 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kK5kEgOm?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/09/01/why-youtubers-are-accusing-the-site-of-rampant-censorship/ |archivedate=September 6, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28361">In [[mathematics]] a '''stack''' or '''2-sheaf''' is, roughly speaking, a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] that takes values in categories rather than sets. Stacks are used to formalise some of the main constructions of [[descent theory]], and to construct fine moduli stacks when [[fine moduli space]]s do not exist.

Descent theory is concerned with generalisations of situations where [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], compatible geometrical objects (such as [[vector bundle]]s on [[topological space]]s) can be "glued together" within a restriction of the topological basis. In a more general set-up the restrictions are replaced with [[Pullback (category theory)|pullbacks]]; [[fibred category|fibred categories]] then make a good framework to discuss the possibility of such gluing. The intuitive meaning of a stack is that it is a fibred category such that "all possible gluings work". The specification of gluings requires a definition of coverings with regard to which the gluings can be considered. It turns out that the general language for describing these coverings is that of a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Thus a stack is formally given as a fibred category over another ''base'' category, where the base has a Grothendieck topology and where the fibred category satisfies a few axioms that ensure existence and uniqueness of certain gluings with respect to the Grothendieck topology.

==Overview==
Stacks are the underlying structure of algebraic stacks (also called Artin stacks) and Deligne–Mumford stacks, which generalize [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] and [[algebraic space]]s and which are particularly useful in studying [[moduli space]]s. There are inclusions: schemes ⊆ algebraic spaces ⊆ Deligne–Mumford stacks ⊆ algebraic stacks (Artin stacks) ⊆ stacks.

{{harvtxt|Edidin|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Fantechi|2001}} give a brief introductory accounts of stacks, {{harvtxt|Gómez|2001}}, {{harvtxt|Olsson|2007}} and  {{harvtxt|Vistoli|2005}} give more detailed introductions, and {{harvtxt|Laumon|Moret-Bailly|2000}} describes the more advanced theory.

==Motivation and history==

quote=La conclusion pratique à laquelle je suis arrivé dès maintenant, c'est que chaque fois que en vertu de mes critères, une variété de modules (ou plutôt, un schéma de modules) pour la classification des variations (globales, ou infinitésimales) de certaines structures (variétés complètes non singulières, fibrés vectoriels, etc.) ne peut exister, malgré de bonnes hypothèses de platitude, propreté, et non singularité éventuellement, la raison en est seulement l'existence d'automorphismes de la structure qui empêche la technique de descente de marcher.
|source=Grothendieck's letter to Serre, 1959 Nov 5.}}
The concept of stacks has its origin in the definition of effective descent data in {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1959}}.
In a 1959 letter to Serre, Grothendieck observed that a fundamental  obstruction to constructing good moduli spaces is the existence of automorphisms. A major motivation for stacks is that if a moduli space for some problem does not exist because of the existence of automorphisms, it may still be possible to construct a moduli stack.

{{harvtxt|Mumford|1965}} studied the Picard group of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]], before stacks had been defined. Stacks were first defined by  {{harvs|txt|last=Giraud|year1=1966|year2=1971}}, and the term "stack" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Deligne|Mumford|1969}} for the original French term "champ" meaning "field". In this paper they also introduced '''Deligne–Mumford stacks''', which they called algebraic stacks, though the term "algebraic stack" now usually refers to the more general '''Artin stacks''' introduced by {{harvs|txt|author-link=Michael Artin|last=Artin|year=1974}}.

When defining quotients of schemes by group actions, it is often impossible for the quotient to be a scheme and still satisfy desirable properties for a quotient. For example, if a few points have non-trivial stabilisers, then the [[categorical quotient]] will not exist among schemes.

In the same way, [[moduli space]]s of curves, vector bundles, or other geometric objects are often best defined as stacks instead of schemes.  Constructions of moduli spaces often proceed by first constructing a larger space parametrizing the objects in question, and then [[quotient stack|quotienting by group action]] to account for objects with automorphisms which have been overcounted.

==Definitions==

A category &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with a functor to a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[fibered category]] over &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if for any morphism &lt;math&gt;F:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and any object &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with image &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; (under the functor), there is a pullback &lt;math&gt;f:x\to y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. This means a morphism with image &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that any morphism &lt;math&gt;g:z\to y&lt;/math&gt; with image &lt;math&gt;G=F\circ H&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;g=f\circ h&lt;/math&gt; by a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;h:z\to x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that the functor maps &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. The element &lt;math&gt;x = F^*y&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''pullback''' of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and is unique up to canonical isomorphism.

The category ''c'' is called a '''[[prestack]]''' over a category ''C'' with a [[Grothendieck topology]] if it is fibered over ''C'' and for any object ''U'' of ''C'' and objects ''x'', ''y'' of ''c'' with image ''U'', the functor from objects over ''U'' to sets taking ''F'':''V''→''U'' to Hom(''F''*''x'',''F''*''y'') is a sheaf. This terminology is not consistent with the terminology for sheaves: prestacks are the analogues of separated presheaves rather than presheaves.

The category ''c'' is called a '''stack''' over the category ''C'' with a Grothendieck topology if it is a prestack over ''C'' and every descent datum is effective. A '''descent datum''' consists roughly of a covering of an object ''V'' of ''C'' by a family ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the fiber over ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and morphisms ''f&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' between the restrictions of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''V&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''=''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''×&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfying the compatibility condition ''f&lt;sub&gt;ki&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f&lt;sub&gt;kj&lt;/sub&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;''. The descent datum is called '''effective''' if the elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are essentially the pullbacks of an element ''x'' with image ''V''.

A stack is called a '''stack in groupoids''' or a '''(2,1)-sheaf''' if it is also fibered in groupoids, meaning that its fibers (the inverse images of objects of ''C'') are groupoids. Some authors use the word "stack" to refer to the more restrictive notion of a stack in groupoids.

An '''algebraic stack''' or '''Artin stack''' is a stack in groupoids ''X'' over the etale site such that the diagonal map of ''X'' is representable and there exists a smooth surjection from (the stack associated to) a scheme to X.
A morphism ''Y''&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''X'' of stacks is '''representable''' if, for every morphism ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''X'' from (the stack associated to) a scheme to X, the [[fiber product]] ''Y''&amp;nbsp;×&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''S'' is isomorphic to (the stack associated to) an [[algebraic space]]. The '''fiber product''' of stacks is defined using the usual [[universal property]], and changing the requirement that diagrams commute to the requirement that they [[2-commute]]. See also [[morphism of algebraic stacks]] for further information.

The motivation behind the representability of the diagonal is the following: the diagonal morphism &lt;math&gt;\Delta:\mathfrak{X} \to \mathfrak{X}\times\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; is representable if and only if for any pair of morphisms of algebraic spaces &lt;math&gt;X,Y \to \mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;, their fiber product &lt;math&gt;X\times_{\mathfrak{X}}Y&lt;/math&gt; is representable.

A '''[[Deligne–Mumford stack]]''' is an algebraic stack ''X'' such that there is an étale surjection  from a scheme to ''X''.
Roughly speaking, Deligne–Mumford stacks can be thought of as algebraic stacks whose objects have no infinitesimal automorphisms.

==Examples==
*If the fibers of a stack are sets (meaning categories whose only morphisms are identity maps) then the stack is essentially the same as a sheaf of sets. This shows that a stack is a sort of generalization of a sheaf, taking values in arbitrary categories rather than sets.
*More concretely, let ''h'' be a contravariant  functor from the category ''C'' of all schemes over some fixed base scheme to the category of sets. Then it [[Grothendieck construction|determines]] the following category ''H'':
:# an object is a pair (''S'', ''s'') consisting of a scheme ''S'' in ''C'' and an element ''s'' of the set ''h''(''S'')
:# a morphism (''S'', ''s'') → (''T'', ''t'') consists of a morphism ''φ'': ''S'' → ''T'' in ''C'' such that ''h''(''φ'')(''t'')= ''s''.
:Via the forgetful functor ''p'': ''H'' → ''C'', the category ''H'' is a [[fibered category|category fibered]] over ''C''. For example, if ''X'' is a scheme in ''C'', then it determines the contravariant functor &lt;math&gt;h = \operatorname{Hom}(-, X)&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding fibered category is the '''{{vanchor|stack associated to ''X'''''|stack associated to a scheme}}. Stacks (or prestacks) can be constructed as a variant of this construction.

*Any scheme with quasi-compact diagonal is an algebraic stack (or more precisely represents one) since every scheme has an action by the trivial group.
*The [[moduli stack of vector bundles]]: the category of vector bundles ''V''→''S'' is a stack over the category of  topological spaces ''S''. A morphism from ''V''→''S'' to ''W''→''T'' consists of continuous maps from ''S'' to ''T'' and from ''V'' to ''W'' (linear on fibers) such that the obvious square commutes.  The condition that this is a fibered category follows because one can take pullbacks of vector bundles over continuous maps of topological spaces, and the condition that a descent datum is effective follows because one can construct a vector bundle over a space by gluing together vector bundles on elements of an open cover.
*The stack of quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes (with respect to the [[fpqc-topology]] and weaker topologies)
*The stack of affine schemes on a base scheme (again with respect to the fpqc topology or a weaker one)
*{{harvtxt|Mumford|1965}} studied the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves|moduli stack M&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; of elliptic curves]], and showed that its Picard group is cyclic of order 12. For elliptic curves over the [[complex number]]s the corresponding stack is similar to a quotient  of the [[upper half-plane]] by the action of the [[modular group]].
*The [[moduli space of algebraic curves]] M&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; defined as a universal family of smooth curves of given [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' does not exist as an algebraic variety because in particular there are curves admitting nontrivial automorphisms. However there is a moduli stack  M&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; which is a good substitute for the non-existent fine moduli space of smooth genus ''g'' curves. More generally there is a moduli stack M&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of genus ''g'' curves with ''n'' marked points. In general this is an algebraic stack, and is a Deligne–Mumford stack for ''g≥''2 or  ''g''=1,''n''&gt;0 or ''g''=0, ''n''≥3 (in other words when the automorphism groups of the curves are finite). This moduli stack has a completion consisting of the moduli stack of stable curves (for given ''g'' and ''n'') which is proper over Spec '''Z'''.  For example, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the classifying stack BPGL(2) of the projective general linear group. (There is a subtlety in defining ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, as one has to use algebraic spaces rather than schemes to construct it.)
*A [[gerbe]] is a stack in groupoids; for example the trivial gerbe that assigns to each scheme the principal ''G''-bundles over the scheme, for some group ''G''.
*If ''Y'' is a scheme and ''G'' is a smooth affine group scheme acting on ''Y'', then there is a [[quotient algebraic stack]] ''Y''/''G'', taking a scheme ''T'' to the groupoid of ''G''-torsors over ''T'' with ''G''-equivariant maps to ''Y''. Explicitly, given a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-action, form the stack &lt;math&gt;[X/G]&lt;/math&gt; which (intuitively speaking) [[pseudo-functor|sends]] a space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to the groupoid of pullback diagrams
::&lt;math&gt;[X/G](Y) = \begin{Bmatrix}
Z &amp; \xrightarrow{\Phi} &amp; X \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\
Y &amp; \xrightarrow{\phi} &amp; [X/G]
\end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant morphism of spaces and &lt;math&gt;Z \to Y&lt;/math&gt;is a principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundle. The morphisms in this category are just morphisms of diagrams where the arrows on the right-hand side are equal and the arrows on the left-hand side are morphisms of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles.

*A special case of this when ''Y'' is a point gives the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of a smooth affine group scheme ''G'': &lt;math&gt;\textbf{B}G := [pt/G].&lt;/math&gt; It is named so since the category &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}G(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the fiber over ''X'', is precisely the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; itself can be considered as a stack, the [[moduli stack of principal bundles|moduli stack of principal ''G''-bundles on ''X'']].
*An important subexample from this construction is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}GL_n&lt;/math&gt; which is the moduli stack of principal &lt;math&gt;GL_n&lt;/math&gt;-bundles. Since the data of a principal &lt;math&gt;GL_n&lt;/math&gt;-bundle is equivalent to the data of a rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vector bundle, this is isomorphic to the [[moduli stack of vector bundles|moduli stack of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vector bundles &lt;math&gt;Vect_n&lt;/math&gt;]].
&lt;!--* An example of a stack which is not globally a quotient stack is the disjoint union of two quotient stacks which have non-equal quotienting group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; e.g. consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}/2 \coprod \mathbf{B}S_3&lt;/math&gt;.

*Stacky curves, or [[Orbifold|orbicurves]], can be constructed by taking the stack quotient of a morphism of curves by the monodromy group of the cover over the generic points. For example, take a projective morphism

:which is generically [[Étale morphism|etale]]. The stack quotient of the domain gives a stacky &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1&lt;/math&gt; with stacky points that have stabilizer group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/5&lt;/math&gt; at the fifth roots of unity in the &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt;-chart since these are the points where the cover ramifies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Quasi-coherent sheaves on algebraic stacks==

On an algebraic stack one can construct a category of quasi-coherent sheaves similar to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over a scheme.

A quasi-coherent sheaf is roughly one that looks locally like the [[sheaf of a module]] over a ring. The first problem is to decide what one means by "locally": this involves the choice of a Grothendieck topology, and there are many possible choices for this, all of which have some problems and none of which seem completely satisfactory. The Grothendieck topology should be strong enough so that the stack is locally affine in this topology: schemes are locally affine in the Zariski topology so this is a good choice for schemes as Serre discovered,  algebraic spaces and Deligne–Mumford stacks are locally affine in the etale topology so one usually uses the etale topology for these, while algebraic stacks are locally affine in the smooth topology so one can use the smooth topology in this case. For general algebraic stacks the etale topology does not have enough open sets: for example, if G is a smooth connected group then the only etale covers of the classifying stack BG are unions of copies of BG, which are not enough to give the right theory of quasicoherent sheaves.

Instead of using the smooth topology for algebraic stacks one often uses a modification of it called the [[Smooth topology|Lis-Et topology]] (short for Lisse-Etale: lisse is the French term for smooth), which has the same open sets as the smooth topology but the open covers are given by etale rather than smooth maps. This usually seems to lead to an equivalent category of quasi-coherent sheaves, but is easier to use: for example it is easier to compare with the etale topology on algebraic spaces.  The Lis-Et topology has a subtle technical problem: a morphism between stacks does not in general give a morphism between the corresponding topoi. (The problem is that while one can construct a pair of adjoint functors ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''*, as needed for a geometric morphism of topoi, the functor ''f''* is not left exact in general. This problem is notorious for having caused some errors in published papers and books.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Olsson, Martin (2007), ''Sheaves on Artin Stacks''.&lt;/ref&gt;) This means that constructing the pullback of a quasicoherent sheaf under a morphism of stacks requires some extra effort.

It is also possible to use finer topologies. Most reasonable "sufficiently large" Grothendieck topologies seem to lead to equivalent categories of quasi-coherent sheaves, but the larger a topology is the harder it is to handle, so one generally prefers to use smaller topologies as long as they have enough open sets. For example, the big fppf topology leads to essentially the same category of quasi-coherent sheaves as the Lis-Et topology, but has a subtle problem: the natural embedding of quasi-coherent sheaves into O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; modules in this topology is not exact (it does not preserve kernels in general).

==Other types of stack==

'''[[Differentiable stack]]s''' and '''topological stacks''' are defined in a way similar to algebraic stacks, except that the underlying category of affine schemes is replaced by the category of smooth manifolds or topological spaces.

More generally one can define the notion of an ''n''-sheaf or ''n''–1 stack, which is roughly a sort of sheaf taking values in ''n''–1 categories. There are several inequivalent ways of doing this. 1-sheaves are the same as sheaves, and 2-sheaves are the same as stacks. They are called [[higher stack]]s.

A very similar and analogous extension is to develop the stack theory on non-discrete objects (i.e., a space is really a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] in algebraic topology). The resulting stacky objects are called [[derived stack]]s (or spectral stacks). [[Jacob Lurie]]'s under-construction book ''Spectral Algebraic Geometry'' studies a generalization which he calls a [[spectral Deligne–Mumford stack]]. By definition, it is a ringed [[∞-topos]] that is étale-locally the [[étale spectrum]] of an [[E-infinity ring|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-ring]] (this notion subsumes that of a [[derived scheme]], at least in characteristic zero.)

==Set-theoretical problems==

There are some minor set theoretical problems with the usual foundation of the theory of stacks, because stacks are often defined as certain functors to the category of sets and are therefore not sets. There are several ways to deal with this problem:

*One can work with Grothendieck universes: a stack is then a functor between classes of some fixed Grothendieck universe, so these classes and the stacks are sets in a larger Grothendieck universe. The drawback of this approach is that one has to assume the existence of enough Grothendieck universes, which is essentially a [[large cardinal]] axiom.
*One can define stacks as functors to the set of sets of sufficiently large rank, and keep careful track of the ranks of the various sets one uses. The problem with this is that it involves some additional rather tiresome bookkeeping.
*One can use reflection principles from set theory stating that one can find set models of any finite fragment of the axioms of ZFC to show that one can automatically find sets that are sufficiently close approximations to the universe of all sets.
*One can simply ignore the problem. This is the approach taken by many authors.

The '''stare-in-the-crowd effect''' is the notion that an eyes-forward, direct [[Gaze |  gaze]] is more easily detected than an averted gaze.  First discovered by [[psychologist]] and [[neurophysiologist]] [[Michael von Grünau]] (October 3, 1944-December 22, 2011) and his psychology student [[Christina Marie Anston]] using human subjects (von Grünau and Anston 1995), the processing advantage associated with this effect is thought to derive from the importance of [[Eye contact | eye contact]] as a cue for social interactions.

In their seminal 1995 paper published in [[ Perception (journal) | Perception]], von Grünau and Anston demonstrated that staring eyes (straight gaze with iris and pupil in center position in eye socket) are detected faster than eyes gazing to the right or left (averted gaze with iris and pupil in right-most or left-most position in eye socket).  Eye targets with a straight gaze when presented in an array of averted gaze nontargets are detected faster with fewer errors than an averted gaze targets presented in an array of straight gaze targets.  This search asymmetry in which straight gaze targets are given preference in array of averted gaze distractors is found for both realistically drawn and schematic eye stimuli but not for other arrayed objects.  Search asymmetry is not seen with geometric stimuli, for instance 1 x 3 rows of black and white squares, that vary in the position of the distinguishing feature or stimuli consisting of only one schematic eye.

This effect, which has subsequently been replicated in many different search paradigms, is understood in terms of the evolutionary significance of what is considered to be one of the most critical [[Socio-cognitive | sociocognitive]] abilities of humans and other primates: gaze perception.  Gaze perception can manifest itself in two ways depending on context, social group or species.  Mutual gaze or eye contact in humans and some other primates in one context can serve to bond individuals and regulate social interactions, through the transmission of expressions of intimacy and filial identity (Kleinke 1986).  But, in another context, a sustained stare may be interpreted as a sign of hostility or anger – a cue for increased vigilance or aversive action (Ellsworth and Carlsmith 1973).  Staring is a threat gesture in many primate societies (Hinde and Rowell 1962) and makes most people feel nervous and tense (Strom and Beck 1979).  Be that as it may, regardless of how it is perceived and subsequently processed cognitively a directed gaze is a powerful cue, an amber alert, for potential synergistic or antagonistic interactions.
 
According to Darwin (1872) and Gibson (1969), organisms have evolved perceptual sensitivities that maximize their survival.  Among these is a visual system that rapidly and reliably identifies and discriminates relevant from irrelevant cues.  The stare-in-the-crowd effect is considered to be one of these perceptual abilities: a ‘quick and dirty’ primary process, by means of which an organism can take on board basic facts about the space it shares with others and respond appropriately to maximize its survival and/or the survival of conspecifics with a common filial identity.

It has been speculated that [[Human eye | human eye]] morphology evolved from a necessity for fast and accurate gaze perception for complex social interactions (Emery 2000).  According to this model, an eye direction detector (EDD) mechanism - a neurocognitive system responsible for the rapid detection of eyes in the environment and their gaze direction – arose as a function of the geometry created by a dark circular iris relative to the white sclera (Baron-Cohen 1994).  Specifically, it is contended that the increased ratio of exposed sclera in the eye outline of humans serves to enhance the velocity and acuity of gaze direction perception (Kobayashi and Kohshima 2001).

'''Suspense''' is a state of mental [[uncertainty]], [[anxiety]], of being [[Decision-making|undecided]], or of being [[Doubt|doubtful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a [[Drama|dramatic work]], suspense is the [[anticipation]] of the [[wikt:outcome|outcome]] of a [[plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the solution to an uncertainty, [[puzzle]], or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as it affects a character for whom one has [[sympathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, suspense is not exclusive to fiction.

== In drama ==
In literature, films, television, and plays, suspense is a major device for securing and maintaining interest.  It may be of several major types:  in one, the outcome is uncertain and the suspense resides in the question of ''who, what, or how''; in another, the outcome is inevitable from foregoing events, and the suspense resides in the audience's anxious or frightened anticipation in the question of ''when''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harmon|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Readers feel suspense when they are deeply curious about ''what'' will happen next, or when they know what is likely to happen but don’t know ''how'' it will happen.  It would be difficult (and perhaps pointless) to write a piece of fiction in which there were not some issue the reader had a burning wish to find out about.  Consequently, even in [[historical fiction]], with characters whose life stories are well known, the ''why'' usually brings suspense to the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Henry|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adjunct to suspense is [[foreshadowing]], as found in hints of national crisis or revolution in [[Isabel Allende]]’s ''[[House of the Spirits]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
* In [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (429 B.C.), suspense is achieved through a withholding of the knowledge that Oedipus himself has killed Laius, his father.  During the play, the spectators, aware that Oedipus will eventually make the discovery, share the hero's uncertainties and fears as he pursues the truth of his own past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beckson|Ganz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[George Washington Cable]]'s story "Jean-ah Poquelin" (1875), the reader wants to know the cause of the strange smell and the unexplained disappearance of a brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1895), the reader anticipates the outcome of the switching of a black infant with a white infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ernest J. Gaines]]'s ''[[A Gathering of Old Men]]'' (1983), the reader waits for the court's decision at a murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paradox of suspense ==
Some authors have tried to explain the "paradox of suspense", namely: a narrative tension that remains effective even when uncertainty is neutralized, because repeat audiences know exactly how the story resolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yanal|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories assume that true repeat audiences are extremely rare because, in reiteration, we usually forget many details of the story and the interest arises due to these holes of memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brewer|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; others claim that uncertainty remains even for often told stories because, during the immersion in the fictional world, we forget fictionally what we know factually&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Walton|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because we expect fictional worlds to look like the real world, where exact repetition of an event is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerrig|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of Yanal is more radical and postulates that narrative tension that remains effective in true repetition should be clearly distinguished from genuine suspense, because uncertainty is part of the definition of suspense. Baroni proposes to name ''rappel'' this kind of suspense whose excitement relies on the ability of the audience to anticipate perfectly what is to come, a precognition that is particularly enjoyable for children dealing with well-known fairy tales. Baroni adds that another kind of suspense without uncertainty can emerge with the occasional contradiction between what the reader knows about the future (cognition) and what he desires (volition), especially in tragedy, when the protagonist eventually dies or fails (''suspense par contradiction'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baroni|2007|pp=279–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talairach coordinates''', also known as '''Talairach space''', is a 3-dimensional [[coordinate system]] (known as an 'atlas') of the human brain, which is used to [[brain mapping|map]] the location of brain structures independent from individual differences in the size and overall shape of the brain. It is still common to use Talairach coordinates in [[Functional imaging|functional brain imaging]] studies and to target transcranial stimulation of brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Medical Imaging: Processing and Analysis Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHkkPBnhT-MC&amp;pg=PA565|date=9 October 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-053310-0|pages=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternative methods such as the [[MNI Coordinate System]] originated at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital]] have largely replaced Talairach for [[Stereotactic surgery|stereotaxy]] and other procedures.&lt;ref name="PoldrackMumford2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Russell A. Poldrack|author2=Jeanette A. Mumford|author3=Thomas E. Nichols|title=Handbook of Functional MRI Data Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjwBnVRwuD8C&amp;pg=PA17|date=22 August 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49836-4|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The coordinate system was first created by [[neurosurgeon]]s [[Jean Talairach]] and Gabor Szikla in their work on the ''Talairach Atlas'' in 1967, creating a standardized grid for neurosurgery.&lt;ref name="TS1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talairach |first=Jean |last2=Szikla |first2=G. |date=1967 |title=Atlas of stereotactic concepts to the surgery of epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grid was based on the idea that distances to lesions in the brain are proportional to overall brain size (i.e., the distance between two structures is larger in a larger brain). In 1988 a second edition of the ''Talairach Atlas'' came out that was coauthored by Tournoux, and it is sometimes known as the Talairach–Tournoux system. This atlas was based on single post-mortem dissection of a human brain.&lt;ref name="Lazar2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicole|last=Lazar|authorlink= Nicole Lazar |title=The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcX8g9k_SnEC&amp;pg=PA88|date=10 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-78191-4|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Talairach Atlas'' uses [[Brodmann area]]s as the labels for brain regions.&lt;ref name="Vogt2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brent Vogt|title=Cingulate Neurobiology and Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwZ4KpPBxe4C&amp;pg=PA4|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856696-0|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Talairach coordinate system is defined by making two anchors, the [[anterior commissure]] and [[posterior commissure]], lie on a straight horizontal line.&lt;ref name="YangJiang2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guang-Zhong Yang|author2=Tianzi Jiang|title=Medical Imaging and Augmented Reality: Second International Workshop, MIAR 2004, Beijing, China, August 19-20, 2004, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bbVq3-OR44C&amp;pg=PA179|date=11 August 2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-22877-6|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these two points lie on the midsagittal plane, the coordinate system is completely defined by requiring this plane to be vertical. Distances in Talairach coordinates are measured from the anterior commissure as the origin (as defined in the 1998 edition). The y-axis points posterior and anterior to the commissures, the left and right is the x-axis, and the z-axis is in the ventral-dorsal (down and up) directions.&lt;ref name="Toennies2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus D. Toennies|title=Guide to Medical Image Analysis: Methods and Algorithms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtij1fQesqcC&amp;pg=PA326|date=4 February 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4471-2751-2|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the brain is reoriented to these axes, the researchers must also outline the six cortical outlines of the brain: anterior, posterior, left, right, inferior, and superior.&lt;ref name="MillerCummings2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce L. Miller|author2=Jeffrey L. Cummings|title=The Human Frontal Lobes: Functions and Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBcPYvqE19QC&amp;pg=PA173|year=2007|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-329-7|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1967 atlas the left is with positive coordinates while in the 1988 atlas the left has negative coordinates.

By defining standard anatomical landmarks that could be identified on different subjects (the anterior and posterior commissures), it became easier to spatially warp an individual brain image obtained through [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and other imaging methods to this standard Talairach space. One can then make inferences about tissue identity at a specific location by referring to the atlas.

==Conversion to other coordinate systems==
Another common atlas for the human brain is the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) coordinate system, which is the template used for [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]] and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping. Most [[List of neuroimaging software|neuroimaging software packages]] are able to convert from Talairach to MNI coordinates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6546">'''Twelf''' is an implementation of the logical framework [[LF (logical framework)|LF]]. It is used for logic programming and for the formalization of programming language theory.

==Introduction==
&lt;!-- to do: introduce LF theory --&gt;
At its simplest, a Twelf program (called a "signature") is a collection of declarations of type families and constants that inhabit those type families. For example, the following is the standard definition of the [[natural numbers]], with &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; standing for zero and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; the successor operator.

 nat : type.
 
 z : nat.
 s : nat -&gt; nat.

Here &lt;code&gt;nat&lt;/code&gt; is a type, and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; are constant terms. As a [[dependent type|dependently typed]] system, types can be indexed by terms, which allows the definition of more interesting type families (relations). Here is a definition of addition:

 plus : nat -&gt; nat -&gt; nat -&gt; type.
 
 plus_zero : {M:nat} plus M z M.
 
 plus_succ : {M:nat} {N:nat} {P:nat}
             plus M (s N) (s P)
          &lt;- plus M N P.

The type family &lt;code&gt;plus&lt;/code&gt; is read as a relation between three natural numbers &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;, such that M + N = P. We then give the constants that define the relation: &lt;code&gt;plus_zero&lt;/code&gt; indicates that any natural number &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; plus zero is still &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;. The quantifier &lt;code&gt;{M:nat}&lt;/code&gt; can be read as "for all &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;nat&lt;/code&gt;".

The constant &lt;code&gt;plus_succ&lt;/code&gt; defines the case for when the second argument is the successor of some other number &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; (see [[pattern matching]]). The result is the successor of &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is the sum of &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;. This [[recursion|recursive]] call is made via the subgoal &lt;code&gt;plus M N P&lt;/code&gt;, introduced with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt;. The arrow can be understood operationally as Prolog's &lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt;, or as logical implication ("if M + N = P, then M + (s N) = (s P)"), or most faithfully to the type theory, as the type of the constant &lt;code&gt;plus_succ&lt;/code&gt; ("when given a term of type &lt;code&gt;plus M N P&lt;/code&gt;, return a term of type &lt;code&gt;plus M (s N) (s P)&lt;/code&gt;").

Twelf features type reconstruction and supports implicit parameters, so in practice one usually does not need to explicitly write &lt;code&gt;{M:nat}&lt;/code&gt; (etc.) above.

These simple examples do not display LF's higher-order features, nor any of its theorem checking capabilities. See the Twelf distribution for its included examples.
&lt;!-- to-do: example that is higher order --&gt;
&lt;!-- to-do: concept of canonical forms --&gt;

==Uses==
Twelf is used in several different ways.

===Logic programming===
Twelf signatures can be executed via a search procedure, so Twelf can be used as a [[logic programming]] language. Its core is more sophisticated than [[Prolog]], since it is higher-order and dependently typed, but it is restricted to pure operators: there is no cut or other extralogical operators (such as ones for performing [[input/output|I/O]]) as are often found in Prolog implementations, which may make it less well-suited for practical logic programming applications.  Some of the use of cut rule as used in Prolog is obtained through the ability to declare that certain operators belong to deterministic type families, which avoids recalculation. Also, like [[λProlog]], Twelf generalizes the [[Horn clause]]s underlying Prolog to [[Harrop formula#Hereditary Harrop formulae and logic programming|hereditary Harrop formulas]], which allow for logically well-founded operational notions of fresh-name generation and scoped extension of the clause database.
&lt;!-- theorem prover?? --&gt;

===Formalizing mathematics===
Twelf's main use today is as a system for formalizing mathematics (especially the metatheory of [[programming language]]s). Used this way it is closely related to [[Coq]] and [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle]]/[[HOL theorem prover|HOL]]/[[HOL Light]]. However, unlike those systems, Twelf proofs are typically developed by hand. Despite this, for the problem domains at which it excels, Twelf proofs are often shorter and easier to develop than in the automated, general-purpose systems.

Twelf is particularly well suited to the encoding of programming languages and logics, because it has a built-in notion of binding and substitution. Most logics and programming languages of interest make use of binding and substitution. When implemented in Twelf, binders can often be directly encoded using the technique of [[higher-order abstract syntax]] (HOAS), in which the meta-language (Twelf) binders are used to represent the object-level binders. As a consequence, standard theorems such as type-preserving substitution and [[Lambda calculus#α-conversion|alpha conversion]] come "for free".

Twelf has been used to formalize many different logics and programming languages (examples are included with the distribution). Among the larger projects are a proof of safety for the [[Standard ML]] programming language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Typical North India Food Prepared for Rongmei Naga.jpg|thumb|A partially-eaten plate of Indian food. The food on the plate is called Uchchhishta (noun). The plate is said to be Uchchhishta (adjective).]]
'''Uchchhishta''' ({{lang-sa|उच्छिष्ट}}, Ucchiṣṭa),{{need-IPA|Sanskrit}} known by various regional terms, is an Indian and a Hindu concept related to food. Though the term has various meanings and has no exact parallel in English,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Roy p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally translated in English as "leftovers"&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 354-5&lt;/ref&gt; or "leavings",&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; but with a denigratory aspect. Uchchhishta frequently denotes food scraps after a person has eaten. In a broader sense, it refers to the contamination by food or hand that has come in contact with saliva or the inside of someone's mouth. A person or plate is also said to be Uchchhishta, when he/it comes in contact with Uchchhishta food.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Uchchhishta food as well as the Uchchhishta eater/utensil are considered ritually impure. The eater is purified by washing his hand (Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers) and mouth.

It is highly disrespectful to offer Uchchhishta to someone in general, however it is acceptable to eat Uchchhishta of socially superior individuals, among other exceptions. While an offering of Uchchhishta food or by a person in the Uchchhishta state to Hindu divinities is forbidden in classical Hinduism, some heterodox [[Tantra|Tantric]] deities are worshipped with the taboo offering.

==Concept==
[[File:Leftovers.JPG|thumb|Leftovers of an Indian curry on a plate. The leftovers are called Uchchhishta (noun); the plate is described as Uchchhishta (adjective)]] 

The Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines Uchchhishta as: "left, rejected, stale, spit out of the mouth (as remnants of food); one who has still the remains of food in the mouth or hands, one who has not washed his hands and mouth and therefore is considered impure, impure; leavings, fragments, remainder (especially of a sacrifice or of food)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=173|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=174|title=MW Cologne Scan|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de|access-date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medhātithi|Medhatithi]] (c. 850–1050 CE), one of the oldest and most famous commentators of the Hindu law book ''[[Manusmriti]]'' lists the meanings of Uchchhishta:&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; 
* Primary meaning: contamination by food or hand that has come in contact the inside of someone's mouth
* Pollution due to contact with "the eater, the eaten food" or the plate on which someone has eaten
* leftover food on someone's plate, after he has eaten
* leftover food in the serving vessel after everyone is served
* a person who has passed human waste, before purification

While Uchchhishta is related to leftovers and contact with saliva, Uchchhishta should be differentiated from other terms also translated in English as "impure": ''Amedhya'' ("unfit for sacrifice") refers to contamination by contact to human waste, corpses, decomposition etc. and ''malina'' ("stained") refers to pollution by physical dirt.&lt;ref name="Davis220"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other bodily substances like sweat, saliva is considered to be part of body and also not part of it, that is, of "uncertain status". Thus, contact with saliva, Uchchhishta, is regarded as impure.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manusmriti'' however does not regard saliva defiling in general, but only in the food context. Drops of saliva, which transmit from one person to another while speaking, are not treated impure.&lt;ref name="Davis225"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

The precept of not contaminating all the food or a drink with bacteria or viruses in one's saliva is of particular concern as the health of someone could be threatened through cross contamination.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gadia p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

A medieval [[Siddhar]] mocks the concept of Uchchhishta. He questions how are the flowers offered to Hindu deities or honey not defiled by saliva of bees and the cow's milk by the saliva of the calf.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Uchchhista is generally regarded as highly polluting and impure in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp"/&gt; Hindus view Uchchhista with revulsion.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Dundes p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Eating Uchchhista is considered as humiliating;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; a Kannada proverb says that he is a dog who eats Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Offering Uchchhista to a higher [[Caste system in India|caste]] member is considered as his insult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dundes p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; 

People usually do not dip, serve or accept food with the fingers or cutlery that has touched someone's mouth. While cooking also, the cook does not taste food and use the same utensil to stir the food. Once food is tasted with a utensil, it is put away to wash. Food which has been dipped with fingers and cutlery used for eating is considered Uchchhista.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While sharing or eating dry food or fruits, the food is portioned so that it does not become contaminated by someone's saliva.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For the same reason, Hindus do not generally drink from each other's water glasses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dundes p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 20th century, use of spoons or forks and metal plates were not used by orthodox Hindus as they had come in contact with one's mouth and thus could not be reused as they remained Uchchhista, even though cleaned. One-use leaf plates were preferred; Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers, without cutlery.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes pp. 110–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Uchchhishta is acceptable to be eaten by socially inferior individuals: one's servants, lower caste persons, beggars and animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Khare p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Dalit|Untouchables]]" including [[Manual scavenging|Castes handling human waste]] historically used to live on leftovers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eating someone's Uchchhista is seen as a sign of submission and acceptance of the person's superiority.&lt;ref name="Davis439" /&gt;

In modern India, the rules of Uchchhista are relaxed in the cases of intimacy of a couple or a family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eating the Uchchhishta food of a young child by his parents is also acceptable, as the child is not regarded a fully-grown separate individual.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Parents usually feed young children from their own plate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In contrast of the general negative connotations associated with it, eating some types of Uchchhista like of a husband by a wife, of a guru by the student and of a sacrifice or divine offering by all, is highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Olivelle354pp" /&gt; [[Prasad]], food offered to a deity and having "eaten" by the deity, is sometimes considered the Uchchhista of the gods, as in some parts of North India; however other times as in parts of South India, the comparison of the sacred prasad to Uchchhista, is frowned upon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis439"&gt;Olivelle &amp; Davis Jr, pp. 439–40&lt;/ref&gt;

A husband is considered equivalent to God for a Hindu wife. As such, wife can eat his Uchchhista as a sign of her love and submission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wife may eat in the same leaf as the husband's, after he finishes. The husband will leave some food in his plate for her to eat, as a symbol of his love.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The custom is ritually performed first at the time of marriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This act is said to signify her integration in her new family. It is also acceptable if the wife eats the Uchchhista of her in-laws or her husband's brothers.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

[[File:Shukracharya and Kacha.jpg|thumb|upright|A student bows to his guru. The student is prescribed to eat the guru's Uchchhishta, which is described variously as sacred and medicinal.]]
The ''[[Apastamba Dharmasutra]]'' (1st-millennium BCE), while describing the code of conduct for a student, refers to the concept of Uchchhishta. In ancient times, a student would stay with a teacher ([[guru]]) in the latter's house ([[Gurukula]]) and learn. In this period, a student should ask for alms for his livelihood, which he should not consider as Uchchhishta. A student is prescribed to not leave any food uneaten in his plate, that is, leave no Uchchhishta. However, if any Uchchhishta remains, he should bury it, throw it in the water or give it away to a [[Shudra]] (a member from the lower social strata). The student is prescribed to eat the Uchchhishta of his guru, which are regarded as sacred as a sacrificial oblation. Eating Uchchhishta of one's father or brother is also acceptable.&lt;ref name="Olivelle11pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 11-2&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vasishtha|Vasishtha Dharmasutra]]'' regards the Uchchhista of the guru, equivalent to medicine that an ill student should have.&lt;ref name="Olivelle311pp"&gt;Olivelle pp. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to Uchchhishta are given in the ''Vasishtha Dharmasutra''. Food remnants stuck in teeth or food currently in the mouth are not considered impure, as they are treated part of the mouth like teeth. Swallowing the same cleanses the individual. While pouring water for someone to drink, if drops of water fall on the person's feet; the drops are not Uchchhista, but considered part of the ground.&lt;ref name="Davis225" /&gt;

The concept of Uchchhishta focuses on purification by washing one's hands and mouth after eating.&lt;ref name="Davis220" /&gt; The cleansing is extended to the kitchen so that so no trace of Uchchhishta or cooking of the meal before, is left.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Association with Hindu deities ==
[[File:Kalighat Matangi.jpg|thumb|The Hindu goddess Matangi is offered the taboo Uchchhishta food by the devotee in the ritually impure Uchchhishta state, with unwashed mouth and hands.]]
Offering Uchchhishta food to Hindu deities or worship by an Uchchhishta person is prohibited in mainstream Hinduism. However, the esoteric [[Tantra|Tantric]] goddess [[Matangi]] is recommended to be offered Uchchhishta food, in the polluted Uchchhishta state, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands; Matangi is associated with pollution and the outcaste and embodies the forbidden transgression of social norms.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley pp. 214–6&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess in a legend from the ''Shaktisamgama-tantram'' is also said to be born from Uchchhishta. The deity couples of [[Shiva]]-[[Parvati]] and [[Vishnu]]-[[Lakshmi]] dropped specks of food on the ground while eating. A divine maiden rose from the Uchchhishta and asked for their Uchchhishta. The deities blessed her and gave her the name Uchchhishta-Matangini (Matangi).&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Tantric deity worshipped in the impure Uchchhishta state is [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]] – a Tantric form of the elephant-headed god [[Ganesha]] – who also derives his name from Uchchhishta.&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;Grewal pp. 122–3&lt;/ref&gt;

While Matangi is offered human Uchchhishta, the goddess [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] is offered divine Uchchhishta of the god [[Jagannath]], a form of Vishnu. Vimala is the Tantric consort of Jagannath and the guardian goddess of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Puri]] – the principal temple of the god. Vimala is said to be survive of the Uchchhishta of Jagannath; vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]] (prasad). A legend justifies this tradition. Once, Shiva ate a food grain, the Uchchhishta of Vishnu as the latter's prasad. Half the grain stuck in Shiva's bread; however the sage [[Narada]] noticed it and ate it. Parvati, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the [[Kali Yuga]] (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food.&lt;ref name="Bimala"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Shrinibas|date=September 2009|title=Goddess Bimala at Puri|url=http://Odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Odishareview/2009/September/engpdf/66-69.pdf|journal=Odisha Review|publisher=Government of Odisha e-Magazine|pages=66–69|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later versions of the [[Hindu Epic|Hindu epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Shabari]], a forest dweller woman, is instructed by her guru to wait for the arrival of the god [[Rama]] in her hermitage. She daily collects wild berries tasting them once for sourness, keeping only the sweet ones and discarding the bitter ones so that she could offer the god [[Rama]] only sweet berries, when he visits her. Unknowingly, the berries become Uchchhishta. Over time, she ages to an elderly woman. When Rama finally visits her hermitage, Shabari offers him the Uchchhishta berries. [[Lakshmana]], Rama's brother, objects to the impurity of the Uchchhishta berries, unworthy to be eaten. However, Rama accepts the Uchchhishta berries, as they offered it with great love and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Khare p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keshavadas pp. 121–5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11636">'''Wing-assisted incline running''' (abbreviated as "WAIR") is a running behavior observed in living [[bird]]s as well as a model proposed to explain the [[origin of avian flight|evolution of avian flight]]. WAIR allows birds to run up steep or vertical inclines by flapping their wings, scaling greater inclines than possible through running alone. The WAIR origin-of-flight hypothesis proposes that the nascent wings of [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s were used to propel the animal up slopes, such as cliffs or trees, in a similar manner to that employed by modern birds, and that [[Bird flight|powered flight]] eventually evolved from this usage.&lt;ref name="bicudo"&gt;{{cite book|last = Bicudo| first = J. Eduardo| title = Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Birds | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = May 26, 2010 | pages = 15 | isbn = 978-0199228454}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its proposal, it was suggested that WAIR might have plausibly been used by feathered theropods like ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' to develop aerial flight.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt;

==WAIR in living birds==
[[File:Chukar Partridge RWD.jpg|200px|thumb|An adult chukar running on a horizontal plane]]
Wing-assisted incline running has been studied extensively in chicks of the [[chukar partridge]] (''Alectoris chukar''),&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"/&gt; and has been observed in juveniles and adults of other species of [[Galliformes]] as well as the [[rock dove]] (''Columba livia'').&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt; In chukar chicks, WAIR was experimentally demonstrated by comparing maximum inclines ascended by normal chicks to those with wing feathers trimmed or plucked entirely. On both smooth and rough surfaces, normal chicks were able to run up much steeper slopes than the other two groups, reaching maximum angles of 105° from the horizontal. Chicks used running alone at slopes up to 45°, then employed wing-flapping at greater slopes, and maximum slope successfully scaled increased with age.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt; When baby chukars hatch, they have not yet developed their flight feathers.  As the babies develop, it takes approximately one week for feathers to appear, and about three weeks for the ability to fly.  As the baby chukars grow and before flying for the first time, they use WAIR as a transition to adult flight.&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tobalske, B.

===Explanation of using WAIR over normal flight===
These galliformes might use WAIR instead of normal flight to reach tree branches because WAIR uses less energy than normal flight.  Fewer muscles are used in the process of WAIR than normal flight, specifically pectoral and shoulder muscles which contribute to wing flapping.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;  This provides an additional explanation as to why birds continue to use WAIR: it is faster than normal flight take-off, and running requires less energy than does flying.  Therefore; the hindlimbs, in conjunction with the wings, may produce quick bouts of energy which may allow the bird to catch prey.&lt;ref name=Dialetal2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dial|first1=K. P.|last2=Randall|first2=R. J.|last3=Dial|first3=T. R.|title=What Use Is Half a Wing in the Ecology and Evolution of Birds?|journal=BioScience|date=2006|volume=56|issue=5|pages=437–445|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2006)056[0437:WUIHAW]2.0.CO;2|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/437.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy also allows energy to be stored for use in a fight-or-flight situation such as to escape becoming eaten or caught.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dial&amp;Jackson2010"/&gt;  WAIR imposes less aerodynamic and physical forces than normal avian flight on the bird, an advantageous trait which may increase fitness.&lt;ref name="Dial&amp;Jackson2010"/&gt;  WAIR could have been used for balance purposes.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;
Many theories propose that the manifestation of WAIR in birds is for predatory escape purposes, in that they are able to run up extremely steep and past vertical slopes (such as the trunk of a tree) to escape from a ground-dwelling predator.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"/&gt;  Another reason for the manifestation of WAIR may be for dispersal or to find food or resources, but this idea is mostly proposed as a survival strategy.&lt;ref name="Dialetal2006"/&gt;
Whether it is to evade predation, catch prey, enhance reproductive success, or simply a variation imposed for dispersal, flight among avian creatures has evolved to be a highly successful trait.

==Origin of flight hypothesis==
The WAIR hypothesis for the origin of flight is a version of the "[[Origin of avian flight#Cursorial model|cursorial model]]" of the evolution of avian flight, in which birds' wings originated from forelimb modifications that provided downforce, enabling the proto-birds to run up extremely steep slopes such as the trunks of trees. The hypothesis was prompted by the observation of living young chukar chicks using WAIR, and proposes that dinosaur wings developed their [[aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, possibly to escape from predators.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"/&gt; Originally, it was thought that birds need ''downforce'' to give their feet increased grip in this scenario.&lt;ref name="Dial2003WAIR"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dial, K.P. |year=2003 |title=Wing-Assisted Incline Running and the Evolution of Flight |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5605 |pages=402–404 |doi=10.1126/science.1078237 |url=http://dbs.umt.edu/flightlab/pdf/WAIR.SCIENCE.pdf |format=pdf | pmid=12532020 |bibcode = 2003Sci...299..402D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=Mechanics of wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |pages=4553–4564 |url=http://dbs.umt.edu/flightlab/pdf/bundle%20and%20dial%20JEB%202003.pdf |format=PDF|author1=Bundle, M.W  |author2=Dial, K.P.  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1242/jeb.00673 | pmid=14610039 |issue=Pt 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study found lift generated from wings to be the primary factor for successfully accelerating, indicating the onset of flight ability was constrained by neuromuscular control or power rather than by the shape of the wing itself, and that partially developed wings not yet capable of flight could indeed provide useful lift during WAIR.&lt;ref name="TobalskeDial2007"/&gt; Additionally, when both the power and work needed for WAIR were examined, it was identified that the need for pectoral muscles in flight increases with the angle being scaled. Thus, WAIR is a hypothesis providing a model for an evolutionary transition from terrestrial to aerial locomotion as birds skeletally adapted to meet the requirements to scale steeper and steeper inclines by flight.&lt;ref name="Jackson2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson, B.

WAIR may have been present in [[oviraptorosaur]]s and [[therizinosauroid]]s, but as the adults, especially of therizinosauroids, would probably break the trees trying to climb, their hatchlings or chicks would have made it up easily. Because of this way to escape predation, early maniraptorans might have evolved their long arms, true feathers and fused [[furcula|wishbone]]s.&lt;ref name="holtz2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtz|first=T.R.

===Response===
One possible problem with the WAIR origin of flight hypothesis was noticed by [[Philip Senter]]. He argued that early birds, including ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', lacked the [[Bird anatomy|shoulder mechanism]] by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes. Since the downforce on which WAIR depends is generated by upstrokes, Senter argued that early birds were incapable of WAIR or flapping flight.&lt;ref name="Senter2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Senter, P. |year=2006 |title=Scapular orientation in theropods and basal birds, and the origin of flapping flight |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=305–313 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app51-305.html |format=Automatic PDF download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been proposed against the WAIR hypothesis, stating that it is too simplistic and does not take additional information into effect.  There have been additional mechanisms suggested, such as climbing claws, that would have provided an advantage for the birds, but are absent in fossil records or extant birds.&lt;ref name=NuddsDyke2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nudds|first1=Robert L.|last2=Dyke|first2=Gareth J.|title=Forelimb posture in dinosaurs and the evolution of the avian flapping flight- stroke|journal=Evolution|date=2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=994–1002|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00613.x|pmid=19154383}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other arguments against WAIR include a lack of fossil evidence and no additional intermediate or transition stages available for study which would provide supplementary evidence for WAIR.&lt;ref name="BundleDial2003MechanicsOfWAIR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dialetal2006"/&gt;
