==History==
===Early history===
People of African ancestry were present in Jerusalem dating back to as far as the 7th century.{{cn|date=February 2017}} Africans migrated to the city of Jerusalem when the second caliph [[Umar]] Ibn Al Khattab conquered the city of Jerusalem. Traveling from Sudan, Chad, Nigeria, and Senegal with the goal of entering the holy city of Jerusalem to perform the Muslim pilgrimage [[Hajj]].{{dubious|date=February 2017}}

===The Holy Guards of the Mosque===
This neighborhood has been around since the 13th century and is marked by the [[Mamluk]] time architecture. African slaves were the protectors of Al Aqsa mosque. During the end of the Ottoman, the present day compounds were made into a prison compound for those who rebelled against the Ottoman power. 

===Modern times===
After Ottoman rule the buildings known as al-Ribat al-Mansouri and Ribat Aladdin al-Bassir became a part of the religious trust [[waqf]]. Proving their loyalty as protectors of al-Aqsa mosque, Palestinian leader Sheikh [[Amin al-Husseini]] rented out these compounds to the Africans.

The Muslim African migrants who traveled to Jerusalem prior to 1947 found themselves in one of the most troubled areas in the region.{{cn|date=February 2017}} With no diplomatic ties, these migrants had no other choice but to stay, leaving their families behind. Some chose to stay and fight alongside Palestinians. Falling in love with the city of Jerusalem and its deep ties to Islam they married Palestinians and continued to identify as Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/223609-afro-palestinians-forge-a-unique-identity-in-israel]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2017}} The African Palestinians who now live in the two compounds near al-Aqsa mosque, have called them home since 1930.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

'''''Angel of Grozny: Inside Chechnya''''' is a [[book]] by Norwegian [[journalist]] [[Åsne Seierstad]] published in 2008, which gives an account of everyday life in the war-torn [[Federal subjects of Russia|Russian Republic]] of [[Chechnya]]. The book was also printed under the title '''''Angel of Grozny: Orphans of a Forgotten War'''''.

==Background==
{{see also|History of Chechnya}}
Åsne Seierstad first visited Chechnya in 1994 (aged just 24) during the [[First Chechen War]]. In 2006, she returned to the region to examine its progress. In the intervening period, Chechnya had been ravaged by a [[Second Chechen War|second civil war]] after disputed elections were won by Russian-backed [[Akhmad Kadyrov]]. During this conflict Russian control of the province was re-established, a process which caused enormous loss of life and widespread destruction of buildings and [[infrastructure]]. In 2003, the [[United Nations]] described the Chechen capital [[Grozny]] as the most destroyed city in the world.

Foreign journalists are not generally allowed into Chechnya, and Seierstad did most of her travelling and research in disguise with her hair dyed.

==Summary==

''Angel of Grozny'' attempts to give an accessible and impartial account of the complicated historical and political forces at play in the Chechen conflict whilst also describing her encounters with combatants and civilians on both sides. The book features an account of her meeting with [[President of Chechnya|Chechen President]] [[Ramzan Kadyrov]]. As well as trying to understand the mindset of the [[Chechen people|Chechen]] and [[Russian people]], one of the books key themes is the exposure of corruption in the process of reconstructing Chechnya.

The Angel of Grozny of the book's title is a Chechen woman [[Hadijat Gatayeva]] who has turned their home into an [[orphanage]] for [[street children]] of the war.

==Criticism==

A criticism often levelled at Åsne Seierstad is her tendency to present personal stories which have not been fully cross-checked for accuracy. Her style, blending historical facts with personal accounts, sometimes blurs the boundary between fact and fiction and language gaps can cause misunderstandings. By focusing on such a small group of individuals to present her case, she fails to prove any abuses or wrongdoing is systemic, and therefore cannot easily hold people to account for their actions.

In ''Angel of Grozny'' she goes a step further by writing some sections of the book in the third person. She describes events she did not witness, often in vivid and evocative language which is ill-suited to the actual person telling the story. The ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' reviewer described the "blurring of reportage and imagined scenes" as "sometimes uncomfortable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,,2263621,00.html When the Russian bear roared], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Argentine Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Argentine people|Argentine]] descent or an [[Argentina]]-born person who resides in [[Canada]]. The Canadian [[Immigration Act of 1952]] resulted in an increased number of skilled and educated Argentine immigrants to Canada.&lt;ref name="Macogsi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples|date=April 28, 1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802029386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority were fleeing the economic decline and political turmoil following the [[Revolución Libertadora]].&lt;ref name="Macogsi"/&gt; An average of 400 Argentines immigrated to Canada annually from 1964 to 1972. Beginning in 1973, increased instability, terrorism and high inflation in Argentina created another wave of immigration to Canada. The rate of immigration increased to more than 1000 persons annually during the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="Macogsi"/&gt; The influx lasted until 1983, coinciding with the progress of Argentine democracy.&lt;ref name="Macogsi"/&gt;

The highest concentrations of Argentine Canadians are in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]].&lt;ref name="Macogsi"/&gt;

'''Asian-American theatre''' is [[theatre]] written, directed or acted by [[Asian Americans]]. From initial efforts by four theatre companies in the 1960s, Asian-American theatre has grown to around forty groups today. Early productions often had Asian themes or settings, but today it is becoming more common to see Asian-Americans in roles that defy the stereotypes.

== Background ==
Asian-American theatre emerged in the 1960s and the 1970s with the foundation of four theatre companies: [[East West Players]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] (later renamed Asian American Theater Company) in [[San Francisco]], Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (later renamed Northwest Asian American Theatre) in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], and [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] in [[New York City]].  The Northwest Asian American Theatre was one of the first in the Pacific Northwest. The four companies have provided the resources and opportunities to actors, writers, directors, designers, and producers to pursue and define ''Asian-American theatre'' for over five decades.  By the end of the 1990s, the number of Asian-American theatre companies and performance groups grew to about forty.  In addition, such companies helped integrate Asian-Americans into many popular theatre companies by normalizing Asian actors. Asian-American plays have appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatres]] and have received major awards both nationally and internationally. Asian-American actors have used Asian-American theatre companies as their artistic bases while pursuing careers in the mainstream theatre, film and television. Alternative forms of theatre and performance such as multimedia performance, [[One man show|solo performance]] and [[spoken word]] have also shaped Asian-American theatre. In the beginning, participants of Asian-American theatre were mostly of [[East Asia]]n descent, but in the 1990s and the 21st century, more artists of [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n and backgrounds have joined the community and have made Asian-American theatre one of the fastest growing and changing sectors in [[Theater in the United States|American theatre]].

== Asian-American theatre companies ==
[[East West Players]] (EWP) was founded in 1965 by a group of actors who wanted to fight racism in the entertainment industry by creating non-stereotypical roles for Asian Americans. Led by the [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-American]] actor [[Mako (actor)|Mako]], the actors at EWP first saw theatre as a venue to showcase their talent for television and film producers and directors, but by the early 1970s, the EWP began to actively sponsor original plays by Asian Americans. [[Frank Chin]], who founded the Asian American Theatre Workshop, argued that Asian-American actors needed Asian-American playwrights to create believable roles and to end dependence on the mainstream acting industry.  Theatrical Ensemble of Asians (TEA) began in 1974 on the campus of the [[University of Washington]], and after the founding students graduated, moved into a theatre in the International District, renaming them selves the Asian Exclusion Act. The theatre group moved around several locations before finding a home at the Theatre Off Jackson. It was late renamed again as the Northwest Asian American Theatre (NWAAT).  In addition to acting and playwriting, NWAAT emphasized community activism and became a cultural center for Asian Americans in Seattle; many of the plays they performed were directly targeted at expressing the painful history of discrimination Asian-Americans in America suffered after the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]].  [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] (Pan Asian Rep), on the other hand, emerged as part of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theatre in 1978. Founded by [[Tisa Chang]], Pan Asian Rep became the representative Asian-American theatre company in New York City and introduced Asian-American plays to the East Coast audiences.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Asian-American theatre companies were founded with more diverse purposes and styles.  Companies such as [[Ma-Yi Theater Company]] (New York City) focus on producing new, original plays, as did the now-defunct [[Lodestone Theatre Ensemble]] (Los Angeles, 1999-2009). Others companies' agendas departed greatly from the original four: National Asian American Theatre Company (NAATCO) in New York City, for instance, stages canonized Western plays with all Asian cast and [[Mu Performing Arts]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] incorporates Asian theatrical styles to specifically cater to local audiences.

== Asian-American actors ==
American theatre in the 1950s was dominated by popular [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows that featured Asian characters and settings, and shows such as ''[[The King and I]]'' and ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' provided employment to a number of "[[Oriental people|Oriental]]" actors.  However, many roles were blatantly stereotypical and racist and many major roles were cast with white actors with facial makeup resembling an "Oriental".  The popularity of Asian themes in Broadway shows did not continue through the 1960s, and "Oriental" actors found themselves unemployed in large numbers.  While they were out of work, they observed white actors getting cast in Asian roles.  "Oriental" actors began to protest this practice by creating activist organizations and creating work for themselves.  The term "Asian-American actor" emerged in the late 1960s when the '''[[Asian American movement]]''' challenged the racist history of the label "Oriental."  By the 1970s, Asian-American actors were well organized in their fight for jobs and positive images for Asians.  In New York, an activist group called Oriental Actors of America regularly protested openings of shows with white actors playing Asians.  In Los Angeles, [[East West Players]] became the most visible venue for Asian-American actors to find acting employment and to participate in activism.  The company's proximity to [[Hollywood]] attracted many ambitious and talented Asian-American actors to Los Angeles.  By the mid-1990s, over 75% of all Asian-American actors had acted on the stage of EWP.

In the early 1990s, the controversy over the musical ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' surfaced when Asian-American actors protested the casting of the British actor [[Jonathan Pryce]] for the role of the half-[[Vietnam]]ese Engineer in the Broadway production of the musical.  The protest was led by many prominent Asian-American theatre artists, including actor [[BD Wong]], the artistic director of Pan Asian Rep, Tisa Chang, and the playwright [[David Henry Hwang]].  Asian-American actors initially lost their fight when the musical opened on Broadway with Pryce, but in the long run, the controversy generated many positive aftereffects for Asian-American actors.  The musical's ten-year run on Broadway employed an unprecedented number of Asian-American actors, and the role of the Engineer was subsequently cast with Asian-American actors.

Asian Americans have won the fight for employment, and while some roles for them stereotype those of Asian descent, Asian Americans are increasingly winning roles that respect and tolerate Asian Americans from the majority of producers who are realizing the reality of [[racial bigotry]] and ignorance that brings hostility and degradation to those oppressed.

== Asian-American playwrights ==
Before the 1960s, Asian-American plays were virtually non-existent, but various initiatives, including East West Players' playwriting contest, encouraged Asian-American writers to adapt their [[short story|short stories]] and [[novel]]s into plays and to write original plays.  The first wave of Asian-American playwrights included [[Wakako Yamauchi]], Momoko Iko, Edward Sakamoto, [[Hiroshi Kashiwagi]], and [[Frank Chin]].  Common themes in plays by first wave writers were Asian-American history, [[generation conflict|generational conflict]], [[cultural identity]], [[cultural nationalism]], and [[family history]].  In 1972, Frank Chin's ''[[The Chickencoop Chinaman]]'' became the first Asian-American play to be produced in New York City, and since then, Chin has become a major [[spokesperson]] for Asian-American playwriting.  He founded the [[Asian American Theatre Workshop]] in San Francisco to promote original playwriting by Asian Americans.  The most commercially successful Asian-American play was [[David Henry Hwang]]'s play ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', which became the first Asian-American play to be produced on Broadway and won the [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 1988.  The success of ''M. Butterfly'' created a national interest in Asian-American plays, and regional theatre companies around the country began to produce plays by Hwang and other second wave Asian-American writers such as [[Philip Kan Gotanda]] and [[Velina Hasu Houston]].  Such interest also promoted the publication of first anthologies of Asian-American plays in the early 1990s.  The mainstreaming of Asian-American plays increased with works by third wave writers such as Diana Son, Sung Rno, [[Han Ong]], [[Chay Yew]], [[Rick Shiomi]], and [[Ralph Peña]].  These third wave writers felt that race and ethnicity were mere jumping off point in addressing multifaceted experiences of being an Asian American and wrote about any topic that interested them.  All three waves of Asian American playwrights continue to produce works that define not only Asian-American theatre, but also American theatre and global theatre.

== Alternative theatre and performance ==
One of the pioneers of Asian-American [[Experimental theatre|alternative theatre]] is [[Ping Chong]], a [[Chinese American]] [[multimedia artist]] who has created [[Experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]] since the early 1970s.  He has used visual effects, sound control, dance, [[Mime artist|mime]], spectacle, and other methods based on the sensibilities of [[Cantonese opera]].  Another form of alternative theatre is [[One man show|solo performance]].  Often written, directed, and acted by one performer, solo performance has provided many Asian-American artists with the opportunity to voice their experiences.  Solo performers, such as [[Dan Kwong]], [[Denise Uyehara]], Jude Narita, and [[Lane Nishikawa]], have toured with their shows and have introduced Asian-American theatre to audiences in all parts of the country.  Group performances have also toured, especially to colleges and universities.  Often comedic, group performances, such as Slant Performance Group and the '''18 Mighty Mountain Warriors''', have been popular amongst college students, many of whom saw Asian-American performers onstage for the first time.

'''Awanzai''' (Pashto: آعوانزي) is a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] allied tribe that resides in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. 

The [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]] claim Arab descent from Qutb Shah of [[Ghazni]], who ruled at [[Herat]], but joined [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] in his invasions of India in 1004 A.D. and received from him the name of Awanor, which means Helper. Qutb Shah was descended from [[Ali]], the son-in-law of the [[Prophet Muhammad]] but through the [[Family tree of Ali]]'s other wife.
The Awans have been Muslims from the beginning. Qutb Shah had six sons, Kalan Shah, who settled near [[Kalabagh]] while two settled in [[Tirah]] and the [[Kurram Valley]].
The rest settled in Punjab, Pakistan.

The Awans who have been living in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province for centuries have mixed up with other Pashtun tribes like the [[Yousafzai]] tribe in [[Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] which in turn gave birth to a Sub-clan called 'Awanzai'.

On a rural level, Awanzai historically were of the [[zamindar]] or landowning class and many Awanzai families to this day live on and cultivate land, which their ancestors have held for centuries.

[[File:Blasiuskerzenhalter.jpg|thumb|Candles crossed in a special candelabrum used to bless throats.]]

The '''Blessing of the Throats''' is a [[sacramental]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], celebrated on February 3, the [[Calendar of Saints|feast day]] of [[Saint Blaise]] of Sebaste. It also celebrated in some of the [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches, and in parishes of the [[Anglican Communion]] on the same day as a [[Commemoration (Anglicanism)|commemoration]].

The ''Order of the Blessing of Throats on the Feast of Saint Blaise'' is in the ''Book of Blessings'' (''de Benedictionibus'').

==Background==

Article 1625 from ''The Book of Blessings'' contains a brief historical background of the blessing of throats:

{{cquote|Saint Blase was the bishop of Sebaste in Armenia during the fourth century. Very little is known about his life. According to various accounts he was a physician before becoming a bishop. His religion spread throughout the entire Church in the Middle Ages because he was reputed to have miraculously cured a little boy who nearly died because of a fishbone in his throat. From the eighth century he has been invoked on behalf of the sick, especially those afflicted with illnesses of the throat.}}

Details regarding the miraculous healing of the boy vary. One account relates that the miracle occurred during the journey to take Blaise to prison when he placed his hand on the boy's head and prayed; another that the miracle happened while Blaise was in prison when he picked up two candles provided to him and formed a cross around the boy's throat.

The use of candles for the blessing of throats stems from the candles that Blaise used while in prison. When an old woman's pig had been miraculously rescued from a wolf by Saint Blaise, she would visit him in prison, bringing him food and candles to bring him light in his dark cell.

==Ritual==
Articles 1626 and 1627 explains when and how the blessing takes place:

{{cquote|'''1626''' The blessing of throats may be given by a priest, deacon, or a lay minister who follows the rites and prayers designated for a lay minister. If the blessing is conferred during Mass, the blessing follows the homily and general intercessions, or, for pastoral reasons, the prayer of blessing may take the place of the final blessing of the Mass. When the blessing is given outside Mass, it is preceded by a brief celebration of the word of God. If the blessing is to be celebrated at Morning Prayer or Evening Prayer, it is given after the reading and responsory (and homily) and before the gospel canticle.

'''1627''' The blessing may be given by touching the throat of each person with two candles blessed on the feast of the Presentation of the Lord (February 2) and which have been joined together in the form of a cross.}}

The candles may be joined together by a red ribbon, the color of martyrdom. Although it is the general custom to touch the throat with the candles, it is not required, especially if the candles are lit. The candles may be held over the person.

If all cannot be blessed individually, the celebrant, without candles, extends his hands over the assembly and says the prayer of blessing.

The following blessing is said: 
{{cquote|"Through the intercession of Saint Blaise, bishop and martyr, may God deliver you from every disease of the throat and from every other illness: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."}} 
The priest or deacon makes the [[sign of the cross]] over the recipient as the blessing is said. If necessary, laypersons are permitted to give the blessing of the throats, but are not allowed to make the sign of the cross.

The ordinary Anglican (Episcopal) version of this prayer is:
{{cquote|Through the intercession of Blessed Blaise, Bishop and Martyr, may you be delivered from all illnesses of the throat and any other ailments. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.}}

The older ''Rituale Romanum'', used in the [[Extraordinary Form]], contains a blessing of the candles:

{{cquote|O God most powerful and most kind, Who didst create all the different things in the world by the Word alone, and Whose will it was that this Word by Which all things were made should become incarnate for the remaking of mankind; Thou Who art great and limitless, worthy of reverence and praise, the worker of wonders; for Whose sake the glorious Martyr and Bishop, St. Blaise, joyfully gained the palm of martyrdom, never shrinking from any kind of torture in confessing his faith in Thee; Thou Who didst give to him, amongst other gifts, the prerogative of curing by Thy power every ailment of men’s throats; humbly we beg Thee in Thy majesty not to look upon our guilt, but, pleased by his merits and prayers, in Thine awe-inspiring kindness, to bless this wax created by Thee and to sanctify it, pouring into it Thy grace; so that all who in good faith shall have their throats touched by this wax may be freed from every ailment of their throats through the merit of his suffering, and, in good health and spirits, may give thanks to Thee in Thy holy Church and praise Thy glorious name, which is blessed for ever and ever.  Through our Lord, Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who with Thee lives and reigns, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, world without end.  R. Amen.}}

==Variations and customs==

In Germany and in other places, the blessing of throats is given with lighted candles.&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.agrarverlag.at/bz/mmedia/image/{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}/2012.02.01/1328091816_1.jpg?1329835674&lt;/ref&gt; It is frequently also given on the evening of [[Candlemas]] (the previous day), sometimes even on the proximate Sunday, when more people attend Mass than on St. Blaise's proper feast day.

In the Church of San Carlo ai Catinari in Rome, which is dedicated to St. Blaise as co-patron, the blessing is given with a relic of Saint Blaise, in a crystal placed on a large ring,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdtprs.com/images/07_02_03_relic_ring1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; pressed against the throat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wdtprs.com/images/07_02_03_blessing1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain Hispanic countries (e.g., Spain and Mexico), a ribbon is given to be worn around the neck for the nine days following the blessing.

In the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], the neck is anointed with oil on a cotton swab&lt;ref&gt;http://orbiscatholicus.blogspot.com/2008/02/st-blaise-day-in-rome.html&lt;/ref&gt; or on a candle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.armeniancatholic.org/popup.php?bigID=1687&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing of throats does not appear to be practiced in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

A Ukrainian Greek Catholic ritual of the blessing of the throats also exists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theologyincolor.com/ray/Blaise.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

The older ''Rituale Romanum'' provides a blessing for bread, wine, water and fruit for the relief of throat ailments on the feast of Saint Blaise.

In [[British English]], '''Bongo Bongo Land''' (or '''Bongo-bongo Land''') is a [[pejorative]] term used to refer to [[Third World]] countries, particularly in [[Africa]], or to a fictional such country.

==Possible origins==
The origin of the term is unclear but it may come from one of the following:
* [[bongo drum]]s, as (inaccurately) supposed to be played by African natives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8dWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Bongo+Bongo+Land&amp;dq=Bongo+Bongo+Land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=md8CUrzuOYrN4QTqlIH4Ag&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAzgK|first=Adrian|last=Room|year=2006|title=Nicknames of places: Origins and meanings of the alternate and secondary names, sobriquets, titles, epithets and slogans for 4600 places worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a parody of African place-names or languages

There is a reference to "Bongoland" in the English translation, by Ellen Elizabeth Frewer, of a book originally in German, by [[Georg August Schweinfurth]], published in 1874 in English as ''The Heart of Africa''.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/heartofafrica02schw&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1947 song [[Civilization (1947 song)|Civilization]] by  [[Bob Hilliard]] and [[Carl Sigman]], recorded by various artists, contained the line "Bongo, Bongo, Bongo, I Don't Want to Leave the Congo".  A variation of this was adopted for a poster produced by the [[fascist]] [[Union Movement]] bearing the chant "Bongo, bongo, [[whites]] aren't going to leave [[Congo (area)|the Congo]]".&lt;ref&gt;Prison Sentence And Fines In Ritz Hotel Case Defence Speaks Of "An Awful Error" (Law) The Times Saturday, Aug 13, 1960; pg. 4; Issue 54849; col F&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1970s, the cinema advertisement for [[Silk Cut]] cigarettes parodying the 1964 film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' was supposedly set in 'Mbongoland'.

==Controversies==
The term has featured in political controversies. In 1985 [[Alan Clark]], while [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Plymouth Sutton (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Sutton]], once, in a departmental meeting, allegedly referred to Africa as "Bongo Bongo Land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzw9WabmmVwC&amp;pg=PT219&amp;dq=bongo+bongo+land#v=onepage&amp;q=bongo%20bongo%20land&amp;f=false|title=Political Correctness: A History of Semantics and Culture|isbn=9781444360295|author1=Hughes|first1=Geoffrey|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;7 February 1985 "Tory minister faces row over race remark" ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; When called to account, however, by then Prime Minister [[John Major]], Clark denied the comment had any racist overtones, claiming it had simply been a reference to the President of [[Gabon]], [[Omar Bongo]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A. ''The Last Diaries: In and Out of the Wilderness'', Phoenix, 2003, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 [[Taki Theodoracopulos]] called [[Kenya]] "bongo-bongo land" in his ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' column.

In July 2013, [[Godfrey Bloom]], [[Member of the European Parliament]] for [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] for the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) was filmed referring to countries which receive overseas aid from the United Kingdom as "Bongo Bongo Land".&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/06/ukip-godfrey-bloom-bongo-bongo-land|title=Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom criticises aid to 'bongo bongo land'|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=6 August 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UKIP later banned use of the term, and while Bloom refused to apologise for his remarks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/video-ukip-mep-wont-apologise-for-bongo-bong-land-comment-8750407.html |title=Video: Ukip MEP won't apologise for 'Bongo Bong Land' comment |work=[[The Independent]] |date=29 July 2013|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later stated that he regretted "any genuine offence which might have been caused."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/story/2013-08-07/fury-at-bongo-bong-land-remarks-ukip-godfrey-bloom/ |title='Bongo' MEP 'regrets offence' |publisher=ITV News |date=7 August 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson from [[Show Racism the Red Card]] stated that Bloom's remarks were: "crude stereotypes that see Britain as a civilised place and overseas as tribal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-23600129||title=The other meaning of Bongoland|publisher=BBC News|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew d'Ancona]] wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'': "There may indeed be some who inwardly cheered Bloom’s choice of words.

'''Call signs in Oceania''' are currently voluntary in [[Australia]] radio and TV station, and were previously compulsory in [[New Zealand]]. In both countries, stations like [[2GB]] and [[Newstalk ZB]] continue to use parts of the call signs in their branding.

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] has assigned countries in the [[Oceania]] the following call sign blocks for all radio communication, broadcasting or transmission:&lt;ref&gt;[http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm International Telecommunication Union country call sign assignments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234420/http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The conference held in 1927 assigned call prefixes mainly to colonial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/01/S02010000144002PDFE.pdf# |title=International Radiotelegraph Conference (Washington 1927) |access-date=2016-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308211326/http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/01/S02010000144002PDFE.pdf# |archive-date=2014-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only modern Oceanic nation mentioned was an Anglo-French condominium lasting from 1906 until 1980, when the New Hebrides gained their independence as Vanuatu.  New Hebrides was assigned YHA–YHZ.

The 1947 Atlantic City ITU Conference reallocated call sign blocks some developing island nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/01/S020100002B4506PDFE.pdf International Telecommunication Convention Atlantic City 1947] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710000000/http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-s/oth/02/01/S020100002B4506PDFE.pdf |date=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This time New Hebrides was assigned YJA–YJZ.  All other islands were assigned call prefixes according to their colonial or protectorate status.

Since 1947 and the various independence movements, new call signs were assigned by the ITU or a new host country.  This is particularly true of Japanese territories occupied by the United States following WWII.

While not directly related to call signs, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) further has divided all countries assigned amateur radio prefixes into [[International Telecommunication Union region|three regions]]; countries and territories in Oceania are located in ITU Region 3.  They cover CQ Zones 27, 28, 31, 32 and 12.

==Amateur radio call signs==

Amateur radio or [[amateur radio|ham radio]] [[call signs]] are unique identifiers for more than 2,500 licensed operators in [[Oceania|the western Pacific]].  [[Call signs]] are regulated internationally by the [[ITU]] as well as nationally by island national entities, some of which are independent countries and others are under colonial administration.  For the purposes of this article, [[Amateur radio call signs of Australia|Australia]], its dependencies and [[Amateur radio call signs of New Zealand|New Zealand]] are excluded.  Also not included are Oceanic Indonesian areas of [[Irian Jaya]] and the [[Maluku Islands]].

Since call sign allocation from the [[International Telegraph Union]] is administered by national political authorities and international mandates, it is a story of colonial transition within the 20th Century.

'''Capital punishment in Finland''' (Finnish: ''kuolemanrangaistus'') has been abolished ''de jure''.&lt;ref name=SuomenPerustuslaki&gt;{{cite web | author=Finlex, database of Finnish Acts and Decrees | title=Suomen perustuslaki | url=http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990731 | language=Finnish | accessdate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ConstitutionOfFinland&gt;{{cite web | author=Finlex, database of Finnish Acts and Decrees | title=The Constitution of Finland | url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990731.pdf | accessdate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1823 in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], death sentences were commuted to transportation to [[Siberia]] or other lesser sentences. The last person to be executed in peacetime was [[Tahvo Putkonen]], on 8 July 1825. The capital punishment was ''de facto'' abolished during the rest of the Czarist regime 1825–1917 in Finland.

During and right after the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918 there were many executions, most done without due process. Approximately 1,400–1,650 [[White Guard (Finland)|Whites]] and 7,000–10,000 [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] were executed by the opposing side. The executions were invariably carried out by [[firing squad]]. The [[Shoot on the Spot Declaration]] allowed White commanders to summarily execute prisoners, something which was of questionable legality, but this issue became moot after general amnesties.

During the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War]] approximately 550 death sentences were carried out. 455 (some ninety percent) of those executed were Soviet infiltrators, spies and saboteurs. The officer's authority to execute soldiers refusing to obey commands or fleeing from combat was exercised only in 13 cases. The most famous case is the execution of [[conscientious objector]] [[Arndt Pekurinen]] in autumn 1941, who was also the penultimate Finn ever to be executed for civilian crimes (conscientious objection during wartime was considered [[high treason]]). As he declined taking a rifle and going to the front line, he was sentenced to death without trial for disobedience by his commanding officer, Captain Valkonen. Nobody in his battalion volunteered for the firing squad, and Captain Valkonen had to use threat of punishment to order a soldier, Corporal Asikainen, to shoot him. Pekurinen's death was widely considered miscarriage of justice by his service mates.

The last Finn to be executed for civilian crimes was Toivo "Kirves" (Axe) Koljonen, who killed a family of six with an axe in 1942. He was shot by a [[military police]] [[firing squad]] along with Soviet spies sentenced to death for espionage in 1943. The last woman executed in Finland was [[Martta Koskinen]], shot for espionage and high treason in 1943. The last Finn to be executed for any crimes was Private Olavi Laiho, who was shot for desertion, high treason and espionage in [[Oulu]], 2 September 1944. One day later a group of three Soviet infiltrators were shot, as the last persons to be executed in Finland.

In independent [[Finland]], capital punishment for crimes committed in peacetime was abolished by law in 1949, and in 1972 it was abolished entirely. In addition, the current [[Constitution of Finland]], adopted in 2000, &amp;mdash;specifically Chapter 2, Section 7&amp;mdash; prohibits capital punishment: {{quote|Jokaisella on oikeus elämään sekä henkilökohtaiseen vapauteen, koskemattomuuteen ja turvallisuuteen. Ketään ei saa tuomita kuolemaan, kiduttaa eikä muutoinkaan kohdella ihmisarvoa loukkaavasti.&lt;ref name="SuomenPerustuslaki"/&gt; (in English: ''Everyone has the right to life, personal liberty, integrity and security. No one shall be sentenced to death, tortured or otherwise treated in a manner violating human dignity.'')&lt;ref name="ConstitutionOfFinland"/&gt;}}

In the 19th century and before, as in the other Nordic countries, [[beheading]] by axe was the most common method of execution. In the 20th century, [[firing squad]]s were used. The official beheading axe of Finland is today on display at Museum of Crime, [[Vantaa]].

Some notable lasts:

* Last person executed in peacetime in Finland: [[Tahvo Putkonen]], 1825, [[Decapitation|beheaded]] with [[axe]] for [[murder]]
* Last person hanged in Finland: Taavetti Lukkarinen, 1916, at [[Oulu]]. He was hanged for [[high treason]] under [[Czarist]] [[Russia]]n [[martial law]]. Instead of [[gallows]], he was hanged in a pine tree. The tree is today protected as a memorial.
* Last person executed for a civilian crime in Finland: [[Toivo Koljonen]], 1943, by [[firing squad]] for six murders.
* Last woman executed in Finland: [[Martta Koskinen]], 1943, by firing squad for [[espionage]] and [[high treason]].
* Last Finn executed: Private [[Olavi Laiho]], 2 September 1944, by firing squad for [[desertion]], [[espionage]] and [[high treason]].
* Last person executed in Finland: a group of three Soviet infiltrators, 3 September 1944, by firing squad for [[espionage]].

==Reappearance==
On 16 December 2015, a member of Finnish Parliament, a member of [[Finns Party]], [[Teuvo Hakkarainen]] inquired Minister of Justice, also member of the same party, if capital punishment could be re-enacted, referring to the court case against two asylum seekers for 11 murders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015121620842750_uu.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{UN_Population|source}}, Nicaragua has a population of {{UN_Population|Nicaragua}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} [[Mestizo]]s (who are a mix of Native American and white) make up about 69% of the population, while whites make up 24%. The remainder of the Nicaraguan population is 9% black, and 5% Native American.

Nicaraguan demographics reflected a different composition prior to the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista revolution]] of 1979 since most of the migration during the years that followed were primarily of upper or middle class Nicaraguans, a group primarily made up of whites. A growing number of these expats have returned, while many continue to live abroad.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The 42.5% of the population live below to the poverty line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2046.html#nu|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general poverty rate is estimated of 47.3%, although much of the population lives in the lower middle class because of low salaries and a minimal amount of PIB (US$1000–3000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inide.gob.ni/|title=Instituto Nacional de Información de Desarrollo- INIDE de Nicaragua|website=Inide.gob.ni|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most populous city in the country is the capital city, [[Managua]], with a population of 1.2 million (2005). As of 2005, over 4.4 million inhabitants live in the Pacific, Central and North regions. 2.7 million inhabitants reside in the Pacific region alone, while inhabitants in the Caribbean region only reach an estimated 700,000.&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=VIII Censo de Poblacion y IV de Vivienda| date=October 2005| url=http://www.inec.gob.ni/censos2005/ResumenCensal/RESUMENCENSAL.pdf| work=Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos| pages=| accessdate=2007-07-07| language=Spanish| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824192548/http://www.inec.gob.ni/censos2005/ResumenCensal/RESUMENCENSAL.pdf| archivedate=2007-08-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census Bureau in Nicaragua is the [[National Institute of Statistics and Census of Nicaragua|National Institute of Statistics and Census]] (INEC). The institution is in charge of completing [[census]]es and [[statistical survey|surveys]]. INEC ran its first census in 1906, the last census was taken in 2005, it was the eighth to date.

=== Population distribution ===
Ninety percent of Nicaraguans live in the Pacific lowlands and the adjacent interior highlands. The population is 54% urban. The most populous city in Nicaragua is the capital city, [[Managua]], with a population of 1.2 million (2005). As of 2005, over 4.4 million inhabitants live in the Pacific, Central and North regions of the country. There are 2.7 million residents in the Pacific region. The Caribbean region has an estimated 700,000 residents.&lt;ref name="CN"/&gt; In addition, many [[Nicaraguan Diaspora|Nicaraguans live abroad]].

In the 19th century, there had been a substantial [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] minority, but this group was also largely assimilated culturally into the [[mestizo]] majority. Primarily in the 19th century, Nicaragua saw several waves of immigration from other European nations. In particular the northern cities of [[Estelí]], [[Jinotega]] and [[Matagalpa]] have significant fourth generation Germans. Most of Nicaragua's population lives in the western region of the country in the departments of Managua, Granada and Léon.

[[File:Afro-Nica.jpg|thumb|An [[Afro-Nicaraguan]].]]

According to the 2005 census 443,847 (8.6%) residents consider themselves to belong to an indigenous people or to an ethnic community.&lt;ref name="census 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inide.gob.ni/censos2005/ResumenCensal/Resumen2.pdf|format=PDF|title=CAPÍTULO 1 : CENSO DE POBLACIÓN|website=Inide.gob.ni|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining majority of the Nicaraguan population (91.6%) are deemed mestizo and white, with the majority of these being of Spanish, with some German, Italian, Portuguese and French ancestry. Mestizos and whites mainly reside in the western region of the country.

Possibly also a part of the black or [[Afro-Nicaraguan]] population, which mainly resides on the country's sparsely populated Caribbean (or Atlantic) coast, is included in the majority population which does not consider itself to belong to an ethnic community. In the 2005 census, there were only 19,890 [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s (0.4% of the total population). The [[Creole peoples|Creole]] population is mostly of [[Antilles|West Indian]] (Antillean) origin, the descendants of indentured laborers brought mostly from [[Jamaica]] when the region was a [[British protectorate]].

The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], a people of mixed [[Island Caribs|Carib]], [[Angola]]n, [[Kongo people|Congolese]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] descent, numbered 3,271 in 2005 (0.1%). 112,253 people considered themselves "Mestizo de la Costa Caribe" (mestizo of the Caribbean coast). In addition to the inhabitants who declared themselves Indigenous or Ethnic community, 13,740 answered "Other". Another 47,473 responded "Not Sure" and an additional 19,460 responded "Ignore".

===Indigenous population===
The Native American population, the unmixed descendants of the country's indigenous inhabitants, numbered 227,760 (4.4% of the total population) in 2005.&lt;ref name="census 2005"/&gt; Nicaragua's [[pre-Columbian]] consisted of many indigenous groups. In the western region, the Nahua people (also known as the [[Pipil people|Pipil-Nicaraos]]) were present along with other groups such as the Chorotega people.

The central region and the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua were inhabited by indigenous peoples who were mostly [[Chibcha]]-related groups that had migrated from South America, primarily present day [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. These groups include the [[Miskito people|Miskitos]] (120,817 people), [[Matagalpa people|Matagalpa]] (15,240 people), [[Rama people|Ramas]] (4,185 people), [[Sumo (people)|Sumos]] (9,756 people) and Ulwa (698 people). Other indigenous peoples include the Subtiaba (19,949 people) and modern-day Chorotegas who are also known as the Mangue (46,002 people).

In the 19th century, there was still a substantial indigenous minority, but this group was largely assimilated culturally into the mestizo majority. In the mid-1980s, the government divided the department of [[Zelaya (Nicaragua)|Zelaya]]&amp;nbsp;– consisting of the eastern half of the country&amp;nbsp;— into two autonomous regions and granted the black and indigenous people of this region limited self-rule within the Republic.{{clear}}

===Immigration===
Relative to its overall population, Nicaragua has never experienced any large scale wave of [[immigrants]]. The total number of immigrants to Nicaragua, both originating from other Latin American countries and all other countries, never surpassed 1% of its total population prior to 1995. The 2005 census showed the foreign-born population at 1.2%, having risen a mere .06% in 10 years.&lt;ref name="CN"/&gt; However, in the 19th century, Nicaragua received immigrants from Europe, who established many agricultural businesses such as coffee and sugar cane plantations, and also newspapers, hotels and banks.

[[File:DeutscheClub.JPG|thumb|250px|The founding members of the Deutscher Club in Nicaragua, 1901]]

===Emigration===
During the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] and the Civil War, thousands of Nicaraguans left the country. After the [[Violeta Chamorro|1990 Nicaraguan Elections]] some people returned, but many more emigrated during the rest of the decade. In 1998, the [[Hurricane Mitch]] killed almost 4,000 people in the country and destroyed much of the [[Economy of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan economy]], as a result thousands of Nicaraguans received the [[Temporary protected status|TPS]] for emigrate to the United States as "refugees".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.immigrantinfo.org/kin/nicaragua.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520160930/http://www.immigrantinfo.org/kin/nicaragua.htm |archive-date=2007-05-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many Nicaraguans had left the country to escape poverty and unemployment.

Nicaraguan emigration is a recent process. During the 1990–2004 period, more than 800,000 Nicaraguans left the country, compared to 100,000 during the 1970–1989 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2004/abril/14/economia/economia-20040414-02.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604212859/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2004/abril/14/economia/economia-20040414-02.html |archive-date=2008-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], in 2005 there were 683,520 Nicaraguans living outside Nicaragua legally. If those who are undocumented are counted, some sources estimate as many as 1,500,000 Nicaraguans living abroad by the end of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lajornadanet.com/diario/archivo/2006/junio/nicaraguenses_divididos_exterior_12.html|title=Nicaragüenses  en el exterior divididos y rizo no renunciará|website=Lajornadanet.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaraguans are the third largest community of Central Americans living abroad, after [[Guatemala]]ns and [[Salvadoran]]s. Nicaragua is also the second country in Central America by percentage of population living abroad.

[[Remittance]]s to Nicaragua represent about 15% of the country's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nu.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Nicaragua received close to one billion dollars in remittances; an increase from the $750,000,000 received in 2007, according to the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/Resources/334934-1199807908806/Nicaragua.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nicaragua|website=Siteresources.worldbank.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of Nicaragua is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or Nicañol as Nicaraguan Spanish is sometimes referred to, and is spoken by the country's population. In Nicaragua the [[Voseo]] form is common, just as in other countries in Central and South America like [[Honduras]], [[Argentina]], and [[Uruguay]]. Spanish has many different dialects spoken throughout Latin America, [[Central American Spanish]] is the dialect spoken in Nicaragua.

;Phonology

Some other characteristics of Nicaraguan phonology include:
* /s/ at the end of a syllable or before a consonant is pronounced like [h].
* ''j'' (/x/), is aspirated; it is soft as the /h/ in English (e.g.: Yahoo).
* Intervocalic /b/, /d/, and /g/ show no sign of reduction, and are much more pronounced than in most dialects.
* In some regions the double /l/ is pronounced with a ( "Shhh") sound, Argentina has a similar accent.
* There is no confusion between /l/ and /r/, as in the Caribbean.
* /s/, /z/ and in some cases /c/ (as in ''cerrar'') are pronounced as [s]
* /m/ at the end of a word tends to be pronounced as [n]

Nicaraguans on the Caribbean coast speak their indigenous languages and also English. The indigenous peoples of the east who use their original language tend to also speak Spanish and/or English, the main languages being [[Miskito language]], [[Sumo language]], and [[Rama language]]. Creole languages are also present in the Caribbean coast, [[Nicaragua Creole English]] has 30,000 speakers.

Nicaragua has many minority groups. Many ethnic groups in Nicaragua, such as the [[Chinese Nicaraguan]]s and [[Palestinian Nicaraguan]]s, have maintained their ancestral languages while also speaking Spanish and/or English. Minority languages include Chinese, Arabic, German, Italian among others. Nicaragua also has a total of 3 [[extinct language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=NI|title=Nicaragua|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicaraguan Sign Language]] is also of particular interest to linguists.

Religion is a significant part of the culture of Nicaragua and forms part of the [[Constitution of Nicaragua|constitution]]. Religious freedom, which has been guaranteed since 1939, and religious tolerance is promoted by both the Nicaraguan government and the constitution. [[Bishop]]s are expected to lend their authority to important state occasions, and their pronouncements on national issues are closely followed. They can also be called upon to mediate between contending parties at moments of political crisis.&lt;ref name="LOCR"&gt;{{cite news | first=Gilbert | last=Dennis | title=Nicaragua: Religion | publisher=Library of Congress | url =http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ni0040) | work =Country Studies | accessdate = 2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nicaragua has no official religion it is nominally [[Roman Catholic]]. Practicing Roman Catholics are no longer the majority and are declining while [[evangelism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] groups and Mormons are growing rapidly have been growing since the 1990s. There are also strong [[Anglican]] and [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] communities on the Caribbean coast.

Roman Catholicism came to Nicaragua in the 16th century with the Spanish conquest and remained, until 1939, the established faith. [[Protestantism]] and various [[Christian sect]]s came to Nicaragua during the 19th century, but only during the 20th century have Protestant denominations gained large followings in the Caribbean Coast of the country. Popular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intermediaries between human beings and God.&lt;ref name="LOCR"/&gt;

Most localities, from the capital of [[Managua]] to small rural communities, honor [[patron saint]]s selected from the Roman Catholic calendar with annual ''fiestas''.  In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honored in August with two colorful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither [[Christmas]] nor [[Easter]], but La Purísima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]], during which elaborate altars to the [[Virgin Mary]] are constructed in homes and workplaces.&lt;ref name="LOCR"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12808">A concept of '''Design Science''' was introduced in 1957 by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|date=1957|title=A Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnxUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22a+comprehensive+anticipatory+design+science%22&amp;dq=%22a+comprehensive+anticipatory+design+science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi38-C5npDPAhXEMGMKHVbxDsk4HhDoAQgpMAM|journal=Royal Architectural Institute of Canada|volume=34|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-09-14|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; who defined it as a systematic form of [[design]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bfi.org/design-science/primer/fuller-design-science|title=Fuller on Design Science|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|date=|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded on this concept in his ''World Design Science Decade'' proposal to the International Union of Architects in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bfi.org/design-science/primer/world-design-science-decade|title=World Design Science Decade documents|last=Fuller|first=R. Buckminster|last2=McHale|first2=John|date=1964|website=Buckminster Fuller Institute|publisher=Southern Illinois University|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used by S. A. Gregory in the 1965 'The Design Method' Conference &lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt; where he drew the distinction between [[scientific method]] and design method. Gregory was clear in his view that design was not a science and that design science referred to the scientific study of design. [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] in his 1968 [[Karl Taylor Compton]] lectures &lt;ref name="simon1996" /&gt; used and popularized these terms in his argument for the scientific study of the artificial (as opposed to the natural). Over the intervening period the two uses of the term (systematic designing and study of designing) have co-mingled to the point where design science may have both meanings.

==Science of design==

The first edition of Simon's ''The Sciences of the Artificial'',&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1969, built on previous developments and motivated the development of systematic and formalized [[Design methods|design methodologies]] relevant to many design disciplines, for example architecture, engineering, urban planning, medicine, computer science, and management studies.&lt;ref name="baldwin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="banathy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="long1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="romme2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vanaken2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="warfield1990" /&gt; Simon's ideas about the science of design also motivated the development of [[Design|design research]] and the scientific study of designing.&lt;ref name="cross2007" /&gt; In his book Simon also used the idea of a theory of design alluding to design science as a science of design. For example, the [[Axiomatic design|axiomatic theory of design]] described in Suh&lt;ref name="suh1990" /&gt; presents a domain independent theory that can explain or prescribe the design process. The [[Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology|Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology]], described in Gero&lt;ref name="gero1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gerokanneng2004" /&gt; presenting a domain independent ontology of design and designing, is another example. Early efforts that use mathematics to formalize the design process include Braha’s Formal Theory of Design (FDT), which is a domain independent mathematical and computational theory of the design process.&lt;ref name=”FDT”&gt;Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing from the idea of a 'design science' there has been recurrent concern to differentiate design from science.&lt;ref name="gregory1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crossnw1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="willem1990" /&gt; [[Nigel Cross]] differentiated between scientific design, design science and a science of design.&lt;ref name="cross2001" /&gt; The scientific study of design does not require or assume that the acts of designing are themselves scientific and an increasing number of research programs take this view.&lt;ref name="gero2004" /&gt; Cross uses the term 'designerly' to distinguish designing from other kinds of human activity.&lt;ref name="cross2006" /&gt;

==Design as science==

Braha and Maimon argue that there is direct similarity between design and the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt; Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_TSMC_Design_Process.pdf The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure]. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”FDT”/&gt; There is growing pressure on architects, engineers, lawyers, managers and other design-oriented professionals to act and decide on the basis of a systematic body of evidence.&lt;ref name="vanaken2009" /&gt; Hevner and Chatterjee provide a reference on Design Science Research (DSR) in Information Systems,&lt;ref name="hevner2010" /&gt; including a selection of papers from the [http://desrist.org/ DESRIST conferences], a look at key principles of DSR, and the integration of action research with design research. In 2010, 122 professors promoted design science in information system research by signing a [http://memo.iwi.unisg.ch/en/ memorandum].

==Design as science in information systems==

Hevner et al. provide a set of seven guidelines which help information systems researchers conduct, evaluate and present design-science research.&lt;ref name="hevner2004" /&gt;  The seven guidelines address design as an artifact, problem relevance, design evaluation, research contributions, research rigor, design as a search process,  and research communication.

Later extensions of the Design Science framework detail how design and research problems can be rationally decomposed by means of nested problem solving.&lt;ref name="wieringa2009" /&gt; It is also explained how the regulative cycle (problem investigation, solution design, design validation, solution implementation, and implementation evaluation) fits in the framework. Peffers et al.&lt;ref name="peffers" /&gt; developed a model for producing and presenting information systems research, the Design Science Research Process. The Peffers et al. model has been used extensively and Adams provides an example of the process model being applied to create a digital forensic process model.&lt;ref name="adams" /&gt;

'''Environmental health policy''' is the interplay between the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[health]], and how the environment can affect human health. Policies are created by governments and organizations where they see the issues arising in the health of their jurisdiction related to the environment.

There are several environmental factors that can contribute to health including air quality, [[climate change]], toxic drinking water, and toxic chemical exposure.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kirk|last2=Corvalan|first2=Carlos|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|year=1999|title=How Much Global Ill Health Is Attributable to Environmental Factors?|url=|journal=Epidemiology Research Inc.|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the region the policy is in, different environmental factors are going to be addressed in the policy. Some effects of the environment on health can include [[asthma]], [[malaria]], [[cholera]], disease, [[cancer]], and physical injury.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; These are also dependent on the area in which the individual lives, and how severe the environmental factors are. Climate change issues have become more prevalent in the 21st century, requiring action from global leaders. When there are substantial changes to the environment, a populations health is vulnerable to potential risks.

Environmental health policy can be implemented at many levels of government, including the municipal, state and international levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Investing Together: Working Effectively Across Levels of Government|last=OECD|first=|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal governments focus on [[Public policy|policies]] that affect the boundaries they control, while state governments focus on several cities or states within their borders where environment affects health. International policies involve the cooperation of several states to implement the same policy to address larger environmental issues on health like pollution and climate change.

[[Developing country|Developing nations]] take a different approach to environmental health politics than [[Developed country|developed nations]]. Developing nations do not always have the same access to resources to implement policies that can improve the environment and health of their citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conteh|first=Charles|last2=Ohemeng|first2=Frank|year=2009|title=The Politics of Decision Making in Developing Countries|url=|journal=Public Management Review|volume=11|pages=57–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors can have an unequal effect on lower income and ethnic minority regions being exposed to environmental stressors and a lower quality of life.

== Definition ==
Environmental Health Policy is the combination between the environment and the health of citizens in a defined area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dummer|first=Trevor|year=2008|title=Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning|url=|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=178|pages=1177–80|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When defining Environmental Health policy it is best to break down the concept into three separate groups: [[Natural environment|environment]], health and policy. The environment aspect of the term refers to the ecosystems and the environmental factors that can affect human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buhrs|first=Ton|last2=Bartlett|first2=Robert|year=1991|title=Environmental Policy in New Zealand|url=|journal=The Politics of Clean and Green|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health]] refers to the human beings ability to function successfully when environmental factors are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=Machteld|last2=Knottnerus|first2=J. André|last3=Green|first3=Lawrence|last4=Horst|first4=Henriëtte van der|last5=Jadad|first5=Alejandro R.|last6=Kromhout|first6=Daan|last7=Leonard|first7=Brian|last8=Lorig|first8=Kate|last9=Loureiro|first9=Maria Isabel|date=2011-07-26|title=How should we define health?|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4163|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=343|pages=d4163|doi=10.1136/bmj.d4163|issn=0959-8138|pmid=21791490}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its more simplistic definition, health is the overall well-being of a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=World Health Organization|first=|year=2006|title=Constitution of the world Health Organization|url=|journal=Basic Documents|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Policy]] is a  "course of action or principle adopted or proposed by a government, party, business, or individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concise Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=1995|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental Health Policy refers to the [[human impact on the environment]], which in turn affects human health and requires policy action.

== Environmental Factors ==
One environmental factor that contributes to the health of the global community is [[climate change]]. Climate change is the long term rising and/or dropping of temperatures and the deviation of weather patterns over time.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forman|first=Gideon|year=2015|title=Climate Change Already Makes Us Sick|url=|journal=Alternatives Journal|volume=41|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of climate change, the Canadian Arctic has increased in temperature by three or four degrees.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; As the warming of the Northern Arctic continues, a surplus of water enters the system. Whether the surplus is due to rain or melting snow, an increased amount of [[pathogen]]s enter the fresh water.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

With increasing weather extreme trends, [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne diseases]], as well as allergies become more prevalent in these conditions.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patz|first=Jonathan|last2=Campbell- Lendrum|first2=Diarmid|last3=Holloway|first3=Tracey|last4=Foley|first4=Jonathan|year=2005|orig-year=|title=Impact of Regional Climate Change on Human Health|url=|journal=Nature|volume=438|pages=310–317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infectious diseases and what accompanies them (mosquitoes, tics etc.) rely upon the environment to spread and survive.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The reproduction and spread of these diseases are severely affected by weather fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Air pollution is another environmental factor that has been proven to be an influence on health. Air pollution has become a more serious issue in recent years as developing nations are experiencing a high [[birth rate]] and low [[Mortality rate|death rate]]. The more people that are in these regions means the more resources required to sustain them. Air pollution comes in two forms; emission and transmission. These pollutants come from various sources, such as modes of transportation, the burning of fossil fuels, or naturally from the ground.

[[Sea level rise|Rising sea levels]] is another environmental factor that affects the health of individuals in a given region. One of the reasons why sea levels begin to rise is due to the melting of large glacier ice.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milne|first=Glenn|date=2008-04-01|title=How the climate drives sea-level changes|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/49/2/2.24/246715/How-the-climate-drives-sea-level-changes|journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics|volume=49|issue=2|pages=2.24–2.28|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2008.49224.x|issn=1366-8781}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the glacier icecaps start melting faster, sea levels will be affected.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Another way that the sea levels rise is when temperatures increase, the water molecules expands and require more space.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; As sea levels start to rise, the shore line starts to expand. In serious situations, this causes people to become environmental refugees. As the sea level rises it starts to affect valuable land used for food and other harvesting. 200 million people is the amount of people that are at risk of flooding should the sea level rise 40&amp;nbsp;cm by the 2080s.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== Health Risks ==
The health risks that are a result of the environment are starting to affect people around the globe. It is estimated that the increasing temperatures over the past 30 years have resulted in the deaths of 150,000 lives each year.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Europe in the summer of 2003 experienced higher than normal temperatures resulting in the deaths of approximately 22,000 to 45,000 in the span of two weeks.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; This has been the worst effect of climate change in recent history. Increasing rates of extreme temperature are directly related to increased mortality. Some of the health risks that come with extreme temperatures are heat stress, cardio vascular failure, Hypothermia, etc.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

The temperature affects the malaria parasites in the mosquitoes and its ability to incubate as well as how likely the mosquitoes are to [[Hematophagy|blood feed]].&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kigozi|first=Ruth|last2=Zinszer|first2=Kate|last3=Mpimbaza|first3=Arthur|last4=Sserwanga|first4=Asadu|last5=Kigozi|first5=Simon P.|last6=Kamya|first6=Moses|date=2016-01-01|title=Assessing temporal associations between environmental factors and malaria morbidity at varying transmission settings in Uganda|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-016-1549-2|journal=Malaria Journal|volume=15|pages=511|doi=10.1186/s12936-016-1549-2|issn=1475-2875|pmc=5070351|pmid=27756304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosquitoes thrive in the transmission of parasites where temperatures do not exceed 25 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Excessive rain, which is becoming more frequent amongst many countries, acts as the perfect breeding site for the aquatic beginning of a mosquito's life.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Malaria is a vector- borne disease that is extremely prevalent in Africa. The disease puts billions of people at risk of contracting the virus.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; Due to a lack of sufficient healthcare where the disease is most concentrated, many people die.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The environment is a huge contributor to the success malaria has in transmitting the disease.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

One of the more common health risks that people encounter is a result of air pollutants and air quality. Allergic [[Asthma]] is a chronic disease that affects individual's inflammatory system when they are exposed to allergens resulting in shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mukherjee|first=Anil B.|last2=Zhang|first2=Zhongjian|date=2011-09-23|title=Allergic Asthma: Influence of Genetic and Environmental Factors|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/286/38/32883|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=286|issue=38|pages=32883–32889|doi=10.1074/jbc.R110.197046|issn=0021-9258|pmc=3190897|pmid=21799018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors such as, air pollutants, tobacco smoke, emission fumes, and other allergens in the air when absorbed through the body are said to have an influence on allergic asthma.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Climate change can affect humans' respiratory health by aggravating respiratory disease or increasing exposure to potential risks of the disease.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D’Amato|first=Gennaro|last2=Cecchi|first2=Lorenzo|last3=D’Amato|first3=Mariella|last4=Annesi-Maesano|first4=Isabella|date=2014-06-01|title=Climate change and respiratory diseases|url=http://err.ersjournals.com/content/23/132/161|journal=European Respiratory Review|language=en|volume=23|issue=132|pages=161–169|doi=10.1183/09059180.00001714|issn=0905-9180|pmid=24881071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change can affect the respiratory system by the amount of pollen and allergens in the air, mold proliferation, and the effects of the ozone layer.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The increase of temperatures results in putting a strain on the respiratory system often causing asthma and other lung diseases.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Some of the health risks that are closely related to the respiratory system are asthma, rhnosinusitis, respiratory tract infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;

== Perspectives  ==

=== Municipal level ===

==== Hamilton, Ontario (Canada) ====
The Hamilton steel mill region has had higher levels of air pollution than the rest of the city. The effect of air pollution in the region has resulted in the spending of $537 million per year on health care and other associated costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerrett|first=Michael|year=2001|title=A GIS- environmental justice analysis of particulate air pollution in Hamilton, Canada|url=|journal=Environment and Planning|volume=33|pages=955–973|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health issues that arise with air pollution in Hamilton is premature death, respiratory problems, and cardiovascular problems. Hamilton is taking the initiative to spread awareness around environmental issues with the implementation of yearly summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hamilton Environmental Summit 2013 (City Wide)|last=Murray|first=Chris|publisher=City of Hamilton|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision 2020 is a community based development program which encourages community reporting of environmental issues, which influences policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakefield|first=Sarah|last2=Elliott|first2=Susan|last3=Cole|first3=Donald|year=2007|title=Social capital, environmental health and collective action: a Hamilton, Ontario case study|url=|journal=The Canadian Geographer|volume=51|pages=428–443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rochester, New York (United States of America) ====
In 2005, the city of Rochester enacted a rental housing-based lead law when the incidence of childhood lead poisoning was rising.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korfmacher|first=Katrina|last2=Ayoob|first2=Maria|last3=Morley|first3=Rebecca|year=2012|title=Rochester's Lead Law: Evaluation of a Local Environmental Health Policy Innovation|url=|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new amendment to the housing code requires a lead inspection of rental properties built before 1978, with a focus on deteriorating paint within and outside the house.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The law requires property owners to remove any lead based paint and dust from the premise and obtain a certificate of occupancy before they are able to rent out the property again.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In order to keep compliance with the law, Rochester allows owners to be trained in lead safe repair work so [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] workers are not required to correct violations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Harlem, New York (United States of America) ====
Harlem, along with many areas of the United States, have taken on a community based participatory research method to examine environmental health policy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasquez|first=Victoria|last2=Minkler|first2=Meredith|year=2006|title=Promoting Environmental Health Policy Through Community Based Participatory Research: A Case Study from Harlem, New York|url=|journal=Journal of Urban Health|volume=83|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[West Harlem Environmental Action|West Harlem Environmental ACTion Inc.]] and Columbia University's Centre for Children's Environmental Health studied the effects of [[diesel exhaust|diesel pollution]] on the environment, and provided the results to the government, which transformed their environmental health policies to accommodate the results.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Respiratory health was the main concern for the policy change, which was traced back to particular matter and carbon within local diesel sources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Harlem reconstructed their bus fleet system by using clean diesel and installation of permanent air monitors to control the amount of air pollution created by buses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Sao Paulo, Brazil ====
The metropolitan area of São Paulo has dealt with issues of air and water pollution created by motor vehicles and inadequate treatment of sewage.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Carolyn|last2=Akerman|first2=Marco|last3=Maia|first3=Paulo|year=1995|title=Health and Environment in Sao Paulo, Brazil: Methods of Data Linkage and Questions of Policy|url=|journal=World Health Statistics Quarterly|volume=48|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious and parasitic diseases, circulatory diseases, and respiratory problems have all been a concern in São Paulo.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The city uses data linkages (HEADLAMP) between the environment and health in order to influence future policies. [[Pollution|Air pollution]] has been improved marginally in regards to industrial pollution, but motor vehicle traffic creates the largest amount of sulphur dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Water treatment plants have not grown to accommodate the growing population, but piped water and sanitation facilities have been expanding.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Impacts of the environment on health have been felt more in the poorer areas of the city compared to the wealthier sectors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== State level ===

==== Developed nations ====

===== Canada =====
Canada has dealt with [[Lead poisoning|lead exposure]] for decades, decreasing since the 1970s with the phasing out of [[lead paint]] and gasoline.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Environment and Health: An Introduction for Nurses|last=|first=|publisher=Canadian Nurses Association|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55119-214-7|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been a decrease in lead poisoning, there is still cases of exposure to lead from paint and old pipes in homes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Lead exposure is more harmful for pregnant women and children, making them more prone to poisoning. Lead was listed as a toxic substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/toxiques-toxics/Default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=98E80CC6-1&amp;xml=D048E4B9-B103-4652-8DCF-AC148D29FB7D|title=Lead|last=Government of Canada|first=|date=2014|website=Environment and Climate Change Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government implemented regulations against lead to foster a healthy environment.

The First Nations and Inuit Health Branch attempts to ensure that these communities are given equal access to health services comparable to those in similar locations of Canada.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Nations Environmental Public Health Program|last=Minister of Health|first=|publisher=Health Canada|year=2008|isbn=978-0-662-48257-4|location=Ottawa: ON|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health Canada]] defines a health environment to include safe water, food, maintained housing and facilities, disposal of waste, and the ability to prevent and control disease.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Environmental Public Health Program is implemented in several aboriginal communities, customized to specific needs including [[food security]], clean water sources, and improving poor housing conditions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== United States =====
The United States has several policies to deal with chemical exposure, air quality, energy, oil pollution, and safe drinking water. Public exposure to chemicals can have effects on the body including cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma and obesity.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shibley|first=G|year=2014|title=Using Law and Policy to Address Chemical Exposures: Examining Federal and State Approaches|url=|journal=Capital University Law Review|volume=42|pages=97–141|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who work in industrial and agriculture sectors are more prone to exposure, but children, pregnant women, and those with chronic medical conditions are also at a higher risk of exposure.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The United States has implemented the [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976|Toxic Substances Control Ac]]t to deal with chemical exposure and ensure chemicals are safe and citizens are minimally affected.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

The EPA is developing clean diesel fuels and biodiesel to deal with air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nexus of Biofuels, Climate Change, and Human Health|last=Pool|first=Robert|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-309-29241-2|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of emissions can affect respiratory health, risk of cancer, and increased medical costs of the population. In 2013, transportation was more than half on carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides produced in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/vehicles-air-pollution-and-human-health#.WNx-jlK-KCQ|title=Vehicles, Air Pollution, and Human Health|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has also implemented vehicle emission standards to cut pollution from motor vehicles.

===== Norway =====
Norway has several environmental regulations dealing with pollution, air quality, and water.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Norway Environment, Health &amp; Safety Profile and Checklist|last=|first=|publisher=The Isosceles Group|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also policies in place to protect citizen's health and well-being in general, and in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Workplaces must ensure they have measures to prevent or contain pollution, along with voluntarily preparing environmental impact statements that are available to pollution control authority.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If facilities produce carbon dioxide emissions, then they must apply for a discharge permit, and have to report yearly emissions to pollution control authorities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Norway attempts to protect its water sources from contamination by ensuring facilities implement measures that cause the least amount of harm or inconvenience to the public or corporations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government puts policies in place to ensure the safety of employee health at all levels, and takes action on any hazards within the workplace that would put health at risk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Turkey =====
Air quality in Turkey is currently at levels that are considered harmful to human health. Lung capacity growth of children is diminished in areas of high air pollution, which can increase chances of [[Respiratory disease|lung disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Air Pollution and Health in Turkey: Facts, Figures and Recommendations|last=|first=|publisher=The Health and Environmental Alliance|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels, Belgium|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risks to lung health include asthma, [[Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease]], lung cancer, and emphysema which can be intensified by poor air quality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Coal power in Turkey has been a critical factor of air pollution.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The power plants release [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which can last in the environment for up to forty years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Turkish Medical Association expressed concerns about increasing the amount of [[Fossil fuel power station|coal plants]] in Turkey, and suggested a phasing out of coal plants to increase air quality in the country to safe levels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===== Germany =====
The Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Health have coordinated with agencies and scientific institutions to understand environmental health issues.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forbat|first=Julien|year=2015|title=Environmental Health Policies in Europe: Successes and Failures in Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium|url=|journal=International Journal of Environment and Health|volume=7|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has had a long history of environmental health policies in order to maintain the well being of citizens.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Policies are based on scientific research and collaboration between ministries, but environmental health policies are often not on the policy agenda since it is relatively well controlled.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

In 2011, policies were adopted to phase out [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in the country after [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=549|title=Germany: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|last=Smith|first=Brett|date=2015|website=AZO Cleantech|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air pollution increased to the highest levels since the 1980s due to increased coal burning, putting the population at risk for chronic diseases associated with air pollution.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Mining in the country had also resulted in water pollution that affects human and animal health.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Coal mining has been linked to environmental and health issues, leading the government to close all mining pits by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/the-rise-and-fall-of-germanys-coal-mining-industry/a-2331545|title=The Rise and Fall of Germany's Coal Mining Industry|last=|first=|date=2007|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has been a leading actor in dealing with carbon emissions related to climate change through policies to reduce use of resources and efficient use of [[Renewable energy|renewable energy sources]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Developing nations ====
===== China =====
China has large-scale mineral resources and is one of the biggest producers and consumers of metals and metalloids.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhiyuan|last2=Ma|first2=Zongwei|last3=Jan van der Kuijp|first3=Tsering|last4=Yuan|first4=Zengwei|last5=Huang|first5=Lei|year=2013|title=A review of soil heavymetal pollution from mines in China: Pollution and health risk assessment|url=|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=468|pages=843–853|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, they have seen an increase in pollution and degradation of [[natural resource]]s, putting the health of the population at risk. Air pollution is the biggest environmental cause of [[Pulmonary heart disease|cardiopulmonary disease]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Kyungho|last2=Paek|first2=Domyung|last3=Wu|first3=Tangchun|last4=Chan|first4=Chang-Chaun|last5=Onchang|first5=Rattapon|last6=Padungtod|first6=Chantana|last7=Koizumi|first7=Akio|year=2012|title=Asian Forum on Environmental Health Policy: Challenges and Perspectives of Environmental Health Problems in the Region for the Next 30 Years|url=|journal=Environmental Health and Preventative Medicine|volume=17|pages=170–172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asian countries are looking to research environmental factors to better understand how it affects health.

China's mines have produced heavy metal polluted soils that pose a risk to human health.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Those living around the area of the mines are especially at risk of the [[carcinogen]]ic and non-carcinogenic risks of the soil. The main dangers come from sewage irrigation, sludge application, mining, and smelting operations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This pollution affects the human body by harming the nervous, skeletal, circulatory, enzymatic, endocrine, and immune system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More chronic effects can include cancer, bone fractures, hypertension, lesions, and neuropathy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; China has conducted very few health risk assessment studies of all mines in the country, so full health risks associated with the mines are unknown.

===== India =====
In the mining communities of India, the population is at risk of respiratory illness and malaria.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saha|first=Shubhayu|last2=Pattanayak|first2=Subhrendu|last3=Sills|first3=Erin|last4=Singha|first4=Ashok|year=2011|title=Under-mining health: Environmental justice and mining in India|url=|journal=Health and Place|volume=17|pages=140–148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who live closer to the mines reported higher incidences of these illnesses. This has influenced environmental policy because mining is a profitable business that can be privatized, but with adverse effects on health they have been required to balance human and ecological health.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

India has also seen difficulty providing access to drinking water and sanitation services in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattanayak|first=Subhrendu|last2=Poulos|first2=Christine|last3=Yang|first3=Jui-Chen|last4=Patil|first4=Sumeet|year=2010|title=How valuable are environmental health interventions? Evaluation of water and sanitation programmes in India|url=|journal=Bull World Health Organ|volume=88|pages=535–542|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community-driven development|Community demand-driven programmes]] have been implemented since 2004 which required improvements in water supply, sanitation, and hygiene.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This was an effort to improve children's health, and reduce diarrhoea and water-related illnesses.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Only 21% of the rural population was using a private tap, the other percentage commuted to obtain water. Only 12% used private toilets, the others travelled to a main sanitation site.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The implemented program was able to increase access to filtered water, private toilets, and increased hygiene.

===== Nigeria =====
In 2014, Nigeria implemented the WHO Country Cooperation Strategy to deal with Millennium Development Goals. A strategic objective of the policy was to assess health effects of environmental risks by conducting health impact assessments.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=WHO Country Cooperation Strategy 2014-2019|last=WHO Regional Office for Africa|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978 92 9 023207 0|location=Nigeria|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also plans to increase countries abilities to deal with environmental emergencies including climate change, air pollution, and radiation that could be harmful to health.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The strategy focuses on creating policies to improve medicine, [[Universal health care|universal access to health care]], and reduction in diseases caused by the environment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

===== Kenya =====
In 2016, the Kenya government introduced the new Kenya Environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Policy.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kenya environmental Sanitation and Hygiene Policy|last=Ministry of Health|first=|publisher=Republic of Kenya|year=2016|isbn=|location=Nairobi, Kenya|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor sanitation has been a leading cause of mortality in the country. The new policy created a timeline from 2016-2030 in which guidelines were set for state and non-state actors to follow to improve sanitation and create a better quality of life.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The aim is to have universal access to [[sanitation]] by 2030. This includes all public places and dwellings having access to sustainable toilets, free from odours, and reducing hygiene related diseases.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Currently, about 72% of toilets in rural Kenya are dug pits and open defecation occurs. The amount of sanitation sewers is very low, with most not being treated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Sewage bursts and discharge of raw sewage from plants is a common practice, contaminating the earth and water supply.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Air pollution in urban centres is also a concern. In Nairobi, pollution levels are three times higher than World Health Organization recommendations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Urbanization]] is projected to increase in the next decade, so the government has created [[Kenya Vision 2030]] in attempts to deal with sanitation practices in the country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Kenya Visions wants to make Kenya a newly industrialized, middle-income country with a high quality of life for its citizens.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== International level ===
==== World Health Organization (WHO) ====
In 2006, the [[World Health Organization]] created a study on specific diseases and injuries affected by environmental risks, and which regions of the world are at the most risk of injury.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Preventing Disease Through Healthy Environments: Towards an Estimate of the Environmental Burden of Disease|last=Pruss-Ustun|first=A.|last2=Corvalan|first2=C.|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2006|isbn=92 4 159382 2|location=Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO studies the effects and supports the design of preventative and health strategies in countries to reduce environmental health risks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Environmental factors such as air and water quality, patterns of energy use, and patterns of land use can directly and indirectly affect health of citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; WHO's findings found that 24% of global disease and 23% of deaths are caused by environmental factors (although they vary from developing countries with 25%, and developed with 17%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several diseases found in the study included [[Diarhhea|diarrhea]], respiratory infections, malaria, and unintentional injuries caused by environmental factors that can be modified by policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Infectious diseases is a higher burden in developing countries than in developed, attributed to more exposure to environmental risks and lack of access to health care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Diseases attributed to environmental factors decrease with development to either eradication, or to levels comparable to developed regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Children are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. WHO found that children under the age of five are more prone to diseases from environmental factors than the rest of the total population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

WHO has supported the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals to provide sustainable access to safe drinking water. The benefits to the MDG's is savings in health care, economic productivity, and fewer lives lost from diseases caused by contaminated water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== United Nations ====
In 2000, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) were created at the UN Millennium Declaration. Leaders from all over the world gathered in aims to reduce poverty by 2015 in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=B|last2=Taylor|first2=S|year=2017|title=Squaring the circle: health as a bridge to global solidarity in the Sustainable Development Goals|url=|journal=Archives Disease Child|volume=0|pages=1–4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight goals were created in order to deal with extreme poverty due to climate, shelter, and disease, and ensure everyone has the right to health, education, shelter, and security.

[[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDG) were created to replace the MDG, which are to be reached by 2030. These goals are aimed at both developing and developed countries, using environmental, social, and economic dimensions to meet goals.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abel|first=Guy|year=2016|title=Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals leads to lower world population growth|url=|journal=PNAS|volume=113|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals 3, 6, and 11 affect environmental health policy. Goal 3 is to ensure good health and well-being, which affects other goals. If environmental goals are achieved, the health of the country will be able to improve by reducing disease and death.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Goal 11 of creating sustainable cities and communities is important to environmental health policy since urbanization is a big concern that can affect resources including water, which affects the health of the population.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Goal 6 aims to provide clean water and sanitation in countries.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Wastewater treatment in countries is an issue that the SDG goals are trying to influence countries to improve and provide better access to clean drinking water and sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik|first=Omar|last2=Hsu|first2=Angel|last3=Johnson|first3=Laura|last4=Sherbinin|first4=Alex|year=2015|title=A global indicator of wastewater treatment to inform the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)|url=|journal=Environmental Science and Policy|volume=48|pages=172–185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7695">'''Ethnic media''' is media fashioned with a particular [[ethnic minority]] group or ethnic minority community in mind.

== Definition ==
Academic Yu Shi tenders an operational definition for ethnic media: “Ethnic media are often regarded as media ''by and for'' ethnics in a host country with content in ethnic languages."&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2009, p. 599). Re-evaluating the 'alternative' role of ethnic media in the US: the case of Chinese-language press and working-class women readers. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi also adds, ethnic media “can be published by big ethnic media groups and by small organic ethnic communities”, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2010). Audio Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioner Inga Buchbinder of New America Media adds, “Our organization defines it most as a publication, whether that’s news, television, radio, online, print, magazine--any sort of publication that caters to a specific ethnic community. And it could be in-language…or it could be bilingual that reaches a very specific community.”&lt;ref&gt;Buchbinder, Inga. (2010). Audio Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to news, television, radio, online, print, and magazine outlets that qualify as ethnic media, academic John D.H. Downing adds musical culture and forms of religious expression to the ethnic media mix. Downing finds, “these may, along with language and dialect, act as a media force somewhere between shock absorption and psychic validation in the often fraught atmosphere between the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities.”&lt;ref&gt;Downing, John. (2001, p. 82). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Downing finds that ethnic media tends to circulate, “within at least three different sectors, namely, indigenous nations and communities, recent migrants…and settled subordinate ethnic groups.”&lt;ref&gt;Downing, John. (2001, p. 81). Radical Media: Rebellious communication and social movements. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic media as alternative media ==

Analogous to the debate as to ''what'' qualifying factors constitute [[alternative media]], the domain of ''what'' qualifying factors that classify a respective ethnic media outlet as an alternative media outlet is also, at play.

Thus, ethnic media is not by definitional default alternative media.

Again, the work of academics and grassroots practitioners, such as John D.H. Downing, Yu Shi, Clemencia Rodriguez, and Inga Buchbinder of New America Media provide definitional assistance for this complex and overdetermined zone. Discernment of whether or not a respective ethnic media outlet qualifies as an alternative media outlet is dependent upon the outstanding contextual information, and should be assessed on a case by case evaluation.

Yu Shi’s work puts forth a seven-pronged test for evaluating the “alternative media role” of ethnic media in the United States: “reference has to be made to their (1) individual place of origin, (2) historical evolution, (3) production process, (4) distribution pattern, (5) ownership, (6) self-identity (non-profit or for-profit; alternative or commercial; or in between), and (7) connection to power groups in local and transnational settings.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Yu. (2009, p. 600). Re-evaluating the 'alternative' role of ethnic media in the US: the case of Chinese-language press and working-class women readers. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind''''' (1997) is a book about the evolution of the intelligent and conscious human mind by [[biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]].

==Overview==
In this book Cohen and Stewart give their ideas on how the sentient human being evolved. Various chapters discuss scientific and
philosophical ideas such as [[emergence]] and chaos, [[free will]], perception versus reality, objectivity versus subjectivity, [[self-awareness]], the ego and id, [[groupthink]], and [[extelligence]]. A theme is that the traditional [[reductionist]] approach of trying to understand things as interaction of simpler things can not alone explain such complex concepts as intelligence or culture. To better understand them one has to consider also the context in which they have evolved and the fact that the evolution is a recursive process, often changing the context so that previously unseen evolutionary paths became available. The authors claim that intelligence is an inevitable result of letting evolution progress for long enough.

Topics are illustrated with humorous science fiction snippets dealing with a hypothetical alien intelligence, the Zarathustrians, whom Cohen and Stewart use as metaphors of the human mind itself, an alternative [[evolution]] story, and various philosophical concepts.

'''Gender pay gap in India''' refers to the difference in earnings between women and men in the paid employment and labor market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutta|first=Puja|date=2005|title=Accounting for Wage Inequality in India|url=http://www.isleijle.org/ijle/IssuePdf/d7ce3acf-12eb-4ead-932a-f8de5bf31ead.pdf|journal=The Indian Journal of Labour Economics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the year 2013, the [[gender pay gap]] in India was estimated to be 24.81%.&lt;ref name="wageindicator"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Pay Gap in the Formal Sector: 2006 - 2013(September, 2013)|url=http://www.wageindicator.org/documents/publicationslist/publications-2013/gender-pay-gap-in-formal-sector-in-india-2006-2013|publisher=Wage Indicator Data Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, while analyzing the level of female participation in the economy, this report slots India as one of the bottom 10 countries on its list. Thus, in addition to unequal pay, there is also unequal representation, because while women constitute almost half the Indian population (about 48% of the total), their representation in the work force amounts to only about one-fourth of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012) Planning Commission, Government of India|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/11thf.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and contributing factors ==

The female labor participation rate in India from 1901 to 1951 was between 28 and 34 percent, which is higher than the level of participation observed in 1990.&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/6641/1/Gender_Discrimination_and_Growth_Theory_and_Evidence_from_India.pdf|title=Gender Discrimination and Growth: Theory and Evidence from India (January, 2004)|date=2004|publisher=London School of Economics|last1=Esteve-Volart|first1=Berta}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rate also varies from state to state. Regions in northern India (which have been observed to be more patriarchal) have lower participation rates for women than the states in southern India, where women have more freedom to participate in the formal economy.&lt;ref name="LSE" /&gt; [[Self Employed Women's Association|SEWA]] (the Self Employed Women’s Association) recently found that the average wage of women workers was Rs. 1815 while the average wage for men was Rs. 3842.

Some of the main factors that contribute to the existing gender pay gap in India are:

===Occupational segregation===
The rate of female participation in the paid labor market is generally low, and is primarily concentrated in rural areas in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name="IMF" /&gt; In rural north India, it has been observed that labor is divided sharply on the basis of gender. Certain activities in agriculture have been assigned specifically to women, like drying and storing the grain, while other tasks like plowing and harvesting are only performed by men.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martha C. Nussbaum, Jonathan Glover|first1=Martha Chen|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhLgdK84Ll8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=india&amp;f=false|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="justjobs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewan|first1=Sabina|title=Closing the Gender wage gap in Indian Agriculture|url=http://justjobsnetwork.org/wp-content/pubs/reports/8.pdf|publisher=JustJobs Network|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female labor participation in India has been observed to be higher in sectors involving personal services and care work, and is also higher in informal sectors, especially in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Status of Women" /&gt;

===Cultural barriers===
While social and cultural norms vary from state to state within India, one commonality that has been observed is the exclusion of women from the paid labor market and status based segregation of labor.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt; Ironically, women from higher castes faced more difficulty when they tried to obtain paid work, even if their survival depended on it.&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;{{Rp|45}} In interviews conducted with widows from rural North India, they stated that if attempts were made to seek gainful employment outside their homes, they would be forced to give up their property rights and made to leave the villages they live in, indicating that paid work was not a feasible option even to sustain themselves due to the existing [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name="Chen" /&gt;{{Rp|49}} Because childcare is viewed primarily as a woman's job, women often take part-time jobs or take time off during their careers to care for their families. When women return to work after a break, they are paid lower wages than their male colleagues. Women employed full-time ordinarily already earned 34% less than men, but when compared to part-time working women, the pay gap further increased as they earned almost 42% less than men.&lt;ref name="wageindicator finalreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/files/gender-pay-gap-oct-2012-1|title=Gender Pay Gap in the Formal Sector: Preliminary Evidence from Paycheck India Data|date=September 2012|publisher=WageIndicator Data Report|last1=Leeja Anand|first1=Biju Varkkey, Rupa Korde,}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|13}} Additionally, even if women do not have children, it has been observed that they still face pay discrimination as they are viewed as potential mothers, who may require a break from work in the near future.&lt;ref name="wageindicator finalreport" /&gt;

===Education and training===
The literacy rate for women in India is far lower than the rate for men, and it has been observed that many girls drop out of school and fail to fully complete their education.&lt;ref name="Status of Women" /&gt;{{Rp|76}} Investment in education and training has also been strongly in favor of men as they are brought up with the expectation of being bread earners, and hence this investment is considered necessary for their success, while women are instead viewed as "future homemakers" for whom education may not be as essential.&lt;ref name="Understanding GI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rustagi|first1=Preet|title=Understanding Gender Inequalities in Wages and Incomes in India|url=http://www.isleijle.org/ijle/IssuePdf/6d6c974d-9da9-4a33-a6d0-1a2e193d58e0.pdf|publisher=The Indian Journal of Labour Economics, Vol. 48, No. 2|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|325}}

===Unpaid work===
According to the [[Human Development Report]] 1995, women spend about two-thirds of their working time on unpaid work, while men spend only one-fourth of their time towards unpaid labor.&lt;ref name="invisible heart"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Invisible Heart— Care and the Global Economy|url=http://akgul.bilkent.edu.tr/hdr/1999/en/pdf/hdr_1999_ch3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated in India that women on average work twenty-one more hours than men during each week.&lt;ref name="invisible heart" /&gt; Agriculture currently accounts for over two-thirds of the current employment in India, but most of the work women contribute to this sector is not accounted for or officially documented.&lt;ref name="Status of Women"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anil Kumar Mishra|first1=Tauffiqu Ahamad, Jitendra Kumar Pandey,|title=The Status of Women Workers in the Unorganized Sector|url=http://www.newmanpublication.com/admin/issue/br/Untitled3.pdf|publisher=Newman International Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, Volume 1, Issue 12|pages=72–79|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative protections ==

===International obligations===
India has been a permanent member of the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Governing Body from 1922. In September 1958, India ratified the C100 Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), which addressed the issue of equal pay between men and women for work of equal value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C100 - Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), Article 1|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312245}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convention requires all member states to direct their national laws and policies towards guaranteeing equal remuneration to all workers, regardless of gender. In an attempt to ensure compliance with this convention and in response to the [[Towards Equality|Report]] by the Committee on status of women in India, the government enacted the Equal Remuneration Act.&lt;ref name="Chapter2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Pay for Equal Work in India - A Socio-legal Imperative|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/28562/9/09_chapter%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 ===
In 1976, the Equal Remuneration Act was passed with the aim of providing equal remuneration to men and women workers and to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender in all matters relating to employment and employment opportunities. This legislation not only provides women with a right to demand equal pay, but any inequality with respect to recruitment processes, job training, promotions, and transfers within the organization can also be challenged under this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 4 and 5, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 |url=http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421031623/http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |archivedate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its scope does not extend to situations where: (i) a woman is attempting to comply with the requirements of laws giving women special treatment; and (ii) a woman is being accorded special treatment on account of the birth of a child, or the terms and conditions relating to retirement, marriage or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 15, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 |url=http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421031623/http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |archivedate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and individual employers can both be held accountable to maintain the standards prescribed under this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 11, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 |url=http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421031623/http://pblabour.gov.in/pdf/acts_rules/equal_remuneration_act_1976.pdf |archivedate=April 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In various cases, the [[Supreme Court of India]] has also held that discrimination on the basis of gender only arises when men and women perform the same work or work of a similar nature. However, it clarified that a flexible approach is required to be taken while deciding which kinds of work may be similar by considering the duties actually performed as a part of the job, and not the duties potentially capable of being performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Audrey D’ Costa &amp; Another|journal=(1987) 2 SCC 469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional protections ===
As part of its [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles of State Policy]], the [[Constitution of India]] through Article 39 envisages that all states ideally direct their policy towards securing equal pay for equal work for both men and women, and also ensuring that men and women have the right to an adequate means of livelihood. While these [[Directive Principles in India|Directive Principles]] are not enforceable by any court of law, they are crucial to the governance of the country and a state is duty bound to consider them while enacting laws.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Devi|first1=Kovuru|title=Women's Equality in India: A Myth Or Reality?|date=January 1, 2000|isbn=81-7141-563-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LS8wJlfjUcUC&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While “equal pay for equal work” is not expressly a constitutional right, it has been read into the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] through the interpretation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 – which guarantee equality before the law, protection against discrimination and equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.&lt;ref name="Myth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of India, Articles 14 - 16 |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of India]] has also declared this to be a constitutional goal, available to every individual and capable of being attained through the enforcement of their fundamental rights set out in Articles 14 through 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Union of India v. Dineshan K.K.,|publisher=(2008) 1 SCC 586}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a popular [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] decision, the conditions of employment of the air-hostesses of Air India was challenged. The terms of employment required the mandatory retirement of females: (i) upon attaining the age of 33; (ii) if they were married within four years of service; or (iii) upon their first pregnancy. The court however struck down these provisions and held them to be arbitrary and discriminatory as it violated Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Air India vs. Nargesh Mirza,|publisher=AIR 1981 SC 1829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancillary legislation ===
While legislation like the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 and the Factories Act, 1948 do not directly address the issue of equal pay for equal work, they provide certain additional benefits a woman can claim. The Maternity Benefit Act applies to all establishments with more than ten employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (Act No. 53 of 1961), Section 2|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/678/maternitybenefitsact1961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in states where the Employees’ State Insurance Act applies, employers no longer have any liability under the Maternity Benefit Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papola|first1=T.S.|title=An Assessment of the Labour Statistics System in India, 2014|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---sro-new_delhi/documents/publication/wcms_342333.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this Act, a pregnant woman worker is entitled to 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, and six weeks in case of miscarriage or termination of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (Act No. 53 of 1961), Section 4 and 6|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/678/maternitybenefitsact1961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant women also have the right to not perform physically arduous work, which may affect their pregnancy, and no deductions can be made from their wages because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 (Act No. 53 of 1961), Sections 4 and 13|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/678/maternitybenefitsact1961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as per the Factories Act, employers are required to provide childcare for children under 6 years old at all worksites that employ over 30 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Factories Act, 1948 (Act No. 63 of 1948), Section 48|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/663/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==

=== By state ===
The gender pay gap varies across Indian states, and is the highest in the following states:&lt;ref name="wageindicator" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! State !! Women's earnings as a percentage of men's earnings
|-
| [[Bihar]] || 63%
|-
| [[Chhattisgarh]] || 48%
|-
| [[Assam]] || 48%
|-
| [[Himachal Pradesh]] || 45%
|-
| [[Rajasthan]] and [[Kerala]] || 44%
|}

[[Uttarakhand]] on the other hand is the state with the lowest percentage of gender pay gap, with females earning only 9% less than men. [[Punjab]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] are also states with a lower gender pay gap, following with 10% and 15%, respectively.&lt;ref name="wageindicator" /&gt;

=== By education ===
The gender pay gap in India increases with an increase in educational qualifications. While comparing men and women who had only completed high-school level education, it was observed that women earned 10.34% less than men.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Women who had gone to college for four to five years or who had received advanced degrees earned around 30% less than their male counterparts. With an increase in the level of education, where women had obtained a [[Master's degree]] of a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] equivalent, it was observed that the gender pay gap ranged between 44% to 46%.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

== Impact ==
Research suggests that when countries are able to raise the female labor participation rate, this stands to benefit the entire economy.&lt;ref name="IMF"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff Discussion Note|first1=IMF|title=Women, Work, and the Economy: Macroeconomic Gains from Gender Equity|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2013/sdn1310.pdf|publisher=International Monetary Fund|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from potential [[GDP]] growth, equal employment opportunities for women could also result in increased growth and profitability in the private sector.&lt;ref name="IFC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Investing in Women’s Employment|url=http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/5f6e5580416bb016bfb1bf9e78015671/InvestinginWomensEmployment.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|publisher=International Finance Corporation, World Bank Group|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where the population is aging quickly, an increase in the female labor participation rate would help offset the negative effects of a declining workforce.&lt;ref name="IMF" /&gt; It is also important to note that women in India perform 9.8 times the amount of labor in the unpaid sector either through household duties or care work. If this work was measured and valued, it was estimated by [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] that it would contribute 0.3 trillion dollars to India’s total economic output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Power of Parity: Advancing Women’s Equality in India|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Eve spinning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A depiction of an English woman c. 1170 using a [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and [[distaff]], while caring for a young child]]
Medieval England was a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]] and the lives of women were heavily influenced by contemporary beliefs about gender and authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mate | first = Mavis E. | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Mate | editor-first = Mavis | title = Trade and economic developments, 1450-1550: the experience of Kent, Surrey and Sussex | pages = 2&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Woodbridge, UK Rochester, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781843831891 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mate | first = Mavis | contribution = Overseas trade | editor-last = Mate E. | editor-first = Mavis | title = Trade and economic developments, 1450-1550: the experience of Kent, Surrey and Sussex | pages = 97&amp;ndash;99 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Woodbridge, UK Rochester, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781843831891 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position of women varied according to factors including their [[social class]]; whether they were unmarried, married, widowed or remarried; and in which part of the country they lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Johns | first = Susan M. | contribution = Power and portrayal | editor-last = Johns | editor-first = Susan M. | title = Noblewomen, aristocracy, and power in the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman realm | page = 14 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780719063053 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henrietta Leyser argues that women had much informal power in their homes and communities, although they were of officially subordinate to men. She identifies a deterioration the status of women in the Middle Ages, although they retained strong roles in culture and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leyser | first = Henrietta | title = Medieval women: a social history of women in England, 450-1500 | publisher = Phoenix Giant | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9781842126219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant gender inequities persisted throughout the period, as women typically had more limited life-choices, access to employment and trade, and legal rights than men. After the Norman invasion, the position of women in society changed. The rights and roles of women became more sharply defined, in part as a result of the development of the feudal system and the expansion of the English legal system; some women benefited from this, while others lost out.  The rights of widows were formally laid down in law by the end of the twelfth century, clarifying the right of free women to own property, but this did not necessarily prevent women from being [[Forced marriage|forcibly remarried]] against their wishes.  The growth of governmental institutions under a succession of bishops reduced the role of queens and their households in formal government. Married or widowed noblewomen remained significant cultural and religious patrons and played an important part in political and military events, even if chroniclers were uncertain if this was appropriate behaviour.  As in earlier centuries, most women worked in agriculture, but here roles became more clearly gendered, with [[ploughing]] and managing the fields defined as men's work, for example, and [[Dairy farming|dairy production]] becoming dominated by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Mate | first = Mavis E. | contribution = Trade within and outside the Market-Place | editor-last = Mate | editor-first = Mavis | title = Trade and economic developments, 1450-1550: the experience of Kent, Surrey and Sussex | pages = 21&amp;ndash;27 | publisher = Boydell Press | location = Woodbridge, UK Rochester, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781843831891 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johns | first = Susan M. | title = Noblewomen, aristocracy, and power in the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman realm | pages = 22&amp;ndash;25, 30, 69, 195&amp;ndash;96 14 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780719063053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times, women had responsibility for brewing and selling the ale that men all drank.  By 1600, men had taken over that role. The reasons include commercial growth, gild formation, changing technologies, new regulations, and widespread prejudices that associated female brewsters with drunkenness and disorder.  The taverns still use women to serve it, a low-status, low-skilled, and poorly remunerated tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bennett | first = Judith M. | title = Ale, beer and brewsters in England: women's work in a changing world, 1300-1600 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780195073904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern period==

===Tudor era===
{{Further|Tudor period#Daily life in the period}}

[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait..jpg|thumb|250px|''The Procession Picture'', c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]
While the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility—especially royal wives and queens—historians have recovered scant documentation about the average lives of women. There has, however, been extensive statistical analysis of demographic and population data which includes women, especially in their childbearing roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Minna F. | title = Reconstructing our past: reflections on Tudor women | journal = International Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 133&amp;ndash;158 | publisher = Eden Press Women's Publications | date = 1978 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X2IpAAAAYAAJ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''On the social and demographic history see'': {{cite book | last = Palliser | first = D.

The role of women in society was, for the historical era, relatively unconstrained; Spanish and Italian visitors to England commented regularly, and sometimes caustically, on the freedom that women enjoyed in England, in contrast to their home cultures. England had more well-educated upper class women than was common anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shapiro | first = Susan C. | title = Feminists in Elizabethan England | journal = [[History Today]] | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 703&amp;ndash;711 | date = 1977 | url = http://www.historytoday.com/susan-c-shapiro/feminists-elizabethan-england | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Youings | first = Joyce A. | title = Sixteenth-century England | publisher = A.

The Queen's [[Elizabeth I of England#Marriage question|marital status]] was a major political and diplomatic topic. It also entered into the popular culture. Elizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John N. King |title=Queen Elizabeth I: Representations of the Virgin Queen |journal=[[Renaissance Quarterly]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=30–74 |jstor=2861792 |doi=10.2307/2861792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, "And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Haigh | first = Christopher | contribution = The Queen and the throne | editor-last = Haigh | editor-first = Christopher | title = Elizabeth I | page = 23 | publisher = Longman | location = London New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780582437548 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duc d'Alençon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Doran | first = Susan | title = Juno versus Diana: The treatment of Elizabeth I's marriage in plays and entertainments, 1561–1581 | journal = [[The Historical Journal]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 257&amp;ndash;274 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00019427 | jstor = 2639984 | date = June 1995 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0018246X00019427 | ref = harv | postscript = .| doi-broken-date = 2018-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to her father's emphasis on masculinity and physical prowess, Elizabeth emphasized the maternalism theme, saying often that she was married to her kingdom and subjects. She explained "I keep the good will of all my husbands — my good people — for if they did not rest assured of some special love towards them, they would not readily yield me such good obedience,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Agnes Strickland|Strickland, Agnes]] (1910), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=cF0NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA424 Elizabeth]", in  {{cite book | editor-last = Strickland | editor-first = Agnes | editor-link = Agnes Strickland | title = The life of Queen Elizabeth | page = 424 | publisher = J.M.

===Medical care===
Although medical men did not approve, women healers played a significant role in the medical care of Londoners from cradle to grave during the Elizabethan era. They were hired by parishes and hospitals, as well as by private families. They played central roles in the delivery of nursing care as well as medical, pharmaceutical, and surgical services throughout the city as part of organized systems of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Harkness | first = Deborah E. | author-link = Deborah E. Harkness | title = A view from the streets: women and medical work in Elizabethan London | journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]] | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 52&amp;ndash;85 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University]] | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2008.0001 | date = Spring 2008 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2008.0001 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's medical roles continue to expand in the 17th century, especially regarding care of paupers. They operated nursing homes for the homeless and sick poor, and also looked after abandoned and orphaned children, pregnant women, and lunatics. After 1700, the workhouse movement undermined many of these roles and the parish nurse became restricted largely to the rearing and nursing of children and infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boulton | first = Jeremy | title = Welfare systems and the parish nurse in early modern London, 1650–1725 | journal = Family &amp; Community History | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 127&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1179/175138107x234413 | date = 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/175138107x234413 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Over ninety percent of English women (and adults, in general) entered marriage in this era at an average age of about [[Western European marriage pattern|25–26 years for the bride]] and 27–28 years for the groom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cressy | first = David | contribution = Holy matrimony | editor-last = Cressy | editor-first = David | title = Birth, marriage, and death: ritual, religion, and the life-cycle in Tudor and Stuart England | page = 285 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780198201687 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the nobility and gentry, the average was around 19-21 for brides and 24-26 for grooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Young | first = Bruce W. | contribution = Family life in Shakespeare's world | editor-last = Young | editor-first = Bruce W. | title = Family life in the age of Shakespeare | page = 41 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780313342394 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many city and townswomen married for the first time in their thirties and forties and it was not unusual for orphaned young women to delay marriage until the late twenties or early thirties to help support their younger siblings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Greer | first = Germaine | author-link = Germaine Greer | title = Shakespeare's wife | publisher = Emblem Editions | location = Toronto | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780771035838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly a fourth of all English brides were pregnant at their weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cressy | first = David | contribution = Childbed attendants | editor-last = Cressy | editor-first = David | title = Birth, marriage, and death: ritual, religion, and the life-cycle in Tudor and Stuart England | page = 74 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780198201687 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witchcraft===
{{Further|Witch trials in early modern Scotland}}
In England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland there was a succession of [[Witchcraft Acts]] starting with  Henry VIII's Act of 1542. They governed witchcraft and providing penalties for its practice, or—in 1735—rather for pretending to practise it.

In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kamerick | first = Kathleen | title = Tanglost of Wales: magic and adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500 | journal = [[Sixteenth Century Journal]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 25&amp;ndash;45 | publisher = [[Truman State University]] | date = Spring 2013 | url = https://www.escj.org/article/tanglost-wales-magic-and-adultery-court-chancery-circa-1500 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536-1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parkin | first = Sally | title = Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales | journal = [[Social History (journal)|Social History]] | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;318 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03071020600746636 | jstor = 4287362 | date = August 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03071020600746636 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. He set out the much stiffer [[Witchcraft Acts|Witchcraft Act of 1604]], which made it a felony under common law. One goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lolis | first = Thomas G. | title = The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the homosocial refashioning of the witches' community | journal = Clio: A Journal of Literature, History, and the Philosophy of History | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 322&amp;ndash;337 | publisher = [[Indiana University]], [[Purdue University]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] | date = Summer 2008 | url = https://www.ipfw.edu/dotAsset/99968.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlightenment attitudes after 1700 made a mockery of beliefs in witches. The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Lizanne (2016), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=EK3tCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 Appendix II: The Witchcraft Act, 1735]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Henderson | editor-first = Lizanne | title = Witchcraft and folk belief in the age of enlightenment: Scotland 1670-1740 | pages = 330&amp;ndash;331 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781137313249 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] revolutionized the study of witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Keith | author-link = Keith Thomas (historian) | title = Religion and the decline of magic: studies in popular beliefs in sixteenth and seventeenth century England | publisher = Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson | location = London | year = 1971 | isbn = 9780297819721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Barry | first = Jonathan | contribution = Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft | editor-last1 = Barry | editor-first1 = Jonathan | editor-last2 = Hester | editor-first2 = Marianne | editor-last3 = Roberts | editor-first3 = Gareth  | title = Witchcraft in early modern Europe: studies in culture and belief | pages = 1&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780521552240 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacFarlane | first = Alan | title = Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: a regional and comparative study | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | year = 1970 | isbn = 9780710064035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garrett | first = Clarke | title = Women and witches: patterns of analysis | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 461&amp;ndash;470 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/493477 | jstor = 3173296 | date = Winter 1977 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/493477 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
The Reformation closed the convents and monasteries, and called on former monks and nuns to marry. Lay women shared in the religiosity of the Reformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Eric Josef | title = Marriage and the English Reformation | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780631168645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland the egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, "Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women." Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship In the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles, and took a prominent place in prayer societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Raffe | first = Alasdair | contribution = Female authority and lay activism in Scottish Presbyterianism, 1660–1740 | editor-last = Apetrei | editor-first = Sarah | editor-last2 = Smith | editor-first2 = Hannah | title = Religion and women in Britain, c. 1660-1760 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;78 | publisher = Ashgate | location = Farnham Surrey, England Burlington, Vermont | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781409429197 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolution==
Women's historians have debated the impact of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and capitalism generally on the status of women.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Laura; Brusco, Elizabeth (1998), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ux2PAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Benedict, Ruth 1887 - 1948]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Amico | editor-first = Eleanor | title = Reader's guide to women's studies | pages = 102&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn | location = Chicago | year = 1998 | isbn = 9781884964770 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Carol E.

Clark argues that in 16th century England, women were engaged in many aspects of industry and agriculture. The home was a central unit of production and women played a vital role in running farms, and in operating some trades and landed estates. For example, they brewed beer, handled the milk and butter, raised chickens and pigs, grew vegetables and fruit, spun flax and wool into thread, sewed and patched clothing, and nursed the sick. Their useful economic roles gave them a sort of equality with their husbands. However, Clark argues, as capitalism expanded in the 17th century, there was more and more division of labor with the husband taking paid labor jobs outside the home, and the wife reduced to unpaid household work. Middle-class women were confined to an idle domestic existence, supervising servants; lower-class women were forced to take poorly paid jobs. Capitalism, therefore, had a negative effect on more powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clark | first = Alice | author-link = Alice Clark | title = The working life of women in the seventeenth century | publisher = Routledge | location = London | oclc = 459278936 | year = 1919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more positive interpretation, [[Ivy Pinchbeck]] argues that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pinchbeck | first = Ivy | author-link = Ivy Pinchbeck | title = Women workers and the industrial revolution 1750-1850 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | origyear = 1930 | isbn = 9781138874633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louise Tilly]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott]] have emphasized the continuity and the status of women, finding three stages in European history. In the preindustrial era, production was mostly for home use and women produce much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of early industrialization, the entire family depended on the collective wages of its members, including husband, wife and older children. The third or modern stage is the "family consumer economy," in which the family is the site of consumption, and women are employed in large numbers in retail and clerical jobs to support rising standards of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tilly | first1 = Louise | last2 = Wallach Scott | first2 = Joan | author-link1 = Louise Tilly | author-link2 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Women, work, and family | publisher = Methuen | location = New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780416016819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==

===Fertility===
In the Victorian era, fertility rates increased in every decade until 1901, when the rates started evening out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Szreter | first = Simon | title = Fertility, class, and gender in Britain, 1860-1940 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780521528689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several reasons for the increase in birth rates. One is biological: with improving living standards, the percentage of women who were able to have children increased. Another possible explanation is social. In the 19th century, the marriage rate increased, and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly. The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain. One theory is that greater prosperity allowed people to finance marriage and new households earlier than previously possible. With more births within marriage, it seems inevitable that marriage rates and birth rates would rise together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = Robert I. | title = Approaches to the fertility transition in Victorian England | journal = Population Studies: A Journal of Demography | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 283&amp;ndash;311 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0032472031000142806 | jstor = 2174178 | date = July 1987 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0032472031000142806 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evening out of fertility rates at the beginning of the 20th century was mainly the result of a few big changes: availability of forms of birth control, and changes in people's attitude towards sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link1 = Annie Besant | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control.

===Morality and religion===
{{See also|Victorian morality|Women in the Victorian era}}
The Victorian era is famous for the Victorian standards of personal morality.  Historians generally agree that the middle classes held high personal moral standards (and usually followed them), but have debated whether the working classes followed suit. Moralists in the late 19th century such as [[Henry Mayhew]] decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births.  However new research using computerized matching of data files shows that the rates of cohabitation were quite low—under 5%—for the working class and the poor. By contrast in 21st century Britain, nearly half of all children are born outside marriage, and nine in ten newlyweds have been cohabitating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Probert | first = Rebecca | title = Living in sin | work = [[BBC History Magazine]] | url = http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/living-sin-common-law-marriage-unmarried-relationships-victorian-britain | date = October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frost | first = Ginger | title = Living in sin | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780719085697 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have begun to analyze the agency of women in overseas missions. At first, missionary societies officially enrolled only men, but women increasingly insisted on playing a variety of roles. Single women typically worked as educators. Wives assisted their missionary husbands in most of his roles. Advocates stopped short of calling for the end of specified gender roles, but they stressed the interconnectedness of the public and private spheres and spoke out against perceptions of women as weak and house-bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Midgley | first = Clare | title = Can women be missionaries?

===The middle-class===
The middle class typically had one or more servants to handle cooking, cleaning and child care, Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class whose increase in numbers had a significant effect on the social strata itself: cultural norms, lifestyle, values and morality. Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle class home and lifestyle. Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space. The difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function. In the Victorian era, English family life increasingly became compartmentalised, the home a self-contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations. The concept of "privacy" became a hallmark of the middle class life. {{Quote|text=The English home closed up and darkened over the decade (1850s), the cult of domesticity matched by a cult of privacy. Bourgeois existence was a world of interior space, heavily curtained off and wary of intrusion, and opened only by invitation for viewing on occasions such as parties or teas. "''The essential, unknowability of each individual, and society's collaboration in the maintenance of a façade behind which lurked innumerable mysteries, were the themes which preoccupied many mid-century novelists.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wohl | first = Anthony S. | title = The Victorian family: structure and stresses | publisher = Croom Helm | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780856644382 }}

===Working class families===
{{Main|Women in the Victorian era}}
Domestic life for a working-class family meant the housewife had to handle the chores servants did in wealthier families. A working-class wife was responsible for keeping her family as clean, warm, and dry as possible in housing stock that was often literally rotting around them. In London, overcrowding was endemic in the slums; a family living in one room was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Wise | first = Sarah | contribution = Dead letters: the empire of hunger | editor-last = Wise | editor-first = Sarah | title = The blackest streets: the life and death of a Victorian slum | page = 6 | publisher = Vintage | location = London | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844133314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rents were high in London; half of working-class households paid one-quarter to one-half of their income on rent.

Domestic chores for women without servants meant a great deal of washing and cleaning. Coal-dust from home stoves and factories filled the city air, coating windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. Washing clothing and linens meant scrubbing by hand in a large zinc or copper tub. Some water would be heated and added to the wash tub, and perhaps a handful of soda to soften the water.  Curtains were taken down and washed every fortnight; they were often so blackened by coal smoke that they had to be soaked in salted water before being washed. Scrubbing the front wooden doorstep of the home every morning was done to maintain respectability.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Murray | first = Janet Horowitz | contribution = Domestic life in poverty | editor-last = Murray | editor-first = Janet Horowitz | title = Strong-minded women: and other lost voices from nineteenth-century England | pages = 177&amp;ndash;179 | publisher = Penguin Books | location = Aylesbury | year = 1984 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
{{main|Women in the Victorian era#Leisure activities}}
Opportunities for leisure activities increased dramatically as real wages continued to grow and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the [[Bank Holiday Act 1871|Bank Holiday Act of 1871]], which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, G. R. (2004), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=5SGI2Y8vyC4C&amp;pg=PT529 The pursuit of pleasure]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Searle | editor-first = G.

Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside, Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as [[Worthing]], [[Brighton]], [[Morecambe]] and [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like [[Thomas Cook]] saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walton | first = John K. | title = The English seaside resort: a social history, 1750-1914 | publisher = Leicester University Press St. Martin's Press | location = Leicester Leicestershire New York | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780312255275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late Victorian era, the leisure industry had emerged in all cities with many women in attendance. It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices. These included sporting events, music halls, and popular theater. Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, G. R.

===Feminism and Reform===
[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]
The advent of [[Reformism]] during the 19th century opened new opportunities for reformers to address issues facing women and launched the [[feminist movement]].  The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by Barbara Bodichon (''née'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.

Property owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835.  The Chartist Movement was a large-scale demand for suffrage—but it meant ''manhood'' suffrage.   Upper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society.  However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.

====Child custody ====
Before 1839, after divorce rich women lost control of their children as those children would continue in the family unit with the father, as head of the household, and who continued to be responsible for them. [[Caroline Norton]] was one such woman, her personal tragedy where she was denied access to her three sons after a divorce, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] and then introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement.&lt;ref name="Wroath_Seven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wroath | first = John | title = Until they are seven: the origins of women's legal rights | publisher = Waterside Press | location = Winchester England | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781872870571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = L.

====Divorce====
Traditionally, poor people used desertion, and (for poor men) even the practice of selling wives in the market, as a substitute for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Stone | first = Lawrence | contribution = Desertion, elopement, and wife-sale | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | pages = 143&amp;ndash;148 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198226512.003.0006 Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain before 1857 wives were under the economic and legal control of their husbands, and divorce was almost impossible. It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps £200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford.  It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England.  The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about £40, but now became feasible for the middle class.  A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace.  The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stone | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Halévy | first = Élie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protection====
A series of four laws called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]]  passed  Parliament from 1870 to 1882 that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property. They now had practically equal status with their husbands, and a status superior to women anywhere else in Europe.&lt;ref name="Halévy_495"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halévy | first = Élie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 495&amp;ndash;496 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Griffin | first = Ben | title = Class, gender, and liberalism in Parliament, 1868–1882: the case of the Married Women's Property Acts | journal = [[The Historical Journal]] | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;87 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0018246X02002844 | date = March 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0018246X02002844 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Lyndon Shanley |first= Mary |title=Suffrage, protective labor legislation, and Married Women's Property Laws in England | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 62&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | jstor = 3174357 | doi = 10.1086/494297 | date = Autumn 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/494297 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working class women were protected by a series of laws passed on the assumption that they (like children) did not have full bargaining power and needed protection by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Feurer | first = Rosemary | title = The meaning of "sisterhood": the British Women's Movement and protective labor legislation, 1870-1900 | journal = [[Victorian Studies]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 233&amp;ndash;260 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | jstor = 3827971 | date = Winter 1988 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prostitution====
{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}
Bullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.  The evangelical movement of the nineteenth century denounced the prostitutes and their clients as sinners, and denounced society for tolerating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bullough | first = Vern L. | title = Prostitution and reform in eighteenth-century England | journal = Eighteenth-Century Life | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;74 | publisher = | date = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ICpJV0LfVkkC&amp;pg=PA61 | ref = harv | postscript = .| isbn = 9780521347686 }}

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] ("CD") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The "regulationist policy" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free.  The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand.  The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.&lt;ref name="Halévy_498"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halévy | first = Élie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498&amp;ndash;500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187&amp;ndash;222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work opportunities===
The rapid growth of factories opened jobbed opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled women and light industries, such as textiles, clothing, and food production.  There was an enormous popular and literary interest, as well as scientific interest, in the new status of women workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Neff | first = Wanda F. | title = Victorian Working Women | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415759335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland St Andrews University pioneered the admission of women to universities, creating the Lady Licentiate in Arts (LLA), which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Rayner-Canham2008&gt;{{citation | last1 = Rayner-Canham | first1 = Marelene M. | last2 = Rayner-Canham | first2 = Geoffrey W. | contribution = Universities in Scotland and Wales: entry of women to Scottish universities | editor-last1 = Rayner-Canham | editor-first1 = Marelene M. | editor-last2 = Rayner-Canham | editor-first2 = Geoffrey W. | title = Chemistry was their life: pioneering British women chemists, 1880-1949 | page = 264 | publisher = Imperial College Press | location = London Hackensack, New Jersey | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781860949869 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle-class careers====
Ambitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges and the goals of entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law and medicine.  The loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians kept tightly shut the door to medicine; there were a few places for woman as lawyers, but none as clerics.&lt;ref name="Halévy_500_506"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halévy | first = Élie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500&amp;ndash;506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s a new employment role opened for women in libraries; it was said that the tasks were "Eminently Suited to Girls and Women."  By 1920, women and men were equally numerous in the library profession, but women pulled ahead by 1930 and comprised 80% by 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kerslake | first = Evelyn | title = 'They have had to come down to the women for help!'Numerical feminization and the characteristics of women's library employment in England, 1871–1974 | journal = Library History | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&amp;ndash;40 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1179/174581607x177466 | date = 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174581607x177466 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The factors accounting for the transition included the demographic losses of the First World War,  the provisions of the Public Libraries Act of 1919, the library-building activity of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, and the library employment advocacy of the Central Bureau for the Employment of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coleman, Jr. | first = Sterling Joseph | title = 'Eminently suited to girls and women': the numerical feminization of public librarianship in England 1914–31 | journal = Library &amp; Information History | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 195&amp;ndash;209 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1179/1758348914Z.00000000063 | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1758348914Z.00000000063 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teaching====
Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman then to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers.   The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.&lt;ref name="Halévy_500"&gt;{{cite book | last = Halévy | first = Élie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority came from lower middle class origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165&amp;ndash;186 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760970260203 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

However the new redbrick universities and the other major cities were open to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tamboukou | first = Maria | title = Of Other Spaces: Women's colleges at the turn of the nineteenth century in the UK | journal = [[Gender, Place &amp; Culture: A Journal of Feminist Geography]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 247&amp;ndash;263 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/713668873 | date = 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713668873 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nursing and Medicine ====
[[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing in modern warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Nursing by 1900 was a highly attractive field for middle-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawkins | first = Sue | title = Nursing and women's labour in the nineteenth century: the quest for independence | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780415539746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Helmstadter | first1 = Carol | last2 = Godden | first2 = Judith | title = Nursing before Nightingale, 1815-1899 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | location = Farnham, Surrey, England Burlington, Vermont | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781409423140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicine was very well organized by men, and posed an almost insurmountable challenge for women, with the most systematic resistance by the physicians, and the fewest women breaking through.  One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. In 1877, the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland became the first institution to take advantage of the Enabling Act of 1876 and admit women to take its medical licences.  In all cases, coeducation had to wait until the World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bonner | first = Thomas Neville | contribution = The fight for coeducation in Britain | editor-last = Bonner | editor-first = Thomas Neville | title = To the ends of the earth: women's search for education in medicine | pages = 120&amp;ndash;137 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780674893047 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kelly | first = Laura | title = 'The turning point in the whole struggle': the admission of women to the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland | journal = [[Women's History Review]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;125 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/09612025.2012.724916 | date = 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/09612025.2012.724916 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poverty among working class women====
The [[1834 Poor Law]] defined who could receive monetary relief. The act reflected and perpetuated prevailing gender conditions. In Edwardian society, men were the source of wealth. The law restricted relief for unemployed, able-bodied male workers, due to the prevailing view that they would find work in the absence of financial assistance. However, women were treated differently. After the Poor Law was passed, women and children received most of the aid. The law did not recognise single independent women, and lumped women and children into the same category.&lt;ref name=thane&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thane | first = Pat | authorlink = Pat Thane | title = Women and the Poor Law in Victorian and Edwardian England | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 29&amp;ndash;51 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/hwj/6.1.29 | date = Autumn 1978 | url = https://doi.org/10.1093/hwj/6.1.29 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a man was physically disabled, his wife was also treated as disabled under the law.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt; Unmarried mothers were sent to the workhouse, receiving unfair social treatment such as being restricted from attending church on Sundays.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt; During marriage disputes women often lost the rights to their children, even if their husbands were abusive.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt;

At the time, single mothers were the poorest sector in society, disadvantaged for at least four reasons. First, women had longer lifespans, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women's work opportunities were few, and when they did find work, their wages were lower than male workers' wages. Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt; Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.&lt;ref name=thane/&gt;

==20th century==

===Women in the Edwardian Era===
The [[Edwardian era]], from the 1890s to the First World War saw middle-class women breaking out of the Victorian limitations. Women had more employment opportunities and were more active. Many served worldwide in the British Empire or in Protestant missionary societies.

====Housewives====
For housewives, sewing machines enabled the production of ready made clothing and made it easier for women to sew their own clothes; more generally, argues Barbara Burman, "home dressmaking was sustained as an important aid for women negotiating wider social shifts and tensions in their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Burman | first = Barbara | contribution = Made at home by clever fingers: home dressmaking in Edwardian England | editor-last = Burman | editor-first = Barbara | title = The culture of sewing: gender, consumption, and home dressmaking | page = 34 | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9781859732083 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increased literacy in the middle class gave women wider access to information and ideas. Numerous new magazines appealed to her tastes and help define femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beetham | first = Margaret | title = A magazine of her own?: domesticity and desire in the woman's magazine, 1800-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780415141123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====White-collar careers====
The inventions of the typewriter, telephone, and new filing systems offered middle class women increased employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = Guerriero R. | title = Women's work in offices and the preservation of men's ‘breadwinning’jobs in early twentieth-century Glasgow | journal = [[Women's History Review]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 463&amp;ndash;482 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/09612020100200296 | date = 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/09612020100200296 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Gregory | title = The White-blouse revolution: female office workers since 1870 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester, UK New York, New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780719024009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  So too did the rapid expansion of the school system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dyhouse | first = Carol | title = Girls growing up in late Victorian and Edwardian England | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781138008045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of the new profession of nursing.  Education and status led to demands for female roles in the rapidly expanding world of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parratt | first = Cartriona M. | title = Athletic 'Womanhood': Exploring sources for female sport in Victorian and Edwardian England | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 140&amp;ndash;157 | publisher = North American Society for Sport History | date = 1989 | url = http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1989/JSH1602/jsh1602c.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's suffrage====
{{main|Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom}}

As middle class women rose in status they increasingly supported demands for a political voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Martin | title = Women's suffrage in Britain, 1867-1928 | publisher = Historical Association | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780852782255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] founded the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU), a suffrage advocacy organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Melanie | author-link = Melanie Phillips | title = The ascent of woman: a history of the suffragette movement | publisher = Abacus | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780349116600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While WSPU was the most visible suffrage group, it was only one of many, such as the [[Women's Freedom League]] and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) led by [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]].  In Wales the suffragists women were attacked as outsiders  and were usually treated with rudeness and often violence when they demonstrated or spoke publicly. The idea of Welshness was by then highly masculine because of its identification with labouring in heavy industry and mining and with militant union action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = John | first = Angela V. | title = 'Run Like Blazes' the Suffragettes and Welshness | journal = [[Llafur]] | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 29&amp;ndash;43 | publisher = [[Llafur|Llafur: The Welsh People's History Society]] | date = 1994 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10107/1328679 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radical protests steadily became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, burning mailboxes, and arson of unoccupied buildings. [[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of an actual revolt in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, historian Robert Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media. The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389&amp;ndash;399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of moderate suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  They increasingly repudiated the extremists as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Historian [[G. R. Searle]] says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended. Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

In Wales, women's participation in politics grew steadily from the start of the suffrage movement in 1907. By 2003, half the members elected to the National Assembly were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Beddoe | first = Deirdre | title = Women and politics in Twentieth Century Wales | journal = [[National Library of Wales Journal]] | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 333&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[National Library of Wales]] | date = 2004 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10107/1292074 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fashion====
{{main|1900s in fashion}}
The upper classes embraced leisure sports, which resulted in rapid developments in fashion, as more mobile and flexible clothing styles were needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Constanzo | first = Marilyn | title = 'One can't shake off the women': images of sport and gender in ''Punch'', 1901-10 | journal = The International Journal of the History of Sport | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 31&amp;ndash;56 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/714001704 | date = 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/714001704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cosbey | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Damhorst | first2 = Mary Lynn | last3 = Farrell-Beck | first3 = Jane | title = Diversity of daytime clothing styles as a reflection of women’s social role ambivalence from 1873 through 1912 | journal = [[Clothing &amp; Textiles Research Journal]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 101&amp;ndash;119 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0887302X0302100301 | date = June 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0887302X0302100301 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Edwardian era, women wore a very tight [[corset]], or [[bodice]], and dressed in long skirts. The Edwardian era was the last time women wore corsets in everyday life. According to [[Arthur Marwick]], the most striking change of all the developments that occurred during the Great War was the modification in women's dress, "for, however far politicians were to put the clocks back in other steeples in the years after the war, no one ever put the lost inches back on the hems of women's skirts".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Marwick | first = Arthur | contribution = New women:1915-1916 | editor-last = Marwick | editor-first = Arthur | title = The deluge: British society and the First World War | page = 151 | publisher = Macmillan | location = Basingstoke | year = 1991 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780333548479 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
[[Home front during World War I#Women|The First World War]] advanced the feminist cause, as women's sacrifices and paid employment were much appreciated. Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] was clear about how important the women were: {{Quote|text=It would have been utterly impossible for us to have waged a successful war had it not been for the skill and ardour, enthusiasm and industry which the women of this country have thrown into the war.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Bob (2001), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-Rd0iLobaEC&amp;pg=PA167 How did the First World War affect the campaign for women's suffrage?]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Whitfield | editor-first = Bob | title = The extension of the franchise, 1832-1931 |page=167 | publisher = Heinemann Educational | location = Oxford | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780435327170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |author=[[David Lloyd George]] }}

The militant suffragette movement was suspended during the war and never resumed. British society credited the new patriotic roles women played as earning them the vote in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = A.J.P. | title = English History, 1914-1945 | pages = 29, 94 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1965 | oclc = 185566309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British historians no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women's participation in war work. Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914–1918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358&amp;ndash;374 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

There was a relaxing of clothing restrictions; by 1920 there was negative talk about young women called "[[flappers]]" flaunting their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Langhamer, Claire (2000), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=L3f2s0Ed-r4C&amp;pg=PA53 'Stepping out with the young set': youthful freedom and independence]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Langhamer | editor-first = Claire | title = Women's leisure in England, 1920-60 | page = 53 | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780719057373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social reform ===

The vote did not immediately change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organisation, the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strand 2: Women's Suffrage Societies (2NSE Records of the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship) | url = https://twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=2NSE&amp;pos=1 | website = twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[Women's Library|The Women's Library @ London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and prostitution) and over the differences between ''equality'' and ''equity'', the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the "equality vs. difference conundrum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Offen | first = Karen | title = Women in the western world | journal = Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 145&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | date = Summer 1995 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jowh.2010.0359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Rathbone]], who became a MP in 1929, succeeded [[Millicent Fawcett|Millicent Garrett]] as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration of ''difference'' in gender relationships as "what women need to fulfill the potentialities of their own natures".&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Tiffany K. (2011), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=cfHj-XjP-VcC&amp;pg=PA484 "''The Old and the New Feminism''" (1925) by Eleanor Rathbone]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Wayne | editor-first = Tiffany K. | title = Feminist writings from ancient times to the modern world: a global sourcebook and history | pages = 484&amp;ndash;485 | publisher = Greenwood | location = Santa Barbara | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780313345814 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1924 Labour government's social reforms created a formal split, as a [[splinter group]] of strict egalitarians formed the [[Open Door Council]] in May 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strand 5: (5ODC Campaigning Organisations  Records of the Open Door Council) | url = https://twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk/CalmView/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=5ODC&amp;pos=1 | website = twl-calm.library.lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[Women's Library|The Women's Library @ London School of Economics]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965. Other important social legislation of this period included the [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] (which opened professions to women), and the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1923]]. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the [[National Council for Equal Citizenship]] and the latter as the [[Townswomen's Guild]]. The council continued until the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pedersen | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Pedersen (historian) | title = Eleanor Rathbone and the politics of conscience | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780300102451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second World War===
{{Main|Home front during World War II#Britain}}
Britain's total mobilization during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a "people's war" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Donnelly | first = Mark P. | title = Britain in the Second World War | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1999 | oclc = 300390600 }} - is a short survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calder | first = Angus | title = The people's war: Britain 1939-45 | publisher = Cape | location = London | year = 1969 | isbn = 9780224616539 }} - is the standard scholarly history.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:INF3-219 Salvage Up Housewives and at em - put out your paper, metal, bones Artist Yates-Wilson.jpg|thumb|Salvage – Up Housewives and at 'em – put out your paper, metal, bones. Artist Yates-Wilson]]
Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Havers | first = Robin | contribution = World around war: the home front | editor-last = Havers | editor-first = Robin | title = The Second World War Vol. 2: Europe 1939-1943 | page = 75 | publisher = Osprey | location = Oxford | year = 2002 | isbn = 9781841764474 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hancock | first1 = William K. | last2 = Gowing | first2 = Margaret M. | title = British war economy | publisher = [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] | location = London | year = 1949 | oclc = 503017232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over planned, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep the rats and mice under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Marwick | first = Arthur | contribution = The Second World War | editor-last = Marwick | editor-first = Arthur | title = Britain in the century of total war: war, peace and social change 1900-1967 | page = 258 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company | location = Boston Toronto | year = 1968 | oclc = 804633692 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and school lunches, as well as the equalitarian spirit of the People's war, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to open up shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000, and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.&lt;ref name="Calder_276"&gt;{{citation | last = Calder | first = Angus | contribution = Through the tunnel: October 1940 to December 1942 | editor-last = Calder | editor-first = Angus | title = The people's war: Britain 1939-45 | pages = 276&amp;ndash;283 | publisher = Cape | location = London | year = 1969 | isbn = 9780224616539 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Calder | first = Angus | contribution = The India-rubber Island: Britain in 1943-44 | editor-last = Calder | editor-first = Angus | title = The people's war: Britain 1939-45 | pages = 411&amp;ndash;430 | publisher = Cape | location = London | year = 1969 | isbn = 9780224616539 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents had much less time for supervision of their children, and the fear of juvenile delinquency was upon the land, especially as older teenagers took jobs and emulated their older siblings in the service. The government responded by requiring all youth over 16 to register, and expanded the number of clubs and organizations available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Marwick | first = Arthur | contribution = The Second World War | editor-last = Marwick | editor-first = Arthur | title = Britain in the century of total war: war, peace and social change 1900-1967 | pages = 292&amp;ndash;294, 258 | publisher = Little, Brown and Company | location = Boston Toronto | year = 1968 | oclc = 804633692 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rationing====
Food, clothing, petrol, leather and other such items were [[Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II|rationed]]. However, items such as sweets and fruits were not rationed, as they would spoil. Access to luxuries was severely restricted, although there was also a significant black market. Families also grew [[victory garden]]s, and small home vegetable gardens, to supply themselves with food. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such as fat for [[nitroglycerin]] production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in metropolitan areas and were more able to grow their own.

The rationing system, which had been originally based on a specific basket of goods for each consumer, was much improved by switching to a points system which allowed the housewives to make choices based on their own priorities. Food rationing also permitted the upgrading of the quality of the food available, and housewives approved—except for the absence of white bread and the government's imposition of an unpalatable wheat meal "[[national loaf]]." People were especially pleased that rationing brought equality and a guarantee of a decent meal at an affordable cost.&lt;ref name="Calder_276" /&gt;

===1950s===
'''1950s Britain''' was a bleak period for militant [[feminism]]. In the aftermath of World War II, a new emphasis was placed on companionate marriage and the [[nuclear family]] as a foundation of the new [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ward | first = Paul | contribution = Gender and national identity: Gender, 'race' and home in post-war Britain | editor-last = Ward | editor-first = Paul | title = Britishness since 1870 | page = 50 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780415220170 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pugh 1990: 158"&gt;{{citation | last = Pugh | first = Martin | contribution = Domesticity and the decline of feminism 1930–1950 | editor-last = Smith | editor-first = Harold L. | title = British feminism in the Twentieth Century | page = 158 | publisher = University of Massachusetts Press | location = Amherst, Massachusetts | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780870237058 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the proportion of adult women who were (or had been) married was 75%; more specifically, 84.8% of women between the ages of 45 and 49 were married.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lewis | first = Jane | contribution = Patterns of marriage and motherhood | editor-last = Lewis | editor-first = Jane | title = Women in England, 1870-1950: sexual divisions and social change | page = 3 | publisher = Wheatsheaf Books Indiana University Press | location = Brighton, Sussex Bloomington | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780710801869 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time: “marriage was more popular than ever before.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bruley | first = Sue | contribution = From austerity to prosperity and the pill: the Post-War years, 1945–c.1968 | editor-last = Bruley | editor-first = Sue | title = Women in Britain since 1900 | page = 131 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780333618394 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-27743-8_6 Also available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, a popular book of advice for women states: “A happy marriage may be seen, not as a holy state or something to which a few may luckily attain, but rather as the best course, the simplest, and the easiest way of life for us all”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Whiteman | first = Phyllis | contribution = Making the marriage bed | editor-last = Whiteman | editor-first = Phyllis | title = Speaking as a woman  | page = 67 | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | location = London | year = 1953 | oclc = 712429455 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the end of the war, childcare facilities were closed and assistance for working women became limited, the social reforms implemented by the new welfare state included [[Family Allowances Act 1945|family allowances]] meant to subsidize families, that is, to support women in the “capacity as wife and mother.”&lt;ref name="Pugh 1990: 158"/&gt; Sue Bruley argues that “the progressive vision of the New Britain of 1945 was flawed by a fundamentally conservative view of women”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bruley | first = Sue | contribution = From austerity to prosperity and the pill: the Post-War years, 1945–c.1968 | editor-last = Bruley | editor-first = Sue | title = Women in Britain since 1900 | page = 118 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780333618394 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-27743-8_6 Also available online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's commitment to companionate marriage was echoed by the popular media: films, radio and popular [[women's magazines]]. In the 1950s, women's magazines had considerable influence on forming opinion in all walks of life, including the attitude to women's employment.

Nevertheless, 1950s Britain saw several strides towards the parity of women, such as [[Equal pay for women|equal pay]] for teachers (1952) and for men and women in the [[civil service]] (1954), thanks to activists like [[Edith Summerskill]], who fought for women's causes both in parliament and in the traditional non-party pressure groups throughout the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Pugh | first = Martin | contribution = The nadir of feminism and the climax of domesticity 1945-59 | editor-last = Pugh | editor-first = Martin | title = Women and the women's movement in Britain, 1914-1959 | page = 284 | publisher = Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780333494400 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Caine]] argues: “Ironically here, as with the vote, success was sometimes the worst enemy of organised feminism, as the achievement of each goal brought to an end the campaign which had been organised around it, leaving nothing in its place.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Caine | first = Barbara | contribution = The postwar world | editor-last = Caine | editor-first = Barbara | title = English feminism, 1780-1980 | page = 223 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9786610767090 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist writers of that period, such as [[Alva Myrdal]] and [[Viola Klein]], started to allow for the possibility that women should be able to combine home with outside employment. 1950s’ form of feminism is often derogatorily termed “welfare feminism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Myrdal | first1 = Alva | last2 = Klein | first2 = Viola | author-link1 = Alva Myrdal | author-link2 = Viola Klein | title = Women's two roles: home and work | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780415176576 }}
:''Cited in'' {{cite book | last = Banks | first = Olive | title = Faces of feminism: a study of feminism as a social movement | page = 176 | publisher = Martin Robertson | location = Oxford, England | year = 1981 | isbn = 9780855202606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many activists went to great length to stress that their position was that of ‘reasonable modern feminism,’ which accepted [[sexual diversity]], and sought to establish what women's social contribution was rather than emphasizing equality or the similarity of the sexes. Feminism in 1950s England was strongly connected to social responsibility and involved the well-being of society as a whole. This often came at the cost of the [[Liberty|liberation]] and personal fulfillment of self-declared feminists. Even those women who regarded themselves as feminists strongly endorsed prevailing ideas about the primacy of children's needs, as advocated, for example, by [[John Bowlby]] the head of the Children's Department at the [[Tavistock Clinic]], who  published extensively throughout the 1950s and by [[Donald Winnicott]] who promoted through [[Radio programming|radio broadcasts]] and in the [[Newspaper|press]] the idea of the home as a private emotional world in which mother and child are bound to each other and in which the mother has control and finds freedom to fulfill herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Finch | first1 = Janet | last2 = Summerfield | first2 = Penny | contribution = Social reconstruction and the emergence of companionate marriage, 1945–59 | editor-last = Clark | editor-first = David | title = Marriage, domestic life, and social change: writings for [[Jacqueline Burgoyne]], 1944-88 | page = 11 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York, New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780415032469 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's roles===
The 1960s saw dramatic shifts in attitudes and values led by youth.  It was a worldwide phenomenon, in which British rock musicians especially [[The Beatles]] played an international role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Hunter | title = The Beatles | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York | year = 2010 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780393338744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generations divided sharply regarding the new sexual freedom demanded by youth who listened to bands like ''The Rolling Stones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = August | first = Andrew | title = Gender and 1960s youth culture: The Rolling Stones and the new woman | journal = Contemporary British History | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 79&amp;ndash;100 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13619460801990104 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13619460801990104 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual morals changed. One notable event was the publication of [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[Penguin Books]] in 1960. Although first printed in 1928, the release in 1960 of an inexpensive [[Mass marketing|mass-market]] [[paperback]] version prompted a court case. The prosecuting council's question, "Would you want your wife or servants to read this book?" highlighted how far society had changed, and how little some people had noticed. The book was seen as one of the first events in a general relaxation of sexual attitudes. Other elements of the [[sexual revolution]] included the development of [[The Pill]], [[Mary Quant]]'s [[miniskirt]] and the 1967 legalisation of [[homosexuality]]. There was a rise in the incidence of divorce and abortion, and a resurgence of the [[women's liberation movement]], whose campaigning helped secure the [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act]] and the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act]] in 1975.  The Irish Catholics, traditionally the most puritanical of the ethno-religious groups, eased up a little, especially as the membership disregarded the bishops teaching that contraception was sinful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Geiringer | first = David | title = Catholic understandings of female sexuality in 1960s Britain | journal = 20th Century British History | volume =  28| issue =  2| pages =  209–238| publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/tcbh/hww051 | pmid = 28922825 | date = November 2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tcbh/hww051 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Since 2007, [[Harriet Harman]] has been Deputy Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the UK's current opposition party. Traditionally, being Deputy Leader has ensured the cabinet role of [[Deputy Prime Minister]]. However, [[Gordon Brown]] announced that he would not have a Deputy Prime Minister, much to the consternation of feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Harman snatches an empty victory | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article1980533.ece | work = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 22 February 2009 | subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly with suggestions that privately Brown considered [[Jack Straw]] to be de facto deputy prime minister&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Harriet Harman will fill in for Brown at Prime Minister's Questions next week | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/harriet-harman-will-fill-in-for-brown-at-prime-ministers-questions-next-week-6698532.html | work = [[London Evening Standard]] | date = 29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus bypassing Harman. With Harman's cabinet post of [[Leader of the House of Commons]], Brown allowed her to chair [[Prime Minister's Questions]] when he was out of the country. Harman also held the post [[Minister for Women and Equality]]. In April 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport English journalist [[Laura Bates]] founded the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], a website which documents everyday examples of sexism experienced by contributors from around the world. The site quickly became successful and a book compilation of submissions from the project was published in 2014. In 2013, the first oral history archive of the United Kingdom women's liberation movement (titled ''Sisterhood and After'') was launched by the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  Tavernor | first = Rachel |url=http://reframe.sussex.ac.uk/activistmedia/2013/03/sisterhoodandafter/ |title=Sisterhood and after: first oral history archive of the UK Women’s Liberation Movement | work = REFRAME |publisher=School of Media, Film and Music, [[University of Sussex]] |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate= 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2103">'''Hyman "Pittsburgh Hymie" Martin''' (April 6, 1903 &amp;ndash; July 1987) was a [[Pittsburgh]] [[mobster]] and a close associate of [[Moe Dalitz]] and [[Louis Rothkopf]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (December 1967) (pp. 578-579)&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen with Davis and Rothkopf hours before the murder of [[Cleveland]] city councilman William E. Potter on February 3, 1931. Identified by police as matching the description of the man who rented the apartment in which Potter's body was found, he was arrested in Pittsburgh shortly after, although he denied any knowledge of the murder, stating "I'm a gentleman, a rumrunner!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930337,00.html |title=From the Statesman's Window |accessdate=2007-05-18 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1931-02-23 |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charged with Potter's murder, Martin was convicted; however, he later won a [[retrial]] and was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Organized%20Crime%20in%20the%20United%20States%201950%202.htm |title=Investigation of Organized Crime in State Commerce: Hearings Before the Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce |accessdate=2007-05-18 |publisher=U.S. Senate |date=1950-07-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113053222/http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Organized%20Crime%20in%20the%20United%20States%201950%202.htm |archivedate=2006-01-13 |quote=On February 3, 1931, William E. Potter, a Cleveland city councilman, was slain in one of the most sensational crimes ever committed in Cleveland. The most logical suspect insofar as the murder was concerned was one 'Pittsburgh Hymie' Martin.... 'Pittsburgh Hymie' was tried for this murder and was convicted. He won a retrial, however, and was acquitted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3682">The '''International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference (IPNC)''' occurs every two years and is a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research on all aspects of the genus ''[[Neisseria]]''. This includes immunology, vaccinology and physiology and metabolism of ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' and the commensal species.

The 21st International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference (IPNC 2018) will be held in Asilomar, California, USA from the 23–28 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neisseria.org/ipnc/|title=IPNC - Neisseria.org|last=|first=|date=|website=http://neisseria.org/ipnc/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 1970s a series of conferences were held dealing with issues of meningococcal epidemiology and vaccination. Some of these conferences were held in Milano, St. Paul de Vence, and Marseille. But the first official conference was held in [[San Francisco, California]], 1978. The location of the conference switched between North America and Europe until 2006 when the venue was located in [[Cairns]], Australia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IPNC - Neisseria.org|url = http://neisseria.org/ipnc/history.shtml|website = neisseria.org|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assyrians in Iraq''' are an [[ethnoreligious]] and linguistic [[minority group|minority]] in present-day [[Iraq]], and are the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous population]] of the region. Assyrians are about .5% of the population of Iraq. Assyrians in Iraq are those [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] still residing in the country of Iraq, and those in the [[Assyrian diaspora]] who are of Iraqi-Assyrian heritage. They are and have direct cultural and genetic lineage from the ancient [[Mesopotamians]], in particular from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] peoples ([[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]]) who emerged in the region c. 3000 BC, and the [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] tribes who intermingled with them from the 9th century BC onwards.

Assyrians are a [[Semitic people]] who speak, read and write a modern-day [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Dialects]] of ancient [[Aramaic]] that has existed in Iraq since 1200 BC, which retains even older [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] grammatical influences and loan words (the language which they originally spoke). They are mainly a [[Christian]] people, and follow a collection of ethnic-based [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] denominations which first evolved in the region in the 1st century AD. The Assyrians of Iraq adhere to [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Ancient Church of the East]], in addition to other recently formed Assyrian Protestant churches including the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]].

According to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the Assyrian [[Christians of Iraq]] or other religions (excluding [[Islam]]), make up .5% of the [[Demographics of Iraq|Iraqi population]].&lt;ref&gt;[[CIA Factbook]]: "[[Arab]] 75%-80%, [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish]] 15%-20%, [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman]], Assyrian, or other 5% [...] Christian or other 3%" [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The last Iraqi census, in 1987, counted 1.4 million Christians, including the Assyrian community (4–5%), although many left the country during the 1990s when economic sanctions were imposed on the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=61897 |title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; IRAQ: Christians live in fear of death squads &amp;#124; Iraq &amp;#124; Other |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2006-10-19 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other indigenous Assyrian communities can be found just outside Iraq's borders in "southeastern [[Turkey]], northwestern [[Iran]] and northeastern [[Syria]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=northern+Iraq,+southeastern+Turkey,+northwestern+Iran,+northeastern+Syria+Assyrians&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20Iraq%2C%20southeastern%20Turkey%2C%20northwestern%20Iran%2C%20northeastern%20Syria%20Assyrians&amp;f=false Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century  By Sargon Donabed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient history==
The Assyrians are typically Syriac-speaking Christians who [[Assyrian continuity|claim descent]] from [[Assyria|Assyria, one of the oldest civilizations]] in the world, dating back to 2500 BC in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Leo Oppenheim|title=Ancient Mesopotamia |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/ancient_mesopotamia.pdf|year=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria itself existed as an independent state (and often imperial power) in what is today northern [[Iraq]], north eastern [[Syria]], south eastern [[Turkey]] and the north western fringe of [[Iran]] from the 25th century BC to the beginning of the 6th century BC, and remained a geopolitical entity until the mid 7th century AD.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The Assyrians were an integral part of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC) which united the Akkadian-speaking peoples under one rule, and after its dissolution Assyria rose to prominence with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (c.2025–1750 BC), [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC) and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC), the latter two of these empires made Assyria the most powerful nation in the world at the time. At its height the Assyrians ruled a vast empire from their homeland in what is today northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]] and south east [[Turkey]], an empire stretching from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the south, and from [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to western [[Iran]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

After the Assyrian empire fell between 612 and 599 BC, Assyria endured mostly as an occupied but named [[geo-political]] entity as; [[Athura]], [[Achaemenid Assyria]], [[Asuristan]], [[Assyria]], although during the [[Parthian Empire]] and early [[Sassanid Empire]] (c.160 BC – 260 AD) there was an Assyrian revival, and a number of independent Assyrian states arose in northern Iraq and north east Syria, including; [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Beth Nuhadra]], [[Beth Garmai]], ancient [[Assur]] itself, and to some degree [[Hatra]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The Assyrians formulated the influential [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac script]] in the 5th century BC IN [[Athura]] ([[Achaemenid Assyria]]), and began to gradually convert from [[Mesopotamian Religion]] to [[Christianity]] from the 1st to 4th centuries AD, with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and its much later offshoot, the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] being founded in the region, as too to some extent was the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

Assyria was dissolved as an entity in the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Arab]] [[Islamic Conquest]], and the Assyrians, as Christians and non-Arabs, suffered discrimination;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} they were banned from spreading their religion upon pain of death,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} were taxed a [[Jiziyah]] for not being Muslim, and found their word was not equal to a Muslim in legal and civil matters.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Assyrians still formed the majority of the population in northern Iraq until the [[Middle Ages]]. The Assyrians suffered a series of severe religiously motivated massacres under [[Muslim]] [[Turco-Mongol]] rule in the 13th and 14th centuries AD, greatly reducing their numbers, and causing the ancient city of [[Assur]] to be finally abandoned after 4000 years of occupation.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The new arrival of Muslim Kurds went along with persecutionss of Assyrians. In the 1840s the Kurdish chieftain Badr-Khan Beg and his tribe massacred tens of
thousands of Assyrians. In 1918, Simko Agha Shekaki, regarded as a national hero among Kurds, killed the Assyrian Mar Benjamin Shimun, the Patriarch of the Church of the East.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ 2013, by Assyria Council of Europe and the Assyria Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; After 1933, Assyrians had to flee from Iraq to Syria due to the massacres by the Iraqi army, led by
Kurdish general Bakr Sidqi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Scholars have said that Kurds also fought against Christians because they feared that Armenians or their European allies could take control of the area. Both Arabs and Kurds thought of the Assyrians as foreigners and as allies of colonial Britain. Kurdish tribes were plundering Armenian and other Christian villages and "took possession of land".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, J. (2016). Margins of empire. S.l.: Stanford University Press., and https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=akron1464911392&amp;disposition=inline """"THE SIMELE MASSACRE AS A CAUSE OF IRAQI NATIONALISM: HOW AN ASSYRIAN GENOCIDE CREATED IRAQI MARTIAL NATIONALISM """"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Davis,  Memories of State  (Los Angeles: University of California Press 2005): 62;  Records of Iraq,  v.7 , Consul Mon ypenny to Mr. Ogilvie- Forbes, 21 Aug. 1933, 580.

Persecution of Assyrians has a long and bitter history. In 1895 in Diyarbakır Kurdish and Turkish militia began attacking Christians, plundering Assyrian villages. In 1915 Kurds and Turks plundered villages, about 7000 Assyrians were killed. In 1915 Turkish troops "with Kurdish detachments" committed mass slaughters of Assyrians in Iran. In the Assyrian village of Haftvan almost 1000 people were beheaded and  5000 Assyrian women were taken to Kurdish harems.&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies  Richard G. Hovannisian  (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Paul Cambon described the creation of Kurdish Hamidies regiments as „the official organisation for pillage at the expense of Armenian Christians“. In these places "the system of persecutions and extorsions became intolerable to populations who had become accustomed to their slavery". According to Cambon, the Porte refused reforms and persisted in „maintaining a veritable regime of terror, arrests, assasinations and rape.“.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Yeʼor. 116-18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 the Muslim Kurds "rose in revolt against the „atheist government of Ankara“ and demanded autonomy , the restoration of religious laws and of the sultanate".&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Yeʼor. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Iraqi forces commanded by Kurdish general Bakr Sidki killed 600 Assyrians at Simel, near Mosul. Kurds committed the slaughter "in which 65 Nestorian villages in northern Iraq were plundered and burned down, priests were tortured and Christians were forced to renounce their religion while others in Dohuk were deported and about a 100 were shot". While today Armenians "concentrate their resentment against the Turks", in reality "Kurds and Arabs had participated in the genocide and the enslavement and conversion of Armenian women and children".&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Yeʼor. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 Nestorians in the Tauris region refused to pay Kurds the jizya, and "by way of reprisal 4350 Nestroians were slaughtered, about 400 women and children were reduced to slavery and all their houses and churches destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Yeʼor. see in hommaire de hell, voyage en turquie 2:22-24, where it is recounted&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have noted that in "Kurdistan Jews, Nestorians and Armenians were subject to tallage and corvees at whim of authorities, and this period witnessed massacres of Christians in Kurdistan in the mid-19th century".&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Yeʼor&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have noted that "Bedirhan Bey the Ruler "called the Kurdish Muslims to fight a sacred war against Christian Syriac, Nestorian, Chaldean and Armenian people and ordered to massacre and annihilate them". Kurdish writers have recounted that “the Kurdish troops attacked the Assyrians and started slaughters. Consequently, a few Assyrians were killed, their villages were destroyed and set into fire... For the second time, in 1846, the Assyrians residing at the Thuma region have been massacred....” British writer William Eagleton said that “in 1843 and 1846, Bedirhan started a massacre and booting campaign against the Christian Assyrians (Nestorians) he was anxious about whose getting stronger and independent through becoming able to rule themselves. It was intolerable for Bedirhan to see the Assyrians living on his own territories getting stronger. Thus he killed ten thousand Assyrians. Even though Bedirhan was a feudal tribal leader, he was expressing the aspirations of Kurdish nationalism.” Kurdish and Arab attacks on Assyrians continued, culminating in the August 1933 Simele Massacres. About 3000 Assyrians were killed in that single month alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atour.com/education/20000825a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in August 1933 Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish militia killed thousands of Assyrias in Simele (Iraq). The massacre had a big influence on Raphael Lemkin, the jurist who coined the word "genocide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/center-study-genocide-conflict-resolution-and-human-rights/assyrian-genocide-1914-1923-and-1933-pres&lt;/ref&gt; The Simmele Massacre is also commemorated yearly with the official Assyrian Martyrs Day on August 7. The massacre was carried out by the Iraqi Army, led by Kurdish General Bakir Sidqi, and Kurdish and Arab irregulars. There were about 3,000 victims of the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/releases/20040805022140.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Turks, with the cooperation of Kurdish groups, conducted systematic murder against the Christian population. Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, the Turks allied with Kurdish tribes. After the Kurds weregranted  an emirate in Syriac Cizre in 1842, the Kurds launched brutal assaults againt Christians under the command of Kurdish emir Bedr Khan, who murdered thousands of Assyrians in the region of Tur Abdin and Hakkari. Christian areas were subjected to the migration of Kurdish tribes. Many massacres were carried out against Christians in 1895 in Diyarbakir, Urfa, Mardin, Nusaybin, Meyafarkin, Tur Abdin and Viranshahr. Assyrians were eradicated from Tur Abdin, Mardin, Diyarbakir and Hakkari in Turkey and Urmia in Iran. The Syriac city of Mardin was captured by Turks and given over to Kurds who expelled its original population.&lt;ref name="araborthodoxy.blogspot.com"&gt;http://araborthodoxy.blogspot.com/2013/12/as-safir-on-history-of-persecution-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few of the Christians of the Nineveh Plain remain after the repeated attacks by Arab and Kurdish fighters.  Historically Christian cities like Erbil, Zakho, Dohuk, Kirkuk, and Mosul have been Kurdicized and Islamized.  Suryanis emigrated from Syria after the Amuda massacre of August 1937. The massacre was carried out by Kurdish general Saeed Agha and emptied the city of its Suryani population. Malikiya, Darbasiya and Amuda have since become completely Kurdish. Also the historically Christian city of Nusaybin has become Kurdish. Christians fled to Qamishly which became a Christian city until the immigration of Kurds beginning in 1926.&lt;ref name="araborthodoxy.blogspot.com"/&gt;

Kurdish-Christian Armenian relations were bitter at the turn of the 19th century and land conflicts were a major problem. Many Christians and Europeans regarded the Kurds as barbarians and a major threat, the French consul at Erzurum describing them as a blood-thirsty savage population which is used to plundering and a nomadic life. Kurds also played a major part in the Ottoman army, also through the Hamidiye.&lt;ref&gt;The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone, Janet Klein Stanford University Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Kurdish chieftain Bedr Khan during his rise to power massacred about 10,000 Assyrians in 1842. Nestorian tribes were massacred by Kurds in 1843. In 1915 Kurds massacred more than 27,000 Assyrians in Urmia region alone and destroyed more than 100 villages Assyrian villages in March 1915 alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century, Sargon Donabed Edinburgh University Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 Kurds and Turks massacred Assyrians in Bohtan region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Both Kurdish and Turkish nationalists deny the fact that Assyrians were the original inhabitants of south-eastern Turkey and northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Forgotten Genocides: Oblivion, Denial, and Memory herausgegeben, Rene Lemarchand. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011 Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian population was so small in the aftermath of the genocide that the region called Assyria in ancient times came to be known as "Kurdistan".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Kurds and Turks cynically resisted Assyrian and Armenian efforts to attain statehood after World War II.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; While the Kurdish population doubled from two million in 1970 to four million in 2002, the Christian population decreased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==British Mandate==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
In 1918, Britain resettled 20,000 Assyrian people from south east Turkey in Iraqi refugee camps in [[Baquba]] and Mandan after the [[Ottoman Empire]] instigated the [[Assyrian Genocide]] and a subsequent British and Russian-inspired Assyrian [[rebellion]] (see [[Assyrian struggle for independence]]), which although having success against overwhelming odds initially, floundered when the Russians withdrew from the war, leaving the Assyrian forces cut off and vastly outnumbered without supplies and armaments. From there, due to their higher level of education, many gravitated toward [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]] and [[Erbil]] with their own long established ancient Assyrian communities, and to [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]], (as well as to other areas in the north such as the [[Nineveh plains]] with age old existing indigenous Assyrian populations) where they were indispensable in the administration of the oil and military projects.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

As a result, approximately three-fourths of the Assyrians who had sided with the British during [[World War I]] found themselves living in by now Kurdish dominated areas of Iraq, where their ancestors had existed for over five thousand years. Thousands of Assyrian men had seen service in the ''Iraqi Levies'' ([[Assyrian Levies]]), a force under British officers separate from the regular Iraqi army. Excellent, disciplined and loyal soldiers, they were used by the British to help put down Arab and Kurdish insurrections against the British, and to help patrol the Turkish and Iranian borders of British Mesopotamia. Pro-British, they had been apprehensive of Iraqi independence. Many of those thus resettled by the British have gradually been forced into [[exile]], although by the end of the twentieth century, almost all of those who remain were born in Iraq.

Assyrians living in northern Iraq today are those whose ancient ancestry lies in the north originally, an area roughly corresponding with ''Ancient Assyria''. Many of these, however, in places like [[Berwari]], have been forcibly displaced by Kurds and Arabs since the genocides of World War I. This process has continued throughout the twentieth century: as Kurds and Arabs have expanded in population, Assyrians have come under attack as in 1933 ([[Simele Massacre]]), and as a result have fled from Iraq. (Stafford, ''Tragedy of the Assyrians'', 1935)

In fact, it all started as a conflict between the Assyrians Patriarch of the Church of the East, Mar Shimun, whose residency and seat was traditionally at Kochanis in the Hakkari mountains in Southeastern Turkey. He was forced to retreat to Iran and then to Iraq under the auspices of the British army, while many of his people perished, and many were injured during the confrontations with the Turkish and the Iranian army and the Kurds during WWI. His relocation into Iraq forced the Patriarch Mar Shimun, one year before the end of the British Mandate over Iraq, to enter into discussions with the Iraqi Government, asking to recognize not only his religious authority but also his secular and political authority, representing his wounded people, but the government refused. 
The Assyrians, previously from Hakkari and form Iran, had been settled by the British administration in Iraq. However, their problems and absorption in the new country was far from flawless. In 1932, the British decision to hand over the mandate over Iraq was taken and the Assyrians insisted that they would not be safe after the British left. When the end of the mandate became a certainty, Browne calls it 'political mutiny,' when Assyrian officers and men of the Levies acknowledged that they wished to be disbanded in a month from June 1, 1932.  Browne says the British point of view:

they had no right to do anything pf the sort, and a most dangerous would have arisen if several thousand men, all armed, were collected together in the area north of Mosul.

From an Assyrian point of view, Browne argues, "it was simply a desperate attempt to bring their case home to everyone before it was too late. Many took part unwillingly, and the more level-headed admitted they were wrong; but all decided that they must hold together."

After several weeks of mounting tensions all the Levies withdrew their resignations and were asked to commit "never again to take part in any more demonstrations of a political nature while serving." 
At the same time, the Assyrian Patriarch Mar Shimon went to Geneva to address the League of Nations the concerns and worries of the Assyrian people who he represented. There were no results for his efforts, and the mandated over Iraq was transferred without the Assyrian problem being resolved.
The British administration appointed a settlement officer, Major Thompson, to work under the Iraq government, and his work begain in 1933. "Then matters began to move rapidly to a crisis," according to Browne. Concerns of the Assyrians that were not addressed, military men annoyed, in a midst of a process that included resignation from the Levies and return to service in a hope that some solution will be provided to their concerns.
Two former Levy officers, Yaqub Ismail of the Upper Tiyari tribe, and Loko Shlimun of the Tkhuma Tribe, "after figuring in a series of disturbing situations" north of Mosul marched off into Syria with between 400 and 500 men. They were all armed. Browne argues they had no intention of fighting, because they left their women and children in Iraq, an act "they would certainly not have done had they intended war." After deliberations and involvement of Great Britain, France and Iraq, in order to solve this delicate situation, the Assyrians decided to march back into Iraq, and arrived on the Tigris River near Deirabun (Dehrabun), a Christian village. However, they were faced with a force of 4,000 Iraqi soldiers who were keeping the line. "As it was, two groups of people, both armed, both disliking each other intensely, met on the river. It was only necessary for one rifle to go off for hostilities to begin, and that is what happened."

A little fight ensues but the Assyrians, after some initial success, suddenly broke off and retired. The Iraqi action that followed included shooting the prisoners in cold blood, and a massacre of between 400 and 500 men of the Baz tribe in the village of Simmel. Browne argues that the Iraqi army was entirely responsible for the deterioration, the civil authorities was not involved and even the Kurds had nothing to do with these developments.&lt;ref&gt;See the PHD dissertation of Mordechai Zaken: “Tribal Chieftains and their Jewish Subjects in Kurdistan: A Comparative Study in Survival,”  The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (2003), which deals and draw a good comparison between the Jews of Kurdistan and the Assyrians in Kurdistan and provides and provides an analysis of the status and position of these two non-Muslim communities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Kurds]], some Assyrians scarcely expected a nation-state of their own after World War I (despite promises by the British and Russians), but they did demand [[restitution]] from Turkey for the huge material and population losses they had suffered, especially in northwest Iran, a neutral party in World War I invaded by Turkish and Kurdish forces. Their pressure for some temporal authority in the north of Iraq under the Assyrian patriarch, [[Shimun XXI Eshai]], was flatly refused by British and Iraqis alike.

==Independent Kingdom of Iraq==

In 1933, the Iraqi government held the Patriarch of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the Mar Shamun, under [[house arrest]]. When he left Iraq to appeal to the British with regard to how the Assyrians were being mistreated in Iraq contrary to the agreement at Iraq's independence to refrain from discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, he was stripped of his [[citizenship]] and refused re-entry.

Assyrians continued to serve the [[United Kingdom|British]] in Iraq (who maintained a military presence until 1954), despite earlier betrayals. Assyrian levies played an important role in putting down the pro Nazi Iraqi movement in [[World War II]], and served the British in the [[Mediterranean]], Middle Eastern and North African campaigns during the war.

The ''World Directory of Minorities'' states that there are over 300,000 Assyrian followers of the [[Chaldean Catholic]] rite in Iraq and that they live mainly in Baghdad. Until the 1950s, Chaldean Catholics were mostly settled in [[Mosul]]—in 1932, 70 percent of Assyrian Christians of all denominations lived there, but by 1957, only 47 percent remained, as they migrated southward due in part to ethnic and religious violence and regional and political tensions. It was estimated that about half of Iraq's Assyrian Christian's lived in Baghdad by 1979, accounting for 14 percent of that city's population

This period also marks the intensification of denominational antagonism among Assyrians in Iraq as some church institutions began to distance themselves from the members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] who were seen as magnets for Muslim antagonism.

===Simele Massacre===
During July 1933, about 800 armed Assyrians headed for the Syrian border, where they were turned back by the French. While [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] had briefly left the country for medical reasons, the Minister of Interior, [[Hikmat Sulayman]], adopted a policy aimed at a ''final solution'' of the "Assyrian problem". This policy was implemented by a Kurd, General [[Bakr Sidqi]]. After engaging in several unsuccessful clashes with armed Assyrian tribesmen, on 11 August 1933, Sidqi permitted his men to attack and kill about 3,000 unarmed Assyrian civilian villagers, including women, children and the elderly, at the Assyrian villages of [[Sumail]] (Simele) district, and later at [[Suryia]]. Having scapegoated the Assyrians as dangerous national traitors, this massacre of unarmed civilians became a symbol of national pride, and enhanced Sidqi's prestige. The British, though represented by a powerful military presence as provided by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, failed to intervene or allow the well disciplined [[Assyrian Levies]] under their command to do so, and indeed helped white-wash the event at the [[League of Nations]].

The Assyrian repression marked the entrance of the military into Iraqi politics, a pattern that has periodically re-emerged since 1958, and offered an excuse for enlarging conscription. The hugely popular Assyrian massacre, an indication of the latent [[anti-Christian]] atmosphere among the Muslim Arab, Kurdish and Turkmen population, also set the stage for the increased prominence of Bakr Sidqi. In October 1936, Bakr Sidqi staged the first military coup in the modern [[Arab world]].

==Republic of Iraq==

===Recognition of the Syriac language by the Ba'thist regime===
In the early 1970s, the secularist [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'ath]] regime initially tried to change the suppression of Assyrians in Iraq through different laws that were passed. On 20 February 1972, the government passed the law to recognize the cultural rights of Assyrians by allowing [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] be taught schools in which the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to [[Arabic]]. Aramaic was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools in which the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic, but it never happened. Special Assyrian programs were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were planned to be published in the capital. An Association of Syriac-Speaking Authors and Writers had also been established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.240.Add.3.En?OpenDocument |title=Twelfth periodic reports of States parties due in 1993 : Iraq. 14/06/96, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (the Iraqi government's point of view) |publisher=Unhchr.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill turned out to be a failure. The radio stations created as the result of this decree were closed after a few months. While the two magazines were allowed to be published, only 10 percent of their material was in Aramaic. No school was allowed to teach in Aramaic either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zindamagazine.com/html/archives/1999/feb22_1999.html |accessdate=February 28, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
[[File:Assyrian autonomy map 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|Assyrian villages in northern Iraq.]]
In modern times, Assyrians, for whom no reliable census figures exist in Iraq (as they do not for [[Kurds]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Yazidi]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] or [[Mandean]]s), have been doubly mistreated; first by their Kurdish neighbours who outnumber them greatly, then by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Baath Party|Ba'athist]] regime. Assyrians were deprived of their ethnic, cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. In northern Iraq today, a similar pattern was claimed to have emerging as Kurdistan Regional Government attempt to allegedly rewrite the history of the region to give it a Kurdish flavor and diminish its historic and far older Assyrian heritage. As in Ba'athist Iraq, there is a strong tendency in Iraq today to recognize only two ethnic groups: Arab or Kurd. Assyrians have claimed that Kurdish nationalists have enforced revisionist curricula in schools with a Kurdish-nationalist bias. This is controversial since it has been noted they ""alter historical and geographical facts"", including Assyrian place names which are changed to Kurdish names, and students are taught that King Nebuchadnezzar from the Old Testament married a Kurdish woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article155513600/Ein-Krieg-um-Schulbuecher-bestimmt-Syriens-Zukunft.html WELT] [http://www.aina.org/news/20160524145527.htm AINA]. According to Aboona, due to the very obscure history of the Kurds and the lack of historical sources, ""Kurds have been forced to look for what they wanted in others' nations sources" [such as Assyrian history]. "Most of the inhabitants of today's Kurdistan region were Christians and were later displaced or absorbed by Kurdish tribes. The scholarly consensus is that Kurdish tribes were living in nomadic and pastoral societys, living in their tents, divided into tribes and subtribes, and were "less disposed to adopt civilisation than the Persians or Turks". Between 1055 and 1536, many Assyrian worship centers in northern and northeastern ancient Assyrian "were raided and attacked by Kurds who killed, looted and enslaved the indigenous population." "During these times Kurds were moving into Assyrian regions." Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. . {{ISBN|978-1-60497-583-3}}. page 89-94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-invasion Iraq===
Reports from various sources "indicate a better human rights situation overall in the Kurdish-controlled areas of Northern Iraq than exists elsewhere in the country" (AI 2000, 135; U.K. Immigration &amp; Nationality Directorate Sept. 1999; USDOS 25 Feb. 2000)&lt;ref name="Refugees"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3dee0b564.html|title=Refworld {{!}} Iraq: Chaldean Christians|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=Refworld|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the reports, “while freedom of speech, religion, movement, and press are strongly restricted throughout Iraq, these freedoms do exist to a certain extent in parts of the Kurd-controlled area “(USDOS 25 Feb. 2000). However, reports regarding  isolated human rights abuses continued in 1999. The US State government reported that in 1999 Assyrian Christian Helena Aloun Sawa was murdered, and according to AINA, "the murder resembles a well-established pattern of complicity by Kurdish authorities in attacks against Assyrian Christians in the north". The murder was investigated by a commission appointed by the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|KDP]] but no results of the investigation were reported by year's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/nea/787.htm|title=Iraq|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees"/&gt; There were also incidents of mob violence by Muslims against Christians in northern Iraq. 

According to the UK Immigration &amp; Nationality Directorate "despite Tariq Aziz's lofty position in the Baghdad regime, Christians have little political influence in the Ba'ath government" (Sept. 1999)&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/|title=Refworld {{!}} The Leader in Refugee Decision Support|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=Refworld|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education in any language other than Arabic and Kurdish was prohibited by the government in Baghdad. Therefore, Assyrians were not permitted to attend classes in Syriac. In the Kurdish-controlled northern areas, classes in Syriac have been permitted since the 1991. However, according to some Assyrian sources "regional Kurdish authorities refused to allow the classes to begin" However, details of this practice were not available, and Kurdish authorities denied the accusations. In 1999, the Kurdistan Observer claimed that “the Central Government had warned the administration in the Kurdish region against allowing Turkoman, Assyrian, or Yazidi minority schools.&lt;ref name="refworld.org" /&gt;

According to the UK Immigration &amp; Nationality Directorate, "the Central Government has engaged various [sic] abuses against the Assyrian Christians, and has often suspected them of 'collaborating' with Kurds" (Sept. 1999). According to report by The World Directory of Minorities "Assyrians were unable to avoid the Kurdish conflict. As with the Kurds, some supported the government, others allied themselves with the Kurdish nationalist movement" (Minority Rights Group International 1997, 346).&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/index.htm|title=U.S. Department of State {{!}} Home Page|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-invasion Iraq===
Iraqi Christians have been victim of executions, forced displacement campaigns, torture, violence and target of Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Since the 2003 Iraq War, Iraqi Christians have fled from the country and their population has collapsed under the [[Government of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Vulnerable Ground |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/11/10/vulnerable-ground/violence-against-minority-communities-nineveh-provinces-disputed|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61689.htm|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majority of Christians have either fled to the Iraqi Kurdistan or abroad.

In 2003, Iraqi Christians were primary target of extremist Sunni Islamists. Many kidnapped Christians were forced to leave Christianity or tortured.

On August 1, 2004, a series of car bomb [[2004 Iraq churches attacks|attacks]] took place during the Sunday evening Mass in churches of two Iraqi cities, Baghdad and Mosul killing and wounding a large number of Christians. Jordanian jihadist and 1st emir of Al-Qaeda in Iraq [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] was blamed for the attacks.

In 2006, an Orthodox priest, Boulos Iskander, was snatched off the streets of Mosul by a Sunni Arab group that demanded a ransom. His body was later found, the priest's arms and legs had also been cut off.

In 2007, there were reports of a push to drive Christians out of the historically Christian suburb of Dora in southern Baghdad, with some Sunni extremists accusing the Christians of being allies of the Americans. A total number of 239 similar cases were registered by police between 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Greg|title=The Gospel of Rutba: War, Peace, and the Good Samaritan Story in Iraq|date=2012|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=9781608331130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtAu9jwDTy0C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=Christian+suburb+of+Dora+in+southern+Baghdad,+2007&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rc9-0znU91&amp;sig=SAm-5HYdCgu0cMGBPG6L7A-SMdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAgIvOi6zUAhVCDZoKHflECNEQ6AEIWTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20suburb%20of%20Dora%20in%20southern%20Baghdad%2C%202007&amp;f=false|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a priest called Ragheed Ganni, was shot dead in his church along with three of his companions. At the same year, there were reports that Christian students are harassed.

In 2008, the charity Barnabas conducted research into 250 Iraqi Christian IDPs who had fled to the north of the country (Iraqi Kurdistan) to seek refugee status and found nearly half had witnessed attacks on churches or Christians, or been personally targeted by violence.

In 2009, the Kurdistan Regional Government reported that more than 40,000 Christians had moved from Baghdad, Basra and Mosul to the Iraqi Kurdistan cities. The reports also stated that a number of Christians families who are moving to the Iraqi Kurdistan is growing and they were providing support and financial assistance for 11,000 of those families, and some are employed by the KRG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=http://cabinet.gov.krd/uploads/documents/Status_Christians_Kurdistan_Region_Dec_09__2009_12_22_h16m26s16.pdf |url=http://cabinet.gov.krd/uploads/documents/Status_Christians_Kurdistan_Region_Dec_09__2009_12_22_h16m26s16.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Sunni Islamist groups [[2010 Baghdad church massacre|attacked]] a Syrian Catholic church in Baghdad during Sunday evening Mass, on 31 October 2010 killing more than 60 and wounding 78 Iraqi Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shadid|first1=Anthony|title=Baghdad Church Attack Hits Iraq’s Core|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html|accessdate=7 June 2017|work=The New York Times|date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Islamist extremists assassinated Christian randomly using sniper rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/christian-attacks.aspx|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before the incident, 2 Christians had been shot for unknown reasons in Baghdad and 2 other Christians had been shot by Jihadist in Mosul. Human rights organizations has recorded 66 assault cases on churches and monasteries until 2012, as well as about 200 kidnappings. On 30 May 2011, a Christian man was beheaded by a Salafi extremist in Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.gchragd.org/sites/default/files/Nesira-religious-minority.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2011, a Catholic church was bombed by Sunni extremists in Turkmen area of Kirkuk, wounding more than 23 Christians.

On 15 August 2011, a church was bombed by al-Qaeda in Kirkuk center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohammed Tawfeeq |title=Iraq church bombing wounds at least 20|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/02/iraq.church.attack/|accessdate=7 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, during the [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|2014 Northern Iraq offensive]], the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIS) ordered all Christians in the area of its control, where Iraqi Army collapsed, to pay a special tax of approximately $470 per family, convert to Islam, or die. Many of them took refuge in nearby Kurdish-controlled regions of Iraq.

After Saddam Hussein's fall in 2003, the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while armed members of the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the [[Iraq Interim Governing Council]] briefly (September 2003 – June 2004) guiding Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, [[Younadem Kana]], a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since 1979.

Assyrians in post-Saddam Iraq have faced high rate of persecution by [[fundamentalist]] [[Islamist]] since the beginning of the [[Iraq War]]. By early August 2004 this persecution included church bombings, and fundamentalist groups' enforcement of Muslim codes of behavior upon Christians, e.g., banning alcohol, forcing women to wear [[hijab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3529364.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Analysis: Iraq's Christians under attack |date=2004-08-02 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence against the community has led to the exodus of perhaps as much as half of the community. While [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] only made just over 5% of the total [[Iraq]]i population before the war, according to the [[United Nations]],  Assyrians are over-represented among the Iraqi refugees (as much as 13%) who are stranded in [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061225/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_celebrating_christmas |authors=Qais al-Bashir, [[Associated Press]] |title=Iraqi Christians celebrate Christmas |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2008 the Assyrians formed their own militia, the [[Qaraqosh Protection Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95343489 |title=Christian Security Forces Growing Stronger In Iraq |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to protect Assyrian towns, villages and regions in the north. In 2008 the Assyrian Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Mosul was assassinated by some Kurds while some have claimed assassins were hired by local Arab tribes. Rahho was a defender of Assyrian self-administration. Some observers have claimed that Kurdish KDP forces often used to practice their shooting on important Assyrian cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ 2013, by Assyria Council of Europe and the Assyria Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Kurdish KDP security forces have been criticized for human rights abuses, abuses "ranged from threats and intimidation to detention in undisclosed locations without due process." In 2015, the local [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|KDP]] security forces arrested and detained political activist [[Kamal Said Kadir]], for having written articles on the Internet critical of the KDP. He was sentenced to a 30 years prison sentence. Some activists have claimed that party membership in Kurdish parties is necessary to obtain "employment and educational opportunities" in Iraqi Kurdistan. The US State department report said that "Kurdish authorities abused and discriminated against minorities in the North, including Turcomen, Arabs, Christians, and Shabak", and that Kurdish authorities "denied services to some villages, arrested minorities without due process and took them to undisclosed locations for detention, and pressured minority schools to teach in the Kurdish language". Christian minorities in Kirkuk also "charged that Kurdish security forces targeted Arabs and Turcomen".&lt;ref&gt;Iraq report, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 2005. March 8, 2006 http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61689.htm. "The Kurdish parties also control "the pursuit of formal education and the granting of academic positions". In 2015 Kurdish security forces in Bartalah reportedly broke up a peaceful demonstration by Shabak people, thereby assaulting several demonstrators. The US State department reported on allegations that the KRG discriminated against Christian minorities. Christians living in areas north of [[Mosul]] said that the KRG seized their property without compensation and that the KRG began building Kurdish settlements on their land. Assyrian Christians also said that the "KDP-dominated judiciary routinely discriminated against non-Muslims and legal judgments in their favor were not enforced". The Kurdish political parties "encouragd and supported resettlement of Kurds in Kirkuk outside the framework of the IPCC". However Arabs remained "in antagonistic and extremely poor conditions, facing pressure from Kurdish authorities to leave the province". In 2015 elections, many of the mostly Christian residents in the Ninewah Plain were unable to vote, "polling places did not open, ballot boxes were not delivered, and incidents of voter fraud and intimidation occurred". Kurdish militia refused to "allow ballot boxes to pass to predominantly Christian villages".  The KRG also reportedly "pressured NGOs into hiring only Kurds and dismissing non-Kurds on security grounds"."&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrians have criticized the kurdification of the school curricula, and have complained about the confiscation and occupation of Assyrian lands, and "that the Kurds invent new and impossible laws when the legitimate owners ask for their lands".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/releases/20111010102607.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] have criticized that while Kurds are very well funded, the Assyrian Christians receive almost no funding for their schools. Assyrians have also said that Kurds have modified and falsified school textbooks (kurdification) and changed traditional Christian names to Kurdish names. In textbooks it was even claimed that some biblical figures were Kurdish.&lt;ref name="welt.de"&gt;https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article155513600/Ein-Krieg-um-Schulbuecher-bestimmt-Syriens-Zukunft.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported that the man accused of killing the Christian politician Francis Yousif Shabo in 1993 is "allowed to walk around freely" in Kurdistan. The impunity for those who attacked or killed Assyrians in the  Kurdistan region was criticized.&lt;ref&gt;http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2010/6/state3940.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrian Christian David Jindo was one of many murdered Christian politicians. Other prominent Assyrian leaders who were killed by Kurdish nationalists include  Patriarch Mar Shimun, Franso Hariri, Margaret George (one of the first female Peshmerga) and Francis Shabo. Many of these figures were killed "in spite of their attempts to engage with, or  work under, Kurds".&lt;ref name="joshualandis.com"&gt;http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/the-assyrians-of-syria-history-and-prospets-by-mardean-isaac/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="joshualandis.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.syriacsnews.com/press-release-general-public-syriac-assyrian-chaldean-people/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015 David Jendo was killed, he was leader of the Assyrian Khabour guards. YPG members were sentenced to 12 and 20 years in prison for the crime.&lt;ref name="middleeasteye.net"&gt;http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tensions-soar-between-syrian-kurds-and-christians-1646831127&lt;/ref&gt; Qamilshi has been designated as the Kurdish capital in Syria, but  Assyrians believe the town was founded by their ancestors.&lt;ref name="middleeasteye.net"/&gt; A report "‘We had nowhere else to go’: Forced displacement and demolitions in northern Syria" by Amnesty International documented many cases of forced displacement and home demolitions amounting to war crimes carried out by the Autonomous Administration led by the Syrian Kurdish PYD party. The report also documented cases of "deliberate displacement of thousands of civilians and the razing of entire villages in areas under the control of the PYD.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/&lt;/ref&gt; The Aramean politician Johny Messo stated that the last attack by the YPG "on an Aramean Christian self-defense unit in Qamishli had killed one Aramean. Messo also criticized that Syria’s minorities "were not allowed to participate as an independent voice in the Geneva peace talks". He said that "there are thousands of Aramean Christians living in northern Syria, and the PYD is trying to intimidate and threaten them".&lt;ref&gt;http://aa.com.tr/en/politics/syrias-christians-pressured-by-forced-pyd-assimilation/541614&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrians lack many democratic rights compared to Kurds, with all important decisions being taken by Kurdish politicians of the PYD.&lt;ref name="welt.de"/&gt;

The US State government also reported that in Kurdish controlled areas Assyrian schools and classes Syriac were not permitted or prevented in some cases.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/nea/787.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There were also incidents of mob violence by Kurdistan Workers party (KWP) against Christians in northern Iraq.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; Christian Assyrians were also targeted in a series of bombings in Erbil in 1998 to 1999, and Assyrian groups have criticized the KRG for the lack of investigation.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt; According to the US Department of State the KDP blockaded Assyrian villages in 1999 and "later entered the villages and beat villagers". However, after invervention by the International Committee of the Red Cross the KDP left the villages again.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;

====''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons====
The publication of [[editorial cartoon|satirical cartoons]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in the [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' on September 30, 2005 led to an increase in violence against the Assyrian community. In the beginning, the cartoons did not get much attention at the time of its original publish, but when the Egyptian media picked up on the publication in late December 2005, violence and protests erupted around the world.

On January 29 six churches in the [[Iraq]]i cities of [[Baghdad]] and [[Kirkuk]] were targeted by car bombs, killing 13-year-old worshipper Fadi Raad Elias. No militants claimed to be retaliating for the pictures, nor is this the first time Iraqi churches have been bombed; but the bishop of the church stated "The church blasts were a reaction to the cartoons published in European papers. But Christians are not responsible for what is published in Europe."&lt;ref name="iraq_christians_on_edge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq Christians on edge as cartoon row escalates|date=2006-02-03|publisher=Reuters UK|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-02-03T112627Z_01_GEO338358_RTRUKOC_0_UK-RELIGION-CARTOONS-IRAQ.xml}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in Iraq now feel like "Westerners should not give wild statements [as] everyone can attack us [in response]" and "Today I'm afraid to walk the streets, because I'm Christian."&lt;ref name="iraq_christians_on_edge"/&gt;

Also on January 29, a Muslim Cleric in the Iraqi city of [[Mosul]] issued a [[fatwa]] stating, "Expel the (Assyrian) Crusaders and infidels from the streets, schools, and institutions because they have offended the person of the prophet."&lt;ref name="Elaph"&gt;{{cite news|date=2006-01-29|script-title=ar:تفجيرات الكنائس العراقية على علاقة برسومات الدنمارك |publisher=Elaph.com|url=http://www.elaph.com/ElaphWeb/Politics/2006/1/124132.htm|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that Muslim students beat up a Christian student at Mosul University in response to the fatwa on the same day.&lt;ref name="Elaph"/&gt;

On February 6, leaflets were distributed in [[Ramadi]], Iraq by the militant group "The Military Wing for the Army of Justice" demanding Christians to "halt their religious rituals in churches and other worship places because they insulted Islam and Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sotaliraq.com/iraqi-news/nieuws.php?id=17602 Sotaliraq.com - صوت العراق] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301092629/http://www.sotaliraq.com/iraqi-news/nieuws.php?id=17602 |date=March 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20060206123245.htm |title=Iraq Islamic Group Asks Christians to Stop Prayers in Churches |publisher=Aina.org |date=2006-02-06 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy====
The [[Pope Benedict XVI]] Islam controversy arose from a lecture delivered on 12 September 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI at the [[University of Regensburg]] in [[Germany]]. Many [[Islamic world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] registered protest against what they said was an insulting mischaracterization of Islam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm |title=BBC Article. ''In quotes: Muslim reaction to Pope'' last accessed September 17, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-16 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm |title=Article:''Pope sorry for offending Muslims'', last accessed September 17, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-17 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained in the quotation by the Pope of the following passage:{{cquote|Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;}}
After the Pope's comments were known throughout the [[Arab world]], several churches were bombed by insurgent groups. A previously unknown [[Baghdad]]-based group, Kataab Ashbal Al-Islam Al-Salafi ([[Islamic]] [[Salafist]] Boy Scout Battalions)&lt;ref name=ashbal group=Note&gt;Ashbāl has been mistranslated in the media as Boy Scout. The [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] defines ''shibl'' (plural ''ashbāl'' اشبال) as meaning "lion cub; a capable young man, brave youth, young athlete." Compare with [[Ashbal Saddam]] (Saddam's Lion Cubs).&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill all Christians in Iraq if the Pope does not apologize to Muhammad within three days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aina.org/news/20060916154058.htm |title=Christian Killed in Iraq in Response to Pope's Speech: Islamic Website |publisher= [[Assyrian International News Agency]] |date=September 16, 2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Leaders in Iraq have asked their parishioners not to leave their homes, after two Assyrians were stabbed and killed in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aina.org/news/20060917014616.htm |title=Second Assyrian Christian Killed in Retaliation for Pope's Remarks |publisher=Aina.org |date=September 17, 2006 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been reports of writing in Assyrian church doors stating "If the Pope does not apologise, we will bomb all churches, kill more Christians and steal their property and money." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060929iraq.shtml |title=Violence against Christians grows in Iraq, Ekklesia, 29 September 2006 |publisher=Ekklesia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi militia Jaish al-Mujahedin (Holy Warriors' Army) announced its intention to "destroy their cross in the heart of Rome… and to hit the Vatican."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,437461,00.html "Vatikan verschärft Sicherheitsvorkehrungen"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 16 September 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Pope's comments dying down in the media, attacks on Assyrian Christians continued and on October 9, Islamic extremist group kidnapped priest [[Paulos Iskander]] in Mosul. Iskander's church as well as several other churches placed 30 large posters around the city to distance themselves from the Pope's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?ArtKey=iraq |title=Growing violence against Christians in Iraq |publisher=Ianpaisley.org |date= October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatives of the Christian priest who was beheaded 3 days later in Mosul, have said that his Muslim captors had demanded his church condemn the pope's recent comments about Islam and pay a $350,000 ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/986D3437-8801-4AE2-91C1-860A42D5EB68.htm |title=2006 Iraq priest killed over pope speech |publisher=Aljazeera.net |date=12 October |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112105947/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/986D3437-8801-4AE2-91C1-860A42D5EB68.htm |archivedate=2006-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Assyirian objects and buildings have been  labeled by Kurdish authorities as Kurdish. Also many names of places and towns have been changed to Kurdish names. Observers have also reported that Kurdish forces often used to practice their shooting on important Assyrian cultural heritage sites.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An example of Kurdification is the attack on the Assyrian town [[Rabatki]] in2013 by General Aref al-Zebari and his brother Habib al-Hares Zabari, reportedly by Kurdish peshmerga soldiers. It has been reported that many Assyrian girls are forced into prostitution by Kurdish criminal organizations, and the families of these girls have also been threatened.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Massacres and harassment since 2003====
Massacres, [[ethnic cleansing]], and harassment has increased since 2003, according to a 73-page report by the [[Assyrian International News Agency]], released in Summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Incipient Genocide |url=http://www.aina.org/reports/ig.pdf |format=PDF |newspaper=Aina.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Doug |last=Bandow |title=Thrown to the Lions |newspaper=Spectator.org |date=July 2, 2007 |url=http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11665 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705190013/http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=11665 |archivedate=July 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2008 ([[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] day,) five Assyrian Churches, one Armenian Church, and a [[monastery]] in Mosul and Baghdad were coordinately attacked with multiple car bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ankawa.com/forum/index.php/topic,157932.0.html عاجل سلسلة تفجيرات تطال كنائس في بغداد والموصل&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.maktoob.com/News-20070423135913-Churches_monastery_bombed_in_Iraq_Police.aspx |title=Churches, monastery bombed in Iraq: Police |publisher=Business.maktoob.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110195828/http://business.maktoob.com/News-20070423135913-Churches_monastery_bombed_in_Iraq_Police.aspx |archivedate=2008-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi vice-president [[Tariq al-Hashimi]] expressed his "closeness to Christians", whom he called "brothers" in the face of this "attack that changed their joy to sadness and anxiety".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.1743312524 |title=AKI - Adnkronos international Iraq: Vice-president condemns church attacks |publisher=Adnkronos.com |date=2003-04-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on January 8, two more Churches were bombed in the city of [[Kirkuk]]; the Chaldean Cathedral of Kirkuk and the [[ACOE]] Maar Afram Church, wounding three bystandards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jBZZy2XNngjtpMOUTx-Yv_ZDLutA |title=AFP: Car bombings target churches in north Iraq |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2012-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724012949/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jBZZy2XNngjtpMOUTx-Yv_ZDLutA |archivedate=2012-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Iraq War]], there have been at least 46 Churches and Monasteries bombed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20080107163014.htm |title=Church Bombings in Iraq Since 2004 |publisher=Aina.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Threats on population====
{{main article|Assyrian exodus from Iraq}}
Leaders of Iraq's Christian community estimate that over two-thirds of the country's Christian population may have fled the country or been internally displaced since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. While exact numbers are unknown, reports suggest that whole neighborhoods of Christians have cleared out in the cities of [[Baghdad]] and [[Al-Basrah]], and that both Sunni and Shiite insurgent groups and militias have threatened Christians.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/05/A453003E-DEC4-491A-9069-81255C27A7FA.html2006 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907133733/http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/05/A453003E-DEC4-491A-9069-81255C27A7FA.html2006 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-07 |title=Population 'under attack', Radio Free Europe |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of the situation prompted Shiite Grand [[Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]] to ask Vice President Adil Abd al-Mahdi to take steps to protect the Christian community. Sunni imams in Baghdad have made similar statements to their congregations in Friday Prayer sermons.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

====Religious official targets====
Including those mentioned already, many other Assyrian religious officials have been targeted since 2003. [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]] priest [[Ragheed Aziz Ganni]] was murdered together with subdeacons [[Basman Yousef Dawid]], [[Wahid Hanna Isho]], and [[Gassan Isam Bidawed]] after the Sunday evening [[East Syrian Rite|Eucharist]] at Mosul's [[Holy Spirit]] Chaldean Church. [[Paulos Faraj Rahho]], Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Mosul, was found in a shallow grave in the northern city two weeks after he was kidnapped. [[Youssef Adel]], a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] priest with Saint Peter's Church in Baghdad's Karadda neighbourhood, was killed by gunmen while travelling on a car on April 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Christian priest shot dead in Baghdad, AFP&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 11, President Bush was interviewed by [[Cliff Kincaid]] of the [[EWTN]] Global Catholic Network; after being informed about the deteriorating situation of the Assyrians, President Bush was quoted as saying "This is a Muslim government that has failed to protect the Christians. In fact, it discriminates against them....It’s time to order U.S. troops to protect Christian churches and believers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cliff Kincaid |url=http://www.aim.org/aim-column/journalist-asks-bush-to-protect-iraqi-christians/ |title=Journalist Asks Bush to Protect Iraqi Christians |publisher=Aim.org |date=2008-04-11 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Growth of Assyrian Security Forces====

In October 2008, National Public Radio reported that a new phenomenon was spreading through the Assyrian Christian towns and villages of northern Iraq: Christian security forces, organized through their local churches, began manning checkpoints and working with the Iraqi police.  Father [[Daoud Suleiman]] from the Assyrian town of [[Bartella]] testified that without the Christian militias, Bartella and other villages would be in much worse shape than they are now.  A mysterious, media-shy, and wealthy Assyrian  [[Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo]] was a key player in this apparently straightforward story of a small beleaguered minority learning to stand up for itself once more.  He is the finance minister for the Kurdish regional government, and he is a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party believed to be close to Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.  New churches are going up across the north, paid for, everyone says, by Sarkis. New schools, more than 300 new apartments for displaced Christian families from the south, an Assyrian cultural center in Bartella — the list goes on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95343489/ NPR Reports on Iraqi Christians forming Security Forces]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009-2010 Violence====
Attacks against the community began again in December 2009 in [[Mosul]] and picked in February 2010. During this three-month period, over 20 Christians were assassinated and many churches of Mosul were targeted. The attacks led to 4,300 Assyrians fleeing Mosul to the [[Nineveh plains]] where there is an Assyrian majority population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/ASAZ-836CFE/$File/full_report.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A report by the United Nations tracked the refugees and reported people fleeing to the following Assyrian towns and villages:

&lt;/center&gt;

The deadliest attack against Assyrians since the war began was the [[2010 Baghdad church attack]] which occurred on October 31, 2010. The attack left at least 58 worshipers dead, including 2 priests. More than 100 had been taken hostage by an operation [[al-Qaeda]]-linked Sunni insurgent group the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] claimed responsibility for.

==Statistics==
A 1950 [[CIA]] report on Iraq estimated 98,000 Chaldeans, 30,000 Nestorians (Assyrians), 25,000 Syriac Catholics and 12,000 Jacobites.&lt;ref name=CIA-1950&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intelligence Survey: Iraq: Section 43|publisher=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001252339.pdf|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report used the name Assyrians, in the ethnic sense, for Nestorians, and also noted that Assyrians may be members of the Chaldean and Protestant Churches.&lt;ref name=CIA-1950/&gt;

The Iraqi Minorities Council and the Minority Rights Group International estimated that Iraq's pre-war Assyrian population was 800,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson |first=Patrick |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6293230.stm#graph |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Crushing Iraq's human mosaic |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-13 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statistics gathered by the [[Catholic Church]] when doing censuses of Chaldean Catholic diocese in Iraq in 2012 and 2013, [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldo-Assyrians]] in Iraq numbered 230,071 people.&lt;ref name="catholic-hierarchy.org"&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/rite/dch2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italians in Germany''' consist of ethnic [[Italians|Italian]] migrants to [[Germany]] and their descendants, both those originating from Italy as well as from among the communities of [[Italians in Switzerland]]. Most Italians moved to Germany for reasons of work, others for personal relations, study, or political reasons. Today, Italians in Germany form one of the largest [[Italian diaspora]]s in the world and account for one of the largest immigrant groups in Germany.

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013076-0001, Walsum, Unterricht Gastarbeiter.jpg|thumb|right|Italian emigrants in Germany (called "Gastarbeiter"), receiving instruction in 1962]]

Large numbers of Italians have resided in Germany since the [[early Middle Ages]], particularly architects, craftsmen and traders. During the [[late Middle Ages]] and early modern times many Italians came to Germany for business, and relations between the two countries prospered. The political borders were also somewhat intertwined under the German princes' attempts to extend control over all the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which extended from northern Germany down to southern Italy. During the [[Renaissance]] many Italian bankers, architects and artists moved to Germany and successfully integrated in the German society.

When the huge [[italian diaspora|Italian emigration of the 19th century]] began, only a few Italians moved to the [[German Empire]] under Prussian rule.

With Germany's post-[[World War II]] economic boom ([[Wirtschaftswunder]]), a large wave of immigrants from Italy relocated to Germany. Italy and Germany have been joint members of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (later the [[European Economic Community]]). Since the establishment of [[freedom of movement for workers]] between the two countries in 1961, more than 580,000 Italians migrated to Germany for work, mainly from southern and north-eastern Italy. Among the German cities [[Wolfsburg]] and [[Ludwigshafen]] had the highest share of Italian migrants in 2011 according to German Census data. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kartenseite.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/italiener-in-deutschland-landkreise/ |title=Kartenseite: Italiener in Deutschland - Landkreise |publisher=kartenseite.wordpress.com |date=2017-03-26 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The workers in the Contemporary Art Museum of Casoria in Naples, Italy, proposed a plea of [[Asylum in Germany|asylum to Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,743621,00.html 'A Warning Scream from Italian Art': Naples Museum Requests Asylum in Germany] Der Spiegel 2011-02-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organised crime==
In 2017 there wre 14 organized crime trials of [[Italian mafia]] groups. The following groups were involved:&lt;ref name="bka_ok_2017_p20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Publikationen/JahresberichteUndLagebilder/OrganisierteKriminalitaet/organisierteKriminalitaetBundeslagebild2017.html;jsessionid=A99EC3231788A672D2AEA397F21B1FEC.live2302?nn=27988|title=BKA  -  Bundeslagebilder Organisierte Kriminalität - Bundeslagebild Organisierte Kriminalität 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bka.de|page=20|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ndrangheta]], seven trials
* [[Cosa Nostra]], three trials
* [[Camorra]] two trials.

The major activity of these groups was cocaine [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. In these trials 169 suspects were reported, of which 139 were Italian citizens.&lt;ref name="bka_ok_2017_p20" /&gt;

==Social integration==
Italians in Germany are actively involved both in regional and federal [[Politics of Germany|German politics]]; areas of concern are [[European integration]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].

They also had a substantial influence on the development of Fine Arts in Germany from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] to contemporary fashion and design.

[[File:Kasbah of Sfax.jpg|thumb|[[Kasbah of Sfax]], [[Tunisia]], [[Maghreb]]]]

A '''kasbah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|z|b|ə|,_|-|b|ɑː|,_|ˈ|k|ɑː|z|-}}; {{lang-ar|قَـصْـبَـة|qaṣbah}}, "central part of a town or citadel"; also known as '''qasaba''', '''gasaba''' and '''quasabeh''', in older English '''casbah''' or '''qasbah''', in [[India]] '''qassabah''' and in Spanish '''alcazaba''' (remains of the [[Moorish Spain]])) is a type of [[Medina quarter|medina]] or fortress ([[citadel]]).&lt;ref&gt;Morocco Baedeker Guide -Ingeborg Lehmann, Rita Henss – 2012  Page 214 "KASBAH A mud-brick castle that serves as a residence for the local Berber tribe is called a kasbah or »tighremt« in Morocco. Some are private mansions, others are even whole fortified villages with many large and small buildings crowded on ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Marrakesh Fez Rabat [[Barnaby Rogerson]] – 2000– Page 65 "as its purpose, for a kasbah should be the domain of a ruler, be he sultan, governor or just a tribal chieftain. Most of the ancient cities of Morocco retain a large portion of their outer walls, but the kasbah (the government citadel containing ... "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morocco – A Country Study Guide Usa Ibp, International Business Publications, USA. – 2006  Page 229 "[[Abd al-Mu'min|Sultan Abdelmoumen]] transformed what was not much more than a Casbah and built a mosque and a palace here too."&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the word ''kasbah'' is varied, including [[keep]], [[Old town|old city]] and [[watchtower]] or [[blockhouse]]. 

==Keep==
[[File:Kasbah Glaoui in Télouet Morocco.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Telouet Kasbah]] main building, [[Morocco]], [[North Africa]]]]

In [[Morocco]] and in [[Iberia]], the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word form of ''kasbah'' frequently refers to multiple buildings in a [[keep]], a [[citadel]], or several structures behind a defensive wall. The Spanish word ''[[alcazaba]]'' is a [[cognate]] naming the equivalent building in [[Andalusia]] or [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Spain]]. In Portuguese, it evolved into the word ''alcáçova''. In Catalan, the evolution resulted in "alcassaba". A kasbah was a place for the local leader to live and a defense when a city was under attack. A kasbah has high walls, usually without windows. Sometimes, like in [[Tangiers]], they were built on hilltops so that they could be more easily defended. Some were placed near the entrance to harbors. Having a kasbah built was a sign of [[wealth]] of some families in the city. When [[French Algeria|colonization started]] in 1830, in northern [[Algeria]], there were a great number of kasbahs that lasted for more than 100 years.

==Old city==
The word ''kasbah'' may also be used to describe the old part of a city, in which case it has the same meaning as a [[medina quarter]]. Some of the prominent examples of kasbah as an old city is the [[Casbah of Algiers]] and the [[Casbah of Dellys]]. In Turkish and [[Urdu]] the word ''kasaba'' refers to a settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city; in short, a town. In [[Serbo-Croatian]], ''kasaba'' (Cyrillic: касаба) means an undeveloped, provincial small town. In India, a qasbah is a small town distinguished by the presence of Muslim families of rank.&lt;ref&gt;Boundaries and identities: Muslims, work and status in Aligarh E. A. Mann – 1992 p. 23 " "A qasbah is a small town distinguished by the presence of 'decent people or families of some rank' (Platts, 1974). ."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watchtower==
[[Image:Baha-old-architecture.jpg|thumb|Kasbah watchtower in the [[Hejaz]]i city of [[Al Baha]], [[Saudi Arabia]]]]

In [[Al-Baha]]h and [[Asir]] provinces of [[Saudi Arabia]] and in [[Yemen]], the word "qasaba" usually refers to a single stone or rock tower, either as part of a [[tower house]] or a tower isolated on a hilltop or commanding a field. The Encyclopædia Britannica defines it as: "Ancient qasaba ("towers") found in the province were used as lookouts or granaries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485531/qasaba The New Encyclopædia Britannica. 1998. "Asir." 15th edition. Volume 1, "Micropedia". Page 635.]&lt;/ref&gt; Another book describes these towers as follows: "Apparently unique to Asir architecture are the qasaba towers. Controversy surrounds their function - some argue that they were built as [[lookout]]s, and others that they were [[keep]]s, or even granaries. Perhaps it is a combination, although the right position of a [[watchtower]], on a hill top, is the wrong place for a keep or [[granary]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mostyn, Trevor. 1983. Saudi Arabia- A MEED Practical Guide. London: Middle East Economic Digest. 2nd edition. Page 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologists have found images of similar towers in the ruins of [[Qaryat al-Fāw]], in the [[Rub' al-Khali]] or the [[Empty Quarter]] of Saudi Arabia, that date from between the third century BCE to the 4th century or our era. "Homes rose two stories, supported by stone walls nearly two meters (6') thick and boasting such amenities as water-supply systems and second-floor latrines. One eye-catching mural faintly depicts a multi-story tower house with figures in the windows: Its design resembles similar dwellings today in [[Yemen]] and southern [[Saudi Arabia]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201102/roads.of.arabia.htm Covington, Richard. 2011. "Roads of Arabia." Saudi Aramco World. March/April 2011. Pages 24-35.]&lt;/ref&gt; "Most of the qasabas have a circular plan, although some are square. Sometimes they have a band of [[quartz]] stones just below the windows or framing the windows- one well preserved examples is at the top of Wadi Ain. The remains of a [[martello tower]]-like stone structure are just off the dirt track north of Al-Masnah. It appears to be an interesting antecedent of the [[Asir]] farmhouse and perhaps closely related to the qasaba. It is in ruins now, but was once a dwelling and is strongly defensive."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; One account says about a traditional village in Al-Bahah, Saudi Arabia: "Even the road that leads to the village is impressive, and several historical stone and slate towers dot the way. Al-Bahah Province is known as the region of 1001 towers, once built to protect villages, roads and plantations from rivalling tribes. Today, these towers are abandoned, and many of them are partially or completely in ruins."&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlasobscura.com/place/marble-village-of-dhee-ayn "Marble Village of Dhee Ayn."]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26609">This is a list of bodies that regulate [[standard language]]s, often called '''language academies'''. Language academies are motivated by, or closely associated with, [[linguistic purism]] and [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]], and typically publish [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] [[dictionaries]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, George (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=G18NAQAAMAAJ ''Linguistic purism''] p.108, quotation: {{quotation|Whereas a number of the puristically motivated language societies have assumed ''de facto'' responsibility for language cultivation, the decisions of the academies have often had the force of law. ... Since academies are so closely associated with the notion of purism, a brief word on their history may not be out of place. The first academy to deal expressly and exclusively with language matters was the ''Accademia della Crusca'' ... Its orientation was essentially conservative, favouring a return to the Tuscan language as cultivated in the fourteenth century over the innovations of contemporary renaissance poets such as Torquato Tasso. ... One of its first tasks&amp;nbsp;-- as with so many academies to follow&amp;nbsp;-- was to produce a large-scale prescriptive dictionary of Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which purport to officiate and prescribe the meaning of words and pronunciations. A language regulator may also be descriptive, however, while maintaining (but not imposing) a standard spelling. Many language academies are private institutions, although some are governmental bodies in different states, or enjoy some form of government-sanctioned status in one or more countries. There may also be multiple language academies attempting to regulate the same language, sometimes based in different countries and sometimes influenced by political factors.

Many [[world language]]s have one or more language academies. However, the degree of control that the academies exert over these languages does not render the latter [[controlled natural language]]s in the sense that the various kinds of "[[Simple English (disambiguation)|simple English]]" (e.g. [[Basic English]], [[Simplified Technical English]]) or [[George Orwell]]'s fictional [[Newspeak]] are. They instead remain [[natural language]]s to a considerable extent and are thus not [[formal language]]s such as [[Attempto Controlled English]]. They have a degree of [[standardization]] that allows them to function as [[standard language]]s (e.g. [[standard French]]). The [[English language]] has never had a formal regulator anywhere.

==Auxiliary languages==

=== Esperanto ===
Apart from the [[Akademio de Esperanto]], most auxiliary languages, also known as constructed languages ([[Conlangs]]) have no true linguistic regulators, language academies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Johan Derks, Prilingvaj institutoj de 18 naciaj lingvoj ([https://www.academia.edu/s/7d5e7b91ca/language-institutes-of-eighteen-states#comment_115944 Language Institutes of eighteen states]), Interlingvistikaj Studoj, UAM, 2014/17, Esperanta Interlingvistiko 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] have been ''constructed'' (or planned) by a person or small group, before being adopted and further developed by communities of users through [[Evolutionary linguistics|natural language evolution]].

Bodies such as the [[Akademio de Esperanto]] look at questions of usage in the light of the original goals and principles of the language.

===Interlingua===
The auxiliary language [[Interlingua]] has no regulating body, as its vocabulary, grammar, and orthography are viewed as a product of ongoing social forces. In theory, Interlingua therefore evolves independent from any human regulator. Interlingua's vocabulary is [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|verified and recorded]] by dynamically applying certain general principles to an existing set of natural languages and their etymologies. The [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] ceased to exist in 1954, and according to the secretary of [[Union Mundial de Interlingua]] "Interlingua doesn't need its Academy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Lohani'''(لوحانی), sometimes called '''Nuhani''' is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe. The renowned personality and spiritual leader of Bettani tribe is '''Sheikh Mohammad Rohani''' (1220-1305 AD)(Pashto:شيخ محمد روحانى) also known as Shah Mohammad Rohani and Rohani Ba Ba was a Sufi cleric born around 1220 AD. The cleric, whose shrine in southern Afghanistan attracts thousands of Sufi visitors every year The Lohani(لوحانی), sometimes called Nuhani found in [[Pakistan]] especially in the region of Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, Shakargarh, Afghanistan and India (Bassi Dulat Khan). 

They were a mostly pastoral and migratory tribe engaged in Commerce and Trade but nowadays most of them have settled down in the plains of DI Khan, Tank and Lakki Marwat. Lohanis have four branches, Marwat, Daulat Khel, MiaKhail and Tatoor. The Tatoor tribe was crushed by Nadir shah and Daulat khel (Nawab of Tank) who brought them near to extinction. Therefore, nowadays Tatoor tribe is generally dispersed in the region of Tank, Dera Ismail khan and FR Tank and especially found in village Tatoor near Tank city.

==History==
Lohanis, like other Lodi tribes, were originally inhabitants of [[Ghor]]. From Ghor they descended into [[Ghazni]], and engaged in pastoral pursuits.Due to conflict with neighboring [[Ghilzais]], they migrated to Katawaz and from there they moved to the plains of Daman in the 16th century. A big portion of the tribe migrated to India on invitation of Lodi Sultans of [[Delhi]] where they became the most prominent participants in the sultanate administration and army. During Ibrahim Lodi's reign, the Lohanis of south Bihar rebelled and carved out an independent kingdom for themselves which was later incorporated into Suri empire. In their homeland, conflict arose between Lohani clans over distribution of land and revenue of Daman tract and after some battles, the [[Marwat]] and MiaKhail clans of Lohani migrated from Daman to Lakki and DI Khan tracts respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Haroon Rashid, "History of the Pathans", Vol.III, p-367-89&lt;/ref&gt;

Jhalori dynasty of Lohani clan ruled [[Palanpur State]] in India from thirteenth century to twentieth century.

According to the 1941 census of India, there were 5.9 million non-Muslims in the provinces that today form Pakistan.

==Religious minorities==

===Demographics===
{{see also|Demographics of Pakistan|Religion in Pakistan}}

According to the [[Government of Pakistan]]'s [[National Database and Registration Authority]] (NADRA), in 2012, the population of registered religious minorities in Pakistan was as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/430059/over-35000-buddhists-bahais-call-pakistan-home/&lt;/ref&gt;

*Hindus: 1,414,527
*Christians: 1,270,051
*Ahmedis: 125,681
*Baha'is: 33,734
*Sikhs: 6,146
*Parsis: 4,020
*Buddhists: 1,492
*Others: 66,898

According to the most recent (1998) census conducted by the Government of Pakistan, Hindus make up 1.20% of the population and Christians (Protestant and Roman Catholic) 1.9%, or around 2.3 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_religion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617205811/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/other_tables/pop_by_religion.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other estimates put the numbers higher.  Historically, there was also a small contingent of [[Pakistani Jews|Jews in Pakistan]] who emigrated to Israel in 1948.

The U.S. State Department's [[International Religious Freedom Report]] 2002 estimates the [[Shia|Shi'a]] population between 10-12%,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14026.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  among which around 900,000 are [[Ismaili]]s which is a sect of Shi'i Muslims and who pay tribute to their living spiritual leader, the [[Aga Khan]]. It also lists Christians at 2.09 million; Ahmadis at 286,000, Hindus at 1.03 million; [[Zoroastrianism|Parsis]], Buddhists, and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] at 20,000 each; and [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'is]] at 30,000.

In a 2011 book, [[Ishtiaq Ahmed (political scientist)|Ishtiaq Ahmed]] wrote that "Some independent studies, however, suggest that the non-Muslims population of Pakistan is nearly 10 per cent and Hindus, Christians and Ahmadis make up four million each. It is generally noted that while majorities play down minority figures, the minorities inflate them. This is especially true of the Ahmadiyya community. Official statistics return less than half a million for them while the Ahmadis claim to be around ten million."&lt;ref name="Ahmed2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ishtiaq Ahmed|title=The Politics of Religion in South and Southeast Asia|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-72703-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination and violence===
{{see also | Religious discrimination in Pakistan | Forced_conversion#Pakistan | label 2 = Forced conversion of minorities in Pakistan | Freedom of religion in Pakistan | Sectarian violence in Pakistan}}

According to the 2012 [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] (USCIRF) annual report, "The government of Pakistan continues to engage in and tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief."&lt;ref name="WT-USCRIF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osce.org/odihr/94875&lt;/ref&gt; The USCIRF has designated Pakistan as "country of particular concern" since 2002.&lt;ref name="WT-USCRIF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/tier1-countries-of-particular-concern.html&lt;/ref&gt; The report argues that "The [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|country’s blasphemy law]]s, used predominantly in [[Punjab]] but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and this frequently results in imprisonment. The USCIRF is aware of at least 16 individuals on [[death row]] and 20 more serving life sentences. The blasphemy law, along with anti-Ahmadi laws that effectively criminalise various practices of their faith, has created a climate of vigilante violence. Hindus have suffered from the climate of violence and hundreds have fled Pakistan for India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amina Jilani|date=May 10, 2013|title=Of particular concern|publisher=[[The Express Tribune]]''|url=tribune.com.pk/story/546987/of-particular-concern/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farahnaz Ispahani]] who was the media advisor to the [[President of Pakistan]] from 2008 to 2012, has blamed the successive Pakistani governments of pursuing a "slow genocide" against minorities to shore up their political base, especially accusing [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] of creating a militant group to target them, the [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] whose sole job was to harass [[Shias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/F4r3Tmf51k8Sm6DGjPRaEN/Slow-genocide-of-minorities-in-Pakistan-Farahnaz-Ispahani.html|title=Slow genocide of minorities in Pakistan: Farahnaz Ispahani Mint|publisher=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC FAQ notes that "Beginning in 1980, a slew of clauses was added to the chapter of religious offences in the [[Pakistan Penal Code]]. These clauses can be grouped into two categories - the anti-Ahmadi laws and the blasphemy laws." The BBC notes that three is widespread popular support for these laws in Pakistan, and that two prominent critics of these laws, [[Salman Taseer]] and [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], have been assassinated in 2011. Regarding the blasphemy laws, the BBC observes that: "Hundreds of Christians are among the accused - at least 12 of them were given the death sentence for blaspheming against the Prophet."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12621225 Q&amp;A: Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Rights Watch]] noted that the condition of religious minorities deteriorated sharply in 2012, with the government unwilling or unable to provide protection against attacks by extremists or to reign in abuses committed by its own security forces.&lt;ref name=dawnhrwreport&gt;{{cite news|title=Security forces allowing extremists to attack minorities: HRW|url=http://dawn.com/2013/02/02/security-forces-allowing-extremists-to-attack-minorities-hrw/|accessdate=9 May 2013|newspaper=Dawn|date=2 Feb 2013|quote=“The Human Rights Watch has accused the government of having failed to act against abuses committed by security and intelligence agencies which are letting extremist groups to attack religious minorities....Pakistan’s human rights crisis worsened markedly in 2012 with religious minorities bearing the brunt of killings and repression,” said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan Director of Human Rights Watch.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/01/pakistan-abuses-impunity-erode-rights&lt;/ref&gt; Mass anti-Christian violence recently occurred in the [[2009 Gojra riots]] and in the 2013 Joseph Colony riot and the 2013 [[Gujranwala]] riot.&lt;ref&gt;Sonya Rehman (April 5, 2013) Joseph Colony: Attacked and Unprotected, ''[[The Diplomat]]'' thediplomat.com/the-pulse/2013/04/05/joseph-colony-christian-community-in-lahore-attacked-and-unprotected/2/?all=true&lt;/ref&gt; Recent anti-Shia violence includes the [[February 2012 Kohistan Shia Massacre]], the [[August 2012 Mansehra Shia Massacre]]&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan Shias killed in Gilgit sectarian attack www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19280339&lt;/ref&gt; and the particularly deadly [[January 2013 Pakistan bombings|January 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;Formidable power of Pakistan's anti-Shia militants www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20983153&lt;/ref&gt; and [[February 2013 Quetta bombing]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/10/pakistan-bomb-billiards-hall/1823409/&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan was targeted in the similarly deadly [[May 2010 attacks on Ahmadi mosques in Lahore]]; the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted on that occasion that "Minority sects like the Ahmadis and the Shiites and have come under increasing pressure as religious extremism has taken hold, fomented by sectarian groups like [[Jaish-e-Mohammad]] and [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], formerly state-sponsored organizations."&lt;ref&gt;Attackers Hit Mosques of Islamic Sect in Pakistan https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/world/asia/29pstan.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey carried out by All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement Pakistan's revealed that out of 428 Hindu temples in Pakistan only around 20 survive today and they remain neglected by the [[Evacuee Trust Property Board]] which controls those while the rest had been converted for other uses since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/686952/95-of-worship-places-put-to-commercial-use-survey/ |title=95% of worship places put to commercial use: Survey |last=Gishkori |first=Zahid  |access-date=13 October 2017 |work=The Express Tribune |publication-date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990s nearly 1000 Hindu temples were targeted by the frenzied Islamists for vandalism destruction according to journalist Reema Abbasi.&lt;ref name=islamshit5&gt;[http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-hindus-of-pakistan/ The Hindus of Pakistan], Friday Times,  Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities sometimes have to hide their identity, adopt Muslim names and mannerism to survive and live in fear in areas like [[Lahore]] while hundreds of temples have been vandalized or demolished.&lt;ref name=islamshit5/&gt;

[[File:Mrs Graham's XI in 1895.jpg|thumb|280px|The British Ladies Football Club North Team - Mrs Graham's XI was a women's football team (in 1895)]]
'''Mrs Graham's XI''' was a women's [[association football|football]] team formed by [[Helen Matthews]] in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] in 1881. It is considered the first British women's football team and a pioneering team in the history of the sport.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tate|first1=Tim|title=Girls With Balls: The Secret History of Women's Football|date=2013|publisher=John Blake|isbn=1782196862|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYknAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Girls+with+Balls%22+Tate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHj-OYjf_SAhWmh1QKHXUxCJkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Girls%20with%20Balls%22%20Tate&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was not safe for women to play football without harassment, the players used pseudonyms to protect their identities. Matthews, also a goalkeeper for the team, claimed to be "Mrs Graham".&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;

==History==
The first record of the team coming together to play football occurred on 9 May 1881, at Edinburgh's [[Easter Road Stadium]]. The match was billed as a Scotland v England international.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTF&gt;Domeneghetti, R. (2014) ''From the Back Page to the Front Room: Football's journey through the English media'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lmWLBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PT155#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 155] Ockley Books. {{ISBN|1783015586}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Just over a week later, on 20 May 1881,&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt; the teams played in Glasgow in front of 5,000 spectators. The match was abandoned in the 55th minute after a violent pitch invasion during which the women were "roughly jostled", and chased by a mob as they left the grounds.&lt;ref name="gwb_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; Further games resulted in similar pitch invasions, which soon resulting in ending this early attempt to introduce women's football.&lt;ref name=UB/&gt;

The press coverage, which would dominate coverage of women's football for the next century, was clearly established in 1881: barely disguised contempt regarding player appearance, including costume, and the standard of play,&lt;ref name=BTF/&gt; overlaid with a certainty that football was a rough man's game unsuitable for women.&lt;ref name=UB&gt;Laycock, S. &amp; Laycock, P. (2014) ''Unexpected Britain'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fKelBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT199&amp;dq=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;pg=PT199#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20ladies%20football%20team&amp;f=false page 199] Amberley Publishing. {{ISBN|1445632845}} Retrieved February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to form a new club was made by Matthews&lt;ref name=DSS&gt;Tomlinson, A.

The '''Muhammadzai''' (also Mohammadzai, Mohammedzai,  Mohmandzai, Mamanzai, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Murray, James Wolfe. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=L6VFgdgymHQC&amp;dq=mohmandzai&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Dictionary of the Pathan Tribes on the North-West Frontier of India]''. Calcutta: Office of the Superintendent, Government Printing, India, 1899. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Sarbani]] [[Pashtun tribe]].  There should not be confused with the [[Muhammadzai]] of the [[Barakzai]] [[Durrani]], who were for many years the ruling family of Afghanistan.  
This group of Muhammadzai is located in (Charsadda) modern day Pakistan, has an altogether different Pashtun lineage, son of '''Zamand'''  (Jamand) third  son of [[Kharshbun]].

==Origins==
According to Pashtun genealogy, the Muhammadzai are descended from [[Qais Abdur Rashid]] through his son  [[Sarbani]], and his son [[Kharshbun]]. The Afghan Muhammadzai (Barakzai) are descendants of Sharkhbun and Kharshbun is his brother.  [[Kharshbun]] had three sons, '''Kand''' , '''Zamand''' , '''Kasi'''. Muhammad, was Zamand (Jamand) son so they Popular with the Muhammadzai tribe (see chart below).&lt;ref&gt;Caroe, Olaf. ''The Pathans, 550 B.C. - A.D. 1957''.

==Location and Organization==
The Muhamamdzai are found primarily in Hashtnagar, an area in today's Charsadda District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan that borders the Swat River's left bank.  They were originally said to have resided zhob region, but moved to Charsadda region and were given the Hashtnagar by the [[Yusufzai]].&lt;ref&gt;Elphinstone, Mountstuart.

[[File:Oceania UN Geoscheme Regions with Zones and ISO3166 labels.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Pacific Islanders originate from countries within the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] regions of Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia.&lt;br&gt;New Zealand is uniquely within [[Australasia]] as well as Polynesia and its majority European and native [[Māori people|Māori]] populations are not considered Pacific Islanders.]]

'''Pacific Islanders''' or '''Pasifikas''', are the peoples of the [[Pacific Islands]]. It is a geographic and often ethnic/racial term to describe the inhabitants of any of the three major sub-regions of Oceania: [[Micronesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. These people speak various [[Austronesian languages]].

[[New Zealand]] has the largest concentration of Pacific Islanders in the world. However, the majority of its people are not identified as Pacific Islanders—instead during the 20th century and into the 21st century the country saw a steady stream of immigration from Polynesian countries such as [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]] and [[French Polynesia]].

==Pacific Islander regions==
{{See also|Pacific Islands}}

According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the Pacific islands consist of three regions:

===Polynesia===
The islands are scattered across a triangle covering the east-central region of the Pacific Ocean. The triangle is bound by the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in the north, [[New Zealand]] in the west, and [[Easter Island]] in the east. The rest of Polynesia includes the [[Samoan islands]] ([[American Samoa]] and [[Western Samoa]]), the [[Cook Islands]], [[French Polynesia]] ([[Tahiti]] and The [[Society Islands]], [[Marquesas Islands]], [[Austral Islands]] and the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]), [[Niue]] Island, [[Tokelau]] and [[Tuvalu]], [[Tonga]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[Rotuma Island]] and [[Pitcairn Island]].

===Melanesia===
The island of [[New Guinea]], the Bismarck and Louisiade archipelagos, the [[Admiralty Islands]], [[Bougainville Island]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Aru Islands]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] (part of the Solomon Islands), [[New Caledonia]] and [[Loyalty Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] (formerly New Hebrides), [[Fiji]], [[Norfolk Island]] and various smaller islands.

===Micronesia===
The islands of [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]], the [[Marianas]] ([[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]]), the Republic of the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Palau]], and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] ([[Yap]], [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]], [[Pohnpei]], and [[Kosrae]], all in the [[Caroline Islands]]).

==Ethnolinguistics==
[[Ethnic group|Ethnolinguistically]], those Pacific islanders who reside in Oceania are divided into two different ethnic classifications.
;Austronesian language peoples
*[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian peoples]] who speak the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanian languages]], numbering about 2.3 million, who occupy Polynesia, Micronesia, and most of the smaller islands of Melanesia.
;Papuan language peoples
*[[Papuan people]]s, those who speak the [[Papuan languages]], who number about 7 million, and reside on the island of [[New Guinea]] and a few of the smaller islands of Melanesia located off the northeast coast of New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacific Islands on Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437647/Pacific-Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of phrase by country==
===Australia===
In Australia the term [[South Sea Islander]] was used to describe Australian descendants of people from the more than 80 islands in the western Pacific who had been brought to Australia to work on the sugar fields of Queensland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/radio/rpf/stories/s1314059.htm|title = South Sea Islander Project|work = ABC Radio Regional Production Fund|publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation|year = 2004|accessdate = 2008-08-27|quote = Recognition for Australian South Sea Islanders (ASSI) has been a long time coming. It was not until 1994 that the federal government recognized them as a distinct ethnic group with their own history and culture and not until September 2000 that the Queensland government made a formal statement of recognition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century called [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanakas]]. The ''[[Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901]]'' was enacted to restrict entry of Pacific Islanders to Australia and to authorise their deportation. In the legislation Pacific Islanders were defined as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Pacific Island Labourer" includes all natives not of European extraction of any island except the islands of New Zealand situated in the Pacific Ocean beyond the Commonwealth [of Australia] as constituted at the commencement of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth4i_doc_1901.pdf |format=PDF|title = Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 (Cth) |work = Documenting a Democracy |publisher = National Archives of Australia |year = 1901 |accessdate = 2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2008 a Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme was announced as a three-year pilot scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Institute of Criminology: [http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/421-440/tandi432.html Australia's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme: Managing vulnerabilities to exploitation]&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme provides visas for workers from Kiribati, Tonga, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea to work in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/17/2337828.htm |title = Pacific guestworker scheme to start this year |date = 2008-08-17 |publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme includes one country each from Melanesia (Vanuatu), Polynesia (Tonga) and Micronesia (Kiribati), countries which already send workers to New Zealand under its seasonal labour scheme. Australia's pilot scheme also includes Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/parlsec/releases/2008/dk007.html |title = Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme is more proof of Australia's new Pacific focus |publisher = The Hon Duncan Kerr SC MP; Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs | date = 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian classification standards code Pacific islanders, Oceanians, South Sea islanders, and Australasians all with code 1000, i.e., identically. This coding can be broken down into the finer classification of 1,100 Australian Peoples; 1,200 New Zealand peoples; 1,300 Melanesian and Papuan; 1,400 Micronesian; 1,500 Polynesian. There is no specific coding therefore for "Pacific islander".{{cite web|url = http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/00A57A2C8FE19CACCA2570360074713B/$File/12490_2005.pdf|title = Australian Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ASCCEG) - 2nd edition| date = 2005-07-07|format = pdf - 136 pages|publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|accessdate = 2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local usage in [[New Zealand]] uses "Pacific islander" (or ''Pasifika'') to distinguish those who have emigrated from one of these areas in modern times from the indigenous [[Māori people|New Zealand Māori]],&lt;!--"New Zealand" to distinguish from Cook Islands Maori--&gt; who are also Polynesian but arrived in New Zealand centuries earlier.

In the [[2013 New Zealand census]], 7.4 percent of the New Zealand population identified with one or more Pacific ethnic groups, although 62.3 percent of these were born in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZ stats"&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/pacific-peoples.aspx "Pacific peoples ethnic group"], 2013 Census. [[Statistics New Zealand]]. Accessed on 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those with a Samoan background make up the largest proportion, followed by Cook Islands Maori, Tongan, and Niuean.&lt;ref name="NZ stats"/&gt; Some smaller island populations such as [[Niue]] and [[Tokelau]] have the majority of their nationals living in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Smelt, and Lin, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the diverse Pacific island cultures, the Auckland region hosts several Pacific island festivals. Two of the major ones are Polyfest, which showcases performances of the secondary school cultural groups in the Auckland region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyfest NCEA credits / Pasifika Education Plan / Home - Pasifika|url=http://pasifika.tki.org.nz/Pasifika-Education-Plan/Polyfest-NCEA-credits|website=Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI)|accessdate=18 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pasifika Festival|Pasifika]], a festival that celebrates Pacific island heritage through traditional food, music, dance, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands turn out for Pasifika Festival|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/327424/thousands-turn-out-for-pasifika-festival|accessdate=18 August 2017|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=25 March 2017|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population Estimates Program (PEP), a "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander" is "A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific islands. It includes people who indicate their race as 'Native Hawaiian', 'Guamanian or "Chamorro', 'Samoan', and 'Other Pacific Islander' or provide other detailed Pacific Islander responses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information on Race |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=March 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403171145/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI525211.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Office of Management and Budget]], "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander" refers to a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

The term [[Pacific Islands American]] is used for ethnic Pacific islander residents in [[U.S. state]]s, and in the [[Territories of the United States#Classification of current U.S. territories|territories of the United States]] in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Y. Okihiro, ''American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders'' (University of California Press, 2015). xiv, 499 pp.

'''Pashtun names''' are names used among the [[Pashtun people]]. 

==Given names==
Pashtun given names are derived up from the [[Pashto language|Pashto]] language itself. When Islam was introduced officially in [[Afghanistan]], other names adopted by [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]s came from [[Arabic]] though at times, take the phonology of Pashto, e.g. the Arabic "Zulaikha", a woman's name, can become "Zlaikha" due to the consonant cluster nature of [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. Other names come directly from [[Pashto language|Pashto]] itself and will display pronunciation differences germane to the two main accents of [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. For example "Zarlakht" a Pashtun girl's name as pronounced in [[Peshawar]] and [[Kabul]] (and other northern Pashtuns) will be pronounced as "Zarlasht" by the Pashtuns of [[Kandahar]] and [[Quetta]] (as well as other Pashtun populations who inhabit regions further to the southern regions of Afghanistan and northern [[Pakistan]]).

==Surnames==

Surnames can either come from being borrowed from other languages or from the Pashto language or used from given names. There are many different types of surnames used among Pashtuns. 

Many Pashtuns that come from developing regions are known by their mononym due to a lack of a legal identification system. They may also have multiple mononyms (i.e. may be called by multiple personal names). However, they will know the name of their tribe even prior to registering a legal identity.

Understanding Pashtun tribal systems makes it easier to understand Pashtun surnames based on tribal lineage. 
Many Pashto last names come from the name of the tribe or the subdivisions of a specific tribe: in this case their name would end in -zai (son) or khel (group), (e.g. a Ghilzai Pashtun would likely have Ghilzai as their last name and a Pashtun from specifically the Adamkhel subtribe may use Adamkhel as their last name). Some tribal names have no suffix (e.g. Afridi, Sarbanri, Abdali). One must understand that many Pashtun tribes are composed of super tribes and subtribes, in other words, there are several tribes within tribes branching off and ranked in different tiers. For example, an Omarkhel Yusufzai Pashtun would have the option to use the name of their super tribe name "Sarbanri", their tribe Yusufzai, or Omarkhel, a subdivision of Yusufzai. Tribal names are usually patrilineal. The ancestral line of females generally is not included as part of the identity.

Some Pashtun families that modernize pick a random name typically derived from Persian or Arabic and continue it as a family name down the line. That name may have little to no relation to their tribal standings. Other-times, the first name of the father may become the last name of the child, and so on and so forth.

Surnames based on location are not common due to the rural transhumance semi-nomadic nature of Pashtuns in most their history, there are not surnames tied to a cities or locations. But rarely some tribes identify them with location like [[khostwal]], [[Bannuchis]], [[Bunerwal]] etc. This is why Pashtuns are identified with groups of people moving around. However, locations are given a name based on the people that occupy them.

Few Pashtun communities use the name "Pashtun" as their last name, as Gujjars will use Gujjar or Baloch people will use Baloch. These are names of the undivided ethnic groups. Pathan is used as a surname among Pashtun communities living in the [[Indian subcontinent]] because they are known as Pathans or Pashtuns to their neighbouring communities, so they simplify it as a surname rather than their tribal name (it is important to mention one's tribal surname among Pashtuns, but in lands where they are a minority Afghans or Pathans will often be used instead). Afghan is an archaic name, and has been used among Pashtuns in Iran to signify other Iranians their Pashtun ancestry because they are known as Afghans to Iranians and the Arab world. 

Khan is also a name used commonly among Pashtuns, though it is not native to the Pashtun language and was adopted by Pashtuns via cross cultural exchanges between Turko-Mongol peoples and the Pashtuns when the Pashtun lands were ruled by Mongol peoples and the Turk people. Khan also means king or leader or strong or royal etc., which could be another reason for its adoption. Mostly Khan is used by those pashtuns who have served Turko-Mongol rulers over central Asia and south Asia

==Distribution==
Pashtun names are found among the Pashtun population, and some [[Tajiks]] and South Asians will carry Pashtun names, a sign of Pashtun ancestry among them, at-least patrilineal ancestry. The dardic Pashayis and Indo-Aryan Hindkowans do not speak Pashto but have 30-60% of their people familiar with and living in a Pashtun culture. The assimilated communities may have traces of people with given names derived exclusively from Pashto.

==History==

Population began growing rapidly in the [[Western world]] early in the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] of the late 18th century. The reasons for the "Modern Rise of Population"&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Modern Rise of Population|last=McKeown|first=Thomas|publisher=Edward Arnold|year=1976|isbn=9780713159868|location=London, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were particularly investigated by the British health scientist [[Thomas McKeown (physician)|Thomas McKeown]] (1912-1988). In his publications, McKeown challenged four theories about the population growth: 
# McKeown stated that the growth in Western population, particularly surging in the 19th century, was not so much caused by an increase in [[fertility]], but largely by a decline of [[Mortality rate|mortality]] particularly of childhood mortality followed by [[infant mortality]],&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Brown RG|date=1955|title=Medical evidence related to English population changes in the eighteenth century|journal=Population Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–141|doi=10.1080/00324728.1955.10404688|jstor=2172162|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Brown RG, Record RG|date=1972|title=An interpretation of the modern rise of population in Europe|journal=Population Studies |volume=26 |pages=345-382|doi=|jstor=2173815|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The decline of mortality could largely be attributed to rising standards of living, whereby McKeown put most emphasis on improved nutritional status,
# His most controversial idea, at least his most disputed idea, was that he questioned the effectiveness of public health measures, including sanitary reforms, vaccination and quarantine,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Record RG|date=1962
 |title=Reasons for the Decline of Mortality in England and Wales during the Nineteenth Century

 |doi=10.2307/2173119|jstor=2173119|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The sometime fierce disputes that his publication provoked around the "McKeown thesis", have overshadowed his more important and largely unchallenged argument that [[curative medicine]] measures played little role in mortality decline, not only prior to the mid-20th century&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; but also until well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKeown T, Record RG, Turner RD|date=1975
 |title=An Interpretation of the Decline of Mortality in England and Wales during the Twentieth Century
 |journal=Population Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=391–422
 |doi=10.1080/00324728.1975.10412707|jstor=2173935|pmid=11630508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the McKeown thesis has been heavily disputed, recent studies have confirmed the value of his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Korotayev |first=A. V. |last2=Malkov |first2=A. S. |year=2016 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35548090 |title=Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and Demographic Growth, 1 CE–1973 CE |journal=INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS AND METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES |volume=10 |pages=200-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work is pivotal for present day thinking about population growth, birth control, public health and medical care. McKeown had a major influence on many population researchers, such as health economists and Nobel prize winners [[Robert Fogel|Robert W. Fogel]] (1993) and [[Angus Deaton]] (2015). The latter considered McKeown as 'the founder of [[social medicine]]'.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Escape. Health, wealth, and the origins of inequality|last=Deaton|first=Angus|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=978 0 691 15354 4|location=Princeton and Oxford|pages=91–93|quote=McKeown's views, updated to modern circumstances, are still important today in debates between those who think that health is primarily determined by medical discoveries and medical treatment and those who look to the background social conditions of life.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population growth rate==
The "population growth rate" is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period, expressed as a fraction of the initial population. Specifically, population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period, often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period. This can be written as the formula, valid for a sufficiently small time interval:

:&lt;math&gt;Population\ growth\ rate = \frac{ P(t_2)  -  P(t_1)} {P(t_1)(t_2-t_1)}&lt;/math&gt;

A positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing, while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing. A growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the [[birth rate]]s, [[death rate]]s, [[immigration rate]]s, and age distribution between the two times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522092307/http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=61 |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related measure is the [[net reproduction rate]]. In the absence of migration, a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing, while a net reproduction rate less than one ([[sub-replacement fertility]]) indicates that the population of females is decreasing.

Most populations do not grow exponentially, rather they follow a [[Logistic function|logistic model]]. Once the population has reached its [[carrying capacity]], it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity, which is usually when a population has depleted most its [[natural resource]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa|last3=Cain|first3=Michael|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Logistic growth graph (population ecology).JPG|thumb|The logistic growth of a population.]]

===Logistic equation===

The growth of a population can often be modelled by the [[Population_dynamics#Logistic_population_growth|logistic equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief Applied Calculus|last=Stewart|first=James|last2=Clegg|first2=Daniel|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;P(t)&lt;/math&gt; = the population after time t;
* &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time a population grows;
* &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = the relative growth rate coefficient;
* &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = the carrying capacity of the population; defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As it is a separable differential equation, the population may be solved explicitly, producing a [[logistic function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;A=\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial population at time 0.

Many of the world's countries, including many in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]] and [[South East Asia]], have seen a sharp rise in population since the end of the [[Cold War]]. The fear is that high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc. in some of the less fortunate countries. For example, the population of [[Chad]] has ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009,&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; further straining its resources.

==Growth by region==
Population growth rates vary by world region, with the highest growth rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and the lowest in Europe. For example, from 1950 to 2010, Sub-Saharan African grew over three and a half times, from about 186 million to 856 million. On the other hand, Europe only increased by 35%, from 547 million in 1950 to 738 million in 2010. As a result of these varying population growths, Sub-Saharan Africa changed from 7.4% of world population in 1950 to 12.4% in 2010, while Europe declined from 22% to 11% in the same time period.

According to his projections, population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity, but will peak below 9 bn by 2050.&lt;ref name="Sanjeev Sanyal"/&gt; Conversely, a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division projected that the world's population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

A '''private highway''' is a [[highway]] owned and operated for profit by private industry. Private highways are common in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]; in addition, a [[Private highways in the United States|few have been built in the United States]] on an experimental basis. Typically, private highways are built by companies that charge tolls for a period while the debt is retired, after which the highway is turned over to government control. This allows governments to fulfill immediate transportation needs despite their own budget constraints, while still retaining public ownership of the roads in the long term.

An obstacle to private highways is that government regulation can stifle price flexibility and introduce negotiation and paperwork requirements that increase operational expenses, while having to compete against free public roads. In addition, private highways lack some advantages that governments have, such as [[sovereign immunity]] against liability for accidents, the use of eminent domain power to acquire private property for roads and the ability to issue [[tax-exempt]] [[Security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref name="MakingInroads"&gt;Hakin, Simon &amp; Blackstone, Edwin (August 1, 1999). [http://americancityandcounty.com/mag/government_making_inroads_private/ Making inroads in private highway construction]. American City &amp; County. Retrieved on January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free-market roads]] are advocated by [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], who consider them more efficient, safer, and more cost-effective than public roads.&lt;ref&gt;''Free to Choose'', [[Milton Friedman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize|section|date=September 2015}}
The [[Interstate Highway System]] provided for in the [[Federal Aid Highway Act]] was a federally funded, non-toll system. According to Simon Hakim and Edwin Blackstone, "by 1989, [private] roads comprised just {{convert|4657|mi|km}} of the 3.8 million miles of streets and roads in the United States and only {{convert|2695|mi|km}} out of the {{convert|44759|mi|km}} of the interstate system."&lt;ref name="MakingInroads"/&gt;

==Recent trends==
The [[National Center for Policy Analysis]] and the [[Cato Institute]] have proposed that the [[Demsetz auction]]s commonly used to award franchises be replaced with [[Present Value of Revenues auction]]s in order to reduce risk and thus [[required rates of return]] by private highway owners.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Policy Analysis (January 17, 2003. [http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=5689 New Auctions Could Improve Private Highway Franchises]. Retrieved on January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, contractors would bid an amount equal to the present value of cash flows from user fees they are willing to accept for the project. The lowest bid would win.

Boarnet and DiMento believe that private highways will become more important as the rise of [[Hybrid electric vehicle|gasoline-efficient hybrids]] causes a decline in gas tax revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, Steve (February 1, 2005). [http://www.heartland.org/Article.cfm?artId=16339 California Law Provides Lessons for Private Transportation]. Budget &amp; Tax News.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many highways are constructed under a "[[build-operate-transfer]]" model in which ownership ultimately goes to the government.

==Around the world==
&lt;!--Within continent sections, these will be organized by country, and within country paragraphs, these will be organized in chronological order of establishment.--&gt;

===Asia===
As of 2003, the [[Hong Kong]] government was planning to [[securitize]] five toll tunnels and a toll bridge through bond issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=4421 Hong Kong Plans Massive Privatization | National Center for Policy Analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; India also has a [[Bangalore–Mysore Infrastructure Corridor|private highway]] under-construction between the two cities of Bangalore and Mysore in the state of Karnataka. A vast number of the country's road projects have been upgraded under a [[Public–private partnerships in India|public-private partnership]], thus operating similar to private highways. In Indonesia, all toll roads are built by private companies, and private toll roads are being built in Bangladesh.

===North America===
Mexico has some highways operated by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb288/is_199304/ai_hibm1G143774862 PRIVATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES TEMPORARILY REDUCE TOLLS TO ATTRACT CARGO TRUCKS | SourceMex Economic News &amp; Analysis on Mexico | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 108&amp;nbsp;km [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407 ETR]] through the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is operated privately under a 99-year lease agreement with the provincial government. The highway uses [[electronic toll collection]].  Users who do not have a toll tag (called a ''transponder'') in their vehicle are tracked by [[automatic number plate recognition]], with the toll bill being mailed to the address of the plate on file. There are also some [[private highways in the United States]].

===Europe===
Of the 11,000 kilometers of France's highways, 8,000 km are under private concession. 3,120 kilometers of [[Italy]]'s highways (comprising 56% of the country's toll roads) are controlled by Autostrade Concessioni e Costruzioni Autostrade. According to [[Forbes]], "Autostrade was an early Electronic Age entry, computerizing to its highway system in 1988".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Richard: [https://www.forbes.com/global/2002/0415/080.html The Fast Lane], Forbes, April 15, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[M6 Toll]] was the first private toll motorway in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghamfoe.org.uk/bnrr/pr2698.htm Judge Orders Discovery of Secret BNRR Deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426175935/http://www.birminghamfoe.org.uk/bnrr/pr2698.htm |date=2005-04-26 }}, Alliance Against the Birmingham Northern Relief Road.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was described by urbantransport-technology.com as a "43 km dual three lane (plus hard shoulder), £485.5 million motorway" with six toll stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbantransport-technology.com/projects/birmingham/ Birmingham Northern Relief Road, United Kingdom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411064825/http://www.urbantransport-technology.com/projects/birmingham/ |date=2005-04-11 }}, urbantransport-technology.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Libya}}
Libya is a destination and transit country for men and women from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Instability and lack of government oversight continued to allow for human trafficking crimes to persist and become highly profitable for traffickers. As reported by international organisations in 2016, trafficking victims—including men, women, and children—are highly vulnerable to extreme violence and other human rights violations in Libya by government officials.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Libya 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271228.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=9 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants in Libya are extremely vulnerable to trafficking, including those seeking employment in Libya or transiting Libya en route to Europe. Prostitution rings reportedly subject sub-Saharan women to sex trafficking in brothels, particularly in southern Libya. Nigerian women are at increased risk of being forced into prostitution. Trafficking and smuggling networks that reach into Libya from [[Niger]], Nigeria, [[Chad]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and other sub-Saharan states subject migrants to [[forced prostitution]] through fraudulent recruitment, confiscation of identity and travel documents, withholding or non-payment of wages, and debt bondage.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt; 

Since mid-2015, ISIS in Libya has abducted and taken into captivity at least 540 migrants and refugees, including at least 63 women whom ISIS forced into [[sexual slavery]] for its fighters.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Libya as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Special Case]]" country.&lt;ref name="state17" /&gt;

'''Qaratays''' are  a [[Mordvins|Mordvinian]] [[ethnic group]] in [[Kamsko-Ustyinsky District]], [[Tatarstan]] around the village of Mordovsky Karatay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sawe |first1=Benjamin Elisha |title=Who are the Mordvin People? |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/who-are-the-mordvin-people.html |website=WorldAtlas |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak a variety of the [[Tatar language]] complemented by [[Moksha language|Moksha]] words, which is sometimes considered as a Qaratay Dialect of the [[Kazan Tatar language]]. They number about 100.

Once they lived in three villages, but one of them was submerged by [[Kuybyshev Reservoir]].Another one was re-settled as "unprospective" during the 1950s.
The village of Mordovsky Karatay became the last Qaratay village.

Their ancestors were [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] tribes who lived in the territory of today Tatarstan and were assimilated by [[Volga Bolgars]] and [[Tatars]] between the 8th and 15th centuries. Living around Tatars, they started speaking a Tatar language. Neighbouring Mordvins in [[Tetyushsky District]], however, still speak a [[Uralic language]].

'''Selako''', also known as '''Salako''', '''Silakau''', '''Selakau''', '''Selako Dayaks''', '''Bidayuh Selako''', '''Kata Diri'''' or '''Damea''' is an indigenous [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic group that lives in the westernmost part of [[Borneo]] island. In [[Indonesia]], they are found in districts such as Tujuhbelas, Samalantan, Paloh, Tebas, Telukkeramat and Sejangkung of [[Sambas Regency]], and [[Bengkayang Regency]], [[West Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Darrell T.

'''Shabir Choudhry''' is a [[British national]] and a [[British Mirpuri|Kashmiri]] leader, rights and peace activist, politician, academician and writer. He helped form the Kashmir Youth Movement in 1973, the [[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front|Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] in 1976 and later on the Kashmir National Party in 2008. He resigned from each of these after being discouraged or opposed to the direction they were headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/pok-leader-shabir-choudhry-quits-kashmir-national-party-4376959/|title=PoK leader Shabir Choudhry quits Kashmir National Party|date=2016-11-15|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shabir Choudhry, a former JKLF leader, argues that he is worried about the Talibanisation of Kashmiri freedom struggle which provides an interesting viewpoint about separatists, perhaps contrary to the popular perception.

'''''Sickhouse''''' is a 2016 [[Thriller film|thriller]] that was written and directed by [[Hannah Macpherson]] and starring YouTube personality [[Andrea Russett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/04/sickhouse-snapchat-indigenous-media/|title=Indigenous Media quietly just released a feature film on Snapchat|last=Hamedy|first=Saba|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was initially released between April 29 and May 3, 2016 on the instant image messaging mobile app [[Snapchat]] via Russett's account in one to ten second increments in the mobile 9:16 vertical orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/108569/trailer-sickhouse-2016/|title=Trailer: Sickhouse (2016)|last=|first=|date=2016-05-20|website=Horrornews.net|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2016 the film's production company, Indigenous Media, released a 68-minute full length version was released to [[Video on demand|VOD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/sickhouse-andrea-russett-snapchat-vimeo-1201786822/|title=First Movie Filmed on Snapchat, ‘Sickhouse’ Starring Andrea Russett, Debuts on Vimeo|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-06-01|website=|publisher=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of ''Sickhouse'' utilized the clips released to Snapchat, which made up the bulk of the film, as well as new, additional material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/sickhouse-snapchat-movie-vimeo/|title=A Studio Filmed and Released a Full-Length Horror Movie on Snapchat|last=Huddleston, Jr.|first=Tom|date=2016-06-02|website=Fortune|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's plot centers around Russett, who ventures to a supposedly haunted cabin named "Sickhouse" with her fictitious cousin, and two social media addicts, in an attempt to investigate its lore. The actors for ''Sickhouse'' improvised most of their dialogue as the movie was filmed in real-time on Snapchat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/22/sickhouse-how-the-social-media-horror-film-went-viral|title=Sickhouse: how the first ever Snapchat movie redefined viral|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2016-06-22|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the movie's release ''Sickhouse'' has been compared to the 2014 horror movie ''[[Unfriended]]'', for its usage of social media as a storytelling technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/05/sickhouse-trailer-snapchat-produced-horror-thriller-heads-to-vimeo-291187/|title=‘Sickhouse’ Trailer: Snapchat-Produced Horror Thriller Heads to Vimeo|last=Nordine|first=Michael|date=2016-05-05|website=|publisher=Indiewire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1999 film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', for its similar premise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/snapchat-sickhouse-movie-sequel-1201812862/|title=Snapchat-Based Movie ‘Sickhouse’ to Get Sequel|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2016-07-12|website=Variety|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/sickhouse-horror-movie-snapchat.html|title=The Horror Movie Sickhouse, Shot Entirely on Snapchat, Introduces a New Kind of Fear|website=Vulture|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the film's popularity online, a sequel to the film was [[Green-light|greenlit]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/12/indigenous-media-sickhouse-sequel-snapchat-vimeo/|title='Sickhouse' sequel gets greenlight following successful launch on Snapchat|last=Hamedy|first=Saba|website=Mashable|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film begins with Snapchat personality Andrea Russett announcing to her followers that her cousin Taylor was flying to visit her for the weekend. This coincides with a Twitter request she had received from Sean O'Donnell, who wants Andrea to visit a supposedly haunted cabin called "Sickhouse". Once Taylor arrives the two women bond and Andrea teaches her cousin to use her Snapchat, which Taylor uses to publish a video of Andrea sleeping, the first of many videos posted by Taylor throughout the film.

The next day Andrea discovers death threats on her cousin's Facebook page, revealing that Taylor actually came to Los Angeles to escape a dire situation back at home. The subject then changes to the Sickhouse and the two read a website that explains the legend of the home and the Sickwife who lived there. They also run into two of Andrea's fans, who ask to take a picture with her. Infatuated with her cousin's life and freedom, Taylor decides that she wants to remain with Andrea forever. Later that night the two cousins attend a house party with Sean and two others, Lukas and JC. Lukas, who has visited Sickhouse before, goes over the rules of the Sickhouse: don't make noise, never go inside, and always leave a gift. During the party, Taylor silently observes Sean and Andrea discussing her before sharing a kiss, fact that upsets Taylor.
 
The group sets out for the Sickhouse the following day despite warnings from local residents to stay away. As they grow closer to the cabin Taylor continues to broadcast using Andrea's account, growing irritated when others try to use their phones to document the trip. The group also runs into the two fans again, which Andrea dismisses as a coincidence. After they make it to the woods the group decides to camp out and Andrea has sex with Sean while Taylor loses her virginity to Lukas. The following day they continue to follow clues leading to the Sickhouse and discover the cabin and its altar of gifts. Andrea follows the rules and leaves a gift, however both Lukas and Taylor decide to steal gifts. Lukas drinks from his stolen flask and becomes violently ill and during the night the group is terrorized by strange noises and faint images of the “Sickwife.
 
The following morning Taylor sends out a broadcast on her own, stating that she would “do anything to not go home". The group return to the Sickhouse to replace the stolen gifts, only for Taylor to run inside. Sean decides to follow her, leaving Andrea and Lukas to wait outside. Soon after Taylor runs out of the house and the door slams shut behind her. The trio runs away leaving Sean behind, only to see a woman in a wedding dress walking through the woods. They return to the house and split up in order to find Sean. They instead find the two fans, one of whom is dressed as the Sickwife. They start to explain that they were just pranking them, only for the two to start becoming uncontrollably sick. As Taylor runs from the house the viewer is shown Sean and Lukas lying sick on the ground, with the latter pleading for help; Andrea is then snatched out of view. Taylor is knocked unconscious and the phone drops to the ground, where it records for a little while longer.
 
When she wakes Taylor decides to continue sending out snaps despite having no cellphone reception, in the hopes that once the reception returns the videos will upload and someone will send the police to save them. While wandering through the house she finds Lukas. Taylor also believes that she can hear Andrea in the basement and goes to look for her, even as Lukas begs her not to go. In the basement Taylor finds dead bodies and a wedding dress on a hanger. Right before a fade to black, the viewer is shown a glimpse of the “Sickhusband.” After the fade the viewer is shown Taylor humming happily as she drifts further into the basement. Suddenly a hand appears on her shoulder, to which she says, “I’m home” into the camera.

Ultimately, the fates of Sean, Lukas, Andrea, and the two fans are left unclear to the audience.

== Reception ==
''Vulture'' reviewed the finished version of the movie, writing that "While ''Sickhouse'' is certainly not ''Blair Witch'', it does suggest that the next horror film that will grab hold of the national consciousness could take some version of this form. The dynamic of watching and being watched is fear in its simplest form, and social media is that dynamic played out on a grand scale every second of every day."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Somali Sign Language''' ('''SSL''') is a [[sign language]] used by the [[deaf community]] in [[Somalia]] (more specifically [[Somaliland]]) and [[Djibouti]].  It is based on [[Kenyan Sign Language]].

In the 1980s a school for the deaf was established in the Somali Kenyan town of [[Wajir]] by [[Annalena Tonelli]].  Students there became fluent in Kenyan Sign Language.  In 1997, three graduates from Wajir helped establish the first school for the deaf in Somalia called the Annalena School for the Deaf named after the late Annalena Tonelli, in [[Borama]].  One of the teachers at Boroma soon founded a school in Djibouti, and, with a bit more difficulty, another was established in [[Hargeisa]].&lt;ref name="Tbagossl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Woodford |first=Doreen E. |title=The beginning and growth of a new language: Somali Sign Language |date=2006 |url=http://www.eenet.org.uk/resources/docs/somali_sign_language.php |publisher=Enabling Education Network |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6465">A '''strip parish''' is a [[parish]] with a narrow elongated shape, typically formed during the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[early medieval]] period. The shape is influenced by [[landscape]], political and [[economic]] factors. Evidence of such parishes can be found throughout England although they appear to have been more common in a number of southern counties particularly but not exclusively associated with locations encompassing both [[lowland]] and [[Highland (geography)|upland]] [[landscape]]s or alternatively [[coastal]] communities.

==Origins of strip parishes==
A number of common factors influenced the creation of strip parishes: the establishment of the parish unit; the [[topography]] of the landscape and the scarcity of valuable resources.

The fragmentation of [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]] in England during the 8th and 9th centuries, due to the split up of larger estates and the transfer of land, progressively resulted in the emergence of smaller [[manorialism|manor]]ial estates. One of the most important contributions to this process was the endowment of lands associated with the establishment of churches and their accompanying estate, the patronage of the lower levels of [[nobility]] and the legal inheritance of land within families.  Accelerated by the arrival of [[Normans|Norman]] rule all these factors paved the way for simultaneous creation of the patchwork of parish units and formalisation of their administrative boundaries alongside the re-assembling of manorial lands.

In locations such as the [[Chilterns]], [[South Downs]] and coastal areas of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] where there was a limit of important resources, a further development of the parish system can be observed. For example, in [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Oxfordshire]] settlements established in the lowland areas of the [[Vale of Aylesbury]] and [[Thames Valley]] respectively, along the base of the [[Chiltern Hills]], extended their territories by accumulating territory on the largely uninhabited hillside, scarp and hilltop areas to exploit scarce resources such as [[woodland]] and upland summer [[pasture]] also known as [[transhumance]]. The result of this land reorganisation produced estates and parishes, which were narrow elongated strips exhibiting a range of land types ensuring the widest possible availability of resources.

==Development of autonomous manors and parishes==
Subsequent expansion of the temporary summer settlements led to the establishment of permanent communities, including the formation of autonomous manors or [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s with their own, initially modest [[chapel-of-ease|chapels-of-ease]], which later became fully-fledged churches. Where topography was not favourable to the expansion uphill to create a parish comprising one continuous strip, a detached area of upland territory was acquired. For example, [[Marsworth]] and its detached manor of [[Hawridge]]. Normally, such detached land was within the same hundred and County but occasionally, as in [[Tring]], Hertfordshire and its detached upland hamlet [[Coleshill, Buckinghamshire|Coleshill]] several miles away and in [[Buckinghamshire]] such detached communities can span across county boundaries.

As early as the latter period of the [[Middle Ages]] and as late as the 20th century some of these ‘daughter’ communities became permanently detached from their longer established parent village many miles away. In some cases the split resulted eventually in the creation of two and occasionally several separate hamlets.

The consequence of the splitting off of the upland communities was often the relocation of the lowland community to a new village location. In other cases the upland communities have become parishes in their own right or have amalgamated with other hilltop villages to also create a distinct parish.

A detailed account of the development of strip parishes in the Chilterns can be found in ''The Chilterns'' by Leslie Hepple and Alison Doggett.

'''Suguna Vilasa Sabha''' is a [[Club (organization)|club]] based in the city of [[Chennai]], [[India]].The Suguna Vilasa Sabha club is also called as SVS club.The Suguna Vilasa Sabha club was founded by a  band of public spirited men headed by Late Sambanda Mudaliar for promotion of histrionic talent in the year 1891.It is one of the oldest and foremost theatre companies in the city.

== History ==
The Suguna Vilasa Sabha was established in Madras as a [[theatre company]] in the year 1891 in a house in [[Georgetown, Chennai|Georgetown]]. In 1902, the Sabha moved to the Victoria Public Hall from where it functioned from 1902 to 1936, when it moved to [[Mount Road]].&lt;ref name="Srinivasacharip317"&gt;{{cite book | title=History of the city of Madras written for the Tercentenary Celebration Committee| first=C. S.|last=Srinivasachari|year=1939| publisher=P. Varadachary &amp; Co.|place=Madras|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Sabha built its own theatre, the New Theatre. As stage dramas began to decline after the [[Second World War]], the Sabha transformed into a social club.

In the beginning the sabha was housed in Vijayanagaram Maharajas’s High School in George Town, free of rent. In 1896 it rented a premise in Thambu Chetty Street. In 1902 the Sabha moved to Victoria Public Hall. It was there the Sabha expanded its activities and provided additional recreational amenities like Tennis, Billiards, Table Tennis and other games besides staging many Dramas.The need for acquiring a Building of its own was felt and the present site was purchased.

Under the past president , Dr. M.A.M. Ramaswamy , and the current President CA V. Murali, the Sabha has been expanding steadily as one of the oldest &amp; Premier Clubs in the city.

==Artists==
The Tamil playwright, [[Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar]] was associated with the Suguna Vilasa Sabha in the early 1900s. Popular dancer [[E. Krishna Iyer]] was also associated with the Sabha.

'''''Survival Island 3: Australia Story''''' was an [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] game created by Kristina Fedenkova of [[NIL Entertainment]], notorious for its blatant violence and racism against [[Australian Aboriginals]].  The game was released onto the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]] in December 2015. The game is a 3D first-person survival-action game in which the player is able to ally with or fight against [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] [[Australia]]n people as well as a variety of [[Australian fauna]] while trying to survive. It attracted strong criticism in Australia for its [[racist]] presentation of Indigenous Australians, which were presented as "real Aboriginals" and a threat to the [[White people|fair-skinned]] player's survival. The game was also criticised for encouraging the player to perpetrate violence against Indigenous Australians. Apple rated the game [[Australian Classification Board#Film and video game classifications|PG]] for ages 12 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bludgeon To Death An ‘Aborigine’: The Virtual Apple iPhone Game The Whole Family Can Play|url = https://newmatilda.com/2016/01/15/bludgeon-to-death-an-aborigine-the-virtual-game-the-whole-family-can-enjoy/|website = New Matilda|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
A [[Change.org]] petition was created by Georgia Mantle calling for the game to be removed from Google and Apple marketplaces. She wrote: "By shooting ‘dangerous Aboriginals’, this app makes us inhuman, it re-enforces racial violence, lack of punishment for white people taking black lives, it makes fun and sport of massacres and Frontier violence." The petition gathered over 20,000 signatures in less than 24 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.themercury.com.au/news/survival-island-3-outrage-over-app-where-gamers-hunt-aborigines/news-story/3cfbd08ca0d8b251e02ea03c8f1bd2c3|title = Survival Island 3: Outrage over app where gamers hunt ‘Aborigines’|last = |first = |date = 2016-01-16|work = |access-date = 2016-01-16|via = |newspaper = The Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 16 January 2016, it had received over 60,000 signatures.&lt;ref name = "abc"/&gt; The petition was also seeking an apology from the game's developer.&lt;ref name = "abc"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Demands for 'racist' Survival Island 3 game to be removed from app stores|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-16/demands-for-'racist'-survival-island-3-game-to-be-taken-down/7092782|website = ABC News|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
On 16 January 2016, the game was removed from the Apple App Store,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Game encouraging players to bludgeon Aboriginal Australians to death causes outrage|url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/survival-island-3-australia-story-3d-game-that-encourages-players-to-bludgeon-aborigines-to-death-causes-outrage-20160115-gm76mw.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by its removal from Google Play later that day.

Australia's Federal communications minister [[Mitch Fifield]] asked his staff to "provide advice on the circumstances of its release".

'''Tacanan''' is a family of languages spoken in [[Bolivia]], with Ese’ejja also spoken in Peru. It may be related to the [[Panoan languages]]. Many of the languages are endangered.

==Family division==

*[[Ese Ejja language|Ese Ejja]] (a.k.a. Ese’eha, Tiatinagua, Chama, Huarayo, Guacanawa, Chuncho, Eseʼexa, Tatinawa, Ese exa)
*Araona–Tacana
**[[Araona language|Araona]] (a.k.a. Carina, Cavina)
**Cavineña–Tacana

****[[Reyesano language|Reyesano]] (a.k.a. San Borjano, Maropa)
****[[Toromono language|Toromono]] †

Toromono is apparently [[extinct language|extinct]]. Another possibly extinct Tacanan language is [[Mabenaro language|Mabenaro]]; [[Arasa language|Arasa]] has been classified as Tacanan, but appears to have more in common with Panoan.

'''Terrorism in Mexico''', is the phenomenon of terrorist attacks, since the decade of the 1960s (by communist guerrillas)&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://luchadeclasesyprocesohistorico.blogspot.com/2011/12/breve-cronologia-de-los-principales.html|title=Breve cronología de los principales movimientos sociales ocurridos en México|work=Lucha de Clases.org|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, until the incidents drug war related, and other political movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/hillary-clinton-iran-exports-terrorism-mexico|title=Hillary Clinton: Iran ‘Exports Terrorism’ to Mexicowork=CNN|accessdate=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[image:L'exèrcit al carrer 30 de juliol.jpg|thumbnail|right|Soldiers of the Mexican Army in the streets]]

During the late 60´s until the 90´s decade. Several guerrilla movements were present in the country, the most algid moments that were the assault of the Madera Cuartel and [[Tlatelolco Massacre]], starting point for several guerrilla movements, specially in the state of Guerrero and [[Ciudad de Mexico]].Several of these groups like [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Partido de los Pobres]], [[People's Guerrilla Group]], or [[Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre]].These groups were dismantled under dubious conditions related to the use of force, spreading versions of extrajudicial executions or forced disappearances.&lt;ref&gt; Sierra Guzmán, José Luis. ''El enemigo interno. Contrainsurgencia y fuerzas armadas en México''. México, D. F.: Editorial Plaza y Valdés. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reyes Peláez, Juan Fernando "Introducción a la historia de la guerrilla en México. 1943-83', Editorial Lulu, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

United States politician [[Sue Myrick]] has claimed that the mounting evidence of [[Hezbollah]] presence in Mexico is ignored by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], further adding that "I don't have a lot of faith in the Department of Homeland Security," and "They should be looking at these groups in Mexico much more closely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/29/lawmaker-urges-feds-to-monitor-hezbollah-in-mexico/ | work=Fox News | title=Lawmaker urges feds to monitor Hezbollah in Mexico | date=2012-10-29 | accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traces of these groups situating in Mexico, became more sensible by 2010, when the Tucson Police Department reported International Terrorism Situational Awareness for [[Hezbollah]] in Mexico, adding the arrest of Jameel Nasar in [[Tijuana]], July 2010. Nasar had tried to form a Hezbollah network in Mexico, and South America.A [[US congress]] report from the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations and Management ties Middle East terror organizations with the Mexican drug cartels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/16/congressional-report-ties-middle-east-terrorists-to-mexican-drug-cartels/ Congressional report ties Middle East terrorists to Mexican drug cartels]&lt;/ref&gt; The report reads that;-

{{blockquote|The presence of Hezbollah in Latin America is partially explained by the large Lebanese diaspora in South America. In general, Hezbollah enjoys support by many in the Lebanese world community in part because of the numerous social programs it provides in Lebanon that include schools, hospitals, utilities and welfare.}}

'''Wiki journalism''' is a form of [[participatory journalism]] or [[crowdsourcing]], which uses [[wiki]] technology to facilitate collaboration between users. It is a kind of [[collaborative journalism]].  The largest example of wiki journalism is [[Wikinews]]. According to [[Paul Bradshaw (journalist)|Paul Bradshaw]], there are five broad types of wiki journalism: second draft wiki journalism, a 'second stage' piece of journalism, during which readers can edit an article produced in-house; crowdsourcing wiki journalism, a means of covering material which could not have been produced in-house (probably for logistical reasons), but which becomes possible through wiki technology; supplementary wiki journalism, creating a supplement to a piece of original journalism, e.g. a tab to a story that says "Create a wiki for related stories"; open wiki journalism, in which a wiki is created as an open space, whose subject matter is decided by the user, and where material may be produced that would not otherwise have been commissioned; and logistical wiki journalism, involving a wiki limited to in-house contributors which enables multiple authorship, and may also facilitate transparency, and/or an
ongoing nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wiki Journalism: Are Wikis the New Blogs?|author=Bradshaw, Paul|publisher=Future of Newspapers|year=2007|url=http://onlinejournalismblog.wordpress.com/files/2007/09/wiki_journalism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Wikinews]] was launched in 2004 as an attempt to build an entire news operation on wiki technology. Where Wikinews – and indeed [[Wikipedia]] – has been most successful, however, is in covering large news events involving large numbers of people, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the [[Virginia Tech Shootings]], where first hand experience, or the availability of first hand accounts, forms a larger part of the entry, and where the wealth of reportage makes a central 'clearing house' valuable. Thelwall &amp; Stuart&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Thelwall, M.  |author2=Stuart, D. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007 |title=RUOK? Blogging Communication Technologies During Crises|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue2/thelwall.html|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=12 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; identify Wikinews and Wikipedia as becoming particularly important during crises such as Hurricane Katrina, which "precipitate discussions or mentions of new technology in blogspace."

Mike Yamamoto notes that "In times of emergency, wikis are quickly being recognized as important gathering spots not only for news accounts but also for the exchange of resources, safety bulletins, missing-person reports and other vital information, as well as a meeting place for virtual support groups." He sees the need for community as the driving force behind this.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamamoto|first=Mike|title=Katrina and the rise of wiki journalism|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-5845892-7.html|work=[[CNET News]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|accessdate=21 April 2010|date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' decided to experiment with a '[[wikitorial]]' on the [[Iraq War]], publishing their own editorial online but inviting readers to "rewrite" it using wiki technology. The experiment received broad coverage both before and after launch in both the mainstream media and the blogosphere. In editorial terms the experiment was generally recognised as a failure.&lt;ref name="Glaister"&gt;{{cite web|last=Glaister|first=Dan|title=LA Times 'wikitorial' gives editors red faces|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,1511810,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=21 April 2010|date=22 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'' used Wikipedia itself to 'wiki' an article about Wikipedia by AJ Jacobs.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} The draft called on users to help Jacobs improve the article, with the intention of printing a 'before' and 'after' version of the piece in the printed magazine. He included some intentional mistakes to make the experiment "a little more interesting".{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} The article received 224 edits in the first 24 hours, rising to 373 by 48 hours, and over 500 before the article was 'frozen' in order to be printed.

In 2006 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' also experimented with an article about wikis. When writer Ryan Singel submitted the 1,000 word draft to his editor, "instead of paring the story down to a readable 800 words, we posted it as-is to a SocialText-hosted wiki on August 29, and announced it was open to editing by anyone willing to register."&lt;ref name="Singel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singel|first=Ryan|title=The Wiki That Edited Me|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/09/71737|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Digital]]|accessdate=21 April 2010|date=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the experiment closed, Singel noted that "there were 348 edits of the main story, 21 suggested headlines and 39 edits of the discussion pages. Thirty hyperlinks were added to the 20 in the original story."  He continued that "one user didn't like the quotes I used from [[Ward Cunningham]], the father of wiki software, so I instead posted a large portion of my notes from my interview on the site, so the community could choose a better one."&lt;ref name="Singel" /&gt; Singel felt that the final story was "more accurate and more representative of how wikis are used" but not a better story than would have otherwise been produced:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

"The edits over the week lack some of the narrative flow that a Wired News piece usually contains. The transitions seem a bit choppy, there are too many mentions of companies, and too much dry explication of how wikis work.

"It feels more like a primer than a story to me."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, continued Singel, that didn't make the experiment a failure, and he felt the story "clearly tapped into a community that wants to make news stories better ... Hopefully, we'll continue to experiment to find ways to involve that community more."

In April 2010, the Wahoo Newspaper partnered with [[WikiCity Guides]] to extend its audience and local reach. "With this partnership, the Wahoo Newspaper provides a useful tool to connect with our readers, and for our readers to connect with one another to promote and spotlight everything Wahoo has to offer," said Wahoo Newspaper Publisher Shon Barenklau.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nebraska's Wahoo Newspaper Partners with Hyperlocal WikiCity Guides|publisher=Editor &amp; Publisher|year=2010 |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/departments/online/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004081040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite relatively little traffic as compared to its large scale, WikiCity Guides is recognized as the [[:m:List of largest wikis|largest wiki in the world]] with over 13 million active pages.

== Literature on wiki journalism ==

Andrew Lih places wikis within the larger category of [[participatory journalism]], which also includes [[blogs]], [[citizen journalism]] models such as [[OhMyNews]] and [[peer-to-peer publishing]] models such as [[Slashdot]], and which, he argues "uniquely addresses an historic 'knowledge gap' – the general lack of content sources for the period between when the news is published and the history books are written."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/publications/aejmc-2004-final-forpub-3.pdf JMSC.hku.hk], p4&lt;/ref&gt;

Participatory journalism, he argues, "has recast online journalism not as simply reporting or publishing, but as a lifecycle, where software is crafted, users are empowered, journalistic content is created and the process repeats improves upon itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/publications/aejmc-2004-final-forpub-3.pdf JMSC.hku.ho], p26&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco&lt;ref name="Marketwatch.com"&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/why-media-embrace-wikis/story.aspx?guid=%7B65DE7FE7-0E72-4BF0-B7CC-2DF7755DD69C%7D Marketwatch.com]&lt;/ref&gt; identifies wikis as a 'next step' in participatory journalism: "Blogs helped individuals publish and express themselves. Social networks allowed those disparate bloggers to be found and connected. Wikis are the platforms to help those who found one another be able to collaborate and build together."

== Advantages ==
A Wiki can serve as the collective truth of the event, portraying the hundreds of viewpoints and without taxing any one journalist with uncovering whatever represents the objective truth in the circumstance.

Wikis allow news operations to effectively cover issues on which there is a range of opinion so broad that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to summarise effectively in one article alone. Examples might include local transport problems, experiences of a large event such as a music festival or protest march, guides to local restaurants or shops, or advice. The [[Wikivoyage]] site is one such example, "A worldwide travel guide written entirely by contributors who either live in the place they're covering or have spent enough time there to post relevant information."&lt;ref&gt;Gillmor, 2004, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisations willing to open up wikis to their audience completely may also find a way of identifying their communities' concerns: Wikipedia, for instance, notes Eva Dominguez&lt;ref name="Lavanguardia.es"&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20060914/51283227918.html Lavanguardia.es]&lt;/ref&gt; "reflects which knowledge is most shared, given that both the content and the proposals for entries are made by the users themselves."

Internally, wikis also allow news operations to coordinate and manage a complex story which involves a number of reporters: journalists are able to collaborate by editing a single webpage that all have access to. News organisations interested in transparency might also publish the wiki 'live' as it develops, while the discussion space which accompanies each entry also has the potential to create a productive dialogue with users.

There are also clear economic and competitive advantages to allowing users to create articles. With the growth of low-cost [[micropublishing]] facilitated by the internet and [[blogging software]] in particular, and the [[Convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]]-fuelled entry into the online news market by both broadcasters and publishers, news organisations face increased competition from all sides. At the same time, print and broadcast advertising revenue is falling while competition for online advertising revenue is fierce and concentrated on a few major players: in the USA, for instance, according to [[Jeffrey Rayport]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/advertisings-death-greatly-exaggerated/story.aspx?guid=%7B17A4688C%2D867B%2D42D6%2DA82D%2DD87712FDA6D6%7D&amp;dist%20= Marketwatch.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 99 percent of gross advertising money 2006 went to the top 10 websites.

Wikis offer a way for news websites to increase their reach, while also increasing the time that users spend on their website, a key factor in attracting advertisers. And, according to [[Dan Gillmor]], "When [a wiki] works right, it engenders a community – and a community that has the right tools can take care of itself".&lt;ref&gt;Gillmor 2004, p149&lt;/ref&gt; A useful side-effect of community for a news organisation is reader loyalty.

Andrew Lih notes the importance of the "spirit of the open source movement" (2004b p6) in its development, and the way that wikis function primarily as "social software – acting to foster communication and collaboration with other users."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/publications/aejmc-2004-final-forpub-3.pdf JMSC.hku.hk], p10&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Lih attributes the success of the wiki model to four basic features: user friendly formatting; structure by convention, not enforced by software; "soft" security and ubiquitous access; and wikis transparency and edit history feature.

Student-run wikis provide opportunities to integrate [[learning by doing]] into a journalism education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f8k856gqk693m017/|title=A Qualitative Analysis on Collaborative Learning Experience of Student Journalists Using Wiki|issn=0302-9743|author1=Will Wai Kit Ma  |author2=Allan Hoi Kau Yuen |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Shane Richmond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/3622061/Change_is_inevitable/ |title=Change is inevitable |first=Shane |last=Richmond |date=2007-01-16 |work=[[The daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies two obstacles that could slow down the adoption of news wikis – inaccuracy and vandalism:

* "vandalism remains the biggest obstacle I can see to mainstream media's adoption of wikis, particularly in the UK, where one libellous remark could lead to the publisher of the wiki being sued, rather than the author of the libel."
* "Meanwhile, the question of authority is the biggest obstacle to acceptance by a mainstream audience."

Writing in 2004 Lih&lt;ref&gt;[http://jmsc.hku.hk/faculty/alih/publications/aejmc-2004-final-forpub-3.pdf JMSC.hku.hk]&lt;/ref&gt; also identified authority as an issue for Wikipedia: "While Wikipedia has recorded impressive accomplishments in three years, its articles have a mixed degree of quality because they are, by design, always in flux, and always editable. That reason alone makes people wary of its content."

Security is a common problem in wiki technology. Wikipedia's own entry on wikis notes: "Wikis, because of their open nature, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as 'trolling'. Wikis tend to take a soft-security approach to the problem of vandalism, making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wiki&amp;oldid=852629620
 |title=Wiki
 |website=Wikipedia
 |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation
 |access-date=2018-07-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Gillmor puts it another way: "When vandals learn than someone will repair their damage within minutes, and therefore prevent the damage from being visible to the world, the bad guys tend to give up and move along to more vulnerable places." (2004, p.149)

Attempts to address the security issue vary. Wikipedia's own entry on wikis again explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users known as "IP addresses" to edit content, whilst others limit this function to just registered users. What most wikis do is allow IP editing, but privilege registered users with some extra functions to lend them a hand in editing; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is very simple and can be done in seconds, but detains the user from using the new editing functions until either some time passes, as in the English Wikipedia, where registered users must wait for three days after creating an account in order to gain access to the new tool, or until several constructive edits have been made in order to prove the user's trustworthiness and usefulness on the system, as in the Portuguese Wikipedia, where users require at least 15 constructive edits before authorization to use the added tools. Basically, "closed up" wikis are more secure and reliable but grow slowly, whilst more open wikis grow at a steady rate but result in being an easy target for vandalism."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walsh (2007) quotes online media consultant Nico Macdonald on the importance of asking people to identify themselves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The key is the user's identity within the space – a picture of a person next to their post, their full name, a short bio and a link to their space online."

"A real community has, as New Labour would say, rights and responsibilities. You have to be accountable for yourself. Online, you only have the 'right' to express yourself. Online communities are not communities in a real sense – they're slightly delinquent. They allow or encourage delinquency."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Walsh (2007) argues that "Even if you don't plan on moderating a community, it's a good idea to have an editorial presence, to pop in and respond to users' questions and complaints. Apart from giving users the sense that they matter – and they really should – it also means that if you do have to take drastic measures and curtail (or even remove) a discussion or thread, it won't seem quite so much like the egregious action of some deus ex machina."

Ryan Singel of ''Wired'' also feels there is a need for an editorial presence, but for narrative reasons: "in storytelling, there's still a place for a mediator who knows when to subsume a detail for the sake of the story, and is accustomed to balancing the competing claims and interests of companies and people represented in a story."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/09/71737 Wired.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'Edit wars' are another problem in wikis, where contributors continually overwrite each other's contributions due to a difference of opinion. The worst cases, notes Lih, "may require intervention by other community members to help mediate and arbitrate".

Eva Dominguez&lt;ref name="Lavanguardia.es"/&gt; recognises the potential of wikis, but also the legal responsibilities that publishers must answer to: "The greater potential of the Internet to carry out better journalism stems from this collaboration, in which the users share and correct data, sources and facts that the journalist may not have easy access to or knowledge of. But the media, which have the ultimate responsibility for what is published, must always be able to verify everything. For example, in the case of third-party quotes included by collaborating users, the journalist must also check that they are true."

One of the biggest disadvantages may be readers' lack of awareness of what a wiki even is: only 2% of Internet users even know what a wiki is, according to a Harris Interactive poll (Francisco, 2006).

American columnist [[Bambi Francisco]]&lt;ref name="Marketwatch.com"/&gt; argues that it is only a matter of time before more professional publishers and producers begin to experiment with using "wiki-styled ways of creating content" in the same way as they have picked up on blogs.

The Telegraph's Web News Editor, Shane Richmond, wrote: "Unusually, it may be business people who bring wikis into the mainstream. That will prepare the ground for media experiments with wikis [and] I think it's a safe bet that a British media company will try a wiki before the end of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/3622051/Wiki_Wild_West/ |title=Wiki Wild West |first=Shane |last=Richmond |date=2007-01-18 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond added that ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' was planning an internal wiki as a precursor to public experiments with the technology. "Once we have a feel for the technology, we will look into a public wiki, perhaps towards the end of the year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinejournalismblog.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/are-wikis-the-new-blogs/ Onlinejournalismblog.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in New Zealand''' are women who live in or are from [[New Zealand]]. The first female settlers in New Zealand were [[Māori people|Māori]]. The first known [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European woman]] to settle in New Zealand was [[Charlotte Badger]].&lt;ref name=NZH&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/frontier-of-chaos/charlotte-badger The first woman settler? - go-betweens]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, women in [[Demographics of New Zealand|New Zealand]], also called '''Kiwi women''', are descended from European, Asian and Pacific Islander stock. 

== Notable New Zealand Women ==
* [[Katherine Mansfield]] (writer)
* [[Whina Cooper]] (Maori leader)
* [[Frances Hodgkins]] (artist)
* [[Nancy Wake]] (war heroine)
* [[Janet Frame]] (poet)
* [[Jane Campion]] (filmmaker)
* [[Jean Batten]] (aviator)
* [[Lorde]] (singer)
* [[Valerie Adams]] (shot putter)
* [[Kiri Te Kanawa|Kiri te Kanawa]] (opera singer)
* [[Kate Sheppard|Kate Sheppherd]] (suffragist)
* [[Mabel Howard]] (politician)
* [[Eleanor Catton]] (writer)
* [[Lydia Ko]] (golfer)
* [[Melanie Lynskey]] (actress)
* [[Anna Paquin]] (actress)
* [[Jenny Shipley]] (first female Prime Minister) 
* [[Helen Clark]] (first elected female Prime Minister)

== Education ==
In 1877 [[Kate Edger]] was the first woman to earn a university degree in New Zealand as well as the first women in the British empire to earn a Bachelor of arts degree. [[Helen Connon]] was Canterbury college's first female student to graduate with a Bachelor of arts degree in 1880. In 1881 she went on to be the first woman in the British Empire to graduate with an Honors Degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/first-woman-graduates-from-new-zealand-university|title=First woman graduates from a New Zealand university  {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;Early university graduates were [[Emily Siedeberg]] (doctor, graduated 1895) and [[Ethel Benjamin]] (lawyer, graduated 1897). The Female Law Practitioners Act was passed in 1896 and Benjamin was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1897.

== Political and legal history ==
During the early-mid nineteenth century there were significant differences between the worlds of Maori and European women. While married European women were considered to be subsumed under their husbands' legal status and could not own land, high ranking Maori women could and did own and inherit land.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of New Zealand Women|last=Brookes|first=Barbara|publisher=Bridget Williams Books|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Maori women held positions of social influence and were signatories to the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The founders of European settlement in New Zealand such as [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] encouraged settlement by families instead of single men because women were believed to have a "civilising" influence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however the restricted position of women under English laws and customs increasingly constrained the actions of Maori and European women alike.

In 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world to allow women to vote.&lt;ref name="Māori Women and the Vote"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/about/new-zealand-women/history/m%C4%81ori-women-and-vote|title=Māori Women and the Vote|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included both European and Maori women. However, it was not until 1919 that women were allowed to run for Parliament, and Elizabeth McCombs became the first women elected to the Parliament in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/brief-history|title=Women's Suffrage: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1940’s were an important time for the progress of women in New Zealand. The absence of service men resulting from the demands of war lead to the first women police officers completing their training in 1941.On October 26th, 1942 the Women Jurors Act was passed which for the first time allowed women between the ages of 25 and 60 to have their names placed on the jury list on the same basis as men. Elaine Kingsford was New Zealand’s first female juror and she sat on a case at the Auckland Supreme Court in 1943. [[Mary Anderson (New Zealand politician)|Mary Anderson]] became the first woman to sit on a Magistrate’s Court Bench in 1943 and then in 1946 she and [[Mary Dreaver]], a former Member of the House of Representatives, became the first women to be appointed to the Legislative Council&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/the-women-jurors-act-allows-women-to-sit-on-judicial-juries-for-first-time|title=Women Jurors Act allows women to sit on juries {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1949, [[Iriaka Matiu Ratana|Iriaka Ratana]] became the first Maori woman to win a seat in Parliament.&lt;ref name="Māori Women and the Vote" /&gt;

In 1997 Jenny Shipley became the first woman Prime Minister of New Zealand. Prior to becoming Prime Minister, Shipley held several portfolios including Women's affairs, but was best known for Social welfare and Health, where she oversaw radical and sometimes controversial reforms driven by Ruth Richardson's policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/jenny-shipley&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Parliament, Shipley became a company director in Auckland, she also became Dame Jenny Shipley in 2009. Whilst Shipley was only Prime Minister for only two years, she held some strong and influential views on what constituted leadership.

== Economic Status ==
The gender pay gap in New Zealand is 9.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/work-skills/income/gender-pay-gap|title=Gender pay gap {{!}} Ministry for Women|website=women.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand now has a set of legislation to stop discrimination against women and protect human rights. Advancements like the Equal Pay Act of 1972 that requires employers to pay men and women the same wages for the same work and the Human Rights Commission Act of 1977. There has since been other major milestones such as the establishment of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in 1985; the introduction of parental leave in 1987; and the introduction of paid parental leave in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/about/new-zealand-women|title=New Zealand women|website=women.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Development and Advancements of Women ==

=== Governmental Goals ===
New Zealand's government is making efforts towards improving its overall economic status and prosperity through increasing Women's involvement and leadership in society.

In 2004, a five-year plan known as ''[https://www.mfat.govt.nz/assets/_securedfiles/Peace-Rights-and-Security/NZ-National-Action-Plan-on-Women-Peace-and-Security.pdf The Action Plan for New Zealand Women]'' was launched in an attempt to progress work-life balance, economic stability, and well-being for women. In response to this proposed plan, 52 meetings along with stakeholder meetings took place in an effort to deliberate and advocate the new priorities for women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/sites/public_files/cedaw-2010.pdf|title=The Status of Women in New Zealand|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry for Women|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disabled Women's Access to Education and Employment ===
As of 2006, about 332,600 women (16.2%) were considered to have a disability with only about 50% of those women having an involvement in the labor force as opposed to men with about 70% involved. Women with disabilities in New Zealand lack access to programs to help learn the ways to utilize their disabilities, potentially explaining the large number of women who are not in the labor force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, in February 2009, a Ministerial Committee on Disability Issues was created by the government to target issues such as: modern disability support, making New Zealand accessible for the disabled, and getting more citizens to contribute to the effort. These efforts make up the vision outlined in the New Zealand Disability Strategy.

=== First Women enter Police Training ===
When the pressure of the Second World War began to take a toll on the workforce, New Zealand’s National Council of Women started pushing for the approval of female officers. In 1941 this idea became reality when 10 women from numerous parts of New Zealand were recruited. There were numerous requirements the trainees were required to meet, like being between 25 and 40 years of age, well educated, single, and a few others. The first 10 women to be recruited trained at the Police Training school in Wellington for three months. The women completed their training in October, then sent to work as temporary constables in various detective branches. They dealt mainly with cases involving women and delinquent children. Despite having full authority to arrest lawbreakers, the women were not uniformed until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/first-women-enter-police-training|title=First women enter police training  {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination, Prejudice, and Prostitution ==

=== Racial Discrimination ===

Despite New Zealand being a country that consists of many different integrated cultures and referred to as one of the most tolerant countries in the world, the Māori and Pasifika continually face racial discrimination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wilpf.org/racial-discrimination-in-new-zealand-maori-at-the-heart-of-the-debate/|title=Racial discrimination in New Zealand: Māori at the heart of the debate {{!}} WILPF|website=wilpf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main outlets of this racial discrimination typically tend to be work, education, and justice. The [[Māori people|Māori]] and [http://pasifikafutures.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PAF0018-Pasifika-People-in-NZ.pdf Pasifika] people usually lack a solid educational foundation which ultimately increases their tendency to use drugs, alcohol, and inflates their unemployment and poverty rates. Māori struggle to find employment among a society in which they stand as outcasts with their lack of education. The State often argues that the cause of the inability for migrant populations to acquire jobs stands in the fact that many lack the necessary experience and ability to speak fluent English. Despite the Māori people usually not fulfilling the standards to be employed, the government is making efforts to advocate on behalf of the Māori and the advantages of having a diverse workforce in New Zealand.

=== Māori Women ===

Māori women had a voice in their tribe and were able to inherit land. Women who belong to chiefly families were viewed as sacred and often performed special ceremonies like the karanga. Early European settlers generally thought that the Māori women did not have power and only negotiated with men. When the Europeans settled in the mid to late 19th century they brought with them their ideas about gender differences and inequalities that influenced laws, property rights, education and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/gender-inequalities|title=Gender inequalities – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Māori people are largely discriminated against as a whole, the women are the most heavily impacted by the gendered aspects of racial discrimination. Māori women are greatly impacted by their lack of access to employment and health and fear the violence that is inflicted upon many Māori women. However the Committee on the [http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm Elimination of Discrimination Against Women] (CEDAW) shows deep concerns regarding the violence towards Māori women and is hoping to increase the prosecution rates of those who attack women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Prostitution ===

New Zealand is recognized as being one of the most liberal countries in the world regarding sex and prostitution laws. In June 2003, the Prostitution Reform Act was passed which decriminalized prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/fraser-crichton/decriminalising-sex-work-in-new-zealand-its-history-and-impact|title=Decriminalising sex work in New Zealand: its history and impact|date=2015-08-20|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Prostitution Reform Act 2003|Prostitution Reform Act]], prostitution was still prevalent in New Zealand societies but more widespread and underground. Sex workers serve to benefit from this law as it provides them with a certain level of protection from the police force and allows for them to have specified rights. Brothels and areas of sex exchanges can be found all throughout New Zealand in modern-day society with Auckland offering the most services in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/sex-and-prostitution-in-new-zealand-1606079|title=Sex and Prostitution in New Zealand Tourism|work=TripSavvy|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">'''Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji''' (died 1296) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who held the imamate in 1261-1262.

At this time, most of Yemen was under the control of the [[Rasulid Dynasty]] which was [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] and based in the lowland. In the northern parts of the highland, members of the Zaidi elite tried to maintain a position. One of them was Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji, a 16th-generation descendant of the [[Twelve Imams|Twelver imam]] [[Hasan bin Ali]] (d. 669).&lt;ref&gt;A.B.D.R. Eagle, 'Al-Hadi Yahya b. al-Husayn b. al-Qasim', ''New Arabian Studies 2''. Exeter 1994, p. 117; http://www.almajalis.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=2632 (in Arabic). The line of descent is al-Hasan bin Ali - Zaid - al-Hasan - al-Qasim - Abd ar-Rahman - Ja'far - Muhammad - Ali - al-Husayn - Muhammad - Abdallah - al-Hasan - Abdallah - Muhammad - Ahmad - Muhammad - Yahya bin Muhammad as-Siraji.&lt;/ref&gt; Yahya performed the [[da'wa]] (summoning for the imamate) in 1261. The majority of the population in [[Hadur]] and surrounding districts acknowledged him. However, the Rasulids were on the alert and sent the redoubtable [[emir]] Alam ad-Din Sinjar al-Sha'bi with a force, "springing upon him like a cat." The Zaidis were unable to withstand the incursion and Yahya's followers scattered to distant places. Alam ad-Din then returned to [[San'a]]. Imam Yahya traveled to the land of Banu Fahim; however, the locals took him in custody and turned him over to Alam ad-Din. The emir blinded him in October 1262.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, ''The Pearl-Strings; A History of the Resuli Dynasty'', Vol. I. Leiden 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign as imam is sometimes counted until 1271, though there seem to be no records of his activities in the intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;Ayman Fu'ad Sayyid, ''Masadir ta'rikh al-Yaman fial 'asr al-islami.'' al Qahira 1974, p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; His death is recorded in 1296.&lt;ref&gt;A.B.D.R. Eagle, 1994, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
