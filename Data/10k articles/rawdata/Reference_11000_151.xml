[[File:Address book 1.jpg|thumb|A blank page in a typical paper address book]]
[[File:Jack L. Warner's address book - National Museum of American History - DSC06088.JPG|thumb|[[Jack L. Warner]]'s address book on display at the [[National Museum of American History]]]]
An '''address book''' or a '''name and address book''' ('''NAB''') is a [[book]] or a [[database]] used for storing entries called '''contacts'''. Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard [[Field (computer science)|fields]] (for example: first name, last name, company name, [[address (geography)|address]], [[telephone]] number, [[e-mail]] address, [[fax]] number, [[mobile phone]] number). Most such systems store the details in alphabetical order of people's names, although in [[paper]]-based address books entries can easily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move. Many address books use small [[ring binder]]s that allow adding, removing and shuffling of pages to make room.

== Little black book ==
A related term that has entered the popular [[lexicon]] is '''little black book''' (or simply '''black book'''). Such books are used as [[courtship|dating]] guides, listing people who the owner has dated in the past or hopes to in the future, and details of their various relationships. More explicit variations are guides for [[sexual partner]]s. It is unclear how prevalent this is in practice or when it originated, though such books have been mentioned in many pieces of [[popular culture]]. For example, the 1953 film version of ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' features a musical scene in which [[Howard Keel]]'s character laments the loss of the social life he enjoyed before marriage, naming numerous female romantic encounters while perusing a miniature black book. More recently, the mid-2000s [[Guinness Brewmasters]] advertising campaign features the "little black book" as an invention of one of the brewmasters.

== Software address book ==
[[File:X-office-address-book.svg|thumb|A digital address book icon]]
Address books can also appear as [[software]] designed for this purpose, such as the [[Address Book (application)|"Address Book"]] application included with [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mac OS X]]. Simple address books have been incorporated into [[e-mail]] software for many years, though more advanced versions have emerged in the 1990s and beyond; and also in [[mobile phone]]s.

A [[personal information manager]] (PIM) integrates an address book, [[calendar]], task list, and sometimes other features.

Entries can be imported and exported from the software in order to transfer them between programs or computers. The common file formats for these operations are:
* [[LDAP Data Interchange Format|LDIF]] (*.ldif, *.ldi)
* Tab delimited (*.tab, *.txt)
* [[Comma-separated values|Comma-separated]] (*.csv)
* [[vCard]] (*.vcf)

Individual entries are frequently transferred as [[vCard]]s (*.vcf), which are roughly comparable to physical [[business card]]s. And some software applications like [[Lotus Notes]] and Open Contacts can handle a vCard file containing multiple vCard records.

== Online address book ==
An online address book typically enables users to create their own web page (or profile page) which is then indexed by search engines like Google and Yahoo. This in turn enables users to be found by other people via a search of their name and then contacted via their web page containing their personal information. Ability to find people registered with online address books via search engine searches usually varies according to the commonness of the name and the amount of results for the name. Typically users of such systems can synchronize their contact details with other users that they know to ensure that their contact information is kept up to date.

== Network address book ==
Many people have many different address books: their [[email]] accounts, their [[mobile phone]], and the "friends lists" on their [[social networking service]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. A network address book allows them to organize and manage their address books through one interface and share their contacts across their different address books and social networks

[[File:Clash of Civilizations.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Samuel P. Huntington]] argues in the [[Clash of Civilizations]] theory that after the [[Cold War]], cultural differences between the West and other civilizations will be the main source of conflicts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel P.|date=1993-06-01|title=The Clash of Civilizations?|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1993-06-01/clash-civilizations|journal=Foreign Affairs|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Anti-Western sentiment''', also known as '''Anti-Atlanticism''', or '''Westenophobia''' (is from a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word passed into some [[Romance languages]] and  [[Greek language|Greek]] φόβος, ''phobos'', “fear”) refers to broad opposition, bias, or hostility to the people, [[Western culture|Western Culture]], Western Values ([[Western philosophy|Western Philosophy]]), or policies of the [[Western world|Western World]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anti-Western|title=Definition of ANTI-WESTERN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anti-western|title=anti-Western {{!}} Definition of anti-Western in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and usage==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In many modern cases, anti-western sentiment is fuelled by [[Anti-imperialism]], particularly against countries that are "all are deemed guilty for the colonial crimes of the past and present"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/embassy-attacks-salafis-jihadists|title=Anti-western violence gripping the Arab world has little to do with a film|last=Abdul-Ahad|first=Ghaith|date=2012-09-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Germany, Britain and the Dutch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Anti-Western sentiment occurs in many countries, even from the West itself &amp;ndash; especially European countries. Broad anti-Western sentiment also exists in the [[Muslim world]] against Europeans and the [[United States|United States.]] The hatred against the United States stems from their support for Israel, the seizure of Iraq and the numerous sanctions on Iran.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

After the end of the [[Cold War]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]] argued that international conflict over economic ideology will be replaced with conflict over cultural differences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He argues that [[Regional integration|economic]] and [[Regionalism (politics)|political]] regionalism will increasingly shift non-Western countries towards [[geopolitical]] engagement with countries that share their values. Huntington argues that the [[Islamic world]] experiencing a population explosion at the same time as a growth in Islamic fanaticism, leading to rejection of [[Westernization]].

==Africa==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Africa is often the posterchild for [[post-colonial]] societal collapse where retreating empires and corporate wars for resources have left behind nations unable to maintain their current trajectory of development or even their current state of affairs. Many conflicts currently playing out in Africa, similar to the Middle East, are often blamed on the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Germany, and the United States for arbitrary borders drawn with little regard to the ethnicity, tribal affiliation, and religions of the original inhabitants.

===Russia===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 21 February 2001-2.jpg|thumb|left|Russian President Vladimir Putin with religious leaders of Russia, 2001. Putin has promoted religious traditionalism and the rejection of some Western liberal principles, like toleration of homosexuality.]]
After the [[Cold War]], a number of politicians in the Russian Federation have supported an explicit promotion of Russian Orthodox traditionalism, and a rejection of Western liberalism.

Some [[ultra-nationalist]] politicians, such as [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], an anti-communist, express the most anti-Western sentiment.

[[Vladimir Putin]] has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad.  Putin has attacked [[globalism]] and [[neo-liberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Prozorov,  "Russian conservatism in the Putin presidency: The dispersion of a hegemonic discourse." ''Journal of Political Ideologies'' 10#2 (2005): 121–143.&lt;/ref&gt;  and promoted new think tanks that stress Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marlene Laruelle, "The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant‐Garde in Russia." ''Russian Review'' 75#4 (2016): 626–644.&lt;/ref&gt; Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]], head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like "a miracle of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Gerlach and Jochen Töpfer, eds.|title=The Role of Religion in Eastern Europe Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F6vBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135|year=2014|publisher=Springer|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Higgins, "In Expanding Russian Influence, Faith Combines With Firepower," [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/world/europe/russia-orthodox-church.html ''New York Times'' Sept 13, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Orthodox Church sometimes is host to groups that promote nationalist and anti-Western tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rbth.com/articles/2012/04/23/the_russian_orthodox_church_wont_be_silent_15378.html|title=The Russian Orthodox Church won't be silent|last=Darmaros|first=Marina|date=2012-04-23|work=Russia Beyond The Headlines|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Verkhovsky, "The role of the Russian Orthodox Church in nationalist, xenophobic and antiwestern tendencies in Russia today: Not nationalism, but fundamentalism." ''Religion, State &amp; Society'' 304 (2002): 333-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government has restricted foreign funding of some pro-liberal Non Governmental Organizations. Pro-Russian activists in the former Soviet Union frequently equate the West with [[homosexuality]] and the [[gay agenda]],&lt;ref name="gaywest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anne-applebaum-russias-anti-western-ideology-has-global-consequences/2014/03/28/b96fd172-b6a6-11e3-8cc3-d4bf596577eb_story.html|title=Anne Applebaum: Russia’s anti-Western ideology has global consequences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian gay propaganda law]] was welcomed by nationalist and religious political figures in Russia as a bulwark against Western influence.&lt;ref name="rtnl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/nobel-laureates-putin-gay-592/|title=27 Nobel laureates urge Putin to repeal gay propaganda law|date=14 January 2014|publisher=Russia Today|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yarovaya Law]] prohibits evangelism by religious minorities, which was used to ban the U.S.-based Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-jehovah-witnesses-extremist-organization-/28374043.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"America thinks of modernity as all good — and it has been almost all good for America.  But for the [[Arab world]], modernity has been one failure after another.

'''YP Southeast Advertising &amp; Publishing LLC''', originally '''BellSouth Advertising &amp; Publishing Corporation''', or "BAPCO", publishes telephone directories for [[AT&amp;T]] customers served by [[BellSouth Telecommunications]]. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&amp;T.

It was founded in 1984 to undertake the operations of the '''Bell System Yellow Pages''' owned by [[Southern Bell]] and [[South Central Bell]]. BAPCO published its directories under the "Real Pages" name. It was acquired by [[AT&amp;T]] in 2006 upon the acquisition of its parent, [[BellSouth]].

BAPCO's namesake remained with [[AT&amp;T]] directory operations when they collectively did business as [[AT&amp;T Advertising &amp; Publishing]] until 2008. AT&amp;T changed its directory name to '''The Real Yellow Pages'''.

In 2012, BellSouth Advertising and Publishing became a part of [[YP Holdings]], a joint venture between [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and [[AT&amp;T]]. It was reincorporated in [[Delaware]] as '''YP Southeast Advertising &amp; Publishing LLC'''.

==Virtual existence==

===Website===

The society began a website in 2003&lt;ref name="musing"&gt;[http://carnamah.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/carnamahs-dot-com.html "Musing magazine: Carnamah's dot com". Carnamah Historical Society's Blog]. Retrieved 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and meets many of its organisational objectives online. While its museum collection relates primarily to the Carnamah district, the society has taken a more regional approach online which has been attributed with putting Carnamah into better historical context.&lt;ref name="ASBlog" /&gt;

Online content includes an expansive [[biographical dictionary]], [[virtual museum]], historical photographs, cemetery records, local histories and [[Australian Curriculum]] resources.&lt;ref name="carnamah" /&gt; On the recommendation of the [[State Library of Western Australia]] the society's website has been periodically archived for posterity since 2004 under the [[Preserving and Accessing Networked Documentary Resources of Australia]] (PANDORA) program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/tep/41383 "Carnamah Historical Society".

Facebook]. Retrieved 31 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also joined and attracted a following on [[Twitter]], [[Flickr]], [[Google+]], [[Pinterest]], [[Instagram]] and [[LinkedIn]].&lt;ref name="carnamah" /&gt; The society uses social media to engage and interact with online followers about Carnamah's history, its museum and online content.&lt;ref name="ASBlog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt; As a result of exposure on social media the society and its activities were profiled in a two-page spread in the Nov-Dec 2011 issue of ''Inside History'' magazine and in the spring 2011 edition of ''Musing'', the publication of Museums Australia WA.&lt;ref name="insidehistory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASBlog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="musing" /&gt;

The society was invited to contribute as a guest author to the [[blog]] of Collections Australia Network (CAN). The invitation was accepted however CAN ceased its operations a few weeks after four posts had been written. The society instead started its own blog in May 2011 and began blogging on a regular basis after publishing the posts intended for CAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnamah.blogspot.com.au/2011/05/decision-to-blog_09.html "The decision to blog!".

===Biographical Dictionary===

The society, in collaboration with the North Midlands Project, produces the online ''Biographical Dictionary of Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs''. The dictionary contains referenced biographical and local information on thousands of people with a connection to the shires of [[Shire of Coorow|Coorow]], Carnamah or [[Shire of Three Springs|Three Springs]]. It is a merged and improved version of the society’s former Coorow-Waddy, Carnamah-Winchester and Three Springs databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnamah.com.au/biographical-dictionary “Biographical Dictionary of Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs” Carnamah Historical Society &amp; Museum].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4220">[[File:Codex Suprasliensis.jpg|thumb|Codex Suprasliensis]]
The '''Codex Suprasliensis''' is a 10th-century [[Early Cyrillic|Cyrillic]] literary monument, the largest extant [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[manuscript]] and the oldest Slavic literary work in [[Poland]]. As of September 20, 2007, it is on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World]] list.

The codex, written at the end or even in the middle of the 10th century, contains a [[menaion]] for the month of March, intersecting with the movable cycle of Easter. It also contains 24 lives of saints, 23 [[homily|homilies]] and one prayer, most of which were written by or are attributed to [[John Chrysostom]]. The 284-folio (or 285-folio, according to some sources) codex was "discovered" in 1823 by Canon Michał Bobrowski in the [[Supraśl Orthodox Monastery|Uniate Basilian monastery in Supraśl]]. 

In 1838, Bobrowski sent the last part of the manuscript in two pieces to Slovene philologist [[Jernej Kopitar]] so that he could transcribe it. After Kopitar returned it, Bobrowski sent him the first part (118 [[Recto and verso|folio]]s), however for unknown reason it was never returned to Bobrowski and was found in 1845 among the documents of the deceased Kopitar. It was later kept by the [[Ljubljana Lyceum]] and now by the [[National and University Library of Slovenia]] in Ljubljana. 

The largest part was bought for the private library of the [[Zamoyski]] family in [[Warsaw]]. This part of the codex disappeared during [[World War II]], but later resurfaced in the [[United States]] and was returned by Herbert Moeller to Poland in 1968, where it has been held by the [[National Library of Poland]] in Warsaw until the present day. The third part, consisting of 16 folios, is held by the [[Russian National Library]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

The codex was published by [[Franc Miklošič|Fran Miklošič]] (Vienna, 1851), Sergej Severjanov (''Suprasalьskaja rukopisь'', Saint Petersburg, 1904), and Jordan Zaimov and Mario Capaldo (Sophia, 1982–1983). Alfons Margulies produced a significant volume on the codex titled ''Der altkirchenslavische Codex Suprasliensis'' (Heidelberg, 1927).

Folio 260 of the manuscript contains the note ''g(ospod)i pomilui retъka amin''. Some experts think retъka represents the name of a scribe (hence the occasional name ''Codex of Retko'') and that the text was copied from several sources. Research indicates that at least one of the sources may have Glagolitic (for Epiphanius' ''Homily on the Entombment''). Vocalizations of [[yer]]s, rarely occurring epenthesis, change of ''ъ'' to ''ь'' behind hardened ''č'', ''ž'', ''š'' and some other linguistic traits point to its Bulgarian linguistic provenance.

This article provides introductory information about the RGB, HSV, and HSL color models from a computer graphics (Web page, image) perspective. An introduction to colors is also provided to support the main discussion.

==Basics of color==
[[Image:Simple RGB color wheel.png|right|A simple color wheel based on the additive colors.]]

===Primary colors and hue===
{{further|Color perception|Additive color|Hue}}

First, "color" refers to the human brain's subjective interpretation of combinations of a narrow band of wavelengths of light. For this reason, the definition of "color" is not based on a strict set of physical phenomena. Therefore, even basic concepts like "primary colors" are not clearly defined. For example, traditional "Painter's Colors" use red, blue, and yellow as the primary colors, "Printer's Colors" use cyan, yellow, and magenta, and "Light Colors" use red, green, and blue.&lt;ref name=ArtDesignVisualThinking&gt;{{cite web|last=Jirousek|first=Charlotte|title=Color, Value, and Hue|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/language/element/color/color.htm|work=Art, Design, and Visual Thinking|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Light colors", more formally known as additive colors, are formed by combining red, green, and blue light. This article refers to additive colors and refers to red, green, and blue as the primary colors.

Hue is a term describing a pure color, that is, a color not modified by tinting or shading (see below). In additive colors, hues are formed by combining two primary colors. When two primary colors are combined in equal intensities, the result is a "secondary color".

===Color wheel===
{{main|Color wheel}}

A color wheel is a tool that provides a visual representation of the relationships between all possible hues. The primary colors are arranged around a circle at equal (120 degree) intervals. (Warning: Color wheels frequently depict "Painter's Colors" primary colors, which leads to a different set of hues than additive colors.) The illustration shows a simple color wheel based on the additive colors. Note that the position (top, right) of the starting color, typically red, is arbitrary, as is the order of green and blue (clockwise, counter-clockwise). The illustration also shows the secondary colors, yellow, cyan, and magenta, located halfway between (60 degrees) the primary colors.

==Complementary color==
{{main|Complementary color}}

The complement of a hue is the hue that is opposite it (180 degrees) on the color wheel. Using additive colors, mixing a hue and its complement in equal amounts produces white.

===Tints and shades===
{{main|Tints and shades}}

The following discussion uses an illustration involving three projectors pointing to the same spot on a screen. Each projector is capable of generating one hue. The "intensities" of each projector are "matched" and can be equally adjusted from zero to full. (Note: "Intensity" is used here in the same sense as the RGB color model. The subject of matching, or "[[gamma correction]]", is beyond the level of this article.)

A ''shade'' is produced by "dimming" a hue. Painters refer to this as "adding black". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. "Dimming" is accomplished by decreasing each projector's intensity setting to the same fraction of its start setting.

In the shade example, with any fully shaded hue, that all three projectors are set to zero intensity, resulting in black.

A ''tint'' is produced by "lightening" a hue. Painters refer to this as "adding white". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. "Lightening" is accomplished by increasing each projector's intensity setting by the same fraction from its start setting to full.

In the tinting example, note that the third projector is now contributing. When the hue is fully lightened, all three projectors are each at full intensity, and the result is white.

Note an attribute of the total intensity in the additive model. If full intensity for one projector is 1, then a primary color has a combined intensity of 1. A secondary color has a total intensity of 2. White has a total intensity of 3. Tinting, or "adding white", increases the total intensity of the hue. While this is simply a fact, the HSL model will take this fact into account in its design.

===Tones===
{{further|Colorfulness}}

''Tone'' is a general term, typically used by painters, to refer to the effects of reducing the "colorfulness" of a hue.;&lt;ref name=ArtDesignVisualThinking /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boddy-Evans|first=Marion|title=Painting Color Class: Tones or Values|url=http://painting.about.com/od/colourtheory/ss/ColorClassTones.htm|work=About.Com Guide|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; painters refer to it as "adding gray". Note that gray is not a color or even a single concept but refers to all the range of values between black and white where all three primary colors are equally represented. The general term is provided as more specific terms have conflicting definitions in different color models. Thus, shading takes a hue toward black, tinting takes a hue towards white, and tones cover the range between.

==Choosing a color model==
No one color model is necessarily "better" than another. Typically, the choice of a color model is dictated by external factors, such as a graphics tool or the need to specify colors according to the CSS2 or CSS3 standard. The following discussion only describes how the models function, centered on the concepts of hue, shade, tint, and tone.

===RGB===
{{main|RGB color model}}

The RGB model's approach to colors is important because:
* It directly reflects the physical properties of "[[Color depth#Truecolor|Truecolor]]" displays
* As of 2011, most graphic cards define pixel values in terms of the colors red, green, and blue. The typical range of intensity values for each color, 0–255,  is based on taking a binary number with 32 bits and breaking it up into four bytes of 8 bits each. 8 bits can hold a value from 0 to 255. The fourth byte is used to specify the "[[Alpha compositing|alpha]]", or the opacity, of the color. Opacity comes into play when layers with different colors are stacked. If the color in the top layer is less than fully opaque (alpha &lt; 255), the color from underlying layers "shows through".

In the RGB model, hues are represented by specifying one color as full intensity (255), a second color with a variable intensity, and the third color with no intensity (0).

The following provides some examples using red as the full-intensity and green as the partial-intensity colors; blue is always zero:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Red !! Green !! Result
|-
| 255 || 0 ||&lt;span style="background: #ff0000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;red (255, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 255 || 128 ||&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;orange (255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| 255 || 255 ||&lt;span style="background: #ffff00;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;yellow (255, 255, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Shades are created by multiplying the intensity of each primary color by 1 minus the shade factor, in the range 0 to 1. A shade factor of 0 does nothing to the hue, a shade factor of 1 produces black:
:new intensity = current intensity * (1 – shade factor)

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C06000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 96, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #804000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 64, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 32, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Tints are created by modifying each primary color as follows: the intensity is increased so that the ''difference'' between the intensity and full intensity (255) is ''decreased'' by the tint factor, in the range 0 to 1. A tint factor of 0 does nothing, a tint factor of 1 produces white: &lt;br /&gt;
:new intensity = current intensity + (255 – current intensity) * tint factor

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffa040;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 160, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffc080;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 192, 128)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffe0c0;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 224, 192)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #ffffff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 255, 255)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|}

Tones are created by applying both a shade and a tint. The order in which the two operations are performed does not matter, with the following restriction: when a tint operation is performed on a shade, the intensity of the dominant color becomes the "full intensity"; that is, the intensity value of the dominant color must be used in place of 255.

The following provides examples using orange:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! 0 !! .25 !! .5 !! .75 !! 1.0
|-
! 0
|&lt;span style="background: #ff8000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 128, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C06000;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 96, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #804000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 64, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 32, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! .25
|&lt;span style="background: #ffa040;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 160, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #c07830;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 120, 48)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #805020; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 80, 32)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #402810; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 40, 16)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
! .5
|&lt;span style="background: #ffc080;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(255, 192, 128)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #C09060;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(192, 144, 96)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #806040; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 96, 64)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #403020; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 48, 32)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;

|&lt;span style="background: #807060; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(128, 112, 96)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #403830; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(64, 56, 48)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="background: #000000; color: #fff;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0, 0, 0)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;

===HSV===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}

The HSV, or HSB, model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and value (brightness). Note that the range of values for each attribute is arbitrarily defined by various tools or standards. Be sure to determine the value ranges before attempting to interpret a value.

Hue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are
*The angular relationship between tones around the color circle is easily identified
*Shades, tints, and tones can be generated easily without affecting the hue

Saturation corresponds directly to the concept of tint in the Color Basics section, except that full saturation produces no tint, while zero saturation produces white, a shade of gray, or black.

Value corresponds directly to the concept of intensity in the Color Basics section.
*Pure colors are produced by specifying a hue with full saturation and value
*Shades are produced by specifying a hue with full saturation and less than full value
*Tints are produced by specifying a hue with less than full saturation and full value
*Tones are produced by specifying a hue and both less than full saturation and value
*White is produced by specifying zero saturation and full value, regardless of hue
*Black is produced by specifying zero value, regardless of hue or saturation
*Shades of gray are produced by specifying zero saturation and between zero and full value
The advantage of HSV is that each of its attributes corresponds directly to the basic color concepts, which makes it conceptually simple. The perceived disadvantage of HSV is that the saturation attribute corresponds to tinting, so desaturated colors have increasing total intensity. For this reason, the CSS3 standard plans to support RGB and HSL but not HSV.&lt;ref name="CSS3 HSL"&gt;{{cite web|last=W3C|title=4.2.4. HSL color values|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#foreground|work=CSS Color Module Level 3|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HSL===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}

The HSL model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and lightness (also called luminance). (Note: the definition of saturation in HSL is substantially different from HSV, and lightness is not intensity.) The model has two prominent properties:
*The transition from black to a hue to white is symmetric and is controlled solely by increasing lightness
*Decreasing saturation transitions to a shade of gray dependent on the lightness, thus keeping the overall intensity relatively constant
The properties mentioned above have led to the wide use of HSL, in particular, in the CSS3 color model.&lt;ref name="CSS3 HSL"/&gt;

As in HSV, hue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are
*The angular relationship between tones around the color circle is easily identified
*Shades, tints, and tones can be generated easily without affecting the hue

Lightness combines the concepts of shading and tinting from the Color Basics section. Assuming full saturation, lightness is neutral at the midpoint value, for example 50%, and the hue displays unaltered. As lightness decreases below the midpoint, it has the effect of shading. Zero lightness produces black. As the value increases above 50%, it has the effect of tinting, and full lightness produces white.

At zero saturation, lightness controls the resulting shade of gray. A value of zero still produces black, and full lightness still produces white. The midpoint value results in the "middle" shade of gray, with an RGB value of (128,128,128).

Saturation, or the lack of it, produces tones of the reference hue that converge on the zero-saturation shade of gray, which is determined by the lightness. The following examples uses the hues red, orange, and yellow at midpoint lightness with decreasing saturation. The resulting RGB value and the total intensity is shown.

Note that the physical nature of additive color prevents the scheme from working exactly except for hues halfway between the primary and secondary colors. However, the total intensity of the tones resulting from decreasing saturation are much closer than tinting alone, as in HSV.

{{Unreferenced|auto=yes|date=December 2009}}

The '''Computus Runicus''' refers to a [[runic calendar]] produced in 1328 and found on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] island of [[Gotland]]. A transcription/description of the text - called ''Computus Runicus'' - was published in 1626 by the Danish [[physician]] and [[antiquarian]] [[Ole Worm]] (Olaus Wormius). 

The text consists of the 12 calendar pages and a series of additional pages with detailed explanations for finding information used in the medieval [[computus]], including [[golden numbers]] and [[epacts]].

The calendar is written in [[medieval runes]] with a gloss in [[Latin]] and some places also in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] added by Worm. It follows a standard layout for a Medieval calendar similar to those found in a [[book of hours]], with Christian feasts and saint's days. Worm attempted to identify some of the unusual symbols found in the calendar, including one marking fast days and another marking the beginning of the [[Zodiac]] months which curiously start on the 18th day of each month instead of the more common 20th or 21st.

As with any medieval calendar, there is a column for the golden numbers used in the [[Metonic cycle]] (to find the date of Easter) and another column for the [[dominical letters]] (to find the date of Sunday each week). January 31st and the month of February have an additional column to be used for finding the beginning of [[Lent]], while March and April have an additional column to assist with finding the date of [[Easter]]. The author used a similar system of rune replacements for the Latin letters and Roman numerals as those commonly found in other runic calendars, including the use of the extra runes Arlaug, Tvimadur, and Belgthor to represent the Golden Numbers 17, 18, and 19&lt;ref&gt;[[runic calendar]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The test procedures may involve other criteria from [[test functions for optimization|mathematical testing]] or [[chemical test]]ing. Beyond simple conformance, other requirements for efficiency, interoperability or compliance may apply. Conformance testing is performed by an [[accredited]] independent organization, which can sometimes be the author of the standard (UL, FM for example). When testing is accompanied by [[Certification]], the products or services may then be advertised as being certified in compliance with the referred [[technical standard]]. Manufacturers and suppliers of products and services rely on such certification including listing on the certification body's website, to assure quality to the end user and that competing suppliers are on the same level.

Aside from the various types of testing, related conformance testing activities include:

* [[Surveillance]]
* [[Inspection]]
* [[Auditing]]
* [[Certification]]
* [[Accreditation]]

== Typical areas of application ==

Conformance testing is applied in various industries where a product or service must meet specific quality and/or regulatory standards. This includes areas such as:&lt;ref name="TrenkaevInter03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WerstiukRelay07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="INCITSReport05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="W3CConform02"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/QA/2002/01/Note-qa-certif-20020102.html |title=Conformance Testing and Certification Model for W3C Specifications |editor=Dardailler, D. |publisher=W3C |date=January 2002 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EvansSpec05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0e295yPUBPMC&amp;pg=PA74 |chapter=Chapter 4: Specifications and Quality |title=Pharmaceutical Packaging Technology |author=Evans, E.R. |editor1=Dean, D.A.|editor2=Evans, E.R.|editor3=Hall, I.H. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=73–105 |year=2005 |isbn=9780203301814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* biocompatibility proofing
* data and communications [[protocol engineering]]
* document engineering
* electronic and electrical engineering
* medical procedure proofing
* pharmaceutical packaging
* software engineering
* building construction (fire)

In all such testing, the subject of test is not just the formal conformance in aspects of completeness of filed proofs, validity of referred certificates, and qualification of operating staff. Rather, it also heavily focuses on operational conditions, physical conditions, and applied test environments. By extension conformance testing leads to a vast set of documents and files that allow for reiterating all performed tests.

=== Software engineering ===

In [[software testing]], conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. [[Compiler]]s, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.&lt;ref name="GoerigkTowards99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gM6AS9_XwtgC&amp;pg=PA62 |chapter=Towards Rigorous Compiler Implementation Verification |title=Collaboration Between Human and Artificial Societies: Coordination and Agent-Based Distributed Computing |author=Goerigk, W.; Simon, F. |editor=Padget, J.A. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=62–73 |year=1999 |isbn=9783540669302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CuginiACent01"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hrizEY2BWOoC&amp;pg=PA258 |chapter=FORTRAN Test Programs |title=A Century of Excellence in Measurements, Standards, and Technology |author=Cugini, J. |editor=Lide, D.R. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=258–259 |year=2001 |isbn=9780849312472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronic and electrical engineering ===

In [[electronic engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]], some countries and business environments (such as telecommunication companies) require that an electronic product meet certain requirements before they can be sold.&lt;ref name="WerstiukRelay07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RyanHigh01"&gt;{{cite book |title=High Voltage Engineering and Testing |editor=Ryan, H.M. |publisher=The Institution of Electrical Engineers |edition=2nd |year=2001 |pages=726 |isbn=9780852967751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standards for telecommunication products written by standards organizations such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] have certain criteria that a product must meet before compliance is recognized. In countries such as Japan, China, Korea, and some parts of Europe, products cannot be sold unless they are known to meet those requirements specified in the standards.&lt;ref name="COCIRHowDoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bomcheck.net/rohs/how-does-bomcheck-manage-compliance-with-rohs-restrictions-in-china-korea-japan |title=How does BOMcheck manage compliance with RoHS restrictions in China, Korea and Japan? |work=BOMcheck.net |publisher=COCIR |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EURLex31993"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31993L0068:en:HTML |title=EUR-Lex - 31993L0068 - EN |work=EUR-Lex |publisher=European Union |date=30 August 1993 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, manufacturers set their own requirements to ensure product quality, sometimes with levels much higher than what the governing bodies require. Compliance is realized after a product passes a series of tests without occurring some specified mode of failure.

Compliance testing for electronic devices include emissions tests, immunity tests, and safety tests.&lt;ref name="ECMAAGuide99"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-TR/ECMA%20TR-074.PDF |format=PDF |title=ECMA Technical Report TR/74: A Guide to the Application of the EMC Directive to ITE |publisher=ECMA |date=June 1999 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions tests ensure that a product will not emit harmful electromagnetic interference in communication and power lines. Immunity tests ensure that a product is immune to common electrical signals and [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) that will be found in its operating environment, such as [[electromagnetic radiation]] from a local radio station or interference from nearby products. Safety tests ensure that a product will not create a safety risk from situations such as a failed or shorted power supply, blocked cooling vent, and powerline [[voltage spike]]s and dips.

For example, [[Ericsson]]'s telecommunications research and development subsidiary [[Telcordia Technologies]] publishes conformance standards for telecommunication equipment to pass the following tests:&lt;ref name="EricssonElectro17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1089&amp; |title=Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety - Generic Criteria for Network Telecommunications Equipment |publisher=Ericsson |date=December 2017 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Radiated immunity : An [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] is used to subject the device to [[electromagnetic waves]], covering a large frequency range (usually from 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 2.9&amp;nbsp;GHz).
; Radiated emissions : One or more antennas are used to measure the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves that a device emits. The amplitude must be under a set limit, with the limit depending on the device's classification.
; Conducted immunity : Low frequency signals (usually 10&amp;nbsp;kHz to 80&amp;nbsp;MHz) are injected onto the data and power lines of a device. This test is used to simulate the coupling of low frequency signals onto the power and data lines, such as from a local AM radio station.
; Conducted emissions : Similar to radiated emissions, except the signals are measured at the power lines with a [[electronic filter|filter]] device.
; [[Electrostatic discharge]] (ESD) immunity : Electrostatic discharges with various properties ([[rise time]], peak voltage, [[fall time]], and [[half time (electronics)|half time]]) are applied to the areas on the device that are likely to be discharged too, such as the faces, near user accessible buttons, etc. Discharges are also applied to a vertical and horizontal [[ground plane]] to simulate an ESD event on a nearby surface. Voltages are usually from 2 kV to 15 kV, but commonly go as high as 25 kV or more.
; [[List of common EMC test standards#IEC standards | Electrical Fast Transient Burst immunity (EFTB)]] : Bursts of high voltage pulses are applied to the powerlines to simulate events such as repeating voltage spikes from a motor.
; Powerline dip immunity : The line voltage is slowly dropped down then brought back up.
; Powerline surge immunity : A surge is applied to the line voltage.

== Standardization and agreements ==

Several international standards relating to conformance testing are published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and covered in the divisions of ICS 03.120.20 for management&lt;ref name=pccc&gt;{{cite web |last = [[International Organization for Standardization]] |first = |authorlink = |author2 = |title = 03.120.20: Product and company certification.

===Conformity assessment and mutual recognition agreements===
Many countries sign [[mutual recognition agreement]]s (MRAs) with other countries in order to promote trade of and facilitate market access to goods and services, while making it easier to meet a country's conformance testing requirements.&lt;ref name="EC-MRA18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/international-aspects/mutual-recognition-agreements_en |title=Mutual Recognition Agreements |publisher=European Commission |date=22 February 2018 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NISTMutual17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/what-we-do/conformity-assessment/mutual-recognition-agreements-mras |title=Mutual Recognition Agreements for Conformity Assessment of Telecommunications Equipment |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |date=6 September 2017 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO68:2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/29363.html |title=ISO/IEC Guide 68:2002 Arrangements for the recognition and acceptance of conformity assessment results |publisher=International Organization for Standards |date=January 2002 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these agreements have the advantage of increasing confidence in conformance assessment bodies (e.g., testing labs and certification bodies),&lt;ref name="NISTMutual17" /&gt; and by extension, product quality.&lt;ref name="ISOWhatIs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WTOTech"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tbt_e/tbt_info_e.htm |title=Technical Information on Technical barriers to trade |work=Trade Topics |publisher=World Trade Organization |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desktop wars''' may refer to:

* The struggle for dominance of the desktop computer market from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s between [[Classic Mac OS|Apple's classic Mac OS]], [[History of Microsoft Windows|Microsoft's Windows (DOS-based)]] and [[OS/2|IBM's OS/2]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* The debate among [[Linux]] users and developers as to which Linux [[desktop environment]] is best; generally, the wars are fought over [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]], although alternatives such as [[Xfce]] are tossed in the mix. For the most part, it is friendly competition between the two, but occasionally, there have been cases in which aspects of the development of desktop environments have been criticised, such as by [[Linus Torvalds#Later years|Linus Torvalds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNOME v.

'''''Dictionnaire d'histoire et de géographie ecclésiastiques''''' is an encyclopaedia founded by the future cardinal [[Alfred-Henri-Marie Baudrillart]] in 1912.

This immense and exhaustive work is currently edited by Luc Courtois and Eddy Louchez of Louvain (UCL) and published by Brepols of [[Turnhout]]. This encyclopedia, in [[French language|French]] and English, covers mainly subjects, people and places related to the Christian tradition and follows a strict alphabetical order.

The first fascicule (from entry ''Aachs'') was published in 1912 and the publication follows regularly year after year. In 2015 this encyclopedia arrived at fascicule 185 (containing entries from ''Leyen'' to ''Licayrac''). The whole work is published also in volumes, and up to 2015 the volumes published are 31 (up to entry ''Licayrac''). The two subsequent fasciscules are, unlike earlier fasciscules, selective in content.

'''Veritas Enterprise Vault''' (EV) is an enterprise information archive platform developed by [[Veritas Technologies]].  It is part of the company's "Information Governance" suite.&lt;ref name="infoStor"&gt;Symantec bundles archiving and security:http://www.infostor.com/display_article/295641/23/ARTCL/none/none/Symantec-bundles-archiving-and-security/&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise Vault has the ability to archive from various sources such as Microsoft Exchange (2016, 2013, 2010, 2007, 2003), SMTP (any), IBM Domino (latest release), [[Microsoft]] [[SharePoint]] and various File Systems (NTFS, Unix) with the ability to store on a multiple of storage platforms, such as [[NTFS]], [[NetApp]], [[EMC Corporation|Centera]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]] and [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]].&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.entsupport.symantec.com/pub/support/products/Exchange_Mailbox_Archiving_Unit/276547.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The data archived is indexed, classified, de-duplicated and securely stored.

==History==
Enterprise Vault was originally developed at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) by a group of developers who had previously been the engineering team for Digital's VMS based ALL-IN-1 office and messaging system.  After DEC was acquired by [[Compaq Computer Corporation]] the Enterprise Vault team was terminated just after Version 1 of the product was shipped. 

Technical Director Nigel Dutt approached Edward Forwood of broker Durlacher with a proposal to start a company to develop and sell the product.  They consequently acquired the rights to the product and formed kVault Software Limited in late 1999 with initial funding from Durlacher.  The  four years from 2000&amp;ndash;2004 saw greatly improved sales and eventual acquisition by [[VERITAS Software]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="KVS"&gt;VERITAS News Release: http://www.tornado-insider.com/radar/compShow.asp?compID=5717&lt;/ref&gt; Veritas was subsequently acquired by Symantec in 2005 for $13.5B. However, on February 1st 2016, Symantec completed its sale of Veritas to the Carlyle group for $7.4B and Enterprise Vault again reverted to being a [[Veritas_Technologies|Veritas]] product. 

Enterprise Vault was originally part of Symantec's "Enterprise Messaging Management" group (created after Symantec acquired VERITAS in 2005&lt;ref name="VRTS"&gt;Symantec News Release: http://www.symantec.com/about/news/release/article.jsp?prid=20050705_01&lt;/ref&gt;). Much of the original KVS Engineering team of [[software developer|Development]] and [[Software quality|QA]] still work on Enterprise Vault, based in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading (UK)]] and [[Pune]] (India).{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

As of June 2018 all Enterprise Vault engineers in the UK were made redundant.

==Golden Ball==
The ''Golden Ball'' award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the ''Silver Ball'' and ''Bronze Ball'' awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by [[Adidas]] and ''[[France Football]]'', though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as "golden ball winners" Kempes, Cruyff, Pelé, Bobby Charlton, Garrincha and Didi for 1978, 1974, 1970, 1966, 1962 and 1958 respectively.&lt;ref name=82debut&gt;[[#82tech|1982 FIFA World Cup Technical Report]], page 222: Paolo Rossi wins both adidas/France Football World Cup Trophies&lt;/ref&gt; [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times ([[Johan Cruyff]] in 1974, [[Romário]] in 1994, [[Lionel Messi]] in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/07/15/world-cup-golden-ball-award-past-winners-best-players|title=Golden Ball winners in World Cup history|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golden Boot==
The ''Golden Boot'' or ''Golden Shoe'' Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982,&lt;ref name="FIFA Awards"/&gt; under the name Golden Shoe.&lt;ref name=82debut/&gt; It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010.&lt;ref name=glance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://championsataglance.fifa.com/#14|title=Champions at a Glance|page=14|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.&lt;ref name=boot&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/worldcup/awards/goldenshoe.html|title=adidas Golden Shoe - FIFA World Cup™ Final|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal, if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such.&lt;ref name="busw1994"&gt;
{{Cite news|title=Romario is voted the top player of World Cup '94 and winner of the FIFA/adidas Golden Ball award; Salenko and Stoichkov tie as leading scorers for World Cup USA '94 |date=17 July 1994 |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |quote=[FIFA] has announced Oleg Salenko (Russia) and Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgaria) as [...] winners of the prestigious adidas Golden Shoe award [...] who made six goals and one assist each. Kennet Andersson (Sweden) with 5 goals and 3 assists, will receive a Bronze replica of the Predator [...] Throughout World Cup '94, three points were awarded for each goal scored and one point for each assist leading to a goal, with a maximum of two assists per goal. Assists are only taken into account if two or more players scored the same number of goals.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afp1994"&gt;
{{cite news|publisher=[[Agence France Presse]]|date=11 July 1994 |title=Football by the numbers |first=Rebecca |last=Bryan |location=Los Angeles |quote=the assist has gained enough ground to earn a place in the calculations for the Golden Boot award, which in every previous World Cup has been awarded solely on the basis of goals scored. Under the formula, players get three points for a goal, and one point for an assist. "We made a two-point difference because we do not want someone who did not score winning the award," a FIFA official said.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time, which translates to a higher goal average.&lt;ref name="FIFA Golden Boot Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/awards/golden-boot/intro.html|title=2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil – Awards – adidas Golden Boot|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golden Glove==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FIFA World Cup]] --&gt;
The ''Golden Glove Award'' is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name ''[[Lev Yashin]] Award'' in 1994, in honor of the late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] goalkeeper.&lt;ref name="FIFA Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_22643.pdf |title=FIFA World Cups: Awards |publisher=FIFA.com |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630203029/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-301_03a_fwc-awards_22643.pdf |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002. In the event of a tie, the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition. The next tiebreakers are saves made, then minutes played.

==Best Young Player Award==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FIFA World Cup]] --&gt;
The ''Best Young Player'' award was awarded for the first time at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany and given to Germany's [[Lukas Podolski]].&lt;ref name=podolski/&gt; The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old.  For the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997. The election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/awards/young-player-award/|title=Hyundai Young Player Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=FIFA.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the "best young player" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=award&amp;Id=9|title=FIFA World Cup Best Young Player Award|publisher=footballdatabase.com|accessdate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was [[Pelé]], who finished ahead of the [[Peru]]vian [[Teófilo Cubillas]], the best young player at [[1970 FIFA World Cup|Mexico 1970]], and England's [[Michael Owen]], who reached similar heights at [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 98]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=14690.html |title=Pele, Best Young Player Ever |publisher=newagebd.com |accessdate=11 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821144821/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid%3D14690.html |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FIFA Fair Play Trophy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FIFA World Cup]] --&gt;
The ''FIFA Fair Play Trophy'' is given to the team with the best record of [[Sportsmanship|fair play]] during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/fwc06_regulations_en_1558.pdf|format=PDF|title=XXI.

The appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it had been a golden trophy based on [[Sport Billy]], a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/world-cup-2014/world-cup-24-objects.pdf|title=A History of the World Cup in 24 Objects|publisher=De Montfort University, Leicester|author=David Goldblatt and Jean Will|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#82tech|1982 Technical Report]], page 222: "Sport Billy - the FIFA Fair Play Trophy"&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/raawards/ip-401_07a_trophies_31450.pdf|title=FIFA Award Trophies|publisher=FIFA.com|format=PDF|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peru national football team|Peru]] was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] held in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peru.com/futbol/mundial/2010/equipos20100706/106382/Espana-campeon-del-fair-play-en-Sudafrica-2010 |title=España campeón, del fair play, en Sudáfrica 2010 |publisher=Peru.com |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==All-Star Team==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[FIFA World Cup]] --&gt;
The ''All-Star Team'' is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. The ways in which the FIFA All-Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year.  A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.sporting99.com/fifa-world-cup-all-star-team.html |title=FIFA World Cup All-Star Team – Football world Cup All Star Team |publisher=Football.sporting99.com |date= |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630203237/http://football.sporting99.com/fifa-world-cup-all-star-team.html |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad, chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name ''[[MasterCard]] All-Star Team''.&lt;ref name=94team&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/16/sports/world-cup-94-romario-and-baggio-among-first-all-star-cast.html|title=WORLD CUP '94; Romario and Baggio Among First All-Star Cast|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 1998, 2002 and 2006, substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23-player squads. The All-Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally, three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-07-21-3892418419_x.htm|title=FIFA eliminates official World Cup All-Star team - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps are named for [[Charles E. Goad]] who first produced such things for Fire Insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/freefun/geofacts/geo1158.html |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330074911/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/freefun/geofacts/geo1158.html |archivedate=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/maps/fireinsur/insurancemaps.html |title=Fire Insurance and Shopping Centre plans |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Goad was a Civil Engineer who practised in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and [[London]], and elsewhere. His major business was the creation of detailed street maps for the inner areas of industrial cities, often as a client of insurance companies. He also produced other larger-area maps e.g. for [[Ontario]].

whose mission was to provide online "free access to information that assists grant seekers in locating funding for their projects." &lt;ref&gt;Grantsmart.org "Adios" statement [http://web.mac.com/john_downing/Site/Grantsmart_Adios.html] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a searchable [[database]] it also offered research tools and an on-line [[discussion forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/john_downing/Site/Grantsmart_Adios.html] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The organisation is unrelated to the grant fundraising and management consultancy, grantsmart.co.uk [http://www.grantsmart.co.uk]

== History ==

Beginning in 2000 the [[IRS]] required all United States charitable [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]] to file the 990-PF form, which details information for each foundation, including the total value of all [[assets]], the investments held by the foundation, as well as complete listings of gifts, contributions and grants paid to nonprofits during the tax year, and grants that have been approved for future payment. Fundraisers and nonprofit researchers also use 990-PF tax returns to research which individuals or corporations are supporting the foundation, and information about the foundation's officers, [[Board of directors|directors]], [[trustees]], managers and contractors, their compensation, and [[grant application]] criteria, deadlines and geographical relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[Internal Revenue Service]] Official Website [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f990pf.pdf] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By accessing and utilizing the 990-PFs, Grantsmart made information available on all foundations, including ones lacking [[annual reports]] or [[websites]]. The Grantsmart model enabled persons and organizations seeking foundation funding to bypass print directories and use a simple, comprehensive, searchable free database.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Green, "Finding Local Funding: A Guide to State Foundation Directories,"  The Grantsmanship Center, 2001.
[http://www.tgci.com/magazine/Finding%20Local%20Funding.pdf] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ending the project ==

In early 2008 the organization's founders decided to end the project, issuing a statement online:{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}
 
{{quote|After eight years of providing a free, on line, comprehensive data base of tax returns from non-profit organizations we have decided to end the project. Our mission has been to provide free access to information that assists grant seekers in locating funding for their projects.  By providing this information for free we encouraged others to do the same.  We are pleased that others in the non profit and government agency sectors are now offering much the same information on the same terms. Our work is done and it's time to do the next big thing.}}

== Equipment donations ==

Grantsmart announced its intention to donate the organization's hardware, which included two [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Xserves with dual [[G4 processor]]s, mirrored system [[disk drive|drive]]s and [[SCSI]] boards, one Apple Xserve with dual [[G5 Processor|G5 processors]] and a fibre channel board; two Nexsan ATAboy [[RAID array]]s (14 ata drives) with dual power supplies and dual SCSI connections with 4 to 6 TB each. In addition they offered a single Nexsan SATAboy RAID array (14 drives) with 9 TB and a fibre channel connection. They invited applicants with a message, "If you have a great project underway that can use some or all of this hardware please drop us an [[email]] detailing your project, why it's important and how you can use this hardware."

In addition they offered to make their database and technology, archived in a [[MySQL]] database ([[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]], multi-user [[structured query language]] [[database management system]]) available to any organization that would continue its mission of making the information searchable for free.&lt;ref&gt;Grantsmart.org [http://web.mac.com/john_downing/Site/Grantsmart_Adios.html] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NOZA, Inc.]] was chosen and in March 2008 combined Grantsmart's 990-PF database with its own searchable database of donors and nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nozasearch.com/pdfs/Noza_990_Database_beta_PressRelease80_FINAL.pdf NOZAsearch.com Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Grantsmart donated its Xserve and two NexSan ATAboy RAID arrays (totaling 9 Terabytes) to the [[SETI]] project at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], and announced that in January 2008 all remaining hardware and equipment and the [[domain name]] would be auctioned on [[Ebay]]. [[NOZA]], a searchable database dedicated to nonprofits' use,  acquired the database and the domain, which now [[URL redirection|redirect]]s to its Official website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noza990pf.com] Accessed April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hare-Breadth Hurry''''' is a 1963 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon starring [[Bugs Bunny]] in his fifth and final pairing with [[Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]]. Unlike the previous four pairings, this cartoon follows the Wile E. [[Coyote]] and The Road Runner formula (substituting Bugs for the [[Greater roadrunner|Road Runner]]). As such, Wile E. Coyote is silent, although Bugs does speak to the audience. ''Hare-Breadth Hurry'' is also one of the few cartoons where Bugs does not eat a carrot.

==Plot==
{{tone|section|date=November 2013}}
''Introduction:'' The cartoon opens as a typical Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner cartoon. After the credits are shown, a high-speed object zooms through the desert until it stops. It is revealed to be [[Bugs Bunny]], who explains why he is in the cartoon instead of the Road Runner - the Road Runner had sprained a [[giblets|giblet]]. As the coyote approaches, Bugs stops and, with the help of "[[Acme Corporation|Acme]] Super Speed Pills", is able to imitate the Road Runner. When the pills wear off and Bugs is forced to use wits to outwit the Coyote, he stops again, and holds up his hand as if to say "HOLD IT". Bugs then draws a line in the road, and then a second. As Wile steps in beyond the first line, the bottom falls out from under that segment into an [[underground river]], and Bugs runs off.

1. Wile E. Coyote then tries to capture Bugs using a carrot, but ends up catching a giant fish out of nowhere, who swallows all of Wile E. except for his feet. Wile E. then walks away, still held onto by the fish.

2. Later, Bugs looks on in disbelief ("It's amazing the trouble this joker goes through to get a square meal.") as Wile E's attempts to use a rifle to cut a rope holding a rock over a catapult to propel himself over a large gap backfires, sending Wile straight into the rock, with the rifle, having fallen out of Wile's hands, coming back to hit him to shoot Wile straight up vertically.

3. Bugs is running again. ("It's only sporty to give him a running shot at me once...in a while.") Wile E. attempts to shoot Bugs as he passes by. Unknown to Wile E., Bugs had hastily attached a [[maze]] of pipes to the rifle. When the firing sound is muted and Bugs runs around the mountain, Wile E. Coyote checks out the maze, only for the bullet he fired to exit when he finishes and hit him.

4. Wile E. Coyote then tries to stop Bugs by placing a carrot on a trap (similar to where [[bird food|bird seed]] would be planted for the Road Runner). Wile E. then drops the anvil upon sight of Bugs, but Bugs then places the target on him. Upon hitting Wile E., the edge of the cliff on which Wile E. was standing dislodges and falls to the ground below, and then the anvil is dropped as the target is pulled. The anvil misses Wile E. Coyote, but he is then run over by a passing truck.

5. Bugs is running yet again. ("Here we go again. He doesn't give up easy, does he?".) Wile E. Coyote then tries to be a [[human cannonball|"Coyote cannonball"]] to speed past Bugs, only to then point the cannon downward via his weight, and launch himself into the ground, forming a crater. After escaping the crater, Wile E. Coyote hits his ear to push rocks out of the other ear.

6. Finally, as Bugs times Wile E.'s arrival to him again, he remarks to the viewers: ("Yep. Here comes the 5-15 now. Right on time.") Then Bugs runs off and he is able to place a large patch of glue in the road. Wile E., unable to stop in time, ends up stuck in the puddle and tries to reach a ringing phone some distance away. Bugs answers the phone, which he hands off to Wile E. Coyote, who ends up springing back (phone in hand) the other way, taking the chunk of glued road out of its bed with him, going through a door near a cliff, (Bugs having sped forward to open it) causing Bugs to say "Pardon me, but look behind you" through the telephone, and ending up crashing into the side of another cliff behind him. Bugs then says "Did you realise he almost hit this door?" The chunk of road, having crushed Wile E. against the cliff, breaks, causing him to fall halfway down. Only the telephone cord prevents him from falling all the way to the ground, but Bugs rings up Wile E. and (mimicking the phone company) remarks "You haven't paid your telephone bill lately, so we're going to have to cut you off. Sorry." Bugs severs the cord and Wile E. becomes a victim to gravity as usual. Bugs then tells the audience "The moral is, never get cut off in the middle of a long-distance fall" and he laughs.

'''Investopedia''' is a [[website]] based in New York City that focuses on [[investing]] and finance education and analysis.

==History==
Investopedia was founded by Cory Wagner and Cory Janssen in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]] at the height of the dot-com era in 1999. Wagner focused on business development and R&amp;D, and Janssen focused on marketing and sales. Investopedia drew about 2,500,000 monthly users and provided a popular financial dictionary with over 5,300 terms drawn from personal finance, banking and accounting. It also provided thousands of in-depth articles by financial experts and a Stock Simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes Media Acquires Investopedia.com|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070411005965/en/Forbes-Media-Acquires-Investopedia.com|accessdate=11 April 2007|work=www.businesswire.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Forbes Media]] acquired Investopedia.com for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicole|first1=Kristen|title=Investopedia Acquired by Forbes|url=http://mashable.com/2007/04/12/investopedia/#1EvWzzOsqaqc|accessdate=12 April 2007|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Forbes sold Investopedia to ValueClick Inc. for $42 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wauters|first1=Robin|title=Forbes Sells Investopedia To ValueClick In $42 Million Deal|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/forbes-sells-investopedia-to-valueclick-in-42-million-deal/|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, IAC/InterActive Corp acquired Investopedia.com as part of a group of internet properties from ValueClick Inc for $80 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barinka|first1=Alex|title=IAC Gets a Bargain in Buying ValueClick Websites|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-10/iac-gets-a-bargain-in-buying-valueclick-websites|work=Bloomberg.com|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, IAC has backed Investopedia’s growth and supported its investment into video, timely news production, personal finance tools, and investing education to where Investopedia now delivers more than 28 million monthly unique visitors and nearly 100 million monthly page views.

In 2015, [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] [[David Siegel (executive)|David Siegel]] joined Investopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Ha, Anthony, [https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/david-siegel-joins-investopedia/ "IAC Hires David Siegel As CEO Of Finance Website Investopedia"], ''[[techcrunch.com]]'', March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Dan, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dansimon/2016/02/29/success-by-the-numbers-qa-with-investopedia-ceo-david-siegel/2/#15d69e05262f "Success By The Numbers: An Interview With Investopedia CEO David Siegel"], ''[[Forbes]]'', February 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Investopedia launched Investopedia Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academy.investopedia.com|title=Investopedia Academy|website=Investopedia Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sell premium video educational courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Investopedia Academy Launches to Empower Consumers with Financial Skills|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/investopedia-academy-launches-to-empower-consumers-with-financial-skills-300521981.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James L. Halperin''' (born October 31, 1952, in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is an American author and businessman. In 1985 Halperin authored a text on grading coins, ''How to Grade U.S. Coins'', upon which the grading standards of the two leading third-party grading services [[Professional Coin Grading Service|PCGS]] and [[Numismatic Guaranty Corporation|NGC]] were ultimately based. He is also author of two popular futurism fiction books, ''[[The Truth Machine]]'' (1996) and ''[[The First Immortal]]'' (1997), both best-sellers that were each cited in ''PC Magazine''{{'}}s 20th Anniversary Survey in 2001 as one of the 17 top science/technology fiction books of the previous 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,57455,00.asp PC Magazine Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The Truth Machine is currently under development as a motion picture by Morgan Freeman's Revelations Entertainment.

==Biography==
Halperin graduated from [[Middlesex School]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]] in 1970, then attended [[Harvard University]] between 1970-1971 where he majored in psychology and later philosophy.  After three semesters, Halperin dropped out to pursue a career in [[numismatics]]. In 1976 he established a rare coin fund for investors, New England Rare Coin Fund (NERCF). Upon liquidation at auction in April 1980, each investor in NERCF received 460% of their initial investment after commissions and fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcgs.com/articles/article_view.chtml?artid=1496&amp;type=1&amp;universeid=313 PCGS.com article by Halperin discussing NERCF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he sold his coin company to a former employee, entered into a 50/50 business partnership with renowned numismatist-turned-businessman Steve Ivy and settled in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Halperin and Ivy still co-direct [[Heritage Auctions]], of Dallas, Texas, which advertises itself as the world's largest rare [[coin]] company and third largest [[auction]] house (2012 sales of about $860 million).

A profile on Halperin appeared in ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Helman, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/1227/156_print.html Top Drawer]&lt;/ref&gt; to which Halperin posted an annotated (clarified and/or corrected in footnotes) version on Heritage's website.&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, Jim [http://www.ha.com/forbes What Forbes Didn't Tell You]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Halperin also endows The James &amp; Gayle Halperin Foundation, which supports health and education-related charities.

He has been married to his wife Gayle since 1984 and they have two sons, David (born 1990) and Michael (born 1995).

His niece is [[Molly DeWolf Swenson]], [[American Idol]] Season 10 contestant and co-founder of [[RYOT]] (sold to [[HuffPost|Huffington Post]] / [[AOL]] in 2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">The [[BBC]]'s '''Lonclass''' ("London Classification") is a subject classification system used internally at the BBC throughout its [[BBC Archives|archives]].&lt;ref name="vardan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vardan|first=Vijaylakshmi|title=Book Review : A Handbook for Media Librarians|journal=Library Management|year=2008|volume=29|issue=8/9|pages=814–819|issn=0143-5124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonclass is derived from the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), itself a reworking of the earlier [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC). Lonclass dates from the 1960s,&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt; whereas UDC was created from DDC in the late 19th century. The BBC adaptation of UDC preserves the core features that distinguish UDC from DDC: an emphasis on a compositional semantics that allows new items to be expressed in terms of relationships between known items.

Lonclass and UDC (like DDC) are expressed using codes based on decimal numbers. Unlike DDC, the Lonclass and UDC codes use additional punctuation to express patterns of relationships and re-usable qualifiers. While Lonclass makes a few structural adjustments to the UDC system to support its emphasis on TV and radio content, its main distinction is in the actual set of topics that are recorded within its authority file and within specific BBC catalogue records. Unlike UDC and DDC, which are widely used across the library community, Lonclass has remained a BBC-internal system since its creation in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt;
There are 300,000 subject terms in the Lonclass vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, M.; V. Tablan, H. Cunningham, C. Ursu, and
B. Popov. (2005). "Semantically Enhanced Television News through Web and Video Integration." In ''Second European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC’2005)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

For example, a Lonclass or UDC code may represent “Report on the environmental impact of the decline of tin mining in Sweden in the 20th century“. This would be represented as a sequence of numbers and punctuation. The complex code can be broken down into primitives such as "Sweden" or "tin mining" (which itself could be broken down to "Tin" and "Mining").

Some specific BBC Lonclass examples (with explanatory labels):

* R672:32.007(47)YELTSIN:342.518.1THATCHER “TWO SHOTS OF MARGARET THATCHER AND BORIS YELTSIN”
* [BRITISH AEROSPACE].007.11PEARCE: 656.881:342.518.1THATCHER “LETTER TO MRS THATCHER FROM SIR AUSTIN PEARCE”

'''[[McDonald's]]''' has been involved in a number of [[lawsuits]] and other legal cases in the course of the [[fast food]] [[restaurant chain|chain's]] 70-year history. Many of these have involved [[trademark]] issues, but McDonald's has also launched a [[defamation]] suit which has been described as "the biggest corporate PR disaster in history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/business/worldbusiness/16libel.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1213535788-h1eAOePwEpR4A7Eerx/1DA|title=The infamous McLibel case | work=The New York Times | first=Heather | last=Timmons | date=2005-02-16 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/15/food.foodanddrink|title=McLibel | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Oliver | date=2005-02-15 | accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership suits==
===McDonald's India – Vikram Bakshi partnership case===
On 30 August 2013, McDonald's published a public notice in select newspapers, declaring that McDonald's India partner Vikram Bakshi had ceased to be the managing director of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) pursuant to the expiration of his term on July 17, 2013. CPRL, a joint venture between McDonald's and Vikram Bakshi, is responsible for managing the over 150 McDonald's outlets in North and East regions of India. 
Bakshi had been the face of the company in India for almost two decades. After being ousted abruptly, Bakshi sought to fight for his stake and rights in the Company Law Board (CLB).

=== El Salvador ===
In 1996, McDonald’s revoked businessman Roberto Bukele's franchise for his restaurants in El Salvador. McDonald’s told Bukele the franchise he had operated for 24 years had expired and wouldn’t be renewed. Bukele, who had a 1994 agreement that he believed extended the franchise to 2014, refused to close or rebrand his restaurants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/restaurants/article166592847.html|title=Why you can’t (legally) buy a Big Mac in El Salvador|work=miamiherald|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald’s won in the lower courts, but appellate courts sided with Bukele and eventually in 2012 McDonald's was ordered to pay a $23.9 million judgment to Bukele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/elsalvador-mcdonalds/el-salvador-court-threatens-mcdonalds-with-brand-blackout-idUSL2E8JH0E020120817|title=El Salvador court threatens McDonald's with brand blackout|date=August 17, 2012|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McLibel (UK)===
{{main|McLibel Case}}
In 1990, McDonald's took environmental campaigners Helen Steel and Dave Morris to court after they distributed leaflets entitled "What's Wrong with McDonald's?" on the streets of London. The high-profile trial, which came to be known as the McLibel Case, lasted seven and a half years, the longest in English legal history.

[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-McDonald’s leafletting campaign in front of the McDonald’s restaurant in Leicester Square, London, during the European Social Forum season, 2004-10-16.]]

Though a High Court judge eventually ruled in favour of McDonald's on some counts, John Vidal called it a [[Pyrrhic victory]]. The extended legal battle was a PR disaster, with every aspect of the company's working practices being scrutinised and the media presenting the case as a [[David and Goliath]] battle. Additionally, the damages received were negligible compared to the company's estimated £10 million legal costs because the court ruled in favour of a number of the defendants' claims, including that McDonald's exploited children in its advertising, was anti-trade union and indirectly exploited and caused suffering to animals. McDonald's was awarded £60,000 damages, which was later reduced to £40,000 by the Court of Appeal. Steel and Morris announced they had no intention of ever paying, and the company later confirmed it would not be pursuing the money. Steel and Morris went on to challenge UK libel laws in the [[European Court of Human Rights]], claiming that the lack of access to [[legal aid]] and the heavy [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that lay with them, as the defendants' requirement to prove their claims under UK law was a breach of the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of expression]]. The court ruled in their favour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=717965&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 |title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights |website=Cmiskp.echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK Government was forced to introduce [[legislation]] to change [[defamation]] laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Intellectual property==
===MacJoy (Philippines)===
In 2004, McDonald's sued Cebu-based fast food restaurant MacJoy for using a very similar trade name. In its defense, MacJoy insisted that it was the first user of the mark under the title "MACJOY &amp; DEVICE" for its business in [[Cebu City]] which started in 1987, six years after McDonald's opened its first outlet in the same city. MacJoy stated that the requirement of “actual use” in commerce in the Philippines before one may register a trademark pertains to the territorial jurisdiction on a national scale and is not merely confined to a certain locality or region. It added that "MacJoy" is a term of endearment for the owner's niece whose name is Scarlett Yu Carcel. In response, McDonald's claimed that there was no connection with the name Scarlett Yu Carcel to merit the coinage of the word "MacJoy" and that the only logical conclusion over the name is to help the Cebu restaurant ride high on their (McDonald's) established reputation.

On February 2007, the [[Philippine Supreme Court]] upheld the right of McDonald's over its registered and internationally recognized trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/philippine-supreme-court-upholds-mcdonalds/story.aspx?guid=%7B9F6919C5-CCF2-455A-B8A1-BCF4E9E9C4E4%7D Philippine Supreme Court upholds McDonald's trademark rights]. [[MarketWatch]]. February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the owners of MacJoy, the Espina family, was forced to change its trademark into MyJoy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/07/30/life/myjoy.smiling.through.it.all.html |title=MyJoy: Smiling through it all |publisher=[[Sun.Star Cebu]]. |date=July 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012105944/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/07/30/life/myjoy.smiling.through.it.all.html |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which went into effect with the re-opening of its two branches in Cebu City on August that year.

===McCoffee (US)===
In 1994, McDonald's successfully forced Elizabeth McCaughey of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to change the trading name of her coffee shop ''McCoffee'', which had operated under that name for 17 years. "This is the moment I surrendered the little 'c' to corporate America," said Elizabeth McCaughey, who had named it as an adaptation of her surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/littlepeople.html |title=Big Mac Versus the Little People |website=Mcspotlight.org |date=1995-04-15 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norman McDonald's Country Drive-Inn (US)===
From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, Norman McDonald ran a small "Country Drive-Inn" restaurant in [[Philpot, Kentucky]] called simply "McDonald's Hamburgers; Country Drive-Inn", which at the time also had a gas station and [[convenience store]]. McDonald's the restaurant chain forced Norman to remove the arches and add the full ''Norman'' McDonald's name to its sign so customers would not be confused into thinking the restaurant was affiliated with the McDonald's restaurant chain. The restaurant is still open to this day (though it no longer has the gas station).

===McChina Wok Away (UK)===
In 2001, McDonald’s lost a nine-year legal action against Frank Yuen, owner of ''McChina Wok Away'', a small chain of Chinese takeaway outlets in London. [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Justice David Neuberger]] ruled the McChina name would not cause any confusion among customers and that McDonald's had no right to the prefix Mc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_50_35/ai_80748716|title=McChina UK vs McDonald's USA | work=Nation's Restaurant News | first=Elissa | last=Elan | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McMunchies (UK)===
In 1996, McDonald's forced Scottish sandwich shop owner Mary Blair of [[Fenny Stratford]], [[Buckinghamshire]] to drop McMunchies as her trading name. Mrs. Blair did not sell [[hamburger|burgers]] or [[French fries|chips]]. She said she chose the name because she liked the word munchies and wanted the cafe to have a Scottish feel. The cafe's sign reflected this, featuring a Scottish thistle and a St Andrew's flag. But in a statement to Mrs. Blair's solicitors, McDonald's said if someone used the Mc prefix, even unintentionally, they were using something that does not belong to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/times_24sep96.html |title=Press Articles - Corner shop faces McDonald's writ |website=Mcspotlight.org |date=1996-09-24 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MacDonald's (UK - Cayman Islands) ===
An often reported [[urban legend]] maintains that McDonald's filed a lawsuit against MacDonald's Family Restaurant, an actual fast food establishment located in Grand Cayman.  This false claim alleges that McDonald's lost the case, and in addition, was banned from ever opening a McDonald's location on Grand Cayman. While it is true that no McDonald’s locations exist on the island, the reason is not due to any lawsuit against MacDonald’s Family Restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2017/08/14/new-rights-and-responsibilities-in-trademarks-law/|title=New rights and responsibilities in trademarks law {{!}} Cayman Compass|website=www.caymancompass.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McAllan (Denmark)===
In 1996, McDonald's lost a legal battle at the [[Danish Supreme Court]] to force Allan Pedersen, a hotdog vendor, to drop his shop name ''McAllan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/cni-copyright/msg09452.html |title=FindLaw for Legal Professionals &amp;#124; Law &amp; Legal Information |website=Legalminds.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedersen had previously visited Scotland on [[whisky tasting]] tours. He named his business after his favorite brand of whisky, MacAllan's, after contacting the distillery to see if they would object. They did not, but McDonald's did. However, the court ruled customers could tell the difference between a one-man vendor and a multi-national chain and ordered McDonald's to pay 40,000 kroner ($6,900) in court costs. The verdict cannot be appealed.

===McCurry (Malaysia)===
In 2001, McDonald's sued a small restaurant named ''McCurry'', a popular eatery serving Indian food in [[Jalan Ipoh]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. McDonald's claimed that the use of the "Mc" prefix infringed its trademark, while the defendant claimed that McCurry stood for ''Malaysian Chicken Curry''. 

In 2006, McDonald's won an initial judgment in the [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court]]. The judge ruled that the prefix Mc and the use of colours distinctive of the McDonald's brand could confuse and deceive customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,20374788-462,00.html?from=rss |title='McCurry' to pay damages over name |publisher=[[News Limited#Websites|News.com.au]] |date=September 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109194128/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C%2C20374788-462%2C00.html?from=rss |archivedate=November 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, however, a three-member [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Appeal Court]] panel overturned the verdict, saying that there was no evidence to show that McCurry was passing off its own product as that of McDonald's. The Appeals Court also said that McDonald's cannot claim an exclusive right to the "Mc" prefix in the country. McDonald's appealed the decision to the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], the highest court in Malaysia. In September 2009, the Federal Court upheld the Appeal Court's decision. McDonald's appeal was dismissed with costs, and was ordered to pay RM10,000 to McCurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/4/29/nation/20090429182848&amp;sec=nation |title=McDonald's loses court battle against McCurry |work=thestar.com.my |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502185212/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F4%2F29%2Fnation%2F20090429182848&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=2009-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/retail/153702/malaysia-mccurry-beats-mcdonald-over-trademark|title=Malaysia McCurry beats McDonald over trademark|publisher=''[[Bangkok Post]]''|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African trademark law===
[[Apartheid]] politics had prevented earlier expansion into South Africa, but as the apartheid regime came to an end in the early 1990s, McDonald's decided to expand there. The company had already recognized South Africa as a potentially significant market and had registered its name as a trademark there in 1968.

Under South African law, trademarks cease to be the property of a company if they are not used for a certain amount of time. McDonald's had renewed the 1968 registration several times, but missed a renewal deadline. The registration expired and McDonald’s discovered two fast food restaurants in South Africa were trading under the name MacDonalds. Moreover, a businessman had applied to register the McDonald’s name.

Multiple lawsuits were filed. The fast food chain was stunned when the court ruled it had lost the rights to its world-famous name in South Africa. However, the company eventually won on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gblaw.com/news.asp?newsID%3D19 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716214554/http://www.gblaw.com/news.asp?newsID=19 |archivedate=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The real Ronald McDonald (US)===
The company waged an unsuccessful 32-year legal action against McDonald's Family Restaurant which was opened by a man legally named Ronald McDonald, (not to be confused with [[Ronald McDonald|the restaurants clown mascot]]) in [[Fairbury, Illinois]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sentienttimes.com/01/feb_march/bookreviewbysuzi.html |title=Home - Psychic Sentient Times |accessdate=September 19, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910052417/http://www.sentienttimes.com/01/feb_march/bookreviewbysuzi.html |archivedate=September 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. McDonald ultimately continued to use his name on his restaurant, despite objections by McDonald's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960816&amp;slug=2344437|title=Seattle Times reports on outcome of lawsuit | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=August 16, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The McBrat case (Australia){{anchor|McBrat}}===
In 2005, McDonald’s tried to stop a Queensland lawyer, Malcolm McBratney, from using the name 'McBrat' on the shorts of the [[Brisbane Irish Rugby Football Club|Brisbane Irish Rugby]] team.  McDonald's claimed the McBrat name should not be registered because it was too similar to its McKids trade mark, since the word 'brat' is another term for 'kid'. McBratney, a solicitor specialising in trademarks and intellectual property, argued that his family name had been used in Ireland since the 1600s, and that he had a right to use an abbreviation of that name. In 2006, the Delegate of the Register of Trade Marks held that McBratney could register 'McBrat' as a trademark and that McDonald's had no intellectual property rights over 'Mc' and 'Mac' prefixed words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallesons.com/publications/marketAlerts/2006/Documents/8608435w.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005001836/http://www.mallesons.com/publications/marketAlerts/2006/Documents/8608435w.htm |archivedate=October 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McBratney, who specialises in intellectual property law, then brought a suit against McDonald's for its registration, in Australia in 1987, of 'McKids'.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This trademark had never been used in Australia and can therefore be removed for non-use.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Cases brought against McDonald's===
====''H.R. Pufnstuf'' / McDonaldland====
In 1973, [[Sid and Marty Krofft]], the creators of ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', successfully sued McDonald's in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'', arguing that the entire [[McDonaldland]] premise was essentially a [[ripoff]] of their television show. In specific, the Kroffts claimed that the character Mayor McCheese was a direct copy of their character, "H.R. Pufnstuf" (being a mayor himself). McDonald's initially was ordered to pay $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/562/1157/293262/

McDonaldland itself, as it was depicted in the commercials, was a magical place where plants, foods, and inanimate objects were living, speaking characters. In addition to being the home to Ronald and the other core characters, McDonaldland boasted "Thick shake volcanoes", [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] "Apple pie trees", "The Hamburger Patch" (where McDonald's [[hamburger]]s grew out of the ground like plants), "[[Filet-O-Fish]] Lake", and many other fanciful features based around various McDonald's menu items. In the commercials, the various beings are played by puppets or costumed performers, very similar to the popular ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'' program.

McDonald's had originally hoped the Kroffts would agree to license its characters for commercial promotions. When they declined, McDonaldland was created, purposely based on the ''H.R. Pufnstuf'' show in an attempt to duplicate the appeal.

After the lawsuit, the concept of the "magical place" was all but phased out of the commercials, as were many of the original characters. Those that remained would be Ronald, Grimace, The Hamburglar, and the Fry Kids.

====McSleep (Quality Inns International)====
{{Wikisource|Quality Inns Intl., Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.|''Quality Inns Intl., Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.''}}
In 1988, Quality Inns (now [[Choice Hotels]]) was planning to open a new chain of economy hotels under the name "McSleep." After McDonald's demanded that Quality Inns not use the name because it infringed, the hotel company filed a suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that "McSleep" did not infringe. McDonald's counterclaimed, alleging [[trademark]] infringement and [[unfair competition]]. Eventually, McDonald's prevailed. The court's opinion noted that the prefix "Mc" added to a generic word has acquired secondary meaning, so that in the eyes of the public it means McDonald's, and therefore the name "McSleep" would infringe on McDonald's trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Quality Inns Int'l v.

====Viz top tips (UK)====
In 1996, British adult comic ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' accused McDonald's of plagiarizing the name and format of its longstanding ''Top Tips'' feature, in which readers offer sarcastic tips. McDonald's had created an advertising campaign of the same name, which showcased the Top Tips (and then suggested the money-saving alternative - going to McDonald's). Some of the similarities were almost word-for-word:

:"Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to [[Oxfam]]. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p." – Viz Top Tip, published May 1989.

:"Save a fortune on laundry bills. Give your dirty shirts to a second-hand shop. They will wash and iron them, and then you can buy them back for 50p." – McDonald's advert, 1996

The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which was donated to the charity appeal [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. However, many Viz readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use, leading to Top Tips submissions such as: "Geordie magazine editors. Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets&amp;nbsp;... by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/ind_12sep96.html |title=Press Articles - 'Viz' Challenges McDonald's Over TV Money Tips |website=Mcspotlight.org |date=1996-09-12 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happy Meals and Toys (Quebec, Canada)===
On November 14, 2018, the Superior Court of Quebec certified a class action on behalf of all consumers worldwide who purchased Happy Meals and Toys in the Province of Quebec ([http://canlii.ca/t/hw37t Bramante v. McDonald Restaurants, 2018 QCCS 4852]). The Plaintiffs alleged - and the Court agreed at certification - that McDonalds violated [http://canlii.ca/t/53ghf#sec248 section 248] of the [[Consumer Protection Act (Quebec)|''Consumer Protection Act'' (Quebec)]] by unlawfully advertising Happy Meals using displays with toys (often related to the newest cinematic release) at children's eye-level inside McDonalds restaurants. [http://canlii.ca/t/53ghf#sec248 Section 248] provides that: "Subject to what is provided in the regulations, no person may make use of commercial advertising directed at persons under thirteen years of age". The Court certified the case on behalf of the following class: "Every consumer pursuant to the Québec ''Consumer Protection Act'' who, since November 15, 2013 purchased in Québec for a child under 13 years of age then present inside a McDonald’s restaurant, a toy or Happy Meal, during an advertising campaign directed at children taking place inside the restaurant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Bramante c.

In 2003, a ruling by the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] determined that the corporation had acted in breach of the codes of practice in describing how its French fries were prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/focus/case_studies/McDonalds.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018100756/http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/focus/case_studies/McDonalds.htm |archivedate=October 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A McDonald's print ad stated that "after selecting certain potatoes", "we peel them, slice them, fry them and that's it." It showed a picture of a potato in a McDonald's fries box. In fact, the product was sliced, pre-fried, sometimes had dextrose added, was then frozen, shipped, and re-fried and then had salt added.

=== Beef content in fries ===
Lawsuits were brought against the McDonald's Corporation in the early 1990s for including beef in its French fries despite claims that the fries were vegetarian.  In fact, beef flavoring ''is'' added to the fries during the production phase.&lt;ref&gt;(Block vs. McDonald's Corp., Sharma vs. McDonald's Corp., Bansal v. McDonald's Corp., Zimmerman v. McDonald's Corp.)

Subsequent oversight by the courts was required to ensure that the money that was paid by McDonald's: "to use the funds for programs serving the interests of people following vegetarian dietary practices in the broadest sense." There was some controversy in this ruling, as it benefited non-vegetarian groups such as research institutions that research vegetarian diets but do not benefit vegetarians. In 2005, the appeal filed by vegetarians against the list of recipients in this case was denied, and the recipients of the $10M chosen by McDonald's was upheld.

Further ingredient-related lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's since 2006. McDonald's had included its French fries on its website in a list of [[gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] products; these lawsuits claim children suffered severe intestinal damage as a result of unpublicized changes to McDonald's French fry recipe. McDonald's has provided a more complete ingredient list for its French fries more recently. Over 20 lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's regarding this issue, which the McDonald's Corporation has attempted to consolidate.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==="McMatch and Win Monopoly" promotion (Australia)===

{{main|Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants}}Also known as the "McDonald's coffee case", ''Liebeck v. McDonald's'' is a well-known [[product liability]] [[lawsuit]] that became a flash point in the debate in the U.S. over [[Tort reform in the United States|tort reform]] after a jury awarded $2.9 million to Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who sued McDonald's after she suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee that was spilled on her at one of the company's drive-thrus in 1992.&lt;ref name="case cite"&gt;Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants, P.T.S., Inc., No. D-202 CV-93-02419, 1995 WL 360309 (Bernalillo County, N.M. Dist. Ct.

In addition, McDonald's failed to provide proper warning. Warning consumers of possible dangers of their products is strictly enforced by the FDA. Furthermore, McDonald's should not be serving substances that are potentially harmful to their consumers.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerlin. See also Ralph Nader &amp; Wesley J.

=== China ===
In July 2014, a reporter was able to secretly capture film from inside the Shanghai Husi Food factory (a subsidiary of the American OSI group) which showed factory workers violating various safety policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/09/11/mcdonalds-faces-declining-sales-in-asia-after-china-food-scandal/#188cfd9b6de1|title=McDonald's Faces Declining Sales In Asia After China Food Scandal|last=Team|first=Trefis|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included: handling meat with bare hands, picking meat up off the floor and returning it to the processing machine, processing expired meats, and repeatedly reprocessing products that failed inspection until the said products passed inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/29/world/asia/explainer-china-meat-scandal/index.html|title=China's tainted meat scandal explained - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Zoe Li,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the video surfaced, Yum Brands (operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China) discontinued its operations with Husi Foods (and thus OSI Group). However, McDonalds merely switched factories, preferring to continue their association with OSI Group as they believe the quality of meat is higher and this was an isolated incident. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/09/11/mcdonalds-faces-declining-sales-in-asia-after-china-food-scandal/#188cfd9b6de1|title=McDonald's Faces Declining Sales In Asia After China Food Scandal|last=Team|first=Trefis|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination ==
''Magee v. McDonald's'' is a United States federal [[class action|class action lawsuit]] begun in May 2016 in the Illinois Northern District Court, case number 1:16-cv-05652, in which Scott McGee of [[Metairie, Louisiana]] is pursuing action against [[McDonald's]] due to the company being unwilling to serve people who are [[visually impaired]] when only the [[drive thru]] lane is open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/06/01/blind-man-sues-mcdonalds-service-drive-thru-window/85240334/|title=Blind man sues McDonald's for refusing drive-thru service|website=Usatoday.com|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the drive thru lane is sometimes the only method of ordering food once the [[dining room]] is closed, this creates a situation in which people who are [[legally blind]], and unable to operate a [[motor vehicle]] can not order food from the [[restaurant]] while other people are able to do so.

McDonald’s attempted to get the case dismissed, but in February 2017, a federal court ruled that Magee's lawsuit could proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blind People Are Refused Service At The Company’s Drive-Throughs |author=David Dee |date=December 5, 2017 |url=http://listverse.com/2017/12/05/10-outrageous-mcdonalds-scandals/ |accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 8, 2018, the class was certified.&lt;ref name="case5652"&gt;{{cite web |title=Magee v. McDonald's Corporation Federal Civil Lawsuit Illinois Northern District Court, Case No. 1:16-cv-05652 District Judge Joan B. Gottschall, presiding docket://gov.uscourts.ilnd.1-16-cv-05652 |url=https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/2zzrlvoop/illinois-northern-district-court/magee-v-mcdonalds-corporation/ |accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2018, the case continues to drag on, with McDonald’s bringing up new defences.  In August 2018, McDonald’s argued that the restaurant was operated by a franchisee, and that the McDonald’s corporation did not control the locking of doors.  In October 2018, McDonald’s argued that the restaurant was assessable, because a blind person could obtain food "through the same [[UberEats]] delivery service that everyone else uses," even though it would cost $5.00 extra.&lt;ref name="case5652"/&gt;  

On October 31, 2018, McDonald’s filed a document with the court, arguing that because the restaurants forbid any pedestrian access to their drive-up window, they are not discriminating against the blind.  McDonald’s says a blind person has "the same access as the 13 million adults who are not visually impaired and do not have a car, and that therefore the ADA does not apply."&lt;ref name="case5652"/&gt;

Meanwhile, on May 24, 2018, a law came into effect in [[Portland Oregon]] requiring multi-modal access to drive-throughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It Is Now a Violation of Portland City Code For Drive-Thru Windows to Refuse to Serve People Who Pedal or Walk to the Window |author=Elise Herron |date=May 30, 2018 |publisher=Willamette Week |url=https://www.wweek.com/news/2018/05/30/it-is-now-a-violation-of-city-code-for-drive-thru-windows-to-refuse-to-serve-people-who-pedal-or-walk-to-the-window/ |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2751">The '''PKP Open Archives Harvester''' is software used to accumulate and index freely available [[metadata]], providing a searchable, web-based interface. It is [[open source]], released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It was created and is maintained by the [[Public Knowledge Project]], in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]].

Originally developed to harvest the metadata from [[Open Journal Systems]] articles and [[Open Conference Systems]] proceedings, the Harvester can by used with any [[OAI-PMH]]-compliant resource.

It can harvest metadata in a variety of schemas (including unqualified [[Dublin Core]], the PKP Dublin Core extension, the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), and [[MARCXML]]). Additional schema are supported via plugins.

The PKP OA Harvester allows any institution to create their own metadata harvester, which can be focused specifically on gathering information from or for their research community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3175">The '''Puppy Monkey Baby''' (also styled '''PuppyMonkeyBaby''') is the name of a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character created by [[Mountain Dew]] for a [[TV commercial]] that aired on February 7, 2016 during [[Super Bowl 50]]. The advertisement has garnered a wide amount of media coverage, both positive and negative. According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the [[Super Bowl commercials]] of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/02/puppymonkeybaby_wins_super_bow.html|title='Puppymonkeybaby' wins Super Bowl 50 commercial race|date=8 February 2016|publisher=Cleveland.com|last1=Smith|first1=Troy|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless, all in one body: a [[Pug]] puppy (the head), a monkey (the torso and tail) and a [[dancing baby]] (the hips and legs, complete with a diaper). The puppy monkey baby repeats its name while dancing with three tired men who are presumably too tired to get out while watching the [[Super Bowl]], offering them [[Mountain Dew Kickstart]], which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine).

==Reception==
The media response to the advertisement has been mixed. Melissa Cronin of [[Gawker]], described it as a "horror-hallucination of brand awareness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cronin|first1=Melissa|title=Mountain Dew Presents the PuppyMonkeyBaby, a Horror-Hallucination of Brand Awareness|url=http://gawker.com/mountain-dew-presents-the-puppymonkeybaby-a-horror-hal-1757701922|accessdate=8 February 2016|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while noting the beverage itself contains [[brominated vegetable oil]], a chemical that is banned in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conley|first1=Mikaela|title=Flame Retardant in Your Mountain Dew? Yep|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2011/12/15/flame-retardant-in-your-mountain-dew-yep/|accessdate=8 February 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn &amp; Wolfe, called it "weird".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puppymonkeybaby, Chip-Craving Fetus Stand Out in Ad Lineup|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2016/02/08/puppymonkeybaby-chip-craving-fetus-stand-out-in-ad-lineup.html|publisher=Fox Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Screwattack]] declared Puppymonkeybaby as the most terrifying mascot of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://screwattack.roosterteeth.com/episode/top-10-season-2-terrifying-mascots&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Recreation Yard''' was the yard used by inmates of [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] between 1934 and 1963. It is located opposite the [[Alcatraz Dining Hall|Dining Hall]] south of the end of D-Block on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it.&lt;ref name="Historic Preservation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historic Preservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4RXnwuKT-MC|accessdate=31 August 2012|year=1995|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EagleAssociation1992"/&gt; Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west of the yard.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbar|first=Richard|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoXM5O9glN8C&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-8029-940-0|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gun gallery was situated in the yard, mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls.&lt;ref name="Champion2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Champion Jr.|first=Jerry Lewis |title=Alcatraz Unchained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQV5wM6qj1oC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=26 April 2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-8753-1|pages=140–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recreation yard faced the mainland.&lt;ref name="Moseley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moseley|first=Andy|title=Around the States in 90 Days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrGH3ZuNggIC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=September 2009|publisher=andy moseley|isbn=978-0-9561551-0-8|pages=268–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1936, the previously dirt-covered yard was paved.&lt;ref name="WardKassebaum2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=David A.|last2=Kassebaum|first2=Gene G.|title=Alcatraz: The Gangster Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV6KXrkQjTsC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=19 May 2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25607-1|pages=47–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The yard was part of the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.&lt;ref name="Watson2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|title=The Escape from Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw-4z4Cmb8MC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 2012|publisher=ABDO|isbn=978-1-61783-303-8|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] in 1970, between 400 and 700 Native Indians assembled in the recreation yard and demonstrated.&lt;ref name="EagleAssociation1992"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Adam |last1=Fortunate Eagle|author2=Golden Gate National Park Association|title=Alcatraz! Alcatraz!: the Indian occupation of 1969-1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbRgon2K0QEC|accessdate=31 August 2012|year=1992|publisher=Heyday Books|isbn=978-0-930588-51-9|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
[[File:The Yard in Alcatraz.jpg|thumb|left]]
Inmates were permitted out into the yard on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Gregory L.|title=A History of Alcatraz Island:: 1853-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1duAUPaHSgcC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=28 May 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-5815-8|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albright2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Jim|title=Last Guard Out: A Riveting Account by the Last Guard to Leave Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmVGYLGkLl4C&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=30 March 2008|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4343-5077-0|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays.&lt;ref name="Albright2008"/&gt; Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends.&lt;ref name="Albright2008"/&gt;

==Social interaction==

[[File:Alcatraz yard2.jpg|thumb|right|Looking through the fence into the yard]]
The prisoners of Alcatraz were permitted to play games such as [[baseball]], [[softball]] and other sports at these times, and intellectual games such as [[chess]].&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; Basketball also appears to have been played on the yard judging by the markings which are still visible on the yard today. Baseball and softball were the most popular. Because of the small size of the yard and the [[baseball field|diamond]] at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it.&lt;ref name="Seymour1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Seymour|first=Harold|title=Baseball: The People's Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJuwTnbkmUMC&amp;pg=PA431|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=30 May 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506907-5|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates were provided [[baseball glove|gloves]], [[baseball bat|bats]], and [[Baseball (ball)|balls]], but no [[baseball uniform|sport uniforms]]. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after [[Minor League Baseball|Minor League]] clubs, and four league teams named after [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/alca/historyculture/baseball-on-the-rock.htm|title=For it's one, two, three strikes, you're (not) out, at the old ball game.'|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bank robber and kidnapper [[Volney Davis]] was a pitching ace for the Oilers, while [[Lorenzo Murrietta]], doing 40 years for assault and robbery, was the best batter in Alcatraz league play. He had a .402 [[batting average]], with 9 [[home run]]s and 45 [[Run batted in|RBIs]] for the Cardinals.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;
Although many of the inmates relished the opportunity to exercise on weekends, violence occasionally occurred, often race related. A notable riot occurred on May 20, 1956 over racial taunts on the diamond between a white and black prisoner during a softball match.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; 
[[File:Alcatraz yard3.jpg|thumb|left|View from the diamond]]
Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for active conversation.&lt;ref name="Jr2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jerry Lewis |last=Champion Jr|title=The Fading Voices of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxH3-mB5rCcC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=27 January 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-1488-8|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machine Gun Kelly]] and [[Basil Banghart|Basil "The Owl" Banghart]] were said to be inseparable in the yard and would spend their whole time walking around it in conversation together.&lt;ref name="Jr2011"/&gt; [[Al Capone]], on the other hand, avoided the yard in his later years in the penitentiary as his mind deteriorated.&lt;ref name="Sloate2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloate|first=Susan|title=Mysteries Unwrapped: The Secrets of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yUpfWv68aYC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 April 2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-3591-2|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin B. Swope]], Warden of Alcatraz from 1948 to 1955, once said, in response to an inmate who complained to him on the yard about his term of 199 years, which was really a life sentence, "My boy, we're all doing life. Every one of us is doing life."&lt;ref name="Jr2011"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Alcatraz recreation yard has been a setting for scenes in numerous films and novels. Scenes have featured prison inmates hatching schemes or being involved in bloody conflicts. The yard featured several times in the 1979 [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' including a violent fight; it was parodied in the 1994 [[Leslie Nielsen]] film, ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]''.

'''''Rubber''''' is a 2010 English-language French [[independent film|independent]], [[Satire|satirical]] [[horror film]] about a [[tire]] that comes to life and kills people with its [[Psychokinesis|psychic powers]]. It was directed and written by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]]. The film was produced by Realitism Films. It was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2010, where it received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
===Intermission===
A group of people in a California desert are gathered to watch a "film". A sheriff named Chad, points out that many moments in cinema happen for "no reason", that life is full of this "no reason", and that "this film" ([[Indexical|presumably a dual reference to both the "film" to be watched by the assembled group and ''Rubber'' itself]]) is an homage to "no reason". Chad is both inside and outside the [[diegesis]], sometimes participating in the narrative action and sometimes commenting on it.

An accountant then passes out binoculars to the group and rides off on a bicycle. The spectators then start looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the "film" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people return in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far.

===Plot===
In the late 1990s, somewhere in a California desert, a tire named Robert suddenly comes to life. At first, he learns how to stand upright and then how to roll. He comes across a plastic water bottle and, after hesitating, crushes it, comes across a scorpion and crushes it, and finally comes across a glass beer bottle but is unable to crush it by rolling over it. Robert discovers he can psychokinetically causes the bottle to fracture. He tests his newfound powers on a tin can and a rabbit, making them explode.

Robert then sees a woman drive by and attempts to use his powers on her. However, he only succeeds in making her car stall. As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs him over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again and she continues on her way. The tire explodes a pied crow, then finds the man that had been driving the truck which ran him over and blows up his head.

Arriving in a nearby desert town, Robert comes across the woman from before. She is staying in a motel and, after watching her shower through an open door, the tire goes into the room next to hers. After the motel maid finds the tire showering and throws it out of the room, Robert reenters the room and blows up her head. Chad, the sheriff from the opening of the movie, shows up to investigate the murders. 

For the in-movie audience, two days have passed and most of them are starving; the accountant wakes them up and presents them with a roast turkey. Shortly thereafter, they begin suffering intense abdominal pain. Back in the story proper, Chad is interrogating the motel owner, only to stop abruptly when an alarm goes off. He announces the poison (from the turkey) has had time to do its work, and tries to urge the other characters to go home, since the audience is dead and the movie can now be over. The accountant then informs Chad that one of the audience, a wheelchair-bound man, had not eaten the poisoned food and so the movie has not ended. 

Embarrassed, Chad must continue the plot and returns to his interrogation. Chad witnesses Robert kill the motel owner (who has mistreated it) and leads the cops on a "tire hunt". Meanwhile, the accountant tries to poison the man in the wheelchair with more food, but eats it himself and dies.

Robert comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires, then the film jumps to three days later showing the results of his killing spree. The cops find the tire watching an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling the woman Robert is interested in) with dynamite, intending for the tire to blow the mannequin's head up, thereby also blowing himself up. However, when Robert destroys the mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. The man in the wheelchair mocks Chad for his failed plan, enraging Chad enough to unceremoniously end the film by simply shooting Robert with a shotgun off-screen, after which he tosses the remains to the man in the wheelchair, who continues to criticize him for the anticlimax. 

Almost immediately Robert emerges from the house reborn as a Tricycle, prompting the man in the wheelchair to protest to Chad that the film isn't over. Failing that, he protests to Robert that he is an audience member and can't be killed, which the Tricycle proves wrong by exploding his head. Robert begins rolling down the road recruiting an army of tires along the way, eventually rolling to Hollywood, where the film concludes.

During the credits, the opening scene plays again, but this time from different angles, revealing that Chad is not speaking to anyone.

==Production==
The effects of the tire moving were done via practical effects such as [[remote controls]].&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harley|first1=David|title=Interview: ‘Rubber’ Director Quentin Dupieux!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/22865/interview-rubber-director-quentin-dupieux/|website=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Quentin Dupieux has noted that due to the inherent "emptiness" of a tire that making a remote-controlled tire was difficult as "you can’t really hide the mechanisms well". [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects were used for the shots of heads exploding; during filming Dupieux used practical effects, but he was unhappy with the results.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;

During the writing process, the tire, Robert, was designed solely as a bad guy with no redeeming qualities.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nemiroff|first1=Perri|title=Interview: Rubber Writer-Director Quentin Dupieux|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Rubber-Writer-Director-Quentin-Dupieux-23286.html|website=Cinemablend|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While shooting, however, Dupieux determined that this was the wrong approach realizing "there’s nothing evil about a tire" based partly on early camera tests. Robert was reworked to be "more like a stupid dog"&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;. The 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]],'' specifically the first act, was also an influence on the character.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;

The film begins with Ballard making a speech about how events in movies often happen for "no reason". Dupieux has stated he was inclined to put that speech in because he was not interested in explaining how the tire came to life, although he knew such a setup would be expected.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; The meta element of the film came organically, as Dupieux quickly grew tired of writing about a killer tire. He was partly influenced by an experience where he snuck into a theater playing his previous film "''Steak''" only to find that no one else was in the theater, which he noted was "kind of scary."&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;

==Release==
The film was shown on May 15, 2010 at Cannes Critic's Week.&lt;ref name="v-review" /&gt;
After the film was shown at Cannes, it was picked up for US distribution by [[Magnolia Pictures|Magnet Releasing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/distribution/magnet-burns-us-deal-for-rubber-with-elle-driver/5014237.article|work=[[Screen Daily]]|title=Magnet burns US deal for Rubber with Elle Driver|author=Mitchell, Wendy|date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rubber'' had its outside-France premiere on July 9, 2010 at the [[Fantasia Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fantasiafestival.com/2010/en/films/film_detail.php?id=308|work=[[Fantasia Festival]]|accessdate=October 17, 2010|author=Laperrière, Simon|title=Rubber: International Premiere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rubber'' was shown at the [[Sitges Film Festival]] where it had a positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118025497.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1|title='Neon,' 'Kidnapped' shine at Sitges|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=October 11, 2010|author1=Hopewell, John |author2=Mayorga, Emilio }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shown in Toronto at the [[Toronto After Dark Film Festival|After Dark Film Festival]]. ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine stated the film "deeply split" the audience reaction saying that ''Rubber'' earned "huge laughs and applause as well as the only boos heard by Fango at the fest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1812:toronto-after-dark-report-rubber&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=167|title=Toronto After Dark Report: "Rubber"|author=Parker, Trevor|date=August 24, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DVD]] and soundtrack were made available to purchase from March 14, 2011, and the DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] from June 7, 2011.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a 68% rating based on reviews from 85 critics, the sites consensus reads "a clever premise gets plenty of comic blood and violence but it's hampered by some questionable storytelling techniques from director Quentin Dupieux.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten tomatoes|id=rubber |title=Rubber}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[indieWire]] called the film "one of the more bizarre experiments with genre in quite some time" and that it "does begin to wear out its welcome around the sixty-minute mark, but you can't blame Dupieux for giving it a shot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/cannes_review_bad_ideas_in_close_up_quentin_dupieuxs_rubber/|title=Cannes Review : Bad Ideas In Close Up: Quentin Dupieux's "Rubber"|author=Kohn, Eric|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010|work=indieWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Cannes, the film received positive reception at other film festivals. [[Twitch Film]] gave the film a positive review saying it was "impeccably shot, scored and designed", and "the film is intellectual wankery&lt;!-- sic, calling it wankery is backhanded praise and actually in the source --&gt; of the highest order in the sheepskin of a B-film of the lowest order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2010/07/fantasia-2010-rubber-review-1.php|title= Fantasia 2010: Rubber Review|last= Halfyard|first= Kurt|date= July 10, 2010|accessdate= October 17, 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729150118/http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2010/07/fantasia-2010-rubber-review-1.php|archivedate= July 29, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote that Quentin Dupieux "succeeds in creating an entertaining, sometimes even tense horror film with the very same footage he lightly mocks. The result is an uber-cerebral spoof that is at once silly and smart, populist like a mildly trashy B-movie yet high brow like absurdist theater."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/farihah-zaman/2010-fantastic-fest-2-goo_b_759654.html|title=2010 Fantastic Fest #2: Good Movies, Stupid Plots| last = Zaman |first= Farihah|date=October 12, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote a negative review of the film, saying "How could it not be brilliant? By, at 85 minutes, being an hour too long. By being arch rather than schlocky. And by wasting too much time on dull dialogue celebrating its 'No Reason' philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/7733542/Cannes-Film-Festival-Quentin-Dupieuxs-Rubber-review.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Sukhdev, Sandhu|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010|title=Cannes Film Festival: Quentin Dupieux's Rubber, review}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also gave a negative review, saying that ''Rubber'' is "Neither scary, funny, nor anywhere near as clever as it seems to think it is, pic offers auds few reasons to want to see it beyond its one-joke premise."&lt;ref name="v-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942777.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Rubber|author=Felperin, Leslie|accessdate=October 17, 2010|date=May 16, 2010|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Will Leitch from ''The Projector'' concluded his review by stating that "Rubber" is "a movie about how watching movies is stupid," giving the film a D score out of a traditional American grading scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/the-projector/review-rubber-205110422.html ''Rubber'' Movie Review] Yahoo!Movies&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory Bernard said of the film: "We’re really blessed to have so much attention on such a small film. We both took risks – [Quentin] artistically, me in production – and the fact that we had, in general, a very positive response from the public; we’ve had audiences who really loved it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/04/12/on-rubber-wrong-and-reality-producer-gregory-bernard-discusses-working-with-quentin-dupieux/|title=On Rubber, Wrong And Reality - Producer Gregory Bernard Discusses Working With Quentin Dupieux - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=12 April 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''S. Dillon Ripley Center''', better known simply as the '''Ripley Center''', is one of the buildings of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] series of [[museums]] located in the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The above-ground portion is only a small [[pagoda]], and it descends into a larger underground portion. The Ripley Center houses the International Gallery, The Smithsonian Associates, and the offices of the Smithsonian Contributing Membership. It contains a conference center, an art gallery, and meeting/class rooms as well as exhibition space. It connects underground to the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]], the [[National Museum of African Art]], and the [[Freer Gallery of Art]].

[[File:Ripley Center interior.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The interior of the museum is a small, round area that descends for several stories.]]
The Smithsonian Associates was formed in 1992 from combining the Resident Associates Program with the Smithsonian National Associate Program.  The Smithsonian Associates was established as the cultural, educational, and membership division of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These membership and educational programs include the Young Benefactors, Smithsonian Sleepovers, Resident Associates Program, Discovery Theatre, Regional Events, and the Art Collectors Program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianassociates.org The Smithsonian Associates&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Collectors Program is devoted to the creation and appreciation of contemporary American limited-edition art and to creating a context for collecting and a forum for artists to discuss their work. The Program sells Smithsonian-commissioned contemporary fine art prints and posters by acclaimed American artists like Sam Gilliam and April Gornik. Its limited-edition prints are numbered and signed and come with a Certificate of Authenticity from the [[Smithsonian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ArtCollectorsProgram.org The Art Collectors Program&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saint Petersburg Bede''' (Saint Petersburg, [[Russian National Library|National Library of Russia]], lat. Q. v. I. 18), formerly known as the '''Leningrad Bede''', is an [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] [[illuminated manuscript]], a near-contemporary version of [[Bede]]'s 8th century history, the ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'').  Although not heavily illuminated, it is famous for containing the earliest [[historiated initial]] (one containing a picture) in European illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, p.199 &amp; T. Voronova and A Sterligov, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;  It is so named because it was taken to the Russian National Library of [[Saint Petersburg]] (later known as Leningrad) in [[Russia]] at the time of the [[French Revolution]] by [[Peter P. Dubrovsky]].

==Dating==
Traditionally, the Saint Petersburg Bede is attributed on [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] grounds to Bede’s [[monastery]] at [[Wearmouth-Jarrow]]. It is also traditionally dated to 731/732 × 746 on the basis of the so-called Memoranda, a series of retrospective dates found in the margins of Bede’s ''recapitulo'' in Book V Chapter 24. The validity of these Memoranda (and similar notes in the [[Moore Bede]]) as evidence for the precise year in which the manuscript was copied has been vigorously challenged. While it may not be possible to assign the manuscript to a specific year, it seems unlikely that it was copied much after the middle of the eighth century.

==Physical description==
[[File:Leningrad bede.jpg|thumb|left|The oldest historiated initial known]]
The manuscript is written on [[parchment]]. It contains 162 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s (numbered 161, but with f. 51 repeated—the correct foliation is given on the last folio in the bottom right corner). Pages average approximately 270 × 190&amp;nbsp;mm (Writing Space: 230 × 150&amp;nbsp;mm in two columns of 27 lines). The pages have been trimmed at some point. The manuscript has been copied by four hands, with textual "accessories" ([[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s, chapter numbers, and the like) in a fifth  (Parkes 1982, 6-11).  The opening three letters of Book 2 of Bede are decorated, to a height of 8 lines of the text, and the opening h contains a bust portrait of a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]ed figure carrying a cross and a book.  This may be intended to be St. [[Gregory the Great]], although a much later hand has identified the figure as St. [[Augustine of Canterbury]] in the halo.  The figure is identified as a saint, rather than Christ, by his clerical [[tonsure]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Meyer Schapiro]], p. 199 and pp. 212-214, For the view that it represents Gregory, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=y_u04enpjBoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA299&amp;dq=Leningrad+Bede++Augustine+initial&amp;as_brr=3 here].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the letter decoration is essentially [[Insular art|Insular]] in style, the figure shows Mediterranean influence, as do other elements of the illuminations, such as the foliate decoration filling in the B shown above.

==Contents==
The Saint Petersburg Bede contains one of the two oldest surviving examples of the "m-type" text of the Latin ''Historia ecclesiastica'' (Colgrave and Mynors 1969, xliv). The manuscript also contains one of two copies of the vernacular text of the Northumbrian ''aelda'' recension of ''Cædmon's Hymn'' in the bottom margin of "f. 107r" (actually f. 108r; see [[Cædmon]]). The poem has been copied in the fourth hand of the main Latin text (Parkes 1982, 6).

The '''''Skibby Chronicle''''' (Danish: Skibby-krøniken) is a Danish [[Latin]] [[chronicle]] from the 1530s found in the church of [[Skibby]] in North [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skibby-church/main|title=Skibby Church, The secret history of Denmark - 1001 Stories of Denmark|last=|first=|date=|website=www.kulturarv.dk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] but according to all historians the author is the outstanding humanist [[Poul Helgesen]] (Latin: ''Paulus Helie''). Formally the work covers the period 1047-1534, but the main part is about the reigns of [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] and [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]].

The work is a sometimes very personal description of Danish history during the last decades of [[Catholicism]], marked by the author’s sympathy for and (mainly) antipathy against the political actors. Especially his portrait of Christian II is a very subjective one, affected by his negative attitude to the king’s anti-aristocratic policy and his use of violence. Also Frederick I, regarded by Helgesen as a [[traitor]] to the [[Catholic]] cause, is harshly treated. The description ends abruptly during the [[Count's Feud|Count’s War]], perhaps because of Helgesen’s death.

Formally the chronicle is built up very much like the [[annals]], which means that great and small events are often mentioned together – deaths among the local clergy alternating with battles and wars – but it often contains valuable material. For instance, the nobility’s [[letter of complaint]] over Christian II is repeated.

In general the chronicle reflects the author’s bitterness, sorrow and frustration because of the course of events. His hot temper often breaks through, invectives and personal injuries reveal a man who was deeply engaged in the struggle. His hatred toward the [[Protestant]] [[agitators]] is just as outspoken as is his contempt and indignation at the last Catholic bishops and their behaviour. In spite of this subjectivity, the chronicle makes an interesting picture of pre-Reformation Denmark viewed through the eyes of a disillusioned Reform Catholic.

The original manuscript was found 1650, walled in behind the altar of the Church of Skibby. It was printed in Latin 1773 and translated into Danish 1890-1891.

'''''The Museum of Innocence''''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Masumiyet Müzesi}}}}) is a novel by [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]]-laureate [[Turkey|Turkish]] novelist published on August 29, 2008. The book, set in Istanbul between 1975 and 1984, is an account of the love story between the wealthy businessman Kemal and a poorer distant relative of his, Füsun.

Pamuk said he used [[YouTube]] to research Turkish music and film while preparing the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/world/europe/16frankfurt.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the writing of this book, Pamuk was influenced by the [[Bagatti Valsecchi Museum]] in Milan, Italy, as he noted in the museum's guestbook on June 27, 2007: “It is the third time that I have visited this extraordinary museum. I love this house, the idea and the imagination that hide behind these walls. They influenced me a lot for the novel I am writing, ''The Museum of Innocence''. I am happy to be here for the third time.” {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An excerpt, entitled "Distant Relations", appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on September 7, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pamuk|first1=Orhan|authorlink1=Orhan Pamuk|title=Distant Relations|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/07/distant-relations|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=7 September 2009|translator=Freely, Maureen|translator-link=Maureen Freely}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English translation, by his long-time collaborator [[Maureen Freely]], was released on October 20, 2009 by [[Alfred A.

==Plot==
[[File:Masumiyet Müzesi'nin binası.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The building that houses the Museum of Innocence]]
Kemal has been engaged to a pretty girl named Sibel for two months when he meets a shop girl, Füsun, while buying a handbag for his fiancee. What follows in the next month and a half is an intense and secretive physical and emotional relationship between them. Kemal's happiest moment of life comes while making love the day Füsun confesses her deep love for him. Though it is clear that he has also fallen completely for Füsun, Kemal keeps denying this to himself, believing that his marriage with Sibel and secret relationship could continue forever. His reverie is broken when Füsun disappears just after attending his engagement. Now he has to come to terms with his deep attachment and love for Füsun. He goes through a very painful period for about a year, unable to meet Füsun and deriving consolation from objects and places related to his beloved and their lovemaking. His engagement to Sibel breaks off and finally Füsun responds to his letter and agrees to meet him. Füsun has got married, living with her husband and parents and pretends to meet Kemal just as a distant relation, with undercurrents of anger. For the next eight years Kemal keeps visiting the family for supper and expressing his love for Füsun in various ways, while finding consolation in various objects related to her that he carries away from the house. Finally after her father’s death, circumstances lead Füsun to divorce her husband. Füsun and Kemal are to be married after a trip around Europe together, but fate has something else in store and they become separated forever after a night of intense love-making. Kemal regards each object related to Füsun and their love, collected over the years, as portraying some discrete moment of happiness and bliss in the passage of those nine years. He decides to convert Füsun’s house into a museum of innocence, including all these objects and also other memorabilia related to the period.

==Themes==

===Clash between East &amp; West===
Pamuk's work often deals with clash of culture between East and West, which was cited as part of the reason for him being awarded the [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature#Laureates|Nobel Prize in Literature]]. This novel continuously references the influence of the West (Europe and America) on Istanbul's culture, through both the idea of museums and the film industry, which becomes a large part of the novel.

===Museums and Collections===
The book, along with its accompanying museum, continuously refers to museums and collections. The idea of hoarding and collecting as a shameful act that becomes public and appreciated in the form of a museum is addressed particularly in the last chapters.

===Female Identity &amp; Turkish Culture===
One of the key themes throughout the novel is the role of the female in Turkish culture. The novel describes the ostracism of women who have lost their virginity before marriage, despite the fact that many claim to have a "more western" attitude toward this in 1970s Istanbul. Pamuk describes this as the taboo of virginity that is part of an old system in Turkey.

In an interview Pamuk blended all of these themes as he commented on how the role of the museum is also one of ownership, as Kemal looks to own Füsun as a trinket in his own museum, rather than allow her autonomy of her own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy62YqDeE0c

==Museum==
{{Main article|The Museum of Innocence (museum)}}

Pamuk has established an actual "Museum of Innocence", based on the museum described in the book. It is housed in a building in the [[Çukurcuma]] neighbourhood of [[Beyoğlu]], [[Istanbul]], and displays a collection evocative of everyday life and culture of Istanbul during the period in which the novel is set.&lt;ref name="TurkNet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nobel laureate Pamuk's "Museum of Innocence" to be opened in Istanbul |url=http://haber.turk.net/haber_detay.asp?ID=2282570&amp;cat=EKO |publisher=TurkNet |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the museum was scheduled to be exhibited at [[Frankfurt]]’s [[Schirn Kunsthalle]] in October 2008, during the annual [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], but the exhibition was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International News Digest – Orhan Pamuk cancels "Museum of Innocence" |url=http://www.artforum.com/news/mode=international&amp;week=200827 |journal=[[Artforum]] |date=Week of July 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Pamuk still hoped that the museum would be opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Room with a view: Pamuk explores İstanbul's double soul |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-223082-room-with-a-view-pamuk-explores-istanbuls-double-soul.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010200235/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-223082-room-with-a-view-pamuk-explores-istanbuls-double-soul.html |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much delay, the museum was finally inaugurated in April 2012. Although created later, the museum and the novel were conceived of in tandem, displaying the obsessive romance between two Istanbul families, as well as eternalizing a perspective on upper-class Istanbul in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nobel winner Orhan Pamuk opens novel museum in Istanbul |author=Ayla Jean Yackley |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/29/210931.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429035108/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/29/210931.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 29, 2012 |publisher=[[Al Arabiya]] News |agency=Reuters |date=April 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was supported by Istanbul 2010&amp;nbsp;– [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 ECOC Support for the Museum of Innocence |url=http://www.en.istanbul2010.org/HABER/GP_527259 |publisher=Istanbul 2010&amp;nbsp;– European Capital of Culture |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413134744/http://www.en.istanbul2010.org/HABER/GP_527259 |archivedate=April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book, the museum allows free entry to those who bring a copy of the book. A ticket placed in the 83rd chapter of the book will be stamped before ushering the reader in.

The '''''Thesaurus Linguae Latinae''''' (abbreviated as ''ThLL'' or ''TLL'') is a monumental dictionary of [[Latin]] founded on [[Historical dictionary|historical principles]]. It encompasses the Latin language from the time of [[Old Latin|its origin]] to the time of [[Isidore of Seville]] (died 636). 

The project began in 1894 and it was scheduled to be completed around the year 2050. The last fascicle of the P-volume appeared in 2010, and work is currently under way on both N and R. The institution that carries out the work of the dictionary is located in [[Munich]], in the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, N.

[[File:Lions 02.JPG|thumb|An [[Asiatic lion]] and two [[Bengal tiger]]s&lt;ref name="Tourism" /&gt; in [[Captive animal|captivity]] at [[Bannerghatta National Park]], [[India]]. India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],&lt;ref name="Tudge2011"/&gt; from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;]]

Historically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')&lt;ref name=Geptner /&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP /&gt; has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,&lt;ref name=Ortega2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Porter1894" /&gt; naturalists,&lt;ref name="TOTW2010" /&gt; artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.&lt;ref name="Thespokesmanreview1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lat /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="PapersPast1900" /&gt; In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],&lt;ref name=minn /&gt;&lt;ref name="SydneyMail1889" /&gt; where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys1999 /&gt; The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],&lt;ref name="Beatty1941" /&gt; either deliberately&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auguet1994" /&gt; or accidentally.&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com" /&gt;

== Temperament ==
Both the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[tiger attack|tiger]].&lt;ref name="Porter1894"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCKM1993"/&gt; General differences in behaviour:
* The lion is usually a highly [[social animal]] while the tiger is [[solitary animal|solitary]]. It is agreed that the tiger is faster, smarter and more ferocious, and that keepers of captive tigers must constantly fear sudden attack.&lt;ref name="Kirk Bates" /&gt;
* Lions may roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is  killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,&lt;ref name="Kirk Bates"/&gt; though they do socialize.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt;

More specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[promiscuity|promiscuous]].&lt;ref name=Schaller1972/&gt; However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,&lt;ref name=S&amp;S02/&gt; with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,&lt;ref name="Joslin1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meena2008" /&gt; similar to tigers,&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity to defend their [[cub (organism)|cubs]], African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.&lt;ref name="HT2016" /&gt;

In the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,&lt;ref name="Auguet1994"/&gt; including [[Barbary lion]]s&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /&gt; and tigers.&lt;ref name=Hoage8-18 /&gt; A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.&lt;ref name="King2002" /&gt; There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s won victory. Although lions and tigers can be kept together in harmony in captivity,&lt;ref name="The Telegraph" /&gt; fatal conflicts have also been recorded.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIE1930" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger" /&gt;

== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==
Currently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers.&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Partington1835 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /&gt; Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;&lt;ref name=ToT1838/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Karanth03 /&gt; and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.&lt;ref name="Nationalgeographic2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thetimesofindia2013" /&gt;

Before the end of the 20th Century, lions&lt;ref name=Haas2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Catsg /&gt; and tigers&lt;ref name=Mazak1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Luo04 /&gt; had also occurred in other [[Asia]]n&lt;ref name="Tudge2011" /&gt; or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; As such, there is a word for 'Lion',&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphreys1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Catsg/&gt; which can also mean 'Tiger',&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kipling /&gt; and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|شیر}}}}),&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Iranica" /&gt; and its significance is discussed below. The lion is also of [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|cultural importance]] in the [[Far East]],&lt;ref name="TTN2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Upham1829" /&gt; including the [[Indochina|land]]&lt;ref name="MyanmarImage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicketal. 2010" /&gt; of the [[Indochinese tiger]],&lt;ref name=Mazak1981/&gt; but according to authors such as [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939)&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; and Nowell and Jackson (1996),&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt; the lion did not naturally occur there.

According to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.&lt;ref name="Tudge2011"/&gt;

Apart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.&lt;ref name=messybeast2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="ligerfacts.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krypto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lair" /&gt;&lt;ref name=shi /&gt; From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Luo04/&gt;&lt;ref name="KitchenerDugmore2000" /&gt; it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haas2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazak1981/&gt; Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.&lt;ref name="Jhaletal2011" /&gt;

[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]
[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]
The possibility of conflict, between lions and tigers, had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Indian lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; before December 2017.&lt;ref name="HT 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI 12-2017" /&gt; Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thetimesofindia2013"/&gt; Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would "trigger frequent clashes."&lt;ref name="Thetimesofindia2006" /&gt; The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nationalgeographic2008"/&gt; Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,&lt;ref name=Kailash1978/&gt; these lions are social like their African relatives,&lt;ref name=S&amp;S02 /&gt; and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary, and it is believed that a group of lions (2 – 3 males) or lionesses (2 – 4 females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress (see {{section link||Temperament}}). Therefore it would appear that in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;

[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Subcontinent, before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mazak1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karanth03/&gt; As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt;

== Observed fights ==
In addition to historical recordings, clashes between lions and tigers were reported or even caught on [[camera]],&lt;ref name="St.PetersburgTimes1952"/&gt; in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not always clear which species regularly beat the other, according to Doctor Packer (2015).&lt;ref name=minn/&gt;&lt;ref name="SydneyMail1889"/&gt;

=== In captivity ===
* [[Roman Empire|Roman Emperor]] [[Titus]] had Bengal tigers compelled to fight [[Africa]]n lions, and the tigers always beat the lions.&lt;ref name=JMS1850 /&gt;
* In July 1808, Sylvanus Urban said that Mr Bolton had a friend who claimed to have seen a fight between the lion and tiger at a circus in [[Verona]]. Though the tiger had attacked first, it yielded to the stronger lion.&lt;ref name="Gentlemen'sMagazine1834" /&gt;
* In 1830, a tiger attacked a lion at a menagerie in [[Turin]], [[Rome]]. Despite having attacked first, the lion got it on its back, and used its jaws to hold the tiger's throat. The tiger died after that.&lt;ref name="NMHAMA1930" /&gt;
* Clark (1838) said that a [[British Empire|British]] officer, who resided many years at [[Sierra Leone]], saw many fights between lions and tigers, and that the tiger 'universally' won.&lt;ref name=ToT1838 /&gt;{{efn|As a [[West Africa]]n nation, Sierra Leone would have had [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[Northern lion|lions]], but not tigers.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;}}
* In 1857, an 18-month-old tiger at the Bromwich Zoo broke into the cage of an adult lion. The pair fought, and the young tiger ripped the lion's stomach. The lion died minutes later.&lt;ref name=Darwin /&gt;
* According to Porter (1894), a tiger called 'Gunga', which belonged to the King of [[Oude]], killed thirty lions, and destroyed another after being transferred to the [[London Zoo|zoological garden in London]].&lt;ref name="Porter1894"/&gt;
* According to the ''Gettysburg Compiler'' and ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' (1899), towards the end of the 19th century in [[India]], the [[Gaekwad]] of [[Baroda]], that is [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Sayajirao III]],&lt;ref name="GoB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2011GoB" /&gt; arranged a fight in an [[amphitheater]], between a Barbary lion called '[[Atlas the Barbary lion versus the Bengal tiger of Simla|Atlas]]', from the [[Atlas Mountains]] between [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]], and a man-eating Bengal tiger from the Indian region of [[Shimla]], both large and hungry (with their diets reduced before the fight), before an audience of thousands, instead of between an [[Indian lion]] and the tiger, as Indian lions were believed to be no match for Bengal tigers.{{efn|For more details, see ''[[#Asiatic lion and Bengal tiger|Asiatic lion versus Bengal tiger]]''.}} The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws. The tiger was seen as "the personification of graceful strength and supple energy," whereas the lion was seen as the "embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle".&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt; In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move, before dying. The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 [[rupee]]s, accepted that the tiger was the "King of the [[Cat Family]]," decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a "cage of honour" in the [[menagerie]] of [[Baroda]], and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran [[grizzly bear]] weighing more than {{convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=in}}. The battle was to happen after the tiger recovered from its wounds.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt;
* At the [[Coney Island]] animal show in 1909, a performing lion attacked a chained tiger by leaping through the air, landing on the tiger's back. Though hampered by the heavy neck chain fastened to the iron bars of the arena, the tiger was more than a match for the lion and mangled it to death.&lt;ref name="Boston News" /&gt;
* In May 1914, at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Bronx Zoo]], the barrier between the cages of Rajah, an 8-year-old Bengal tiger, and Huerte, a [[African lion#Northeast African population|Nubian lion]] which was 2&lt;ref name="HorshamTimes1914" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WarracknabealHerald1914" /&gt; or 3 years old, and had been sick for some time, got opened in an "unaccountable manner." For the first few minutes, the more agile Huerte appeared to be winning, but when it aimed for its injured opponent's neck, about an hour into the fight, Rajah aimed for its [[nape]]. Not only did Rajah manage to bite Huerte's nape, but it also broke Huerte's back, thus slaughtering it.&lt;ref name="FairmontWestVirginian1914" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PittsburghPress1914" /&gt;
* In 1934, a fully grown African lion killed a mature Bengal tiger a short time after these circus animals were unloaded from the train, before trainers could separate them.&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com"/&gt;
* Bert Nelson (1938) said that in [[Chicago]], when 20 lions and tigers were mixed together for an act at a circus, a fight occurred, lasting for about 10 minutes. No fatalities were mentioned, but Nelson said that order was 'restored' when tigers used [[escape door]]s to flee.&lt;ref name="TheAge1938" /&gt;
* At South Perth Zoo, 1949, in a three-minute fight between a lion and a tiger, the lion killed the tiger. The fight occurred when the tiger put his head through a connecting slide. The lion caught the tiger by the throat, and, dragging it through the opening, killed it before the keepers arrived.&lt;ref name="Lion Kills Tiger"/&gt;
* By 21 February 1951, Beatty had seen 50 tigers killed by lions throughout his career.&lt;ref name="NMHAMA1951" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Tuscaloosa News" /&gt;
* In September 1951, at a corporation zoo in [[Madras]], India, an eighteen-year-old tiger called 'Vikram' entered the cage of a seven-year-old lion called 'Leo', and got into a fight with it. Badly mauled, including in the [[femur]], Vikram retreated into its cage, and despite receiving medical attention, died.&lt;ref name=TheIndianExpress1951 /&gt;
* An Indian Prince organised a filmed fight in a deep pit in the compound of his palace. The lion had killed the tiger, according to Kailash Sankhala (1978).&lt;ref name=Kailash1978 /&gt;&lt;ref name="newspaperarchive.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kailash1978/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lion Kills Tiger" /&gt;
* In March 2011, a Bengal tiger at the [[Ankara Zoo]] passed through a gap, between its cage and that of a lion, and killed it with a single paw swipe.&lt;ref name="BBC2010" /&gt; "The tiger severed the lion's [[jugular vein]] in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood," officials said.

=== In the wilderness ===
* It appears from the 15th-century book ''[[Anvâr-i Suhaylî]]'' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|اَنوارِ سُهيلى}}}}, "Lights of the [[Canopus]]")&lt;ref name="Eastwick1854" /&gt; that the lion and tiger competed for dominance in the region of the Tigris River, that is Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP/&gt;
* Herne (1855) mentioned that in the Indian [[North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests|jungle]] between the village of [[Elaw]], city of [[Baroche]], and [[Gulf of Cambay]], north of the city of [[Surat]] and its [[Western Ghats|Ghauts]], about {{convert|6.0|or|7.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} from the village, he and his party, which included [[Indian people|locals]], heard a tiger's roar. Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as "tyrants of the [[forest]]," given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the "King of Beasts." Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.&lt;ref name="CUL1855" /&gt;
* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a "rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life," and had muscular limbs. The male lion was "medium-sized." Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. As they fought, which involved making bites or scratches, they growled in a way that turned the hunter's hair gray, in his own words. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,&lt;ref name=Schaller1967 /&gt; but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now, the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),&lt;ref name="StLandryDemocrat1887"/&gt; ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),&lt;ref name="EatonDemocrat1887"/&gt; ''The Iola Register'' (1887),&lt;ref name="IolaRegister1887"/&gt; ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),&lt;ref name="MilanExchange1887"/&gt; and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),&lt;ref name="SydneyMail1889"/&gt; in [[chronological order]].}}
* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and "[[Siberia]]n tiger"{{efn|Though this term was used,&lt;ref name="SanFranciscoCall1911" /&gt; genetic tests showed that the [[Amur tiger]] was closely related to the Caspian tiger,&lt;ref name="CSG2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Driscolletal2009" /&gt; which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="Geptner" /&gt;}} is mentioned in Hamilton M. Wright's work, in ''The [[San Francisco Call]]'' (1911).&lt;ref name="SanFranciscoCall1911" /&gt;

Generally, in terms of dimensions of the body and weight, the modern tiger&lt;ref name=Mazak1981/&gt; and lion&lt;ref name=Haas2005/&gt; are the two [[list of largest cats|largest]] species of the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]'' and the cat [[Family (biology)|family]]. Variations in opinions and measurements exist for them, especially across different populations or [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name=Partington1835/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; Apart from that, similarities and differences exist for other characteristics, such as the lengths of their skulls.&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;

== Professional opinions ==

=== Favoring the tiger ===
* [[John Varty]], owner of the [[Londolozi Private Game Reserve|Londolozi Reserve]] in [[South Africa]], said, "People always ask me which one is bigger? If a tiger and a lion had a fight, which one would win? Well, I've seen tigers crunch up a full-grown [[leopard tortoise]] like it was nothing. And lions try, but they just don't get it right. If there's a fight, the tiger will win, every time."&lt;ref name="Country Life" /&gt;
* The animal rescue organisation [[Big Cat Rescue]] of [[Tampa, Florida]] answered, "While it would depend on the size, age, and aggressiveness of the specific animals involved, generally tigers have a significant advantage."&lt;ref name="Big Cat Rescue" /&gt;
* The conservation charity [[Save China's Tigers]] stated "Recent research indicates that the tiger is indeed stronger than the lion in terms of physical strength. Lions hunt in prides, so it would be in a group and the tiger as a solitary creature so it would be on its own. A tiger is generally physically larger than a lion. Most experts would favor a Siberian and [[Bengal tiger]] over an [[African lion]]."&lt;ref name="Save China's Tigers" /&gt;
* [[John Smith Clarke]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] lion tamer, said, in a lecture on the fight between a tiger and a lion given to the Glasgow Zoological Society, while showing the actual fight on the screen, "in 100 cases out of 100 the tiger would always beat the lion. It was far more agile, it was not so clumsy in its movements, it was equally strong, it was equally armed, but it fought in a different way. The tiger very often fought rolling on its back and held the lion in its grip until it defeated him."&lt;ref name=GlasgowHerald1937 /&gt;
* The [[BBC]] (2016), in a three-round study of agility, strength and intelligence, favored the tiger in the case of intelligence, due to the time spent for a particular challenge.&lt;ref name=BBCEarthUnplugged /&gt;
* [[National Geographic Channel]]'s documentary ''The Last Lions of Asia'' mentioned that a Bengal tiger had a weight advantage of {{convert|50|kg}} over an Asiatic lion, and could kill a lone lion in a fight.&lt;ref name="Nationalgeographic2008"/&gt;

=== Favoring the lion ===
* [[Clyde Beatty]], the animal trainer and performer who owned several tigers, lions, hyenas, and other exotic animals, believed that in nine out of ten times, "a full-grown lion would whip a full-grown tiger". He mentioned that since he first began mixing the animals, 25 of his tigers (two of them being [[Siberian tiger]]s, the rest of them being Bengal tigers) were killed in the circus arena, but there was not a single lion casualty.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics"/&gt;
* Renowned naturalist and conservationist of India, [[Kailash Sankhala]] wrote in his book ''Tiger'' that the tiger would be unable to get close to lion's vital joints because of his thick mane, and that the tiger would be vulnerable to the lion. He mentioned that once an Indian prince organized a fight in which the lion killed the tiger, and opined that "a tiger is no match for even single lion of equal strength".&lt;ref name=Kailash1978/&gt;

=== Neutral ===
* [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a trainer from [[Hamburg]], said that the lion and tiger were alike in "good temper and reliability". He cited the example of a lion being trained for a month to do tricks, and of a tiger taking five weeks to do so.&lt;ref name="EveningStandard1905" /&gt;

== Arts and literature ==

=== Art ===
Battles between the two were painted in the 18th and 19th centuries by [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[George Stubbs]] and [[James Ward (artist)|James Ward]]. Ward's paintings, which portrayed lion victories in accordance with the lion's symbolic value in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], have been described as less realistic than Stubbs.&lt;ref name=Stubbs /&gt;

The British [[Seringapatam medal]] shows a lion defeating a tiger in battle; an Arabic language banner on the medal displays the words ''Asad [[Allāh]] al-Ghālib'' ({{lang-ar|أسَـد الله الـغَـالِـب}}, "Lion of [[God]] the Conqueror"). The medal commemorated the British victory at the 1799 [[Battle of Seringapatam]] (in the town now known as [[Srirangapatna]]) over [[Tipu Sultan]] — who used tigers as emblems, as opposed to the British emblematic use of lions.&lt;ref name=maya /&gt;

=== Literature ===
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Handbill of Merchant's Hall, 1739, announcing A lion, lionesses, tigers, etc..jpg|thumb|A 1739 advertisement by [[Charles Benjamin Incledon (advertiser)|Charles Benjamin Incledon]] featuring [[feliform]]s: the [[Mesopotamian lion]] from the vicinity of [[Bassorah]], [[Cape lion]], [[tiger]] from the [[East Indies]], [[Black panther|panther]] from [[Buenos Aires]], ''[[Hyaena hyaena]]'' from [[West Africa]], and [[leopard]] from [[Turkey]], besides a "[[Lampago|Man tyger]]" from [[Africa]]. Note that the lion comes first in the list, and that it is referred to as the "Magnanimous King of Beaʃt" ([[sic]]).]]

18th-century naturalists and authors compared the species' characters, generally in favor of the lion.&lt;ref name=knight /&gt; [[Oliver Goldsmith]] ranked the lion first among carnivorous mammals, followed by the tiger, which in his view "seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion, without sharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage and strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency and generosity; but the tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity."&lt;ref name=goldsmith /&gt; [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], writing in ''The [[English Cyclopaedia]]'', disparaged the opinions of naturalists [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Thomas Pennant]] in this context, stating "the general herd of authors who eulogise the 'courage, greatness, clemency and generosity' of the lion, contrasting it with the unprovoked ferocity, unnecessary cruelty and poltroonery of the tiger, becomes ridiculous, though led by such names as Buffon and Pennant."&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;
* [[English literature]] compared their battle strengths.&lt;ref name=richards /&gt; The poets [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsey]], and [[Robert Southey]] described lion victories.&lt;ref name=richards/&gt; In the view of a 19th-century literary critic, these contests established "sovereignty of the animal world."&lt;ref name=richards/&gt;
* According to [[John Hampden Porter]] (1894, page 176), Lockington said that the [[South American jaguar|jaguar]] reigned 'supreme' as the "terror of the [[Amazon rainforest|forest]]," and that this applied to the lion and tiger in the '[[desert]]' and '[[jungle]]', respectively.&lt;ref name="Porter1894"/&gt;

In the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] epic [[Mahabharata]], [[Narada]] told Srinjaya that tigers were fiercer and more ruthless than lions.&lt;ref name="Sacredtexts2016" /&gt; This is in contrast with other literature from [[ancient India]], which prefers the lion to the tiger. For example, [[Vedic]] literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the "king of the forest."&lt;ref name="Mitra2005"/&gt;

The lion and tiger rival each other in [[Iranian literature]].&lt;ref name="Eastwick1854"/&gt; For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book ''Lion and [[Gazelle]]: The [[Mammal]]s and [[Bird]]s of Iran'', treated them as the "two greatest and most beautiful" of Iranian [[carnivore]]s, albeit being extinct there. As with the lion,&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt; the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.&lt;ref name=Humphreys1999/&gt;

==== The lion's mane ====
{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical

 |image2=Lion, Etosha National Park, Namibia (3897513000).jpg |caption2=A Southern African lion with a thicker mane in [[Etosha National Park]], [[Namibia]] |width2=220
}}

About the lion's mane, Knight wrote "The lion has owed a good deal to his mane and his noble and dignified aspect; but appearances are not always to be trusted."&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; In fact, a study was done by scientists Craig Packer and Peyton West that claimed that the mane of the lion was strictly for mating purposes. Darker-maned lions were more often picked by females to breed, while light-maned lions were not so lucky. A lion's mane did not always purposely help in a fight, and it might even hinder the male lion, slowing it down when it attacks, according to Packer and West.&lt;ref name=Bigcatnews2006 /&gt;

However, Dereck Joubert (1996), who spent many hours studying [[East-Southern African lion|lions]] in [[Botswana]], believed that the mane could defend the lion's throat, in a fight with another lion,&lt;ref name="NewScientist1996" /&gt; and Clyde (1939)&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics"/&gt; and Kailash (1978)&lt;ref name=Kailash1978/&gt; believed that the mane could defend part of the lion's neck, in a fight against the tiger. Reports also support these claims, for example, when the Shimlan tiger fought Atlas, it tried biting Atlas' neck, but it could not, due to the mane blocking its teeth, and interfering with its respiratory system.&lt;ref name="Lion against tiger"/&gt; According to Heptner and Sludskii (1997), Barbary and Cape lions had the "most luxuriant and extensive manes" among lions, with "[[#History in captivity|tresses on flanks and abdomen]]." As for the Asiatic lion, which has a smaller mane than its African cousins,&lt;ref name=Geptner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1939/&gt; apart from African lions that have weak manes or are maneless,&lt;ref name="Schloetal2010" /&gt; during the fight reported by ''The Sun (New York)'' (1889), though the tiger could bite the lion's body, it was not mentioned to have bitten the lion's neck.

==== Economics ====
The term "[[Tiger economy]]" has been applied to Asian countries that have undergone rapid economic growth, and the term "[[Lion economy]]" to their African counterparts. The two sides, nicknamed the "Asian tigers" and "African lions" have also been compared.&lt;ref name="Berendsen_al2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowditch1999"/&gt;

=== Cinema ===
In ''[[Paalai]]'', a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film, there is dialogue about the characteristics of the tiger and lion. It concludes that the tiger is superior. In the film, the tiger is the symbol and flag of the native Tamil tribal people and the lion is the symbol and flag of non-Tamil [[Singhal]] (literally meaning 'Leonine') people.&lt;ref name=Imbd/&gt;
