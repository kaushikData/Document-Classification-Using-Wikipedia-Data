'''[[Abuse]] of [[Power (social and political)|power]]''', in the form of "[[malfeasance in office]]" or "official misconduct," is the commission of an [[Crime|unlawful]] act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a [[for cause]] removal of an elected official by [[statute]] or [[recall election]]. Abuse of power can also mean a person using the power they have for their own personal gain.

==Institutional abuse==
[[Institutional abuse]] is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) by a system of power.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L.|author2=A. Mooney &amp; M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based [[child abuse]], such as [[neglect]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Examples==
{{Incomplete section|date=January 2018}}
===Joe Arpaio===
{{Main|Joe Arpaio}}
In February 2010, Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio "misused the power of his office to target members of the Board of Supervisors for criminal investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wingett |first=Yvonne |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/02/25/20100225wilcox0225.html#ixzz0y8iImUJ8 |title=Supervisor cases collapse |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a federal grand jury began an inquiry of Arpaio for abuse of power, in connection with an FBI investigation.&lt;ref name=KPHO&gt;{{cite news|title=Sources: FBI Investigating Joe Arpaio |url=http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=KPHO |date=Oct 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020184811/http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Conder |first=Chuck |title=Arizona sheriff under investigation for alleged abuse of power |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/09/arizona.tough.sheriff/index.html?video=true&amp;hpt=T2 |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=CNN |date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2012, the Arizona US Attorney's office announced that it was "closing its investigation into allegations of criminal conduct" by Arpaio, without filing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/08/31/feds-close-criminal-investigation-into-maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio/ |title=Feds close criminal investigation into Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio |publisher=Fox News |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arpaio was investigated for politically motivated and "bogus" prosecutions, which a former US Attorney called "utterly unacceptable".&lt;ref name="KPHO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Phoenix Mayor [[Phil Gordon (politician)|Phil Gordon]] has called Arpaio's "long list" of questionable prosecutions "a reign of terror".&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

===Fa Zheng===
{{Main|Fa Zheng}}
Fa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shu [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (蜀郡) and "General Who Spreads Martial Might" (揚武將軍) by Liu Bei. He oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province's capital [[Chengdu]] and served as Liu Bei's chief adviser.&lt;ref&gt;(以正為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍，外統都畿，內為謀主。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached [[Zhuge Liang]], another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, "When our lord was in Gong'an (公安), he was wary of [[Cao Cao]]'s influence in the north and fearful of [[Sun Quan]]'s presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that [[Lady Sun]] might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;(一飡之德，睚眦之怨，無不報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。或謂諸葛亮曰：「法正於蜀郡太縱橫，將軍宜啟主公，抑其威福。」亮荅曰：「主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之彊，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制，如何禁止法正使不得行其意邪！」初，孫權以妹妻先主，妹才捷剛猛，有諸兄之風，侍婢百餘人，皆親執刀侍立，先主每入，衷心常凜凜；亮又知先主雅愛信正，故言如此。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity.

Individual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be [[Police corruption|corrupt]] or carry out various forms of [[police misconduct]]; this occasionally happens in many forces, but can be more common where police pay is very low unless supplemented by [[bribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |title=IPS: DRUGS-MEXICO: Police Caught Between Low Wages, Threats and Bribes |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620183631/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |archivedate=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers sometimes act with unwarranted [[Police brutality|brutality]] when they overreact to confrontational situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5172206/Ian-Tomlinson-G20-protests-death-police-office-faces-manslaughter-charge.html |title=Ian Tomlinson G20 protests death: police office faces manslaughter charge |work=The Telegraph |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014.100-you-did-it-didnt-you-the-police-often-argue-that-thetough-interviewing-of-suspects-is-the-best-way-to-extract-the-truth-butsuch-strategies-are-exactly-the-sort-to-provoke-false-confessions-.html |title=The police often argue that the tough 'interviewing' of suspects is the best way to extract the truth.

[[File:Aleph0.svg|thumb|right|150px|Aleph-naught, or aleph-null, the smallest infinite cardinal number]]

In [[mathematics]], and in particular [[set theory]], the '''aleph numbers''' are a sequence of numbers used to represent the [[cardinality]] (or size) of [[infinite set]]s that can be [[well-ordered]]. They are named after the symbol used to denote them, the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letter [[aleph]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;) (though in older mathematics books the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in {{harv|Sierpiński|1958|loc=p.402}} the letter aleph appears both the right way up and upside down&lt;/ref&gt; partly because a [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=0553111 
|last=Swanson|first= Ellen|first2= Arlene Ann|last2= O'Sean|first3= Antoinette Tingley |last3=Schleyer
|title=Mathematics into type: Copy editing and proofreading of mathematics for editorial assistants and authors|edition= updated|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |place= Providence, R.I.|year=1999|origyear= 1979|isbn=  0-8218-0053-1 |pages= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (read ''aleph-naught'' or ''aleph-zero''; the German term ''aleph-null'' is also sometimes used), the next larger cardinality is aleph-one &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define a [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for every [[ordinal number]] α, as described below.

The concept and notation are due to [[Georg Cantor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|website=jeff560.tripod.com|access-date=2016-05-05|author=Jeff Miller}}  Miller quotes {{Cite book|title=Georg Cantor:His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|author=Joseph Warren Dauben|date=1990|isbn=9780691024479}} : "His new numbers deserved something unique. ... Not wishing to invent a new symbol himself, he chose the aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet...the aleph could be taken to represent new beginnings..."

&lt;/ref&gt; who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|infinite sets can have different cardinalities]].

The aleph numbers differ from the [[Extended real number line|infinity]] (∞) commonly found in algebra and calculus. Alephs measure the sizes of sets; infinity, on the other hand, is commonly defined as an extreme [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the [[real number line]] (applied to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] that "[[divergent series|diverges]] to infinity" or "increases without bound"), or an extreme point of the [[extended real number line]].

=={{anchor|Aleph-null}}Aleph-naught==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (aleph-naught, also aleph-zero or the German term Aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an [[transfinite number|infinite cardinal]]. The set of all finite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], called '''ω''' or '''ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' (where ω is the lowercase Greek letter [[omega]]), has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. A set has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is [[countably infinite]], that is, there is a [[bijection]] (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are

* the set of all [[square number]]s, the set of all [[cubic number]]s, the set of all [[fourth power]]s, ...
* the set of all [[perfect power]]s, the set of all [[prime power]]s, 
* the set of all [[even number]]s, the set of all [[odd number]]s,
* the set of all [[prime number]]s, the set of all [[composite number]]s, 
* the set of all [[integer]]s, 
* the set of all [[rational number]]s, 
* the set of all [[constructible number]]s (in the geometric sense),
* the set of all [[algebraic number]]s, 
* the set of all [[computable number]]s, 
* the set of all [[definable number]]s, 
* the set of all binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s of finite length, and 
* the set of all finite [[subset]]s of any given countably infinite set.

These infinite ordinals: ω, ω+1, ω·2, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] are among the countably infinite sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | title=Set Theory | publisher= [[Springer-Verlag]]| location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sequence (with [[ordinality]] ω·2) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers

:{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

is an ordering of the set (with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;) of positive integers.

If the [[axiom of countable choice]] (a weaker version of the [[axiom of choice]]) holds, then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than any other infinite cardinal.

==Aleph-one==
&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, called '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' or sometimes '''Ω'''. This '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an [[uncountable set]]. Therefore,  &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is distinct from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The definition of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; implies (in ZF, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] ''without'' the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. If the [[axiom of choice]] is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is [[totally ordered]], and thus &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. Using the axiom of choice we can show one of the most useful properties of the set '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''': any countable subset of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' has an upper bound in '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  (This follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable, one of the most common applications of the axiom of choice.)  This fact is analogous to the situation in &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;: every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and [[Union (set theory)#Finite unions|finite unions]] of finite sets are finite.

'''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is actually a useful concept, if somewhat exotic-sounding. An example application is "closing" with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Borel hierarchy]]). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of "generation" in algebra ([[vector space]]s, [[group theory|group]]s, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations—sums, products, and the like. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via [[transfinite induction]], a set by "throwing in" all possible countable unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of '''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

Every uncountable [[coanalytic]] subset of a [[Polish space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has
cardinality &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Continuum hypothesis==
{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}
{{see also|Beth number}}
The [[cardinality]] of the set of [[real number]]s ([[cardinality of the continuum]]) is &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. It cannot be determined from ZFC ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]]) where this number fits exactly in the aleph number hierarchy, but it follows from ZFC that the continuum hypothesis, '''CH''', is equivalent to the identity

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The CH states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. CH is independent of ZFC: it can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is [[consistency|consistent]]). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940 when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC.  That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] in 1963 when he showed, conversely, that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC by the (then novel) method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html |title=Continuum Hypothesis|last=Szudzik |first=Mattew |date=31 July 2018 |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Web Resources |access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aleph-ω==
Conventionally the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted ω, and the cardinal number &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the least upper bound of
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\left\{\,\aleph_n : n\in\left\{\,0,1,2,\dots\,\right\}\,\right\}&lt;/math&gt;}}
among alephs.

Aleph-ω is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ''not'' to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all [[real number]]s; for any positive integer ''n'' we can consistently assume that &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_n&lt;/math&gt;, and moreover it is possible to assume &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is as large as we like. We are only forced to avoid setting it to certain special cardinals with [[cofinality]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning there is an unbounded function from &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; to it (see [[Easton's theorem]]).

==Aleph-α for general α==
To define &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary ordinal number &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we must define the [[successor cardinal|successor cardinal operation]], which assigns to any cardinal number ρ the next larger [[well-order]]ed cardinal ρ{{sup|+}} (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds, this is the next larger cardinal).

We can then define the aleph numbers as follows:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;}}
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha+1} = \aleph_{\alpha}^+&lt;/math&gt;}}

and for λ, an infinite [[limit ordinal]],

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\lambda} = \bigcup_{\beta &lt; \lambda} \aleph_\beta.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The α-th infinite [[initial ordinal]] is written &lt;math&gt;\omega_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  Its cardinality is written &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
In ZFC, the '''aleph function''' &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection from the ordinals to the infinite cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{PlanetMath | urlname=AlephNumbers | title=aleph numbers | id=5710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed points of omega==
For any ordinal α we have
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\alpha\leq\omega_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;}}

In many cases &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than α. For example, for any successor ordinal α this holds. There are, however, some limit ordinals which are [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the omega function, because of the [[fixed-point lemma for normal functions]]. The first such is the limit of the sequence

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\omega,\ \omega_\omega,\ \omega_{\omega_\omega},\ \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Any [[inaccessible cardinal|weakly inaccessible cardinal]] is also a fixed point of the aleph function.&lt;ref name="Harris 2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kaharris.org/teaching/582/Lectures/lec31.pdf | title=Math 582 Intro to Set Theory, Lecture 31 | publisher=Department of Mathematics, University of Michigan | date=April 6, 2009 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Harris, Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[successor ordinal]], then &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; would be a [[successor cardinal]] and hence not weakly inaccessible. If &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; were a [[limit ordinal]] less than &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt;, then its [[cofinality]] (and thus the cofinality of &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) would be less than &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;\kappa &lt;/math&gt; would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \kappa &lt;/math&gt; and consequently &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \kappa &lt;/math&gt; which makes it a fixed point.

==Role of axiom of choice==

The cardinality of any infinite [[ordinal number]] is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its [[initial ordinal]]. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is [[equinumerous]] with an ordinal and is thus [[Well-order|well-orderable]].

Each [[finite set]] is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality.

The assumption that the cardinality of each [[infinite set]] is an aleph number is equivalent over ZF to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers.

When cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of [[Scott's trick]] is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define card(''S'') to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as ''S'' of minimum possible rank. This has the property that card(''S'') = card(''T'') if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same cardinality. (The set card(''S'') does not have the same cardinality of ''S'' in general, but all its elements do.)

Approach-avoidance conflicts occur when there is one goal or event that has both [[positive affectivity|positive]] and [[negative affectivity|negative]] effects or characteristics that make the goal appealing and unappealing simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Miller, 1944"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miller, N.

The positive aspects, or approach portion, of marriage might be considered togetherness, sharing memories, and companionship while the negative aspects, or avoidance portions, might include financial considerations, arguments, and difficulty with in-laws. The negative effects of the decision help influence the decision maker to avoid the goal or event, while the positive effects influence the decision maker to want to approach or proceed with the goal or event. The influence of the negative and positive aspects create a conflict because the decision maker has to either proceed toward the goal or avoid the goal altogether. For example, the decision maker might approach proposing to a partner with excitement because of the positive aspects of marriage. On the other hand, he or she might avoid proposing due to the negative aspects of marriage.

The decision maker might initiate approach toward the goal, but as awareness of the negative factors increases, the desire to avoid the goal may arise, producing indecision. If there are competing feelings to a goal, the stronger of the two will triumph. For instance, if a person was thinking of starting a business they would be faced with positive and negative aspects. Before actually starting the business, the person would be excited about the prospects of success for the new business and they would encounter (approach) the positive aspects first: they would attract investors, create interest in their upcoming ideas and it would be a new challenge. However, as they drew closer to actually launching the business, the negative aspects would become more apparent; the person would acknowledge that it would require much effort, time, and energy from other aspects of their life. The increase in strength of these negative aspects (avoidance) would cause them to avoid the conflict or goal of starting the new business, which might result in indecision. Research pertaining to approach and avoidance conflicts has been extended into implicit [[Motivation|motive]]s, both abstract and social in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Boyd, R.L.|author2=Robinson, M.

[[Atheism]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|निरीश्वरवाद}},  {{IAST|''nir-īśvara-vāda''}}, lit. "statement of no [[Ishvara|Lord]]", "doctrine of godlessness") or disbelief in [[Deity|God or gods]] has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] streams of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-05-22/edit-page/28331091_1_god-acceptance-shankara |title = The Speaking Tree – The Atheistic Roots of Hindu Philosophy|work = [[The Times of India]]|date = 22 May 2004|last = Daga|first = Mahesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indian philosophy]], three schools of thought are commonly referred to as ''nastika'' for rejecting the doctrine of Vedas: [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Cārvāka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3215570/The-tradition-atheism-India-goes-2-000-years-m-proud-that.html|title=The tradition of atheism in India goes back 2,000 years. I'm proud to be a part of that|work = The Daily Mail |author = Palash Krishna Mehrotra|date = 29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinduism is a religion, but also a philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Make-space-for-true-values-of-Hinduism/articleshow/46972987.cms|title=Make space for true values of Hinduism|date = 19 April 2015|work = Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. ix, ''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning'' By Eva Rudy Jansen&lt;/ref&gt; Among the various schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] and [[Mimamsa]] while not rejecting either [[the Vedas]] or the [[Brahman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyo.in/lifestyle/atheism-schools-indian-philosophy-jainism-buddhism-materialism-religion-vedas/story/1/5904.html|title=Why Indian philosophy is incomplete without atheism|work = Daily O|date= 27 August 2015|author = Hari Ravikumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically reject a personal God, creator God, or a God with attributes. While Samkhya and Yoga rejected the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God, Mimamsa argued that the Vedas could not have been authored by a deity.

Though some schools of thought view the path of the atheist as difficult to follow in matters of [[spirituality]], it is still a valid one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chakravarti |first=Sitansu |title=Hinduism, a way of life |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=978-81-208-0899-7 |quote=According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is a very difficult one to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' ("pious, orthodox") refers to the systems of thought which admit the validity of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name="Pruthi"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Pruthi| title = Vedic civilization – Culture and civilization series| publisher = Discovery Publishing House| year = 2004| page = 214| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C&amp;pg=PA214| isbn = 978-81-7141-875-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit ''{{IAST|asti}}'' means "there is", and ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' (per [[Pāṇini]] 4.2.60) derives from the verb, meaning "one who says ''{{IAST|'asti'}}''". Technically, in [[Hindu philosophy]] the term {{IAST|[[Astika and Nastika|Āstika]]}} refers only to acceptance of authority of Vedas, not belief in the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kapoor| first = Subodh| title = The Systems of Indian Philosophy| publisher = Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd| page = 6| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA6| isbn = 978-81-7755-887-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though not accepted universally, ''{{IAST|Āstika}}'' is sometimes translated as "theist" and ''{{IAST|Nāstika}}'' as "[[atheist]]", assuming the rejection of Vedas to be synonymous to the rejection of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Monier-Williams|first1=Monier|last2=Leumann|first2=Ernst|last3=Cappeller|first3=Carl|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymological And Philologically Arranged With Special Reference To Cognate Indo-european Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUKaou4KcMC&amp;pg=PA161|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-0369-1|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation by [[Swami Vivekananda]] states "As certain religions of the world say that a man who does not believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, a man who does not believe in himself is an atheist. Not believing in the glory of our own soul is what the Vedanta calls atheism."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advaitaashrama.org/cw/volume_2/practical_vedanta_and_other_lectures/practical_vedanta_part_i.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==
The [[Rig Veda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]], deals with significant skepticism around the fundamental question of a creator God and the creation of the universe. It does not, at many instances, categorically accept the existence of a creator God. [[Nasadiya Sukta]] (''Creation   Hymn'') in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=World  scriptures: an   introduction to comparative religions| first=Kramer|   last=Kenneth| isbn=978-0-8091-2781-8|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzUAu-43W5oC&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Subodh Varma | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-06/vintage-wisdom/28377203_1_vedas-philosophy-speculation |title=The gods came afterwards |publisher=  [[Times of India]] |date= May 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation? &lt;br/&gt;The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.}}
The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]], [[Isha Upanishad|Isha]], [[Mundaka Upanishad|Mundaka]] (in which [[Brahman]] is everything and "no-thing") and especially the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]s have also been interpreted as atheistic because of their stress on the subjective self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bhatt| first = Chetan| title = Liberation and purity: race, new religious movements and the ethics of postmodernity| publisher = [[Routledge]]| year = 1997| page = 160| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VukJs0ik0rUC&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 978-1-85728-424-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mimamsa]] was a [[Philosophical realism|realistic]], pluralistic school of philosophy which was concerned with the [[exegesis]] of the Vedas.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"&gt;{{citation|last=Vitsaxis|first=Vassilis|title=Thought and Faith: The concept of divinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52b-A2l7QbwC&amp;pg=PA517|year=2009|publisher=Somerset Hall Press|isbn=978-1-935244-05-9|pages=517–518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core text of the school was the [[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]] of [[Jaimini]] (c. 200 BCE–200 CE). Mimamsa philosophers believed that the [[revelation]] of the Vedas was sacred, authorless (''[[apaurusheyatva]]'') and infallible, and that it was essential to preserve the sanctity of the Vedic ritual to maintain dharma (cosmic order).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{citation|last=King|first=Richard|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uca8R72W8iQC&amp;pg=PA52|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-0954-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}} As a consequence of the belief in sanctity of the ritual, Mimamsas rejected the notion of God in any form.&lt;ref name="Vitsaxis"/&gt; Later commentators of the Mimamsa sutras such as [[Prabhākara]] (c. 7th century CE) advanced arguments against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bales|first=Eugene F.|title=A Ready Reference to Philosophy East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34cjS0M1rFIC&amp;pg=PA198|year=1987|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-8191-6640-1|page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Warder|first=Anthony Kennedy|title=A Course In Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zw1UD1Mj9DwC&amp;pg=PA187|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1244-4|page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Mimamsa not only did not accept God but said that human action itself was enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1 = [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] |author2 = Poolla Tirupati Raju | title = The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy| publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin| year = 1960| page = 305| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uLsAAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the [[Samkhyakarika]] (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt;{{rp|63}} The Samkhyakarika is silent on the issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.&lt;ref name = nicholson&gt;{{cite book|last = Nicholson|first = Andrew J.|chapter = Hindu Disproofs of God: Refuting Vedāntic Theism in the Sāṃkhya Sūtra|title =  Oxford Handbook of Indian Philosophy|date = 2016|chapter-url = http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199314621-e-29|chapter-url-access = subscription|editor-first = Jonardon|editor-last = Ganeri |doi = 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.013.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cārvāka]], a materialistic and atheistic school of Indian philosophy, had developed a systematic philosophy by the 6th century CE. Cārvākas rejected metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], the [[afterlife]], an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate, and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Cārvākas also refused to ascribe supernatural causes to natural phenomena. Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna.

[[Ājīvika]]s was a movement (extinct from at least the 13th century CE) whose founder, [[Makkhali Gosala]], was a contemporary of Mahavira and [[Gautama Buddha]] (the central figures of Jainism and Buddhism, respectively). Gosala and his followers also denied the existence of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=History and Doctrines of the {{IAST|Ājīvikas}}: A Vanished Indian Religion|last = Balsham| first = B.L.|url = https://www.google.com/books?id=BiGQzc5lRGYC&amp;| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ| year = 2003| isbn = 81-208-1204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against God ==
Mimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the [[Veda]]s or a God to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious truth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further thought that the Gods named in the [[Veda]]s had no physical existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |first=Harold |last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Cowell|first1=E. B.|last2=Gough|first2=A. E.|title=The Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha or Review of the Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy: Trubner's Oriental Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkrCRbOq-HUC|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-24517-3 |pages=189–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:&lt;ref name="nicholson" /&gt;
* If the existence of [[Karma (Hinduism)|karma]] is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God's motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God's eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of [[prakriti]] and cannot be thought to grow in God. The testimony of the [[Vedas]], according to Samkhya, also confirms this notion.
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya's notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference and the testimony of the Vedas speak of prakriti as the origin of the world, not God.
Therefore, Samkhya maintained not only that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God, but that God as normally understood--an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent creator who is free from suffering--cannot exist.

[[Vidyaranya|Madhava Acharya]], the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called Sarvadarshansamgraha, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure. The first chapter is "Atheism"&amp;nbsp;– a very strong presentation of the argument in favor of atheism and materialism.}}

According to [[Markandey Katju]], former Chairman of the [[Press Council of India]] and former judge of the [[Supreme Court of India]], "...there are six classical systems of Indian philosophy, Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Sankya, Yoga, Purva Mimansa and Uttar Mimansa, and three non-classical systems, Buddhism, Jainism and Charvak. Out of these nine systems eight of them are atheistic as there is no place for God in them. Only the ninth one, that is Uttar Mimansa, which is also called Vedanta, has a place for God in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justicekatju.blogspot.com/2012/02/what-is-india.html |title=What is India?

A '''bēot''' is [[Old English]] for a ritualized boast, vow, threat, or promise.&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einarsson|first1=Stefán|title=Old English ''Beot'' and Old Icelandic ''Heitstrenging''|journal=PMLA|date=1934|volume=49|issue=4|pages=980|JSTOR=458120|doi=10.2307/458120|quote=For these and other instances of different meaning, see the dictionaries. They give three chief meanings: (1) a threatening, menace; (2) danger; and (3) boasting promise. It seems that the third one is the most usual, and logically the meanings would seem to have developed in the order: promise—boasting—threatening—danger.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hall 1960 p42"&gt;[[Clark Hall, John R.]] ''A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary''. Cambridge University Press, 1960, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of a ''bēot'' is to proclaim one's acceptance of a seemingly impossible challenge in order to gain tremendous glory for actually accomplishing it.

Anglo-Saxon warriors would usually deliver ''bēot''s in the [[mead hall]] the night before a military engagement&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 976-978&lt;/ref&gt; or during the battle itself.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 978-979&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a typical warrior may boast that he will be the first to strike a blow in a battle, that he would claim a renowned sword from an enemy warrior as spoil of battle, that he will slay a particular monster that has been wreaking havoc on a town or village, and so on. ''Bēot''s were usually accompanied by grand stories of one's past glorious deeds. Although other cultures and times might disdain boasting as a sign of arrogance, or sinful pride, the pagan Anglo-Saxons highly regarded such behavior as a positive sign of one's determination, bravery, and character.

Examples of the ''bēot'' can be seen throughout the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', such as when Beowulf vows to fight [[Grendel]] without using any weapons or armor.&lt;ref&gt;Einarsson, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Old English]] word ''bēot'' comes from earlier ''bíhát'' meaning ‘promise’. The original noun-form of ''bēot'' corresponds to the verb ''bi-'', ''be-ˈhátan''. A shifting of the stress from ''bíhát'' to ''bi-ˈhát'', on analogy of the verb, gave the late [[Old English]] ''beˈhát'', from which the [[Middle English]] word ''behote'' derives.&lt;ref&gt;http://oed.com/view/Entry/17815?redirectedFrom=beot# Retrieved 06FEB2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of a ''bēot''==
# '''Pledge''' - The individual pledges to endeavor a specific challenge&lt;ref&gt;[[Beowulf]], lines 679-685&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2510-2525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Einarsson 1934 p975-976"&gt;Einarsson, 1934, p. 975-976, "In both instances we have to do with a solemn promise to carry out a feat—a fight—under very difficult circumstances, partly self-imposed to add glory"&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Speculation of outcomes''' - The individual predicts two possible outcomes—success or failure—and elaborates the effects of either outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, line 687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2535-2537&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Commissioning to a higher power''' - The individual commissions the outcome of the challenge to a higher power (e.g. ''God'', ''fate'').&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 685-687&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beowulf, lines 2526-2527&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bowman–Heidenhain''' hypothesis is an early explanation of [[renal function]] and [[urinary]] [[secretion]]. 

The hypothesis states that the [[kidney]] is first and foremost a secreting [[gland]]. According to the theory, [[glomeruli]] are merely filters, while the [[tubules]] are the true secretory structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Experimental pharmacology| last=McGuigan| first=Hugh| publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger| year=1919| page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove his [[hypothesis]], Rudolph Heidenhain injected [[methylene blue]] into an animal's [[bloodstream]], which soon appeared in the [[urine]]. More evident proof of this theory is that when the tubules are destroyed, urine becomes watery and [[urea]] and other toxic products remain in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Examination of the urine| author=George Alexander de Santos Saxe| year=1904| publisher=W.B. Saunders &amp; Co.| page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This theory was later merged with the [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig theory]] to form the modern theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bowman-Heidenhain+theory|title=Bowman-Heidenhain theory|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==

===Localization===
Various molecular, genetic and imaging studies have been conducted as for the localization of the CPGs. The results have shown that the networks responsible for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(03)00091-1 |vauthors=Kiehn O, Butt SJ |title=Physiological, anatomical and genetic identification of CPG neurons in the developing mammalian spinal cord |journal=Prog.

Rev. Neurosci. |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=239–66 |year=2003 |pmid=12598679 |pmc=2811316 |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.26.041002.131103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatomy===
Although anatomical details of CPGs are specifically known in only a few cases, they have been shown to originate from the spinal cords of various vertebrates and to depend on relatively small and autonomous neural networks (rather than the entire nervous system) to generate rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuo"/&gt; Many studies have been done to determine the [[Neural substrate of locomotor central pattern generators in mammals|neural substrate of locomotor CPGs in mammals]].  Neural rhythmicity can arise in two ways: "through interactions among neurons (network-based rhythmicity) or through interactions among currents in individual neurons (endogenous oscillator neurons)".&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; A key to understanding rhythm generation is the concept of a half-center oscillator (HCO). A half-center oscillator consists of two neurons that have no rhythmogenic ability individually, but produce rhythmic outputs when reciprocally coupled. Half-center oscillators can function in a variety of ways. First, the two neurons may not necessarily fire in antiphase and can fire in any relative phasing, even synchrony, depending on the synaptic release. Second, half-centers can also function in an "escape" mode or a "release" mode. Escape and release refer to the way the off-neuron turns on: by escape or release from inhibition. Half-center oscillators can also be altered by intrinsic and network properties and can have dramatically different functionality based on variations in synaptic properties.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

The classical view of CPGs, as specific networks of neurons dedicated to this function alone, has been challenged by numerous data obtained mostly on the central nervous system of invertebrates. In addition to be classical dedicated networks, most of the CPGs seem in fact to be either reorganizing or distributed circuits, and a single neural circuit can combine features typical of each of these architectures. The observation in invertebrates of pattern generators temporarily formed before the production of motor activity strengthens the assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jean A |title=Brain stem control of swallowing: neuronal network and cellular mechanisms |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=929–69 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11274347 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11274347|doi=10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPG circuits appear thus to have a flexible character.

===Neuromodulation===
Organisms must adapt their behavior to meet the needs of their internal and external environments. Central pattern generators, as part of the neural circuitry of an organism, can be modulated to adapt to the organism's needs and surroundings. Three roles of [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] have been found for CPG circuits:&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;
#Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
#Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
#Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities

*Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
For example, the ''[[Tritonia diomedea]]'' swimming CPG can produce reflexive withdrawal in response to weak sensory input, escape swimming in response to strong sensory input and crawling after escape swimming has ceased. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the swim CPGs not only cause the rhythmic escape swimming, but also connect to cilia-activating efferent neurons. Experimental evidence confirms that both behaviors are mediated by the DSIs. "Given the extreme differences between these behaviors—-rhythmic versus tonic, muscular versus ciliary, and brief versus prolonged—these findings reveal a striking versatility for a small multifunctional network."&lt;ref name="Popescu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Popescu IR, Frost WN |title=Highly dissimilar behaviors mediated by a multifunctional network in the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea |journal=J.

Application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the network from producing the swimming pattern, and hence this intranetwork modulation appears essential for network oscillation."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

*Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
Data from experiments by Harris-Warrick in 1991 and Hooper and Marder in 1987 suggest that the functional target of modulation is the entire CPG network. These phenomena were first observed through experiments with the [[neuromodulator]] in the lobster cardiac ganglion (Sullivan and Miller 1984). The effect of [[proctolin]] could not be understood by looking only at the neurons it directly affected. "Instead, neurons that are not directly affected both alter the response of the directly affected neurons and help to transmit the changes in the activity of these neurons throughout the network," allowing the entire network to change in consistent and synchronized way.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Harris-Warrick and colleagues have conducted many studies over the years of the effects of neuromodulators on CPG neural networks. For example, a 1998 study showed the distributed nature of neuromodulation and that neuromodulators can reconfigure a motor network to allow a family of related movements. Specifically, dopamine was shown to affect both individual neurons, and synapses between neurons. Dopamine strengthens some synapses and weakens others by acting pre- and post-synaptically throughout the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. These responses, as well as other effects of dopamine, can be opposite in sign in different locations, showing that the sum of the effects is the overall network effect and can cause the CPG to produce related families of different motor outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09046.x |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Johnson BR, Peck JH, Kloppenburg P, Ayali A, Skarbinski J |title=Distributed effects of dopamine modulation in the crustacean pyloric network |journal=Ann.

*Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities.
A single neuronal network, such as a central pattern generator, can be modulated moment-to-moment to produce several different physical actions depending on the needs of the animal. These were first coined "polymorphic networks" by Getting and Dekin in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Marder E |title=Modulation of neural networks for behavior |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=39–57 |year=1991 |pmid=2031576 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one such polymorphic central pattern generator is a multifunctional network of the mollusk ''Tritonia diomedea''. As described by Hooper, weak sensory input to the swimming CPG produces reflexive withdrawal, while strong input produces swimming. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the circuit release serotonin to convert to "swim mode," while application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the swim pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Additionally, the same single interneuronal network has been found to produce not only "rhythmic, muscle-based escape swimming," but also "nonrhythmic, cilia-mediated crawling." Evidence also suggests that although the CPG controls related but separate functions, neuromodulation of one function can occur without affecting the other. For example, the swim mode can be sensitized by serotonin without affecting the crawl mode. Thus, the CPG circuit can control many separate functions with the appropriate neuromodulation.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt;

===Feedback mechanism===
Although the theory of central pattern generation calls for basic rhythmicity and patterning to be centrally generated, CPGs can respond to sensory feedback to alter the patterning in behaviorally appropriate ways. Alteration of the pattern is difficult because feedback received during only one phase may require changed movement in the other parts of the patterned cycle to preserve certain coordination relationships. For example, walking with a pebble in the right shoe alters the entire gait, even though the stimulus is only present while standing on the right foot. Even during the time when the left foot is down and the sensory feedback is inactive, action is taken to prolong the right leg swing and extend the time on the left foot, leading to limping. This effect could be due to widespread and long-lasting effects of the sensory feedback on the CPG or due to short-term effects on a few neurons that in turn modulate nearby neurons and spread the feedback through the entire CPG in that way. Some degree of [[#Neuromodulation|modulation]] is required to allow one CPG to assume multiple states in response to feedback.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Additionally, the effect of the sensory input varies depending on the phase of the pattern in which it occurs. For example, during walking, resistance to the top of the swinging foot (e.g., by a horizontal stick) causes the foot to be lifted higher to move over the stick. However, the same input to the standing foot cannot cause the foot to lift or the person would collapse. Thus, depending on the phase, the same sensory input can cause the foot to be lifted higher or held more firmly to the ground.  "This change in motor response as a function of motor pattern phase is called reflex reversal, and has been observed in invertebrates (DiCaprio and Clarac, 1981) and vertebrates (Forssberg et al., 1977). How this process occurs is poorly understood, but again two possibilities exist. One is that sensory input is appropriately routed to different CPG neurons as a function of motor pattern phase. The other is that the input reaches the same neurons at all phases, but that, as a consequence of the way in which the network transforms the input, network response varies appropriately as a function of motor pattern phase."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

A recent study by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking (a CPG controlled function) in response to changes in head pitch. This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location of the head and body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, tilted up or tilted down. Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head tilted down. This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottschall JS, Nichols TR |title=Head pitch affects muscle activity in the decerebrate cat hindlimb during walking |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=182 |issue=1 |pages=131–5 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17690872 |doi=10.1007/s00221-007-1084-z |pmc=3064865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Central pattern generators can serve many functions in vertebrate animals. CPGs can play roles in movement, breathing, rhythm generation and other [[neural oscillation|oscillatory]] functions. The sections below focus on specific examples of locomotion and rhythm generation, two key functions of CPGs.

===Locomotion===
As early as 1911, it was recognized, by the experiments of [[Thomas Graham Brown]], that the basic pattern of stepping can be produced by the spinal cord without the need of descending commands from the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0077 |author=Graham-Brown, T. |title=The intrinsic factors in the act of progression in the mammal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B |volume=84 |issue=572 |pages=308–319 |year=1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whelan PJ |title=Developmental aspects of spinal locomotor function: insights from using the in vitro mouse spinal cord preparation |journal=J.

The first modern evidence of the central pattern generator was produced by isolating the locust nervous system and showing that it could produce a rhythmic output in isolation resembling that of the locust in flight. This was discovered by Wilson in 1961.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Since that time, evidence has arisen for the presence of central pattern generators in vertebrate animals, starting with work on the cat in the 1960s by Elzbieta Jankowska in Gothenburg, who provided the first evidence for a spinal cord CPG. This section addresses the role of the central pattern generator in locomotion for the [[lamprey]] and humans.

The lamprey has been used as a model for vertebrate CPGs because, while its nervous system has a vertebrate organization, it shares many positive characteristics with invertebrates. When removed from the lamprey, the intact spinal cord can survive for days ''in vitro''. It also has very few neurons and can be easily stimulated to produce a fictive swimming motion indicative of a central pattern generator. As early as 1983, Ayers, Carpenter, Currie and Kinch proposed that there was a CPG responsible for most undulating movements in the lamprey including swimming forward and backward, burrowing in the mud and crawling on a solid surface, that although not surprisingly did not match the activity in the intact animal, nevertheless provided the basic locomotor output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayers, J., Carpenter, G.A, Currie, S. and Kinch, J. |title=Which behavior does the lamprey central motor program mediate? |journal=Science |volume=221 |pages=1312–1314 |date=Sep 1983 |pmid=6137060|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/221/4617/1312.long |doi=10.1126/science.6137060 |issue=4617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different movements have been found to be altered by neuromodulators, including serotonin in a study by Harris-Warrick and Cohen in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick R, Cohen A (1985) Serotonin modulates the central pattern generator for locomotion in the isolated lamprey spinal cord.

The lamprey model of CPG for locomotion has been important to the study of CPGs. Although Sten Grillner claims that the locomotor network is characterised, a claim that has seemingly been uncritically accepted by the spinal cord locomotor network field, there are in fact many missing details and Grillner cannot provide the evidence he uses to support his claims (Parker 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2006 | title = Complexities and uncertainties of neuronal network function | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1779 | pmid = 16553310 | journal =  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 361 | issue = 1465| pages = 81–99 | pmc = 1626546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2010 | title = Neuronal network analyses: premises, promises and uncertainties | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 365 | issue = 1551| pages = 2315–2328 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0043| pmid = 20603354 | pmc = 2894952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general scheme of the lamprey CPG is now being used in the creation of artificial CPGs.  For example, Ijspeert and Kodjabachian used Ekeberg's model for the lamprey to create artificial CPGs and simulate swimming movements in a lamprey-like substrate using controllers based on a SGOCE encoding.&lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, Auke Jan and Jerome Kodjabachian "Evolution and development of a central pattern generator for the swimming of a lamprey."

Connections between the CPGs controlling each limb influence the coordination between the limbs and hence the gaits in quadrupedal and possibly also bipedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danner|first1=Simon M.|last2=Wilshin|first2=Simon D.|last3=Shevtsova|first3=Natalia A.|last4=Rybak|first4=Ilya A.|title=Central control of interlimb coordination and speed-dependent gait expression in quadrupeds|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 December 2016|volume=594|issue=23|pages=6947–6967|doi=10.1113/JP272787|pmid=27633893|pmc=5134391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left right coordination is mediated by commissural and fore-hind by long-projecting propiospinal interneurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellardita|first1=Carmelo|last2=Kiehn|first2=Ole|title=Phenotypic Characterization of Speed-Associated Gait Changes in Mice Reveals Modular Organization of Locomotor Networks|journal=Current Biology|date=June 2015|volume=25|issue=11|pages=1426–1436|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.005|pmid=25959968|pmc=4469368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of the left-right alternation (mediated genetically identified V0d and V0v neuron classes) to left-synchronization promoting commissural interneurons (potentially mediated V3 neurons) determines whether walk and trot (alternating gaits) or gallop and bound (synchronous gaits) are expressed. This balance changes with increasing speed, potentially because of connection from the MLR to commissural interneurons, and causes speed dependent gait transitions characteristic for quadrupedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt; The walk to trot transition potentially occurs because of the stronger decrease of extension than flexion phase durations with increasing locomotor speed, which leads to progressively increasing overlap between the diagonal limbs up until diagonal synchronization (trot).&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt;

Central pattern generators also contribute to locomotion in higher animals and humans. In 1994, Calancie, et al. claimed to have witnessed the "first well-defined example of a central rhythm generator for stepping in the adult human." The subject was a 37-year-old male who suffered an injury to the cervical spinal cord 17 years prior. After initial total paralysis below the neck, the subject eventually regained some movement of the arms and fingers and limited movement in the lower limbs. He had not recovered sufficiently to support his own weight. After 17 years, the subject found that when lying supine and extending his hips, his lower extremities underwent step-like movements for as long as he remained lying down. "The movements (i) involved alternating flexion and extension of his hips, knees, and ankles; (ii) were smooth and rhythmic; (iii) were forceful enough that the subject soon became uncomfortable due to excessive muscle 'tightness' and an elevated body temperature; and (iv) could not be stopped by voluntary effort." After extensive study of the subject, the experimenters concluded that "these data represent the clearest evidence to date that such a [CPG] network does exist in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calancie B, Needham-Shropshire B, Jacobs P, Willer K, Zych G, Green BA |title=Involuntary stepping after chronic spinal cord injury.

These measurements were performed in supine position, thus minimizing peripheral feedback. Subsequent studies showed that these lumbar locomotor centers can form a large variety of rhythmic movements by combining and distributing stereotypical patterns to the numerous lower limb muscles.&lt;ref name=Danner2105 /&gt;

====Neuromechanical control of locomotion in mammals====
If step cycle durations and muscle activations were fixed, it wouldn't be possible to change body velocity and adapt to varying terrain.   It has been suggested that the [[mammalian]] locomotor CPG comprises a “timer” (possibly in the form of coupled oscillators) which generates step cycles of varying durations, and a “[[pattern formation]] layer,” which selects and grades the activation of [[motor pools]].&lt;ref name="Rybak IA, Shevtsova NA, Lafreniere-Roula M, McCrea DA 2006 617–39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perret C, Cabelguen JM |title= Main characteristics of the hindlimb locomotor cycle in the decorticate cat with special reference to bifunctional muscles |journal= Brain Research |volume=187 |issue= 2 |pages=333–352|year=1980 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(80)90207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing the neural drive from the midbrain locomotor region (MLR) to the spinal CPG increases the step cycle frequency (the cadence).&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shik ML, Severin FV, Orlovsky GN |title= Control of walking and running by means of electrical stimulation of the mid-brain |journal= Biophysics |volume=11 |pages=756–765|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swing and stance phase durations co-vary in a fairly fixed relationship, with stance phases changing more than swing phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goslow GE Jr. |author2=Reinking RM |author3=Stuart DG |title= The cat step cycle: hind limb joint angles and muscle lengths during unrestrained locomotion. |journal= Journal of Morphology |volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=1–41|year=1973 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1051410102|pmid=4727469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory input from the limbs may truncate or extend individual phase durations in a process akin to finite state control (in which "if-then” rules determine when state transitions occur).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cruse H |title= What mechanisms coordinate leg movement in walking arthropods? |journal= Trends in Neurosciences |volume=13 |issue= 1 |pages=15–21|year=1990 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(90)90057-h|pmid= 1688670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemami H, Tomovic R, Ceranowicz AZ |title= Finite state control of planar bipeds with application to walking and sitting.  |journal= Journal of Bioengineering |volume=2 |pages=477–494|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Prochazka A|title= Comparison of natural and artificial control of movement|journal= IEEE Trans Rehab Eng |volume=1 |pages=7–17|year=1993 |doi=10.1109/86.242403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a limb that is swinging forward reaches the end of swing in less time than the current CPG-generated flexor phase duration, sensory input would cause the CPG timer to terminate swing and start the stance phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiebert GW, Whelan PJ, Prochazka A, Pearson KG |title= Contribution of hind limb flexor muscle afferents to the timing of phase transitions in the cat step cycle |journal= Journal of Neurophysiology |volume=75 |pages=1126–1137|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as body velocity increases, the pattern formation layer would increase muscle activation nonlinearly to provide increased load-bearing and thrust forces. It has been posited that in well-predicted movements, CPG-generated phase durations and muscle forces closely match those required by the evolving biomechanical events, minimizing the sensory corrections required. The term ‘‘neuromechanical tuning’’ has been coined to describe this process &lt;ref name="P&amp;Y"/&gt;

[[File:Locomotor CPG schematic.jpg|thumb|right|750px| Fig. 1. Schematic of the locomotor central pattern generator in the mammalian nervous system. A command signal specifying increasing body velocity descends from deep brain nuclei via the MLR to the spinal cord and drives the timing element of the spinal locomotor CPG to generate cycles of increasing cadence. Extensor phase durations change more than flexor phase durations. The command signal also drives the pattern formation layer to generate cyclical activation of flexor and extensor motoneurons.  Loading of the activated muscles (e.g. supporting the moving body mass) is resisted by the muscles' intrinsic spring-like properties. This is equivalent to displacement feedback.  Force and displacement sensed by [[muscle spindle]] and [[Golgi tendon organ]] afferents reflexly activate motoneurons. A key role of these afferents is to adjust the timing of phase transitions, presumably by influencing or overriding the CPG timer. Modified from &lt;ref name="P&amp;E"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Prochazka A, Ellaway PH |chapter= Sensory systems in the control of movement  |title= Comprehensive Physiology, Supplement 29: Handbook of Physiology, Exercise: Regulation and Integration of Multiple Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons in conjunction with the American Physiological Society |location=NY |year=2012 |pages=2615‐2627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fig. 1 provides a simplified schematic that summarizes these proposed mechanisms. A command specifying desired body velocity descends from higher centers to the MLR, which drives the spinal locomotor CPG. The CPG timer produces the appropriate cadence and phase durations and the pattern formation layer modulates the motoneuronal outputs.&lt;ref name="P&amp;E"/&gt;  The activated muscles resist stretch through their own intrinsic biomechanical properties, providing a rapid form of length and velocity feedback control. Reflexes mediated by [[Golgi tendon organ]] and other afferents provide additional load compensation, but the main role of sensory input may be to adjust or override the CPG at stance-swing-stance transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donelan JM, McVea DA, Pearson KG |title= Force regulation of ankle extensor muscle activity in freely walking cats |journal= J Neurophysiol |volume=101 |issue= 1 |pages=360–371|year=2009 |doi=10.1152/jn.90918.2008|pmid= 19019974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[#Neuromodulation|Neuromodulation]], the human locomotive CPG is very adaptable and can respond to sensory input. It receives input from the brainstem as well as from the environment to keep the network regulated. Newer studies have not only confirmed the presence of the CPG for human locomotion, but also confirmed its robustness and adaptability. For example, Choi and Bastian showed that the networks responsible for human walking are adaptable on short and long timescales. They showed adaptation to different gait patterns and different walking contexts. Also, they showed that different motor patterns can adapt independently. Adults could even walk on treadmills going in a different direction for each leg. This study showed that independent networks control forward and backward walking and that networks controlling each leg can adapt independently and be trained to walk independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi JT, Bastian AJ |title=Adaptation reveals independent control networks for human walking |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=1055–62 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17603479 |doi=10.1038/nn1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, humans also possess a central pattern generator for locomotion that is capable not only of rhythmic pattern generation but also remarkable adaptation and usefulness in a wide variety of situations.

===Respiration===
A three-phase model is the classical view of the respiratory CPG. The phases of the respiratory CPG are characterized by the rhythmic activity of: (1) the phrenic nerve during inspiration; (2) recurrent laryngeal nerve branches that innervate the thyroarytenoid muscle during the last stage of expiration; (3) the internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate the triangularis sterni muscle during the second stage of expiration. The rhythmicity of these nerves is classically viewed as originating from a single rhythm generator. In this model, phasing is produced by reciprocal synaptic inhibition between groups of sequentially active interneurons.

Nevertheless, an alternative model has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Janczewski WA, Feldman JL |title=Distinct rhythm generators for inspiration and expiration in the juvenile rat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=570 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=407–20 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16293645 |pmc=1464316 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.098848 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16293645}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by certain experimental data. According to this model, respiratory rhythm is generated by two coupled anatomically distinct rhythm generators, one in the [[pre-Boetzinger complex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1683005 |vauthors=Smith JC, Ellenberger HH, Ballanyi K, Richter DW, Feldman JL |title=Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5032 |pages=726–9 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1683005 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1683005 |pmc=3209964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in the [[retrotrapezoid nucleus]] / parafacial [[respiratory group]]. Further survey provided evidence to the hypothesis that one of the networks is responsible for inspiration rhythm and the other for expiration rhythm. Therefore, inspiration and expiration are distinct functions and one does not induce the other, as is the common belief, but one of two dominates the behavior by generating a faster rhythm.

===Swallowing===
Swallowing involves the coordinated contraction of more than 25 pairs of muscles in the oropharynx, larynx and esophagus, which are active during an oropharyngeal phase, followed by the primary esophageal peristalsis. Swallowing depends on a CPG located in the medulla oblongata, which involves several brain stem motor nuclei and two main groups of interneurons: a dorsal swallowing group (DSG) in the [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] and a ventral swallowing group (VSG) located in the ventrolateral medulla above the nucleus ambiguus. Neurons in the DSG are responsible for the generation of the swallowing pattern, while those in the VSG distribute the commands to the various motoneuronal pools. As in other CPGs, the functioning of the central network can be modulated by peripheral and central inputs, so that the swallowing pattern is adapted to the size of the bolus.

Within this network, central inhibitory connections play a major role, producing a rostrocaudal inhibition that parallels the rostrocaudal anatomy of the swallowing tract. Thus, when the neurons controlling the proximal parts of the tract are active, those that command more distal parts are inhibited. Apart from the type of connection between the neurons, intrinsic properties of the neurons, especially those of NTS neurons, probably also contribute to the shaping and timing of the swallowing pattern.

The swallowing CPG is a flexible CPG. This means that at least some of the swallowing neurons may be multifunctional neurons and belong to pools of neurons that are common to several CPGs. One such CPG is the respiratory one, which has been observed interacting with the swallowing CPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dick TE, Oku Y, Romaniuk JR, Cherniack NS |title=Interaction between central pattern generators for breathing and swallowing in the cat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=465 |pages=715–30 |date=June 1993 |pmid=8229859 |pmc=1175455 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8229859 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grélot L, Barillot JC, Bianchi AL |title=Pharyngeal motoneurones: respiratory-related activity and responses to laryngeal afferents in the decerebrate cat |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=336–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2599043 |doi=10.1007/bf00228905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhythm generators===
Central pattern generators can also play a role in rhythm generation for other functions in vertebrate animals. For example, the rat vibrissa system uses an unconventional CPG for whisking movements. "Like other CPGs, the whisking generator can operate without cortical input or sensory feedback. However, unlike other CPGs, vibrissa motoneurons actively participate in rhythmogenesis by converting tonic serotonergic inputs into the patterned motor output responsible for movement of the vibrissae."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer NP, Li Y, Keller A |title=The whisking rhythm generator: a novel mammalian network for the generation of movement |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=2148–58 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17202239 |pmc=1821005 |doi=10.1152/jn.01187.2006 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17202239|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.9770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathing is another non-locomotive function of central pattern generators. For example, larval amphibians accomplish gas exchange largely through rhythmic ventilation of the gills. A study by Broch, et al. showed that lung ventilation in the tadpole brainstem may be driven by a pacemaker-like mechanism, whereas the respiratory CPG adapts in the adult bullfrog as it matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broch L, Morales RD, Sandoval AV, Hedrick MS |title=Regulation of the respiratory central pattern generator by chloride-dependent inhibition during development in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=205 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1161–9 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11919275 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11919275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, CPGs hold a broad range of functions in the vertebrate animal and are widely adaptable and variable with age, environment and behavior.

===Mechanism of rhythmic generators: post-inhibitory rebound===

Rhythmicity in CPG's can also result from time-dependent cellular properties such as adaptation, delayed excitation, and post-inhibitory rebound (PIR). PIR is an intrinsic property that elicits rhythmic electrical activity by depolarizing the membrane once hyperpolarizing stimulus is gone. "It can be produced by several mechanisms including hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) or deinactivation of depolarization-activated inward currents" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Angstadt JD, Grassmann JL, Theriault KM, Levasseur SM |title=Mechanisms of postinhibitory rebound and its modulation by serotonin in excitatory swim motor neurons of the medicinal leech |journal=J. Comp. Physiol. A |volume=191 |issue=8 |pages=715–32 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15838650 |doi=10.1007/s00359-005-0628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once inhibition has ceased, this period of PIR can be explained as the time with increased neuronal excitability. It is the property of many CNS neurons that sometimes results in action potential "bursts" following immediately after inhibitory synaptic input."Because of this, it has been suggested that PIR may contribute to the maintenance of oscillatory activity in neural networks that are characterized by mutual inhibitory connections, like those involved in locomotor behaviors. In addition, PIR is often included as an element in computational models of neural networks that involve mutual inhibition" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.185.4146.181 |vauthors=Perkel DH, Mulloney B |title=Motor pattern production in reciprocally inhibitory neurons exhibiting postinhibitory rebound |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4146 |pages=181–3 |date=July 1974 |pmid=4834220 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4834220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the "PIR in crayfish stretch receptor neurons is caused by recovery from adaptation during the course of inhibitory hyperpolarization. One feature of that system is that PIR only occurs if the hyperpolarization is imposed on a background of excitation, caused in this case by stretch. They also found that PIR can be elicited in the stretch receptor by hyperpolarizing current pulses. This was an important finding because it showed that PIR is an intrinsic property of the postsynaptic neuron, related to the membrane potential change associated with inhibition but independent of transmitter receptors or presynaptic properties. The latter conclusion has stood the test of time, marking PIR as a robust property of CNS neurons in a wide variety of contexts." &lt;ref&gt;Gerasimov, V. D., P. G. Kostyuk, and V. A. Maiskii. 1966. "Reactions of giant neurons to break of hyperpolarizing current" Fed. Proc. Transl. Suppl, 25T438-T442&lt;/ref&gt;
This cellular property can most easily be seen in the Lamprey neural circuit. The swimming movement is produced by alternating neural activity between the left and right side of the body, causing it to bend back and forth while creating oscillating movements. While the Lamprey is bent to the left, there is reciprocal inhibition on the right side causing it to relax due to hyperpolarization. Immediately after this hyperopolarizing stimulus, the interneurons use post-inhibitory rebound to initiate activity in the right side. Depolarization of the membrane causes it to contract while reciprocal inhibition is now applied to the left side.

===Functions in invertebrates===
As described earlier, CPGs can also function in a variety of ways in invertebrate animals. In the mollusc ''Tritonia'', a CPG modulates reflexive withdrawal, escape swimming and crawling.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; CPGs are also used in flight in locusts and for respiration systems in other insects.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Central pattern generators play a broad role in all animals and show amazing variability and adaptability in almost all cases.

===Other theories===
The classical view of movement control prior to works of Brown attributed the function of muscle pattern generation largely to sensory feedback mechanisms. In this light, the pattern generator can be considered as an intrinsic spinal processor that corrects imperfect sensory feedback and adapts central input to this optimized peripheral input.&lt;ref&gt;Kuo AD (2002) The relative roles of feedforward and feedback in the control of rhythmic movements. Motor Control 6:129-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry &amp; R.L. Tremblay, “Comparative advertising: perspectives and issues”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1975, pp. 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

This should not be confused with [[parody advertisement]]s, where a fictional product is being advertised for the purpose of poking fun at the particular advertisement, nor should it be confused with the use of a coined brand name for the purpose of comparing the product  without actually naming an actual competitor.  ("[[Wikipedia]] tastes better and is less filling than the [[Encyclopedia Galactica]].")

In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) defined comparative advertising as “advertisement that compares alternative brands on objectively measurable attributes or price, and identifies the alternative brand by name, illustration or other distinctive information.”&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission Commercial Practice Rule 16 CFR §14.15 n 1 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was used in the case [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette Australia Pty Ltd]] v [[Energizer Holdings|Energizer Australia Pty Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;(2002) 193 ALR 629&lt;/ref&gt;   Similarly, the [[Law Council of Australia]] recently suggested that comparative advertising refers to “advertising which include reference to a competitor’s trademark in a way which does not impute proprietorship in the mark to the advertiser.”&lt;ref&gt;P. Armitage in M.A. Murphy, “Legal aspects of comparative advertising and a strategy for its use”,
Queensland University of Technology law journal, Vol. 12, 1996, pp. 41-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative advertisements could be either indirectly or directly comparative, positive or negative, and seeks “to associate or differentiate the two competing brands”.&lt;ref&gt;B. Mills, “Comparative advertising: should it be allowed?”, European Intellectual Property Review, Vol. 17, No. 9, 1995, pp. 417-430.&lt;/ref&gt; Different countries apply differing views regarding the laws on comparative advertising.

==History==
The earliest court case concerning comparative advertising dates back to 1910 in the United States – Saxlehner v Wagner.&lt;ref&gt;16 US 375, 30 S.Ct. 298, 54 L.ED 525 (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Mills, “Comparative advertising: should it be allowed?”, European Intellectual Property Review, Vol. 17, No. 9, 1995, pp. 417-430.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1970s, comparative advertising was deemed unfeasible due to related risks. For instance, comparative advertising could invite misidentification of products, potential legal issues, and may even win public sympathy for their competitors as victims.

In 1972, the FTC began to encourage advertisers to make comparison with named competitors, with the broad, public welfare objective of creating more informative advertising.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative advertising wars: an historical analysis of their causes and consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC argued that this form of advertising could also stimulate comparison shopping, encourage product improvement and innovation, and foster a positive competitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Beck-Dudley &amp; T.G. Williams, “Legal and public policy implications for the future of comparative advertising: a look at U-Haul v Jartran”, Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, Vol. 8, No. 1, 1989, pp. 124-142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have shown that while comparative advertisements had increased since 1960, the relative amount of comparative advertising is still small.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Jackson Jr., S.W. Brown &amp; R.R. Harmon, “Comparative magazine advertisements”, Journal of Advertising Research, Vol. 19, No. 6, 1979, pp.21-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

=== European Union ===
Prior to 1997, many European countries severely limited comparative claims as an advertising practice. For example, in [[Germany]] comparisons in advertising had since the 1930's&lt;ref&gt;Bundesgerichtshof, ''Hellegold,'' GRUR 1931, 1299 ff., 1300; the German Supreme Court based its decision on the two grounds, namely that no one should be required to tolerate being another’s promotional tool, and that comparative advertising effectively permitted the advertiser "judge their own case".

&lt;/ref&gt; been largely prohibited as an anti-competitive practice, with very limited exceptions for cases where the advertiser had a good reason for presenting a critical claim, and reference to a competitor was necessary in order to present that claim.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesgerichtshof, ''Tauchkühler'', GRUR 1970, 422 

&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, this only applied to ''critical'' claims - claims of equivalence were completely prohibited. A similar approach had been adopted in [[France]], where comparative advertising was commonly seen as disparaging of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Biolay, Publicité comparative, 902 Juris-classeur Concurrence Consommation 6 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legalisation of comparative advertising in France in 1992&lt;ref&gt;The Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) had permitted comparative advertising since 1986, Cass. com., July 22, 1986. The principles set out by the Court were codified by Law 92-60 of 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;, opened the door to a general legalisation of comparative advertising through EU law, which had first been proposed by the [[European Commission]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''Official Journal of the European Union'', No C 70, 21. 3. 1978, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the adoption of [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 97/55/EC, which came into force in the year 2000. The relevant provisions are now contained in Directive 2006/114/EC.

This Directive sets out rules that comparative advertising must comply with in order to be considered permissible.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 4 of Directive 2006/114/EC&lt;/ref&gt; These include the requirements that the comparison concern goods and services that meet the same purpose, that it objectively compare the relevant characteristics of the products concerned and that it not cause confusion or denigrate the trademarks and other distinguishing signs of competitors. The Directive prohibits comparisons that take unfair advantage of the reputation of a competitor's distinguishing marks, or present goods or services as imitations of products covered by a protected trade mark or trade name. Additionally, any comparison aimed at promoting goods bearing a [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected designation of origin]] must refer exclusively to other goods bearing the same designation.&lt;ref&gt;The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has held that this does not preclude advertising promoting other types of goods from referring to goods with a designation of origin, as long as this does not result in a taking of unfair advantage; ''De Landtsheer Emmanuel SA v. Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne'', Case C-381/05.&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 2006/114/EC constitutes a total harmonisation of the rules on comparative advertising, meaning that the Member States are neither allowed to permit comparisons that breach the requirements of the Directive, nor prohibit ones that do.&lt;ref&gt;Article 8(1) Directive 2006/114/EC&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further, while trademark rights can in principle be used to prevent comparative advertising that makes unauthorised use of a competitor's trademark&lt;ref&gt;O2 Holdings Limited v Hutchison 3G UK Limited, Case C‑533/06, paragraph 36&lt;/ref&gt;, this is not the case where the comparative advertisement complies with all the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC.&lt;ref&gt;O2 Holdings Limited v Hutchison 3G UK Limited, Case C‑533/06, paragraph 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimate comparative advertising must therefore be seen as an exception to the exclusive rights of the trademark proprietor. However, the trademark proprietor can, thanks to the prohibition on taking unfair advantage of a trademark's reputation, oppose the use of their trademark where it is not aimed at distinguishing the products of the advertiser and trademark proprietor and to highlight their differences objectively&lt;ref&gt;Case C-381/05, ''De Landtsheer Emmanuel SA v. Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne'' at paragraph 69.&lt;/ref&gt;, but rather at riding on the coat-tails of that mark in order to benefit from its reputation.&lt;ref&gt;''L'Oréal and others v. Bellure'', Case C‑487/07, at paragraph 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements set out by the Directive have resulted in some controversy. This is particularly true of the ''per se'' prohibition on comparisons presenting goods and services as imitations of trademarked products. In this regard, EU law contrasts starkly with the US approach; the US courts have long held&lt;ref&gt;Smith v. Chanel, Inc., 402 F.2d 562 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; that traders are allowed to the trademarked names of products they have imitated in advertising. In contrast, in L'Oréal and others v. Bellure&lt;ref&gt;Case C‑487/07&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] held that smell-alike perfumes marketed through comparison lists breached this condition. This decision was criticised both by the English courts&lt;ref&gt;See comments of Lord Justice Jacob at paragraph 50 of ''L'Oréal and others v. Bellure and others'' [2010] EWCA Civ 535&lt;/ref&gt; and by scholars&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Gangjee, Dev, and Robert Burrell. "Because You're Worth It: L'Oréal and the Prohibition on Free Riding." ''The Modern Law Review'' 73, no. 2 (2010): 282-95. &lt;/ref&gt;, who have considered that this places unjustified limits on advertising acts that are otherwise fully legal, such as copying that does not infringe intellectual property rights. 

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, most of the use of competitor’s registered trademark in a comparative advertisement was an infringement of the registration up till the end of 1994. However, the laws on comparative advertising were harmonized in 2000. The current rules on comparative advertising are regulated by a series of EU Directives. [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1276/contents/made The Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008] implements provisions of Directive (EC) 2006/114 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;M, Peitz &amp; F, Barigozzi, “[http://www2.dse.unibo.it/wp/524.pdf Comparative Advertising and Competition Policy]”, School of Business Administration, Working Paper 19/2004, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the classic cases of comparative advertising in the UK was the [http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-533/06 O2 v Hutchison case]. The [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ)  held that there could have been a trademark infringement when a comparative advertiser used the registered trademark for the advertiser’s own goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;P. England, “Advocate General says comparative advertising is not a matter of trade mark law”, Journal of Intellectual Property Law &amp; Practice, Vol.3, No. 5, 2008, pp.284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also held that a trademark proprietor could not prevent a competitor’s use of a sign similar or identical to his mark in a comparative advertisement, which satisfies all the conditions of the Comparative Advertising Directive. If the Advocate General's decision in the O2 case were followed by the ECJ, competitors will not be able to use trademark legislation either to prevent a comparative advertisement through an injunction or to charge in respect of its use. Conversely, in British Airways plc v Ryanair Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[2001] ETMR 235&lt;/ref&gt; a lenient approach was adopted by the UK courts. The use of competitors’ trademarks was no longer restricted for businesses competing within an industry, provided that compliance of the conditions set out in the legislation were performed. This meant that businesses are able to use the trademarks of other companies and trade names to distinguish the relative merits of their own products and services over those of their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;“Use of Competitors’ Trade Marks and Comparative Advertising in the United Kingdom and Europe”, Gillhams Solicitors and Lawyers 2008,  http://www.gillhams.com/articles/389.cfm, viewed 1 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The FTC and the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (NAD), govern the laws of comparative advertising in the United States including the treatment of comparative advertising claims. FTC stated that comparative advertising could benefit consumers and encourages comparative advertising, provided that the comparisons are “clearly identified, truthful, and non-deceptive”.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Villafranco, “Devoted to Intellectual Property Litigation &amp; Enforcement”, Woltens Kluwer Law &amp; Business, Aspen Publishers, Vol. 16, No. 1, 2010, http://www.kelleydrye.com/publications/articles/1335/_res/id=Files/index=0/Villafranco_Law%20of%20Comparative%20Advertising%20in%20the%20US_010210.pdf, viewed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although comparative advertising is encouraged, NAD has stated “claims that expressly or implicitly disparage a competing product should be held to the highest level of scrutiny in order to ensure that they are truthful, accurate, and narrowly drawn.”&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin-Williams Company, Report # 3988 ( NAD/CARU Case Reports December 2002),  citing  AT&amp;T Broadband, Report # 3914 ( NAD/CARU Case Reports  June 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Another major law is the trademark protective [[Lanham Act]], which states that one could incur liability when the message of the comparative advertisement is untrue or uncertain, but has the intention to deceive consumers through the implied message conveyed.

===Australia===
In Australia, no specific law governs comparative advertising although certain cases regarding this matter have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Matthew Anthony. "Legal aspects of comparative advertising and a strategy for its use." Queensland University of Technology Law Journal 12 (1996): 41-59. LegalTrac. Web. 2 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative advertising that is truthful, and does not lead to confusion is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Guidebook to Australian Trade Marks Law and Practice (2nd ed) (Sydney CCH, Australia, 1985) p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, Australian advertisers should make sure that the following are complied when exercising comparative advertising to avoid breaches regarding misleading advertising under Australia Consumer Law:&lt;ref&gt;Advertising and selling, Commonwealth of Australia, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Product compared should be like products as per HCF Australia Ltd v Switzerland Australia Health Fund Pty Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[1988] ATPR 40-846&lt;/ref&gt; or else comparison must be made clearly to consumers as per Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd;&lt;ref&gt;[2002] FCAFC 223&lt;/ref&gt;
# Test results are presented as it is as per Makita v Black &amp; Decker;&lt;ref&gt;[1995] ATPR 41-030&lt;/ref&gt;
# Test used are appropriate and conducted according to industry guidelines as per Duracell Australia Pty Ltd v Union Carbide Australia Ltd;&lt;ref&gt;[1988] ATPR 40-918&lt;/ref&gt; and
# Mock up test results truly reflects how is product functioning in real life as per Hoover (Australia) Pty Ltd v Email Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[1991] ATPR 41-149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Clarke, B. Sweeney &amp; Mark Bender, Marketing and The Law, 4th edn, LexisNexis Butterworths, New South Wales, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The law in Hong Kong regarding comparative advertising is the law that existed in the UK prior to the enactment of the UK Act 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, Garland and Margolis, The Law of Intellectual and Industrial Property in Hong Kong (Hong Kong: Butterworths, 1994) pp 210-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong has no legislation exclusively intended at limiting false or misleading advertisements. Still, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap 362) bans the use of false trade descriptions in advertisements. The tort of trade libel also exists to deal with false or misleading advertisements designed to injure the competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Council may have the authority to publish information with a perspective to amending false or misleading advertisements,&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Council Ordinance, Cap 216, ss 4(1)(a) and 5(2)(d).&lt;/ref&gt; while the  Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies of Hong Kong have the authority to take action against members who organize advertisements that are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Tackaberry, Paul. "Comparative advertising in Hong Kong: denigration and competition." Asia Pacific Law Review 5.1 (1996): 77. LegalTrac. Web. 2 Sep. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
In Argentina, there is no specific statute dealing with comparative advertising (so it is not forbidden), but there are clear jurisprudential rules based on unfair competition law.  If in some manner an advertisement is proven to be unfair or exceeds ethical standards by hiding the truth or omitting some essential aspect of the comparison, it is probable that an injunction will be granted and that the plaintiff will be able to obtain a final decision declaring the advertising illegal.

Numerous cases follow international precedent in referring to the requirements of the  [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997L0055:en:NOT European Union Directive on comparative advertising].  By following these criteria, Argentine courts have developed standards very similar to European regulation.  It is as if the judges wanted to validate the law created by the Courts with an external source.  Similar conclusions reached elsewhere indicate the existence of universally accepted principles that accept that comparing products in commercial advertisements should be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Palazzi, Pablo. "Comparative Advertising in Argentine Law" Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal, Vol. 22, No. 659, 2012. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2122583&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the {{cite web |url = http://www.conar.org.br/pdf/brazilian-advertising-self.pdf |title = Brazilian Advertising Self-Regulation Code }} allow comparative advertising with certain restrictions. Its primary purpose shall be the clarification or consumer’s protection; it shall have as basic principle the objectiveness of the comparison since subjective data, psychological or emotionally based data does not constitute a valid comparison basis for consumers;  the purposed or implemented comparison shall be capable of being supported byevidence; in the case of consumption goods, the comparison shall be made with models manufactured in the same year and no comparison shall be made between products manufactured in different years, unless it is only a reference to show evolution, in which case the evolution shall be clearly demonstrated; there shall be no confusion between the products and competitor’s brands; there shall be no unfair competition, denigration of the product’s image or another company’s product; and there shall be no unreasonable use of the corporate image or goodwill of third parties.

Likewise, the majority of the Brazilian authors is inclined to say that its legitimacy depends to meet certain requirements, which, in general, would be stipulated by Article 3a of Directive 84/450/EEC &lt;ref&gt;DURIGAN, P. L. Publicidade comparativa: informação persuasiva e concorrência. pg. 248 http://www.paulo.durigan.com.br/artigos/publicidadecomparativa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early Mercosur's rules through Resolution 126/96.

==Effectiveness==
Comparative advertising has been increasingly implemented through the years, and the types of comparative advertising range from comparing a single attribute dimension, comparing an attribute unique to the target and absent in the referent and comparisons involving attributes unique to both brands.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zhang, F.R. Kardes &amp; M.L Cronley, “Comparative Advertising: Effects of Structural Alignability on Target Brand Evaluations”, Journal of Consumer Psychology, Vol. 12, No. 4, 2002, pp. 303-311.&lt;/ref&gt; The contributing factors to the effectiveness of comparative advertising include believability,&lt;ref&gt;T.E Barry &amp; R.L Tremblay, “Comparative Advertising: Perspectives and Issues”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1975, pp. 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the extent a consumer can rely on the information provided in comparative advertisements, the level of involvement,&lt;ref&gt;I. Soscia, S. Girolamo &amp; B. Busacca, “The Effect of Comparative Advertising on Consumer Perceptions: Similarity or Differentiation?”, Journal of Business and Psychology, Vol. 25, No. 1,  2009, pp. 109-118.&lt;/ref&gt; and the convenience in evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;K.E. James &amp; P.J. Hensel, “Negative Advertising: The Malicious Strain of Comparative Advertising”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 20, No. 2, 1991, pp. 53-69.&lt;/ref&gt; provided by spoon feeding the consumer with information that does not require extra effort in recall.&lt;ref&gt;A. Chattopadhyay, “When Does Comparative Advertising Influence Brand Attitude? The Role of Delay and Market Position”, Psychology &amp; Marketing, Vol. 15, No. 5, 1998, pp. 461-475.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative advertising is generally coupled with negativity, as evidenced by early industry condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative Advertising Wars: An Historical Analysis of Their Causes and Consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt; Stating reasons such as participation in comparative advertising damaged the honour and credibility of advertising. Studies have suggested that negative information can be stored more effectively,&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Sorescu &amp; B.D. Gelb, “ Negative Comparative Advertising: Evidence Favoring Fine-Tuning”, Journal of Advertising, Vol. 29, No. 4, 2000, pp. 25-40.&lt;/ref&gt; thus generating the impact that any advertisement is purposed for, and more importantly, strong recall.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, such negativity can either be transferred directly to the brand and the consumer’s impression of the brand, various studies through the years have proven that comparative advertising has been responded to negatively.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beard, “Comparative Advertising Wars: An Historical Analysis of Their Causes and Consequences”, Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 30, No. 3, 2010, pp. 270-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Comparative advertising has been used effectively by companies like The National Australia Bank (NAB), and its “break up” campaign has made such an impact it has won an award from Cannes, and a substantial increase in its consumer interest.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsHub ,“Breakup Campaign Wins Cannes Lions”, http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news-article/news/arts/breakup-campaign-wins-cannes-lions-184492, viewed 30 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally acclaimed Apple Inc. has effectively utilized its Mac vs PC advertisements as part of its marketing efforts to increase its market share over the years. Such companies prove the academic view that comparative advertising is more successful when used by established brands,&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt; justified by the credibility and attention an established brand brings. Other famous examples include L’Oreal SA v Bellure NV&lt;ref&gt;[2010] R.P.C. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Coca Cola v Pepsi.&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Petty &amp; P.M. Spink, “Comparative advertising law in the European Community: Will the proposed directive harmonize across the Atlantic?”, Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, Vol.14, Issue 2, 1995, pp. 310-317.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative advertising has to be executed with caution and deep consideration for the targeted markets as the novelty of the concept affects the effectiveness of the stipulated campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Nye, M.S. Roth &amp; T.A. Shimp, “Comparative Advertising in Markets Where Brands and Comparative Advertising are Novel”, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 39, 2008, pp. 851-863.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, during what has been referred to as the [[cola wars]], [[soft-drink]] manufacturer [[Pepsi]] ran a series of advertisements where people, caught on hidden camera, in a blind taste test, chose Pepsi over rival [[Coca-Cola]].

[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|250px|thumbtime=3|"Daisy" advertisement]]
The use of comparative advertising has been well established in political campaigns, where typically one candidate will run ads where the record of the other candidate is displayed, for the purpose of disparaging the other candidate.  The most famous of these type ads, which only ran once on TV, consisted of a child picking daisies in a field, while a voice which sounded like [[Barry Goldwater]] performed a countdown to zero before the launch of a nuclear weapon which explodes in a mushroom cloud.  The ad, "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", was produced by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s campaign in an attempt to prevent Goldwater from either winning the nomination of his party or being selected.

Another example took place throughout the late 1980s between the bitter rivals Nintendo and Sega. "[[Genesis does what Nintendon't]]" immediately became a [[catchphrase]] following the release of the Sega Genesis (known as Mega Drive in PAL countries).

'''Contraceptive security''' (CS) is a situation in which people are able to reliably choose, obtain, and use quality [[Birth Control|contraceptives]] for [[family planning]] and the prevention of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity|title=Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers primarily to efforts undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]] to ensure contraceptive availability as an integral part of family planning programs.

Organizations, usually government health agencies, work to ensure clients have long-term access to a range of high quality contraceptives and other essential health supplies. A framework and tool, the Strategic Pathway to Reproductive Health Commodity Security (SPARHCS), was developed in 2004 by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners to help countries identify and prioritize key commodity security issues; assess current capacity for commodity security among country or regional programs, systems and policies; and shape commodity security strategic plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cssparhcs|title=SPARHCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures taken to provide contraceptive security may include strengthening contraceptive supply chains, forming CS committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cscommitteetoolkit|title=CS Committee Toolkit}}&lt;/ref&gt; product quality assurance, promoting supportive policy environments, and examining financing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csfinancing|title=Financing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening commodity security requires routine monitoring of donor and government commitment, policies, stakeholder coordination, and supply chain information. Tools including the CS Indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/logisticsbriefs/CSIndiImprFPProg_1.pdf|title=How Contraceptive Security Indicators Can Be Used to Improve Family Planning Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CS Index offer ways of measuring contraceptive security, and allow comparisons over time and across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csmeasuring|title=Measuring Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis of 48 countries’ CS Index scores between 2003-2012 indicates that all regions improved on measures of supply chain, financing, health and social environment, access, and utilization, with the greatest progress made in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/factsheets/CSIndexbkltEng.pdf|title=Contraceptive Security Index 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidized products, particularly [[condoms]] and [[oral contraceptives]], may be provided to increase accessibility for low-income people.

'''Courage to Resist''' (CTR) formed as an organization in the [[San Francisco]], CA area during the early part of the [[Iraq War]] (often called the 2nd Iraq war), which began in 2003. It now has members spread around the U.S., but is still mainly concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area. The group’s overall mission is to support U.S military war resisters, including helping them with legal fees. They have defended and supported well-known resisters like [[Chelsea Manning]] and [[Reality Winner]], and in 2018 began encouraging soldiers to refuse to be involved with the immigrant detention camps and other immigrant operations of the U.S. military. Their principle slogans are “Supporting the troops who refuse to fight!” and "Towards a World Without War!" They support those “who face consequences for acting on conscience, in opposition to illegal wars, occupations, [and] the policies of empire”.

== Founding ==
The Iraq War started amid controversy with many questioning everything from its legality to the existence in Iraq of “weapons of mass destruction”. According to French academic [[Dominique Reynié]], between 3 January and 12 April 2003, {{Nowrap|36 million}} people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with [[15 February 2003 anti-war protests|demonstrations on 15 February 2003]] being the largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reynié |first1=Dominique |date=2005 |title=Globalized protest: Demonstrating in the age of globalization: the case of rallies against the Iraq war in 2003 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6081355/GLOBALIZED_PROTEST._DEMONSTRATING_IN_THE_AGE_OF_GLOBALIZATION_THE_CASE_OF_RALLIES_AGAINST_THE_IRAQ_WAR_IN_2003_1 |journal=www.academia.edu |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This questioning was also occurring in the U.S. military and on April 1, 2003 Stephen E. Funk, a U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corporal Reservist, became the first of numerous soldier resisters when he held a press conference outside the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton Marine Base]] in Oceanside, CA publicly announcing his refusal to participate in the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2003-04-01 |first=Laurie |last=Goodstein |title=A Nation at War: Dissent; Conscientious Objector Numbers Are Small but Growing|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Like minded civilians and veterans of earlier wars stepped forward to support Funk and then decided, as other soldiers refused orders and faced courts martial, that a broader organization was needed. It wouldn’t be enough, they thought, to form a committee in support of each individual objector – the result was Courage to Resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Jeff Paterson |date=2012-02-04 |title=Jeff Paterson and the Founding of Courage to Resist |medium=Video |language=English |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxMUFTzNiXA |access-date=2018-11-19 |location=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jeff Paterson ==

[[File:Jeff Paterson Refusing to Board Aircraft to Persian Gulf 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Marine Corporal Jeff Paterson refused to board military aircraft in Hawaii enroute to Persian Gulf on August 7, 1990.]]

One of Funk’s early supporters was Jeff Paterson, a former Marine who, because he was the first soldier to publically refuse orders to the 1st Iraq War in 1990, felt a particular kinship with Funk. Paterson had been a Marine for five years and was on the verge of returning to civilian life when his discharge was cancelled in lieu of orders to the Persian Gulf. On August 7, 1990, as his unit boarded an aircraft in Hawaii, he sat down on the tarmac and refused to move. A week later he, like Funk, held a press conference where he stated, “I will not be a pawn in America’s power plays for profit and oil in the Middle East”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1990-09-13 |first=Robert |last=Stewart |title=Anti-War Sentiment is Seen Growing in the Armed Forces|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1990-09-23 |first=Colman |last=McCarthy |title=This Time, the Pacifists Are Starting Sooner |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2001-01-21 |title=Gulf War Resister Jeff Paterson: Up Against the War Machine |work=Revolutionary Worker |url=https://revcom.us/a/v22/1080-89/1087/jeff_paterson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson was a founding member of and has served for many years as the Project Director for CTR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2011-11-02 |first=Ashley |last=Fantz |title=Key People In WikiLeaks Saga Are Divided On Assange Extradition|work=St. Joseph News-Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Opposition to the Iraq War ==
CTR supported several early public resisters to the Iraq War, including Army Staff Sergeants Camilo Mejia and Kevin Benderman, Navy Petty Officer Pablo Paredes, Army medic Agustin Aguayo, Private First Class [[Robin Long]], and Army First Lieutenant Ehren Watada, and continued to support military resisters throughout the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-08-23 |first=Dan |last=Frosch |title=Soldier Who Deserted to Canada Draws 15-Month Term |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2005-05-28 |first=Joe |last=Garofoli |title=Anti-war sailor lifts foes of Iraq policy |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-09-27 |first=Adrienne |last=Ziegler |title=I'm Not A Deserter or a Coward: Soldier Surrenders at Fort Irwin |work=McClatchy - Tribune Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peaceandjustice.org.uk/newsletter/p-j-news-february-16/unsung-heroes-courage-to-resist/ |title=Unsung Heroes: Courage to Resist |last=Ames |first=Izi |date=2016-02-02 |publisher=Edinburgh Peace and Justice Centre |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2006-06-27 |first=Alex |last=Fryer |title=Opponents of Iraq War Rally Around Lt.

They staged rallies outside the military bases where resisters were being court martialed, demonstrated outside military recruiting stations, and participated in national days of actions to oppose the war and support war resisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2007-01-31 |title=Do you support the troops who oppose war in Iraq? |work=Redlands Daily Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2005-03-20 |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |title=Two Years After Iraq Invasion, Protesters Hold Small Rallies |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the War in Afghanistan ==

CTR supported the earliest public resisters to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] including [[Victor Agosto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-08-05 |first=James C. |last=McKinley Jr. |title=Soldier Who Didn’t Obey Is Jailed |work=New York Times}}[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/us/06soldier.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and Travis Bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/node/8561/ |title=Conscientious objector Travis Bishop sentenced to one year in prison |date=2009-08-14 |publisher=War Resisters' International |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli War Resisters Support ==
CTR members traveled to Israel and Palestine, learning much about Israeli war resistance movements. They talked with former Israeli soldiers about their experiences “carrying out acts of brutality and occupation” and decided as an organization to support their resistance to the Israeli military. In 2008 they were instrumental in issuing a statement signed by 26 U.S. military soldiers and veterans who refused to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which supported Israeli [[Refusal to serve in the IDF|Shministim]] (Hebrew for “12th graders”) who were also resisting military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2008/12/18/taking-stand-our-fellow-war-resisters |title=Taking a Stand With Our Fellow War-Resisters |date=2008-12-18 |publisher=Common Dreams |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they supported Tamar Ze’evi, a 15-year-old who spent 115 days in jail for refusing to enlist in the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2017-03-24 |first=Gili |last=Cohen |title=After 115 Days in Jail, Conscientious Objector Tamar Zeevi Released From Israeli Army |work=Haaretz |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-after-115-days-in-jail-conscientious-objector-released-from-israeli-army-1.5452760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chelsea Manning Support ==
[[File:Bradley-manning-pride001 (5877957820).jpg|thumb|Activists March for Bradley Manning at the 2011 San Francisco Pride Parade.]]In April 2010 a video showing a U.S. helicopter attack in [[Baghdad]] that killed eleven unarmed Iraqi civilians, including two [[Reuters]] employees, and seriously wounded two children was released by [[Wikileaks]] and quickly spread via the Internet and news media. On May 27, 2010, [[Chelsea Manning]], then known as Bradley Manning, was arrested and soon charged with espionage and “aiding the enemy”. Within days of Manning’s arrest, CTR joined with others to defend her and help raise money for her defense. On August 21, 2013 she was sentenced 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge. This was the longest sentence ever given to a whistleblower and was widely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/bradley-manning-sentence-unjust Bradley Manning: a sentence both unjust and unfair], ''The Guardian'', August 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/bradley-mannings-sentence-is-excessive.html Bradley Manning’s Excessive Sentence] ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the trial and the 7 years Manning ended up serving in [[United States Disciplinary Barracks|Leavenworth prison]], CTR defended her and provided financial support through the Chelsea Manning Support Network. Manning's lead defense attorney, David Coombs, credited CTR directly for her early release: “If not for the efforts of Jeff Paterson and the Manning Support Network and Courage to Resist, there’s no way that a president would spend the political capital to grant a commutation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/podcast-david-coombs-manning-attorney/ |title=PODCAST: DAVID COOMBS, CHELSEA MANNING’S TRIAL ATTORNEY |date=2017-05-14 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Manning herself said on the [[NBC]] [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] show that she "would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation."[[File:Stop Recruiting Kids Image 1.jpg|thumb|left|Image used by the Stop Recruiting Kids Organization]]

== Counter-Recruiting ==
Throughout its existence, CTR has focused some of its efforts on U.S. military recruiting, including the efforts of the military to influence and recruit youth. They have organized demonstration and vigils outside military recruiting centers and have on at least one occasion forced a Marine recruiting center to close for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/marinesshutdown/ |title=SUCCESSFUL SHUTDOWN OF MARINE RECRUITING CENTER! |date=2018-05-17 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-01-21 |first=Mark |last=Brown |title=U.S. Military's Recruitment Tactics Faulted by Activists |work=The Register-Guard}}&lt;/ref&gt; They use materials like the photo on the right from the ''Stop Recruiting Kids''[http://www.srkcampaign.org/] campaign.

== Reality Winner Support ==
[[Reality Winner]], a former U.S. Air Force intelligence specialist and military contractor, was arrested on June 3, 2017 and charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] with [[News leak|leaking]] a National Security Agency report about [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] to the news website ''[[The Intercept]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2018-06-26 |first=Charlie |last=Savage |first2=Alan |last2=Blinder |title=Reality Winner, N.S.A. Contractor Accused in Leak, Pleads Guilty |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly after her arrest, CTR began a campaign demanding the charges against her be dropped. They led the efforts to form the ''Stand With Reality'' support committee which stated that “the charge against Winner is grossly disproportionate to her alleged offense, and is designed to create a chilling effect on investigative journalism by dissuading sources from sharing information that is critical to the public interest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/press-release-new-stand-reality-support-group-formed/ |title=SUPPORT GATHERS FOR NSA CONTRACTOR REALITY WINNER |date=2017-07-10 |publisher=Courage To Resist |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://standwithreality.org |title=FRIENDS OF REALITY WINNER |date=2017-07-10 |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 23, 2018 Winner received a sentence of 5 Years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2018-08-23 |first=Dave |last=Philipps |title=Reality Winner, Former N.S.A. Translator, Gets More Than 5 Years in Leak of Russian Hacking Report |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since her conviction, CTR has joined with many other organizations to call for Winner’s pardon or the commuting of her sentence to time served.

== Immigrants ==
CTR’s most recent campaign opposes the use of U.S. military personnel in immigrant detention camps and along U.S. borders. They have produced materials encouraging soldiers to resist what they call “illegal” orders in relation to immigration and they have supported GIs who have publically resisted. For example, they support U.S. Army Captain Brittany DeBarros who has used social media and other public statements to voice her opposition to the military’s immigrant related deployments. She stated, “I didn’t take an oath to defend illegal war abroad and immigrant concentration camps at home. True leaders refuse illegal and immoral orders.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://couragetoresist.org/open-letter-border/ |title=OPEN LETTER TO ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS ON THE BORDER |date=2018-11-15 |last=Fanning |first=Former U.S. Army Ranger Rory

The '''defensive attribution hypothesis''' (or ''bias'', ''theory'', or simply '''''defensive attribution''''') is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] term from the [[Attribution (psychology)|attributional approach]] referring to a set of beliefs used as a shield against the fear that one will be the [[Victimology|victim]] or cause of a serious mishap.

Commonly, defensive attributions are made when someone witnesses or learns of mishaps involving other people. These attributions of blame will depend upon any similarities between the witness and the person(s) involved in the mishap. More responsibility will be attributed as personal or situational [[Similarity (psychology)#Social psychological approaches|similarity]] decreases. Assigning responsibility allows the observer to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable.&lt;ref name="walster"/&gt;

A defensive attribution may also be used to protect the person's [[self-esteem]] if, despite everything, the mishap does occur, because blame can be assigned to the "other" (person or situation).&lt;ref name="shaver"/&gt; The use of defensive attributions is considered a [[cognitive bias]] because an individual will change their beliefs about a situation based upon their [[motivation]]s or desires rather than the factual characteristics of the situation.&lt;ref name="shaver" /&gt;{{rp|112}}

==Research==
Walster (1966) hypothesized that it can be frightening to believe that a misfortune could happen to anyone at random, and attributing responsibility to the person(s) involved helps to manage this emotional reaction.&lt;ref name="walster" /&gt;

Shaver (1970) recognized that the similarity of the witness to the person(s) involved in the misfortune – in terms of situation, age, gender, personality, etc. – changes the amount of blame one is ready to ascribe. This is related to the [[empathy]] response, which is more likely to be activated if the witness sees similarities between themselves and the person(s) involved. Shaver was able to demonstrate this response by describing events to test subjects; varying the situations and people described to either match or be significantly different from the subjects: as similarity with witnesses increased, attributions of responsibility decreased.&lt;ref name="shaver"/&gt;

In 1981 Jerry Burger published a [[meta-analysis]] of 22 [[peer-reviewed]] studies on the defensive attribution hypothesis, in which he found strong evidence to support Shaver's hypothesized negative relationship between similarity and responsibility.&lt;ref name=Burger1981/&gt;

==Sexual assault==
Researchers examining [[sexual assault]] have consistently found that male participants blamed rapists less than female participants did, and that male participants blamed the rape victims more than female participants did.&lt;ref name=Grubb2008/&gt; These findings support Shaver's similarity-responsibility hypothesis: male participants, who are personally similar to (male) rapists, blame rapists less than female participants who are dissimilar to rapists. On the other hand, female participants, who are personally similar to (female) rape victims, blame the victims less than male participants.

A '''derby''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|d|ɑːr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|d|ɜːr|b|i}} {{respell|DUR|bee}}) is a type of [[Horse-racing|horse race]] named after the [[Derby Stakes]] run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in England.{{sfn|Reeves|1997|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=taIfkYgVCWIC&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.134]}} That was in turn named after [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby]], who inaugurated the race in 1780.{{sfn|Vesey|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YiIzxJT5o8C&amp;lpg=RA1-PT110&amp;pg=RA1-PT110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 135]}} Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Freeman|1997|loc=[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=dujiiVP2KJIC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eL9tTPubFY6CvgPVkdz1Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 68]}}{{sfn|Schreifer|Sivell|1996|[https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=NhXkvhEQaCQC&amp;lpg=SL11-PA1&amp;pg=SL11-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. K-1]}}

Traditionally, the term "derby" is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds,{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|English]] and [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S.]] [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] races all are. The most notable exceptions to this rule are the [[Hong Kong Derby]] and [[Singapore Derby]], restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds, and the Canadian Pacing Derby, an annual [[harness racing|harness race]] for "aged pacers" ([[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]]) four years old and up.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In [[Scandinavia]]n harness racing Derby is restricted to four-year-olds. Exception is [[finnhorse|the Finnhorse Derby]], which is restricted to five-year-olds.

{{Disability}}

A '''disability''' is an impairment that may be [[Cognitive disability|cognitive]], [[Developmental disability|developmental]], [[Intellectual disability|intellectual]], [[mental disorder#Disability|mental]], [[physical disability|physical]], [[Sense|sensory]], or some combination of these. It substantially affects a person's life activities and may be present from birth or occur during a person's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"&gt;[http://jap.physiology.org/content/95/5/2152 Journal of Applied Physiology]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Disabilities is an umbrella term, covering impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. An impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; while a participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations. Disability is thus not just a health problem. It is a complex phenomenon, reflecting the interaction between features of a person’s body and features of the society in which he or she lives.|author=[[World Health Organization]]|source=Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disabilities |url=http://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Disability is a contested concept, with different meanings in different communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|last = Linton|first = Simi|publisher = New York University Press|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be used to refer to physical or mental attributes that some institutions, particularly medicine, view as needing to be fixed (the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]]). It may refer to limitations imposed on people by the constraints of an [[ableism|ableist]] society (the [[Social model of disability|social model]]). Or the term may serve to refer to the identity of disabled people. [[Physiological functional capacity]] (PFC) is a related term that describes an individual's performance level. It gauges one's ability to perform the physical tasks of daily life and the ease with which these tasks are performed. PFC declines with advancing [[aging|age]] to result in [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]], cognitive disorders or physical disorders, all of which may lead to labeling individuals as disabled.&lt;ref name="Journal of Applied Physiology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28400984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mugueta-Aguinaga I, Garcia-Zapirain B | title = Is Technology Present in Frailty?

The discussion over disability's definition arose out of [[Disability rights movement|disability activism]] in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1970s, which challenged how the medical concept of disability dominated perception and discourse about disabilities. Debates about proper terminology and their implied politics continue in disability communities and the academic field of [[disability studies]]. In some countries, the law requires that disabilities are documented by a healthcare provider in order to assess qualifications for [[disability benefits]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Contemporary understandings of disability derive from concepts that arose during the West's scientific [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; prior to the Enlightenment, physical differences were viewed through a different lens.

During the [[Middle Ages]], madness and other conditions were thought to be caused by demons. They were also thought to be part of the natural order, especially during and in the fallout of the [[Black Death|Plague]], which wrought impairments throughout the general population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Braddock, David, and Susan Parrish, "An Institutional History of Disability," in ''Handbook of Disability Studies'', ed. Gary Albrecht, Katherine Seelman, and Michael Bury (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[early modern period]] there was a shift to seeking biological causes for physical and mental differences, as well as heightened interest in demarcating categories: for example, Ambroise Pare, in the sixteenth century, wrote of "monsters", "prodigies", and "the maimed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Enlightenment]]'s emphases on knowledge derived from reason and on the value of natural science to human progress helped spawn the birth of institutions and associated knowledge systems that observed and categorized human beings; among these, the ones significant to the development of today's concepts of disability were [[Psychiatric hospital|asylums]], [[clinic]]s, and, [[prison]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary concepts of disability are rooted in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century developments. Foremost among these was the development of clinical medical discourse, which made the human body visible as a thing to be manipulated, studied, and transformed. These worked in tandem with scientific discourses that sought to classify and categorize and, in so doing, became methods of normalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|last = Foucault|first = Michel|publisher = Vintage|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "norm" developed in this time period, and is signaled in the work of the [[Belgian]] [[statistician]], [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]] [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who wrote in the 1830s of l'homme moyen – the average man. Quetelet postulated that one could take the sum of all people's attributes in a given population (such as their height or weight) and find their average, and that this figure should serve as a norm toward which all should aspire.

This idea of a statistical norm threads through the rapid take up of statistics gathering by Britain, United States, and the Western European states during this time period, and it is tied to the rise of [[eugenics]]. Disability, as well as other concepts including: abnormal, non-normal, and normalcy came from this.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Lennard. "Constructing Normalcy." In his ''Enforcing Normalcy: Disability, Deafness, and the Body'' (New York: Verso, 1995), pp. 23–49.&lt;/ref&gt; The circulation of these concepts is evident in the popularity of the [[freak show]], where showmen profited from exhibiting people who deviated from those norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit|last = Bogdan|first = Robert|publisher = |year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of eugenics in the latter part of the nineteenth century, such deviations were viewed as dangerous to the health of entire populations. With disability viewed as part of a person's biological make-up and thus their genetic inheritance, scientists turned their attention to notions of weeding such "deviations" out of the gene pool. Various metrics for assessing a person's genetic fitness, which were then used to deport, sterilize, or institutionalize those deemed unfit. At the end of the Second World War, with the example of Nazi eugenics, eugenics faded from public discourse, and increasingly disability cohered into a set of attributes that medicine could attend to – whether through augmentation, rehabilitation, or treatment. In both contemporary and modern history, disability was often viewed as a by-product of [[incest]] between [[first-degree relatives]] or [[second-degree relatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barlow, Kathleen | year = 2006 | title = Inbreeding, Incest, and the Incest Taboo: The State of Knowledge at the Turn of the Century | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.2.447| journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 447–448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, disability activists began to challenge how society treated disabled people and the medical approach to disability. Due to this work, physical [[Accessibility|barriers to access]] were identified. These conditions functionally disabled them, and what is now known as the [[social model of disability]] emerged. Coined by Mike Oliver in 1983, this phrase distinguishes between the [[medical model of disability]] – under which an impairment needs to be fixed – and the social model of disability – under which the society that limits a person needs to be fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, Tom. "The Social Model of Disability." In ''The Disability Studies Reader'', ed. Lennard Davis (New York: Routledge, 2006, 2d ed.), 197–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===
Different terms have been used for disabled people in different times and places.  ''Disability'' or ''impairment'' are commonly used, as are more specific terms, such as ''blind'' (to describe having no vision at all) or ''visually impaired'' (to describe having limited vision).

''Handicap'' has been disparaged as a result of [[List of common false etymologies#Other|false folk etymology]] that says it is a reference to begging.  It is actually derived from an old game, [[Hand-i'-cap]], in which two players trade possessions and a third, neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/handicap|title=Definition of handicap in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English)|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap racing]] in the mid-18th century.  In handicap racing, horses carry different weights based on the umpire's estimation of what would make them run equally.  The use of the term to describe a person with a disability—by extension from handicap racing, a person carrying a heavier burden than normal—appeared in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=ety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=handicap|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People-first language ===
{{Main|People-first language}}
People-first language is one way to talk about disability that some people prefer. Using people-first language is said to put the person before the disability, so those individuals who prefer people-first language, prefer to be called, "a person with a disability". Some people prefer person-first phrasing, while others prefer identity-first phrasing.

For people-first guidelines, check out, "Cerebral Palsy: A Guide for Care" at the [[University of Delaware]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerebral Palsy: a Guide for Care |url=http://gait.aidi.udel.edu/res695/homepage/pd_ortho/clinics/c_palsy/cpweb.htm |publisher=The Nemours Foundation |accessdate=July 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[American Psychological Association]] [[APA style|style guide]] states that, when identifying a person with a disability, the person's name or pronoun should come first, and descriptions of the disability should be used so that the disability is identified, but is not modifying the person. Acceptable examples included "a woman with [[Down syndrome]]" or "a man who has [[schizophrenia]]". It also states that a person's adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person, not as something that limits a person, for example, "a woman who uses a wheelchair" rather than "a woman in/confined to a wheelchair".&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar kind of "people-first" terminology is also used in the UK, but more often in the form "people with impairments" (such as "people with visual impairments"). However, in the UK, the term "disabled people" is generally preferred to "people with disabilities". It is argued under the [[Social model of disability|social model]] that while someone's impairment (for example, having a spinal cord injury) is an individual property, "disability" is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living: The Social Model of Disability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103084307/http://www.gcil.org.uk/FileAccess.aspx?id=59 |date=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the [[Social model of disability|social model]]. The term "disabled people" as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people, such as [[Disabled Peoples' International]] (DPI).

The use of “people-first” terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym PWD to refer to person(s) (or people) with disabilities (or disability).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Stephen |year=2014 |chapter=Chapter 23.

Which style of language used varies between different countries, groups and individuals.

=== Aging ===
To a certain degree, physical impairments and changing mental states are almost ubiquitously experienced by people as they age. Aging populations are often stigmatized for having a high prevalence of disability. [[Kathleen Woodward]], writing in ''Key Words for Disability Studies'', explains the phenomenon as follows:
{{Quote|Aging is invoked rhetorically—at times ominously—as a pressing reason why disability should be of crucial interest to all of us (we are all getting older, we will all be disabled eventually), thereby inadvertently reinforcing the damaging and dominant stereotype of aging as solely an experience of decline and deterioration. But little attention has been given to the imbrication of aging and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Kathleen|editor1-last=Adams|editor1-first=Rachel|editor2-last=Reiss|editor2-first=Benjamin|editor3-last=Serlin|editor3-first=David|title=Key Words for Disability Studies|date=2015|publisher=New York University Press|location=Washington Square New York NY 10003|isbn=978-1-4798-4115-8|pages=33–34|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== The workforce ==
As stated above, studies have illustrated a correlation between disabilities and poverty. Notably, jobs offered to disabled people are scarce. ''For global demographic data on unemployment rates for the disabled, see [[Disability and poverty]].'' However, there are current programs in place that aid intellectually disabled (ID) people to acquire skills they need in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Blick, R. N., Litz, K. S., Thornhill, M. G., &amp; Goreczny, A. J. (2016). Do inclusive work environments matter? Effects of community-integrated employment on quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Research In Developmental Disabilities, 53358-366. doi:10.1016/j.ridd.2016.02.015&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs include sheltered workshops and adult day care programs. Sheltered programs consist of daytime activities such as, gardening, manufacturing, and assembling. These activities facilitate routine-oriented tasks that in turn allow intellectually disabled people to gain experience before entering the workforce. Similarly, adult day care programs also include day time activities. However, these activities are based in an educational environment where intellectually disabled are able to engage in educational, physical, and communication based tasks. This educational based environment helps facilitate communication, memory, and general living skills. In addition, adult day care programs arrange opportunities for their students to engage in community activities. Such opportunities are arranged by scheduling field trips to public places (e.g. Disneyland, Zoo, and Movie Theater). Despite, both programs providing essential skills for intellectually disabled prior to entering the workforce researchers have found that intellectually disabled people prefer to be involved with community-integrated employment.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; Community-integrated employment are job opportunities offered to intellectually disabled people at minimum wage or a higher rate depending on the position. Community-integrated employment comes in a variety of occupations ranging from customer service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality and manufacturing positions. Within their daily tasks community-integrated employees work alongside employees who do not have disabilities, but who are able to assist them with training. All three options allow intellectually disabled people to develop and exercise social skills that are vital to everyday life. However, it is not guaranteed that community-integrated employees receive the same treatment as employees that do not have ID. According to Lindstrom, Hirano, McCarthy, and Alverson, community-integrated employees are less likely to receive  raises. In addition, studies conducted in 2013 illustrated only 26% of employees with ID retained full-time status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;L. Lindstrom, K.A. Hirano, C. McCarthy, C.Y. Alverson
“Just having a job”: Career advancement for low-wage workers with intellectual and developmental disabilities
Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals, 37 (1) (2014), pp. 1–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many with disabilities, intellectual and (or) psychical, finding a stable workforce poses many challenges. According to a study conducted by JARID (Journal of Applied Research and Intellectual Disability, indicates that although finding a job may be difficult for an intellectually disabled individual, stabilizing a job is even harder.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Banks, P., Jahoda, A., Dagnan, D., Kemp, J., &amp; Williams, V. (2010). Supported Employment for People with Intellectual Disability: The Effects of Job Breakdown on Psychological Well-Being. Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 23(4), 344-354. doi:10.1111/j.1468-3148.2009.00541.x
&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to two main factors: production skills and effective social skills. This idea is supported by Chadsey-Rusch, who claims that securing employment for the intellectually disabled, requires adequate production skills and effective social skills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, other underlying factors for job loss include, structural factors and the integration between worker and workplace. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can effect a multitude of factors in a job. Factors such as a restricted number of hours an intellectually disabled person is allowed to work. This in return, according to Fabian, Wistow, and Schneider leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers and a chance to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARED, many who had participated, found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They,also, had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the NOD ( National Organization On Disability), not only do the (ID) face constant discouragement, but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and (or) because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This then causes the (ID) the incapacity to provide for themselves basic necessities one needs. Items such as, food, medical care, transportation, and housing.

=== Poverty ===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 024.jpg|alt=painting of a group of people, some missing feet, hunched over crutches as a beggar walks past|thumb|upright|''[[The Beggars|The Cripples]]'', [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], 1568]]
There is a global correlation between [[disability and poverty]], produced by a variety of factors. Disability and poverty may form a vicious circle, in which physical barriers and stigma of disability make it more difficult to get income, which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life.{{sfn|Yeo|2005}} The [[World report on disability]] indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care, compared to a third of abled people.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, ''World report on disability'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries without public services for adults with disabilities, their families may be impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centrodiba.org|title=Centro DÍBÁ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disasters ===
{{Main|Disability and disasters}}
There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact disabled people.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |title=Children With Disabilities in the Context of Disaster: A Social Vulnerability Perspective |publisher=Child Development |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512111637/http://cdra.colostate.edu/Data/Sites/1/cdra-research/peek-stough2010.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rep-55-3-211.pdf |title=Disaster Case Management and Individuals With Disabilities |date= |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt;{{sfn|Stough|2009}} Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available.

Research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of a disaster cycle.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or [[transportation]], as well as access disaster-related services.&lt;ref name="cdra.colostate" /&gt; The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and [[disaster relief]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Disability, natural disasters and emergency situations |publisher=Un.org |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202131058/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1546 |archivedate=February 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), produced by the [[World Health Organization]], distinguishes between body functions (physiological or psychological, such as vision) and body structures (anatomical parts, such as the eye and related structures). Impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly, defect, loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards, which may fluctuate over time. Activity is defined as the execution of a task or action. The ICF lists 9 broad domains of functioning which can be affected:
* Learning and applying knowledge
* General tasks and demands
* Communication
* Basic physical mobility, Domestic life, and Self-care (for example, [[activities of daily living]])
* Interpersonal interactions and relationships
* Community, social and civic life, including [[employment]]
* Other major life areas
In concert with disability scholars, the introduction to the ICF states that a variety of conceptual models have been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning, which it seeks to integrate. These models include the following:

=== Medical model ===
{{Main|Medical model of disability}}

The [[medical model]] views disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure", or the individual's adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming [[healthcare]] policy.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}

=== Social model ===
{{Main|Social model of disability}}
The social model of disability sees "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full [[Inclusion (disability rights)|integration of individuals into society]]. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, created by the social environment. The management of the problem requires [[social activist|social action]] and it is the collective responsibility of society to create a society in which limitations for disabled people are minimal. Disability is both [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] in creation. According to the social model, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights concern.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6–7}}{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}} The social model of disability has come under criticism. While recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society, scholars, including [[Tom Shakespeare]], point out the limits of the model, and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the "medical vs. social" dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shakespeare T | title = The social model of disability: An outdated ideology? | journal = Research in Social Science and Disability | volume = 2 | pages = 9–28 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S1479-3547(01)80018-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of this model mean that often the vital services and information persons with disabilities face are simply not available, often due to limited economic returns in supporting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Christopher J.|last2=May|first2=Andrew|last3=Mitchell|first3=Val|last4=Burrows|first4=Alison|title=Capturing Volunteered Information for Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits and Challenges|journal=The Design Journal|date=2015|volume=16|issue=11|pages=197–218|doi=10.2752/175630613X13584367984947|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175630613X13584367984947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say [[medical humanities]] is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garden R | title = Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities | journal = Med. Humanit. | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 70–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21393285 | doi = 10.1136/jmh.2010.004143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social construction ====
The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed by social expectations and institutions rather than biological differences. Highlighting the ways society and institutions construct disability is one of the main focuses of this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Winter 2014|title = Naturalistic Approaches to Social Construction|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/social-construction-naturalistic/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Ron|last = Mallon|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way that race and gender are not biologically fixed, neither is disability.

Around the early 1970s, sociologists, notably Eliot Friedson, began to argue that [[labeling theory]] and [[social deviance]] could be applied to disability studies. This led to the creation of the [[social construction of disability]] theory. The social construction of disability is the idea that disability is constructed as the social response to a deviance from the norm. The medical industry is the creator of the ill and disabled social role. Medical professionals and institutions, who wield expertise over health, have the ability to define health and physical and mental norms. When an individual has a feature that creates an impairment, restriction, or limitation from reaching the social definition of health, the individual is labeled as disabled. Under this idea, disability is not defined by the physical features of the body but by a deviance from the social convention of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Profession of Medicine: A Study of the Sociology of Applied Knowledge |last=Freidson |first=Eliot |publisher=Harper and Row Inc |year=1970 |isbn=0-06-042205-X |location= |pages=205–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social construction of disability would argue that the [[medical model of disability]]'s view that a disability is an impairment, restriction, or limitation is wrong. Instead what is seen as a disability is just a difference in the individual from what is considered "normal" in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American Disability History Vol. 2 |last=Burch |first=Susan |publisher=Facts on File |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-7030-5 |location= |pages=543–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other models ===
* The '''spectrum model''' refers to the range of audibility, sensibility, and visibility under which people function. The model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations. Rather, disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bites August 2011 - International organisations report on disability |url=http://www.dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |publisher=Disabled Persons Assembly New Zealand |accessdate=March 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205123349/http://dpa.org.nz/news/bites-newsletter/55-bites-august-2011 |archivedate=February 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''moral model''' refers to the attitude that people are ''morally responsible'' for their own disability.&lt;ref name="Disability Model"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Deborah |title=Disability Model |url=http://www.peoplewho.org/debate/kaplan.htm |publisher=World Institute on Disability |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if [[congenital]], or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lum|first=Doman|title=Culturally Competent Practice: A Framework for Understanding Diverse Groups and Justice Issues|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780840034434|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of [[karma]] in Indian religions. It also includes notions that a disability gives a person "special abilities to perceive, reflect, transcend, be spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olkin|first=Rhoda|title=What Psychotherapists Should Know About Disability|year=2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=9781462506132|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''expert/professional model''' has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model. Within its framework, professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations (using the medical model), and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person. This has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian, over-active service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=5–6}}
* The '''tragedy/charity model''' depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of [[pity]]. This, along with the medical model, are the models most used by non-disabled people to define and explain disability.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=6}}
* The '''legitimacy model''' views disability as a value-based determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category. This viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable.{{sfn|DePoy|Gilson|2004}}
* The '''social adapted model''' states although a person's disability poses some limitations in an able-bodied society, often the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
* The '''economic model''' defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work, the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual, employer and society in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic Model of Disability |url=http://www.copower.org/models-of-disability/176-economic-model-of-disability.html |publisher=Michigan Disability Rights Coalition |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''empowering model''' (also, '''customer model''') allows for the person with a disability and his/her family to decide the course of his/her treatment. This turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the client's decisions. This model "empowers" the individual to pursue his/her own goals.{{sfn|Nikora|Karapu|Hickey|Te Awekotuku|2004|p=7}}
*The '''market model''' of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing disabled people and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers, employees and voters.  This model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life, with a particular focus on economic empowerment.  By this model, based on US Census data, there are 1.2 billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability. "This model states that, due to the size of the demographic, companies and governments will serve the desires, pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream."{{sfn|Donovan|2012|p=12}}
*The '''consumer model''' of disability is based upon the “rights-based" model and claims that disabled people should have equal rights and access to products, goods and services offered by businesses.  The consumer model extends the rights-based model by proposing that businesses, not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation, but that businesses actively seek, market to, welcome and fully engage disabled people in all aspects of business service activities.  The model suggests that all business operations, for example websites, policies and procedures, mission statements, emergency plans, programs and services, should integrate access and inclusion practices.  Furthermore, these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, T.B. (2012). A New and Emerging Model of Disability:  The Consumer Model.  White Paper. The Pennsylvania State University&lt;/ref&gt;
*Different theories revolve around prejudice, stereotyping, discrimination, and stigma related to disability. One of the more popular ones, as put by Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson 's (1988) work with '''attribution theory''', physical stigmas are perceived as to be un-controllable and elicit pity and desire to help, whereas, mental-behavioral stigmas are considered to be controllable and therefore elicit anger and desire to neglect the individuals with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = An attributional analysis of reactions to stigmas|author1=Weiner, B. |author2=Perry, R.

*The '''‘just world hypothesis'''’ talks about how a person is viewed as deserving the disability. And because it is the fault of that person, an observer does not feel obligated to feel bad for him or to help him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion.|last = Lerner|first = M.

== Identity ==
In contexts where their differences are visible, persons with disabilities often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide.&lt;ref name=":1x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://donnareeve.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ReeveChapter2004b.pdf|title=Reeve Chapter 2004|format=PDF|last=Reeve|first=Donna|publisher=The Disability Press|year=2004|isbn=0-9528450-8-3|editor-last=Barnes|editor-first=Colin|location=Leeds, U.K.|pages=83–100|chapter=Psycho-emotional dimensions of disability and the social model|editor-last2=Mercer|editor-first2=Geof}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repositoriocdpd.net:8080/bitstream/handle/123456789/605/L_MorrisJ_PrideAgainstPrejudice_1991.pdf?sequence=1|title=Pride Against Prejudice Transforming Attitudes to Disability|last=Morris|first=Jenny|publisher=The Women's Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=Aylesbury, Bucks, England|pages=21, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|“Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year after year, a lifetime of rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity and by hostility.”}}
Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One of the ways in which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless, or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance.&lt;ref name=":1x" /&gt; Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, "pass". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Semi|title=Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity|date=1998|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814751343|pages=19–21|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail/bmxlYmtfXzQ3ODY0X19BTg2?sid=edb39fe1-bae0-4c9c-9dc5-d0c2903f2346@sessionmgr106&amp;vid=0&amp;detailAuthError=true#AN=47864&amp;db=nlebk|accessdate=3 May 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence the popular perception of disabled difference.

=== Tropes ===
{{Further|Disability in the media}}
There are distinct tactics that the media frequently employ in representing disabled presence. These common ways of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities.

==== Inspiration porn ====
[[Inspiration porn]] refers to portrayals of persons with disabilities in which they are presented as being inspiring simply because the person has a disability. These portrayals are criticized because they are created with the intent of making able-bodied viewers feel better about themselves in comparison to the individual portrayed. Rather than recognizing the humanity of persons with disabilities, inspiration porn turns them into objects of inspiration for a nondisabled audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rampup/articles/2012/07/02/3537035.htm|title=We're not here for your inspiration|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supercrip ====
The supercrip trope refers to instances when media reports on or portray a disabled person who has made a noteworthy achievement; but center on their disability rather than what they actually did. They are portrayed as awe-inspiring for being exceptional compared to others with the same or similar conditions. This trope is widely used in reporting on disabled athletes as well as in portrayals of autistic savants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Representing Autism Culture, Narrative, Fascination|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84631-092-8|location=Liverpool, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html|title=sosol - Volume 7 Issue 1|website=physed.otago.ac.nz|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many disabled people denounce these representations as reducing people to their condition rather than viewing them as full people. Furthermore, supercrip portrayals are criticized for creating the unrealistic expectation that disability should be accompanied by some type of special talent, genius, or insight.

==== Disabled villain ====
Characters in fiction that bear physical or mental markers of difference from perceived societal norms are frequently positioned as villains within a text. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, “that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's [[Jack Sparrow]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Row-Heyveld|first=Lindsey|date=2015|title=Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar|url=http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf|journal=Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture| volume = 15 |number =3|doi=10.1215/15314200-2917105|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled people's visible differences from the abled majority are  meant to evoke fear in audiences that can perpetuate the mindset of disabled people being a threat to individual or public interests and well-being.

=== Self advocacy ===
Some disabled people have attempted to resist [[marginalisation]] through the use of the social model in opposition to the medical model; with the aim of shifting criticism away from their bodies and impairments and towards the social institutions that oppress them relative to their abled peers. Disability activism that demands many grievances be addressed, such as lack of [[accessibility]], poor representation in media, general disrespect, and [[ignorance|lack of recognition]], originates from a social model framework.

Embracing disability as a positive identity by becoming involved in disabled communities and participating in disabled culture can be an effective way to combat internalised prejudice; and can challenge dominant narratives about disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reeve|first=Donna|date=2002|title=Negotiating Psycho-Emotional Dimensions of Disability and their Influence on Identity Constructions|url=http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/69654/1/ReeveArticle2002.pdf|journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=5|doi=10.1080/09687590220148487|pmid=|access-date=April 19, 2016|pages=493–508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersections ===

{{expand section|date=February 2018}}

The experiences that disabled people have navigating social institutions vary greatly as a function of what other social categories they may belong to. The categories that intersect with disability to create unique experiences of ableism include, but aren't limited to, race and gender. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities differentiates two kinds of disability intersection, race disability intersection and gender disability intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Anna|title=European Union Non-Discrimination Law and Intersectionality:|publisher=Routledge|date=2016|url=https://books.google.am/books?id=-iu3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;q=disability%20intersections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race ====
Disabled people who are also racial [[minority group|minorities]] generally have less access to support and are more vulnerable to violent discrimination. For example, in the United States people of color who are mentally ill are more frequently victims of police brutality than their white counterparts. Camille A. Nelson, writing for the ''Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law'', notes that for “people who are negatively racialized, that is people who are perceived as being non-white, and for whom mental illness is either known or assumed, interaction with police is precarious and potentially dangerous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Camille|title=Racializing Disability, Disabling Race: Policing Race and Mental Status|journal=Berkley Journal of Criminal Law|date=Spring 2010|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.bjcl.org/articles/15_1%20Nelson%20(1-64).pdf|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====
The marginalization of disabled people can leave persons with disabilities unable to actualize what society expects of gendered existence. This lack of recognition for their gender identity can leave persons with disabilities with feelings of inadequacy. Thomas J. Gerschick of Illinois State University describes why this denial of gendered identity occurs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerschick|first1=Thomas|title=Towards a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs|date=Summer 2000|volume=25|pages=1263–1268|jstor=3175525|doi=10.1086/495558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text="Bodies operate socially as canvases on which gender is displayed and kinesthetically as the mechanisms by which it is physically enacted. Thus, the bodies of disabled people make them vulnerable to being denied recognition as women and men."}}
To the extent that women and men with disabilities are gendered, the interactions of these two identities lead to different experiences. Disabled women face a sort of “double [[social stigma|stigmatization]]” in which their membership to both of these marginalized categories simultaneously exacerbates the negative stereotypes associated with each as they are ascribed to them. According to The UN Woman Watch, "Persistence of certain cultural, legal and institutional barriers makes women and girls with disabilities the victims of two-fold discrimination: as women and as persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/enable/|title=WomenWatch: Feature on Women with Disabilities|last=WomenWatch|first=UN|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson puts it, “Women with disabilities, even more intensely than women in general, have been cast in the collective cultural imagination as inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and useless.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Winter 2005|title=Feminist Disability Studies|doi=10.1086/423352|journal=Signs|volume=30|pages=1557–1587|last1=Garland-Thomson|first1=Rosemarie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology==
{{Main|Assistive technology}}
[[Assistive Technology]] is a generic term for devices and modifications (for a person or within a society) that help overcome or remove a disability. The first recorded example of the use of a [[prosthesis]] dates to at least 1800 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Social History Project&amp;nbsp;– Timeline |url=http://www.disabilityhistory.org/timeline_new.html |publisher=Disabilityhistory.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wheelchair]] dates from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooper, Rory A |author2=Hisaichi Ohnabe |author3=Douglas A. Hobson |title=An Introduction to Rehabilitation Engineering|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420012491|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[curb cut]] is a related structural innovation. Other examples are [[standing frames]], text [[telephones]], accessible [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[large print]], [[Braille]], &amp; [[speech recognition]] [[software]]. Disabled people often develop personal or community adaptations, such as strategies to suppress tics in public (for example in [[Tourette's syndrome]]), or [[sign language]] in [[deaf]] communities.

As the [[personal computer]] has become more ubiquitous, various organizations have formed to [[software development|develop software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] to make computers more accessible for disabled people. Some software and hardware, such as [[Voice Finger]], [[Freedom Scientific]]'s ''[[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]]'', the Free and Open Source alternative ''[[Orca (assistive technology)|Orca]]'' etc. have been specifically designed for disabled people while other software and hardware, such as [[Nuance Communications|Nuance]]'s [[Dragon NaturallySpeaking]], were not developed specifically for disabled people, but can be used to increase accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking Dragon Naturally Speaking] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408025058/http://www.unh.edu/disabilityservices/dragon-naturally-speaking |date=April 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LOMAK]] keyboard was designed in [[New Zealand]] specifically for persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobh|first=Tarek|title=Innovations and Advanced Techniques in Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402062681|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The World Wide Web consortium recognised a need for International Standards for Web Accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/ |title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - home page |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at Dec 2012 the standard is WCAG 2.0 (WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/ |title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adapted sports==
{{Main|Disabled sports}}

[[File:Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.jpg|alt=an athlete tilts his wheelchair and raises an arm to block his opponent's shot|thumb|upright|[[Wheelchair basketball]] match between South Africa and Iran at the [[Wheelchair basketball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics|2008 Summer Paralympics]]]]
The [[Paralympic Games]] (meaning "alongside the Olympics") are held after the (Summer and Winter) [[Olympics]]. The Paralympic Games include athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities. In member countries, organizations exist to organize competition in the Paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite (for example, [[Disabled Sports USA]] and [[BlazeSports America]] in the United States).

The Paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme for British war veterans with spinal injuries. In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist working with World War II veterans with spinal injuries at [[Stoke Mandeville Hospital]] in [[Aylesbury]] in the UK, began using sport as part of the rehabilitation programmes of his patients.

In 2006, the [[Extremity Games]] were formed for physically disabled people, specifically limb loss or limb difference, to be able to compete in [[extreme sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Extremity Games was first class success|url=http://www.oandp.com/articles/2006-08_12.asp|publisher=oandp.com|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and government policies==

===Rights movement===
{{main|Disability rights movement}}
The disability rights movement aims to secure equal opportunities and equal rights for disabled people. The specific goals and demands of the movement are [[accessibility]] and [[safety]] in transportation, architecture, and the physical environment; equal opportunities in independent living, employment, education, and housing; and freedom from abuse, neglect, and violations of patients' rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability Rights Wisconsin |url=http://www.disabilityrightswi.org/priority-issues/abuse-neglect-and-patient-rights |publisher=Disabilityrightswi.org |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective civil rights legislation is sought to secure these opportunities and rights.&lt;ref name="disabilityrightswi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagenstos | first = Samuel | title = Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-300-12449-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löve |first1=Laufey |last2=Traustadóttir |first2=Rannveig |last3=Rice |first3=James |title=Achieving disability equality: Empowering disabled people to take the lead |journal=Social Inclusion |date=26 March 2018 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.17645/si.v6i1.1180 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/1180 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early disability rights movement was dominated by the medical model of disability, where emphasis was placed on curing or treating disabled people so that they would adhere to the social norm, but starting in the 1960s, rights groups began shifting to the social model of disability, where disability is interpreted as an issue of discrimination, thereby paving the way for rights groups to achieve equality through legal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemple|first1=Miriam|last2=Ahmad|first2=Fatima|last3=Girijashanker|first3=Suraj|title=Shaping Disability Rights through Shaping the Disability Movement|journal=Journal of Human Rights Practices|date=2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=355–363|doi=10.1093/jhuman/hur019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and actions===

====Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities====
On December 13, 2006, the [[United Nations]] formally agreed on the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], the first human rights treaty of the 21st century, to protect and enhance the rights and opportunities of the world's estimated 650 million disabled people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kayess|first1=Rosemary|last2=French|first2=Phillip|title=Out of darkness into light? Introducing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.|journal=Human rights law review|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2011|April}}, 99 of the 147 signatories had ratified the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UN Enable&amp;nbsp;– Promoting the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/ |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries that sign the convention are required to adopt national laws, and remove old ones, so that persons with disabilities will, for example, have equal rights to education, employment, and cultural life; to the right to own and inherit property; to not be discriminated against in marriage, etc.; and to not be unwilling subjects in medical experiments. UN officials, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have characterized the bill as representing a paradigm shift in attitudes toward a more rights-based view of disability in line with the social model.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====International Year of Disabled Persons====
In 1976, the [[United Nations]] began planning for its [[International Year of Disabled Persons]] (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=International Year for Disabled Persons|journal=Public Health Reports|date=1981|volume=95|issue=5|pages=498–499}}&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed the [[International Year of Disabled Persons]]. The UN Decade of Disabled Persons (1983–1993) featured a World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons. In 1979, [[Frank Bowe]] was the only person with a disability representing any country in the planning of IYDP-1981. Today, many countries have named representatives who are themselves individuals with disabilities. The decade was closed in an address before the General Assembly by [[Robert Davila]]. Both Bowe and Davila are [[deaf]]. In 1984, [[UNESCO]] accepted [[sign language]] for use in education of deaf children and youth.

====Policies in the United States====
In the United States, the Department of Labor's 2014 rules for federal contractors, defined as companies that make more than $50,000/year from the federal government, required them to have as a goal that 7% of their workforce must be disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Labor Department announces final rules to improve employment of veterans, disabled people|url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20131578|website=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, the ADA says that all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.freeadvice.com/government_law/education_law/accommodations-for-children-with-disabilities.htm|title=Accommodations for Children with Disabilities &amp; the ADA|work=FreeAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, commonly known as the Access Board, created the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to help offer guidelines for transportation and accessibility for the physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ansley |first=James |date=2000 |title=Creating Accessible Schools |website=National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |url=http://www.ncef.org/pubs/accessibility.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 12.6% of the U.S. population are individuals who suffer from a mental or physical disability. Many are unemployed because of prejudiced assumptions that a person with disabilities is unable to complete tasks that are commonly required in the workforce. This became a major [[Human rights]] issue because of the discrimination that this group faced when trying to apply for jobs in the U.S. Many advocacy groups protested against such discrimination, asking the [[Federation|federal government]] to implement laws and policies that would help individuals with disabilities.

=====Rehabilitation Act of 1973=====

The [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] was enacted with the purpose of protecting individuals with disabilities from prejudicial treatment by government funded programs, employers, and agencies. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 has not only helped protect U.S. citizens from being discriminated against but it has also created confidence amongst individuals to feel more comfortable with their disability. There are many sections within The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that contains detailed information about what is covered in this policy.

; Section 501
:   An employer must hire an individual who meets the qualifications of a job description despite any preexisting disabilities.
; Section 503
:   Requires contractors or subcontractors, who receive more than $10,000 from the government to hire people with disabilities and to accommodate them with the needs that they need to achieve in the work force.
; [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]]
:   States that receive federal money may not discriminate against any person with disabilities who qualifies for a program or job.

=====The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990=====

The federal government enacted The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which was created to allow equal opportunity for jobs, access to private and government funded facilities, and transportation for disabled people. This act was created with the purpose to ensure that employers would not discriminate against any individual despite their disability. In 1990, data was gathered to show the percentage of disabled people who worked in the U.S. Out of the 13% who filled out the survey, only 53% percent of individuals with disabilities worked while 90% of this group population did not, the government wanted to change this, they wanted Americans with disabilities to have the same opportunities as those who did not have a disability. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] not only required corporations to hire disabled people but that they also accommodate them and their needs.

; Title I: Employment
:   An employer must give a qualified individual with disabilities the same opportunities as any other employee despite their disability. The employer must offer equal work privileges to someone who has a disability including but not limited to pay, work hours, training, etc. The employer must also create accommodations suitable for the person and their physical or mental disabilities.
; Title II: State and Local Government Activities
:   Requires that the government give disabled people the same opportunities involving work, programs, building access, and services. Title II also requires that buildings create easy access for disabled people and provide communicators who will be able to help those with [[Hearing loss|hearing]] or speaking impairments. Public spaces are however not required to create accommodations that would in turn alter their services as long as the services proved that they did all they could to prevent discrimination against disabled people.f
; Title II: Transportation
:   [[Public transport]]ation should be customized so that disabled people may have easy access to public transit. [[Paratransit]] is a service that provides transportation to people who are unable to get from one destination to another due to their mental or physical disability.
; Title II: Public Accommodations
:   Public accommodations require that private businesses create accommodations that will allow disabled people easy access to buildings. Private businesses may not discriminate against disabled people and must provide accommodations that are reasonable, alterations may be made so that a person with disabilities can have equal access to facilities that are provided, communicators for the [[hearing impaired]], devices for the visually impaired, and wheelchair access. Facilities must regulate with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]], when regulating the buildings infrastructure so it meets the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] regulations.
; Title IV: Telecommunication Relay Services
:   Requires telephone companies to have [[Telecommunications relay service|TRS]] seven days a week, twenty four hours a day. It requires telephone companies to create accommodations for deaf/hard of hearing people by providing a third party that will be able to assistant both parties in communicating with one another.

====Policies in the United Kingdom====
In the UK, the Department for Work and Pension is a government department responsible for promoting disability awareness and among its aims is to increase the understanding of disability and removal of barriers for disabled people in the workplace. According to a news report, a people survey conducted in the UK shows a 23% increase in reported discrimination and harassment in the workplace at The Department for Work and Pension. The survey shows the number of reports for discrimination due to disability was in majority compared to discrimination due to gender, ethnicity or age. DWP received criticism for the survey results. As a department responsible for tackling discrimination at work, the DWP results may indicate room for improvement from within. A DWP spokesperson said the survey results do not necessarily indicate an increase in the number of reports, but rather reflecting the outcomes of efforts to encourage people to come forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disabled staff at the DWP are reporting increased discrimination|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/disabled-dwp-staff-report-increased-discrimination-in-the-workplace-a6856191.html|website = The Independent|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political issues===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
[[File:USMC-00772.jpg|alt=woman seated in a wheelchair with military personnel in background|thumb|left|upright|A 28-year-old Iraqi woman who lost both of her legs during the [[Iraq War]] in 2005]]
Political [[rights]], [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] have come to the fore in developed and some developing countries. The debate has moved beyond a concern about the perceived cost of maintaining dependent disabled people to finding effective ways to ensure that disabled people can participate in and contribute to society in all spheres of life.

In developing nations, where the vast bulk of the estimated 650 million disabled people reside, a great deal of work is needed to address concerns ranging from accessibility and education to self-empowerment, self-supporting employment, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf|title=Fact Sheet on Persons with Disabilities, by United Nation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, disability rights activists have focused on obtaining full citizenship for the disabled.

There are obstacles in some countries in getting full employment; public perception of disabled people may vary.

====Abuse====
{{main|Disability abuse}}
Disability abuse happens when a person is abused physically, financially, verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability. As many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalize the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on.

As the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general, this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance. How political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political party's understanding of disability, particularly in the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9626664/Disability-hate-crimes-rise-by-a-quarter-in-a-year.html |title='Disability hate crimes' rise by a quarter in a year |publisher=Telegraph |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance====
Disability benefit, or [[disability pension]], is a major kind of [[disability insurance]] that is provided by government agencies to people who are temporarily or permanently unable to work due to a disability. In the U.S., disability benefit is provided in the category of [[Supplemental Security Income]]. In Canada, it is within the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. In other countries, disability benefit may be provided under [[social security]] systems.

Costs of disability pensions are steadily growing in Western countries, mainly in Europe and the United States. It was reported that, in the UK, expenditure on disability pensions accounted for 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980; two decades later it had reached 2.6% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. Transforming disability into ability: Policies to promote work and income security for disabled people. Paris: OECD Publication Offices. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Labriola M, Lund T | title = Self-reported sickness absence as a risk marker of future disability pension. Prospective findings from the DWECS/DREAM study 1990-2004 | journal = Int J Med Sci | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 153–8 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17554400 | pmc = 1885553 | doi = 10.7150/ijms.4.153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have reported a link between increased absence from work due to sickness and elevated risk of future disability pension.&lt;ref name="pmid16497865"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Virtanen M, Kivimäki M, Vahtera J, Elovainio M, Sund R, Virtanen P, Ferrie JE | title = Sickness absence as a risk factor for job termination, unemployment, and disability pension among temporary and permanent employees | journal = Occup Environ Med | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16497865 | pmc = 2078149 | doi = 10.1136/oem.2005.020297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by researchers in Denmark suggests that information on self-reported days of absence due to sickness can be used to effectively identify future potential groups for disability pension.&lt;ref name="Labriola-Lund-2007"/&gt; These studies may provide useful information for policy makers, case managing authorities, employers, and physicians.

Private, for-profit disability insurance plays a role in providing incomes to disabled people, but the nationalized programs are the safety net that catch most claimants.

==Demographics==

Estimates of worldwide and country-wide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic. The varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding, demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large. For example, in 2012, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated a world population of 6.5 billion people. Of those, nearly 650 million people, or 10%, were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web |title=Disability World Report 2011 |url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2011 |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 the [[International Labour Organization]] estimated that about a billion people, one seventh of the world population, had disabilities, 80% of them in developing countries, and 80% of working age.  Excluding disabled people from the workforce was reckoned to cost up to 7% of [[gross domestic product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For many, disability is part of what it means to be human |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f4e2dc50-3dab-11e8-bcc8-cebcb81f1f90 |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
After years of war in Afghanistan, there are more than 1 million disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8073447.stm Homes for disabled in Afghanistan]". BBC News.

===Australia===
In [[disability in Australia|Australia]], 18.5% of the population reported having a disability in a 2009 survey.&lt;ref name=ABS2009&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/9C2B94626F0FAC62CA2577FA0011C431/$File/44300_2009.pdf |title=Disability, Ageing and Carers, Australia: Summary of Findings, cat. no. 4430.0, |place=Canberra |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, there were some 56.7 million disabled people, or 19% (by comparison, African Americans are the largest racial minority in the U.S., but only constitute 12.6% of the U.S. population).&lt;ref name="U.S. Bureau of the Census"&gt;{{cite web |title=American FactFinder |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S1801&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disabled individuals make up one of the most inclusive minority groups in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaPlante|first=P. Mitchell|year=1991|title=The Demographics of Disability|url=|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=69|pages=55–77|doi=10.2307/3350158}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2014 Disability status report of the Cornell University Yang Tan Institute the prevalence rate of individuals with disabilities in the United States was 12.6% in that year. {{as of|2014}} ambulatory disability had the highest prevalence (7.1%) in the United States. By contrast, visual disability had the lowest prevalence (2.3%). Additionally, 3.6% of people in the United States were reported to have had an auditory disability in the same year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=W.|year=2014|title=2014 Disability Status Report: United States|url=|journal=Cornell University Yang Tan Institute on Employment and Disability|volume=|pages=1–65|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.8% of individuals ages 16–20 reported having any disability, physical and/ or cognitive. Adults 21 to 64 had a prevalence of 10.8% with over half of these (5.5%) being ambulatory disabilities. Ambulatory disability prevalence raised to 15.8% in adults 65–74 years of age. Adults 75 years and older comprised the highest prevalence with any disability at 50.3%.

Female individuals across all ages reported a total 0.4% higher prevalence rate than males who reported 12.4%.

In the U.S. 17.9% of Native American peoples reported having a disability while 4.5% reporting were of Asian descent, these were the two opposing poles of the prevalence rate within race {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Although there are acts that have been imposed in order to prevent the discrimination of individuals with disabilities in the workplace, there is still an employment gap that can be seen between those with and without disabilities. In regards to employment, the institute's status report accounts that 34.6% of people with any disability reported being employed. By comparison; 77.6% of individuals, who did not report having a disability, reported having a full-time job in 2014.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For those employed full-time, individuals with disabilities on average earned $5,100 less than employees without a disability who were also employed full-time. Those affected the most by these differences were intellectually disabled people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Europe===
Nearly 8 million European men were permanently disabled in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kitchen |first=Martin |year=2000 |origyear=1980 |title=Europe Between the Wars |location=New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=0-582-41869-0 |oclc=247285240}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 150,000 [[Vietnam veteran]]s came home wounded, and at least 21,000 were permanently disabled.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 The War's Costs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907033319/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=513 |date=September 7, 2003 }}". Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, there were 2.9 million disabled veterans in the United States, an increase of 25 percent over 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354985,00.html VA: Number of Disabled Veterans Rising]". FOXNews.com. May 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing nations===
There is widespread agreement among experts{{who|date=May 2014}} in the field, that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations. The connection between [[disability and poverty]] is thought to be part of a "vicious cycle" in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yeo R., Moore K. | year = 2003 | title = Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: "Nothing about us, without us" | doi = 10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00218-8 | journal = World Development | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 571–590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disappointment''' is the feeling of [[dissatisfaction]] that follows the failure of expectations or [[hope]]s to manifest. Similar to [[regret (emotion)|regret]], it differs in that a person who feels regret focuses primarily on the personal choices that contributed to a poor outcome, while a person feeling disappointment focuses on the outcome itself.&lt;ref name="Regret"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, David E. |title=Putting a premium on regret |journal=Management Science |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=117–20 |date=January 1985 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.1.117 |jstor=2631680}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a source of psychological [[stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref name="Ma"&gt;Ma, Lybi.

''Disappoint'' is traced to the [[Middle English]] ''disappointen'' by way of the [[Old French]] ''desapointer''.

Disappointment is a subjective response related to anticipated rewards. Disappointment recovery time can vary among people. For some it can take a few minutes while for some it can take a few days.

Disappointment, and an inability to prepare for it, has also been hypothesized as the source of occasional [[immune system]] compromise in [[optimism|optimists]].&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;Schwartz, Todd.

In 1994, [[psychotherapist]] [[Ian Craib]] published the book ''The Importance of Disappointment'', in which he drew on the works of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] in advancing the theory that disappointment-avoidant culture—particularly [[Psychotherapy|therapy]] culture—provides false expectations of perfection in life and prevents people from achieving a healthy [[self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Seale  | first = Clive  | title = Media and Health | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | year = 2002  | location = London  | pages=167, 242 | isbn = 0-7619-4730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craib offered as two examples [[Lawsuit|litigious]] victims of [[Malpractice|medical mistakes]], who once would have accepted accidents as a course of life, and people suffering [[grief]] following the death of a loved one who, he said, are provided a false [[Kübler-Ross model|stage model of recovery]] that is more designed to comfort bereavement therapists than the bereaved.&lt;ref&gt;Seale, p. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Untitled (Disappointed).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Untitled - Woman with a peacock'' (1919), by [[Jogesh Chandra Seal]]]]

Disappointment theory, pioneered in the mid-1980s by [[David E. Bell]] with further development by [[Graham Loomes]] and [[Robert Sugden (economist)|Robert Sugden]],&lt;ref name="INSEAD"&gt;[http://knowledge.insead.edu/abstract.cfm?ct=15268 "Disappointment Without Prior Expectation Cause and Affect" - Understanding emotion in decisions under risk] [[INSEAD]] (2005).

Disappointed individuals focus on "upward counterfactuals"—alternative outcomes that would have been better than the one actually experienced—to the point that even positive outcomes may result in disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartz, Alan |chapter=Expected feelings about risky options |editor=Moore, Simon |title=Emotional Cognition: From Brain to Behavior (Advances in Consciousness Research, 44) |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co |location= |year=2002 |pages=183–96 |isbn=1-58811-224-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example, supplied by Bell, concerns a [[lottery]] win of $10,000.00, an event which will theoretically be perceived more positively if that amount represents the highest possible win in the lottery than if it represents the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, David E. |title=Disappointment in Decision Making under Uncertainty |journal=Operations Research |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |date=Jan–Feb 1985 |doi=10.1287/opre.33.1.1 |jstor=170863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision analysts operate on the assumption that individuals will anticipate the potential for disappointment and make decisions that are less likely to lead to the experience of this feeling.&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; Disappointment aversion has been posited as one explanation for the [[Allais paradox]], a problematic response in [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility theory]] wherein people prove more likely to choose a certain reward than to risk a greater reward while at the same time being willing to attempt a greater reward with lower [[probability]] when both options include some risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jianmin Jia |author2=James S.

While earlier developers of disappointment theory focused on anticipated outcomes, more recent examinations by Philippe Delquié and Alessandra Cillo of [[INSEAD]] have focused on the impact of later disappointment resulting when an actual outcome comes to be regarded negatively based on further development; for example, if a person receives higher than expected [[Gain (finance)|gains]] in the [[stock market]], she may be [[Happiness|elated]] until she discovers a week later that she could have gained much more [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] if she had waited a few more days to sell.&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; This experience of disappointment may influence subsequent behavior, and, the analysts state, an incorporation of such variables into disappointment theory may enhance the study of [[Behavioral economics|behavioral finance]].&lt;ref name="INSEAD"/&gt; Disappointment is, along with regret, measured by direct questioning of respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marcatto, Francesco  |author2=Donatella Ferrante |title=The Regret and Disappointment Scale: An instrument for assessing regret and disappointment in decision making |journal=Judgment and Decision Making |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=87–99 |date=January 2008 |url=http://journal.sjdm.org/bb8/bb8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Iudaicus}}''''' ([[Latin]] for "Jewish tax") or '''''{{lang|la|fiscus Judaicus}}''''' was a tax-collecting agency instituted to collect the [[Roman Empire#Taxation|tax]] imposed on [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Roman Empire]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem and its Temple in AD 70]]. Revenues were directed to the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

==Imposition==
{{Taxation}}
The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 AD (first Jewish revolt) (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 66.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 AD in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6157-fiscus-judaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Judaicus]: "This was an affront to Jewish religious feeling."&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

While the tax paid for the Temple of Jerusalem was payable only by adult men between the ages of 20 and 50, the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was imposed on all Jews, including women, children, and elderly&lt;ref&gt;Schäfer (1998), pp. 113&amp;ndash;114&lt;/ref&gt;—and even Jewish slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], the documentary evidence (in the form of receipts) confirms the payment of the tax by women and children. The oldest person known from these receipts to have paid the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a 61-year-old woman, which led Sherman LeRoy Wallace to conjecture that the tax was levied only until the age of 62, as was the regular [[Roman Empire#Taxation|Roman poll tax]] paid by individuals throughout the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Heemstra, p. 14 (footnote n. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was continued even after the completion of the reconstruction of the Capitoline temple for its upkeep.

==Domitian==
[[Domitian]], who ruled between 81 and 96 AD, expanded the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' to include not only born Jews and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]], but also on those who concealed the fact that they were Jews or observed Jewish customs. [[Suetonius]] relates that when he was an old man of 90 he was examined to see whether he was [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcised]], which shows that during this period the tax was levied even on those above the age of 62.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt; [[Louis Feldman]] argues that the increased harshness was caused by the success of the Jewish (and possibly [[Early Christianity|Christian]]) [[proselytism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (1993), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Domitian applied the tax even to those who merely [[Judaizers|"lived like Jews"]]:

{{quote|Besides other taxes, that on the Jews [A tax of two drachmas a head, imposed by Vespasian; see Josephus, Bell. Jud. 7.218] was levied with the utmost rigor, and those were prosecuted who, without publicly acknowledging that faith, yet lived as Jews, as well as those who concealed their origin and did not pay the tribute levied upon their people [These may have been Christians, whom the Romans commonly assumed were Jews]. I recall being present in my youth when the person of a man ninety years old was examined before the procurator and a very crowded court, to see whether he was circumcised. [{{circa}} 90]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=183&amp;letter=F&amp;search=Fiscus%20Iudaicus Jewish Encyclopedia: Fiscus Iudaicus], [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-domitian-rolfe.html Suetonius's ''Domitian''] XII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Domitian's ruling opened the door to possibilities of [[blackmail]] in Rome and in all [[Italy]]. Charges of following Judaism were easily made, but difficult to disprove, not least because the practices of certain philosophical sects resembled some Jewish customs. As a result, many people chose to settle with the accusers out of court rather than risk the uncertainties of judicial hearings, thus effectively encouraging the blackmailers.&lt;ref&gt;Rodin (1915), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] was put to death for "living a Jewish life" or "drifting into Jewish ways" in the year 95 AD, which may well have been related to the administration of the ''fiscus Judaicus'' under Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius 67.14.1–2, 68.1.2; ''History of the Jewish People'', H.H. Ben-Sasson editor, page 322: "...Domitian ordered the execution of Flavius Clemens ... for [[Judaizing]] tendencies..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schism between Judaism and Christianity==
{{See also|List of events in early Christianity|l1=List of events marking changes in the relations between Christians and Jews in early Christianity}}

The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was originally imposed on Jews. At the time neither the Romans nor, probably, the [[Early Christian]]s considered Christianity to be a separate religion from Judaism. If anything they would have considered themselves as a sect within Judaism, which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Bourgel, Jonathan, ″The Jewish Christians and the Jewish tax ″, in: ''From One Identity to Another: The Mother Church of Jerusalem Between the Two Jewish Revolts Against Rome (66-135/6 EC)''. Paris: Éditions du Cerf, collection Judaïsme ancien et Christianisme primitive, (French), pp. 105-125.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether that was the intention or not, it did not take long for Christians to petition the Emperor to distinguish the Christians for the purpose of the payment of the ''fiscus Iudaicus''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} As the tax only applied to practising Jews, if they could be recognised as a separate religion, they would escape the impost.

After the murder of Domitian in 96 AD, [[Nerva]] relaxed the rules of collection, limiting the tax to those who openly practised Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1996), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; By this measure, the Christians (and perhaps [[Jewish Christians]]) escaped the tax [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Ancient/IntergroupTO/Schism.htm]{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}, but they were not officially recognized as a legal religion until the much later [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. The coins of Nerva bear the legend ''fisci Iudaici [[Calumnia (Roman law)|calumnia]] sublata''&lt;ref&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''; Rodin (1915), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; "abolition of [[malicious prosecution]] in connection with the Jewish tax,"&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Molly Whittaker, ''Jews and Christians: Graeco-Roman Views'', (Cambridge University Press, 1984), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to his reform of the harsh policies of [[Domitian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Goodman (historian)|Martin Goodman]], "Nerva, the ''Fiscus Judaicus'' and Jewish Identity," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 79 (1989) 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==

It remains unclear when exactly the ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was abolished. Documentary evidence confirms the collection of the tax in the middle of the 2nd century, and literary sources indicate that the tax was still in existence in the early 3rd century. It is not known when the tax was formally abolished. Some historians credit the emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] with its abolition in about 361 or 362.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html Julian and the Jews (361-363 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval revival ==

The tax was revived in the [[Middle Ages]] in 1342 under the name of [[Opferpfennig]] by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. The Opferpfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. The practice was justified on the grounds that the emperor, as the legal successor of the Roman emperors, was the rightful recipient of the [[Taxation of the Jews|Temple tax]] which Jews paid to the Romans after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. The Opferpfennig was collected on [[Christmas]] day.

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferpfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Trier]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7716">'''Global Medical Device Nomenclature''' ('''GMDN''') is a system of internationally agreed generic descriptors used to identify all [[medical device]] products. This [[nomenclature]] is a naming system for products which include those used for the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in humans.

The main purpose of the GMDN is to provide health authorities / regulators, health care providers, [[conformity assessment]] bodies and others with a single generic naming system.

Medical device experts from around the world (manufacturers, healthcare authorities and regulators) compiled the GMDN, based on the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 15225.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50728|title=ISO 15225:2010 - Medical devices -- Quality management -- Medical device nomenclature data structure|website=www.iso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was mandated by the European Commission in order to provide the necessary tool to carry out the implementation of the [[Medical Devices Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/regulatory-framework/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the European databank for medical devices (Eudamed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/market-surveillance-vigilance/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the draft of the proposed Medical Device Regulation (from the European Commission)  it states “To facilitate the functioning of the European Databank on medical devices (Eudamed), a medical device nomenclature should be available free of charge to manufacturers and other natural or legal persons obliged to use that nomenclature under this Regulation. Furthermore this nomenclature should be provided, to the maximum possible extent free of charge, also to other stakeholders.”

The GMDN is the current nomenclature used by Members States in the National Competent Authority Reports as part of the current EUDAMED system to exchange information on device safety&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/market-surveillance_en&lt;/ref&gt;. The GMDN is not yet specified for the UDI database system proposed in new European Regulations&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/regulatory-framework_en#new_regulations&lt;/ref&gt; intended to be used by manufacturers of medical devices who have their own UDIs (unique device identifiers) and traceability. 

==Governance==
The GMDN meets the need to identify medical devices at the global level, as identified in the [[Global Harmonization Task Force]] (GHTF) that have since disbanded (2012) and replaced by the IMDRF&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdrf.org/about/about.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

GMDN is managed by the GMDN Agency, a [[non-profit organization]] and Registered Charity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charitable organization#United Kingdom]]&lt;/ref&gt; which reports to its Board of Trustees, that represent medical device regulators and industry.

==Structure==
The GMDN term is in the form of a 5-digit numeric GMDN Code cross-referenced to a specific Term Name and Definition, with which all specific medical devices having substantially similar generic features, can be identified. The following is an example:

* GMDN Term Name - "Scalpel, single-use"
* GMDN Code - "47569"
* GMDN Definition - "A sterile, hand-held, manual surgical instrument constructed as a one-piece handle and scalpel blade (not an exchangeable component) used by the operator to manually cut or dissect tissue. The blade is typically made of high-grade stainless steel alloy or carbon steel and the handle is often made of plastic. This is a single-use device."

The GMDN term and other associated data is [[copyright]] protected and the GMDN is a [[Trademark]].

Uniquely each GMDN term has a set of attributes, known as Collective Terms, which help to navigate the GMDN Database and aid the selection of a GMDN term by medical condition or product feature.

The GMDN is used by regulators, healthcare providers and others for activities such as medical device recalls, adverse event reporting and postmarket surveillance and monitoring, as well as inventory control and other healthcare management functions.

The GMDN Agency updates the GMDN utilizing member change requests, to add a new generic device term or to change an existing Term Name or Definition. The decisions are made by an international expert team, according to ISO 15225. The GMDN Agency releases updates to the GMDN on a daily basis, on their interactive website, the GMDN Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmdnagency.org/|title=GMDN Agency|website=www.gmdnagency.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Members have access to the GMDN Database and membership is priced according to organization type and size. The GMDN is available in English and other languages.

==International use==
The GMDN is used in the European Databank on Medical Devices (Eudamed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/market-surveillance-vigilance/eudamed/index_en.htm|title=Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been established by the European Commission to strengthen [[market surveillance]] and vigilance.

The GMDN has been identified as part of the 'minimum data set' for the proposed US FDA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/UniqueDeviceIdentification/default.htm|title=Unique Device Identification - UDI|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|last=Health|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unique Device Identification]] regulation for the registration of new Medical Devices intended for use in the United States. This follows the international consensus&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdrf.org/docs/imdrf/final/technical/imdrf-tech-131209-udi-guidance-140901.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; established by the International Medical Device Regulatory Forum (IMDRF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdrf.org|title=International Medical Device Regulators Forum|website=www.imdrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GMDN Agency has recently finalised the business principles that will form the basis of a long term cooperation with the [[IHTSDO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtsdo.org/|title=SNOMED International|website=www.ihtsdo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cooperation Agreement shall result in the use of the GMDN as the medical device component of [[SNOMED CT]]. This Agreement is consistent with the aims of both organisations to minimise duplication and to support harmonisation. The following objectives were agreed:

* A more comprehensive and harmonised clinical terminology
* Greater utility and access to both terminologies
* Opportunities to improve organisational efficiencies

The Agreement will benefit patients across the world and all users of [[SNOMED CT]] and the GMDN in promoting comprehensive terminology based medical records, covering the needs of regulators, the medical device industry and healthcare professionals. The arrangement will enhance the application of care to individual patients for medical device, patient risk and safety use cases.

'''Hri''' (Sanskrit, also ''hri''; Pali: ''hiri''; Tibetan Wylie: ''ngo tsha shes pa'')  is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "self-respect"  or "conscientiousness". It is defined as the attitude taking earnest care with regard to ones actions and refraining from non-virtuous actions.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 524-526.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the virtuous [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is hri? It is to avoid what is objectionable as far as I see it and its function is to provide a basis for refraining from non-virtuous actions.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

      <comment>/* In ancient Maya culture */ [[MOS:CONTRACTION]]</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14021">[[File:Panel9SBCTajin.JPG|thumb|350x350px|Human sacrifice shown on a panel at one of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] at [[El Tajín]], Veracruz, in Mexico.]]
Most of the ancient civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]] such as the [[Olmec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Aztec]] cultures practised some kind of taking of [[Human trophy collecting|human trophies]] during warfare. Captives taken during war would often be taken to their captors' city-states where they would be ritually tortured and sacrificed. These practices are documented by a rich material of iconographic and archaeological evidence from across Mesoamerica.

==In ancient Maya culture==
Evidence of the [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|ritualistic sacrifice]] and taking human body parts as trophies in [[Maya civilization]] exists from as far back as the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Formative]] period (800 – 500 BC). The evidence consists of skeletal remains and depictions in Maya [[iconography]], commonly showing acts of human [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]]. Excavations at the non-Maya site of [[Teotihuacan]] have unearthed the remains of hundreds of bodies that are thought to represent a mass sacrifice at the [[Temple of the Feathered Serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Berryman 2007]]: 378&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Temple of the Moon (Peru)|Temple of the Moon]], another excavation site, there were a number of decapitated remains found along with numerous [[bound up|bound]] bodies of headless males. Given these two examples of mass sacrificial sites, there is no reason why this could not have taken place in Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch01|Berryman 2007]]:377-378&lt;/ref&gt;

With that in mind, there are other possible explanations that are commonly used among the Maya. It is not unreasonable to think that some of these sites are examples of ancestral [[veneration]]. This was a selective social practice in which ancestors were considered a 
subset of all the deceased and were the ones who validated political power, status and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mc12|McAnany 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also proof that the mortuary practices of the region were varied and once thought to be evidence of human sacrifice. They were commonly found in locations of tomb reuse and secondary burial practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch02|Berryman 2007]]:378&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed for the most part, that the soldiers did not patrol in large armies; rather there were many smaller groups or raiding parties. Most of these battles were driven by the desire for domination and the intention to intimidate other cities. During this time it was not uncommon that the victors of a battle would take captives back to their cities and use them for ritual sacrifice. In some instances they would bind or hinder the captive so that he could not fairly compete in a winner-take-all [[Ballcourts|ballcourt]] match. Herein, the loser would be beheaded and the victor would, in certain situations, keep his head as a trophy and confirm victory in order to establish his city's dominance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Berryman]]:379&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Popul Vuh]], the vision of human sacrifice and decapitation is abundantly clear and emphasized. However, in instances of decapitation, the sacrifice was intended to signify rebirth and creation. This theme is confirmed when the [[Hero Twins]] played the Lords of Death in a ball game match and ended up tricking the Lords of Death into decapitating themselves. With the Lords of Death out of the picture, the Hero Twins were able to resurrect their father, the Maize God.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch04|Berryman]]:379&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the significance of sacrifice and decapitation in warfare as a means to reenact rebirth, in the Popul Vuh.

===Maya art===
[[Maya art]] and iconography is a major source to anthropologists' knowledge and beliefs about the culture and history of the Maya. For instance, at the site of [[Bonampak]], photographer Giles Healy discovered exquisite murals showing a battle and its aftermath, including the torture of captives. Other examples of Maya art depicting sacrifice and torture include carved stone stelae, altars, and panels. There is evidence that this type of art was recorded on wood and other perishable media, but they have eroded with time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Chacon, O'Mansky, and Demarest 2007]]:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Iconographic depictions of trophy heads tend to show the heads being suspended in midair, held by the hair, or even upside down. In addition they depict blood or possibly other fluids flowing from the neck, eyes or mouth. Holding a head by the hair is seen as a sign of disrespect. In Maya iconography, these heads are usually fastened upright with the eyes opened and are worn on a belt that is positioned on the small of the wearer's back. The actual act of decapitation in the iconography is rare but does appear from time to time. The most common place to see the decapitation of human heads being worn or presented as trophy heads are on painted cylinder vases of the Late Classic period and usually involve the [[Hero Twins]] or some type of Creation myth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch04|Chacon, Dye &amp; Berryman 2007]]:384&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological examples==

===In the South West of Mexico===

In Oaxaca there are various pre-Columbian figures in which high-ranking characters, warriors and ball players wear ritual and military paraphernalia, holding inverted heads with their loose, long hair hanging down. One of these figures can be seen in the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in Washington. Javier Urcid writes that these trophies may have been "soft parts of decapitated heads turned into relics to hang"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 135.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several figures showing characters with facial skin on their faces: the skin of a flayed human. Urcid’s article in ''El Sacrificio Humano en la Tradición Religiosa Mesoamericana'' includes eight illustrations of these trophies in the southern west of Mexico, including a brazier depicting a ball player with a flayed facial mask, wearing a necklace of human bones and carrying a severed head.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Relación Geográfica'' of 1580 mentions the festivity of the [[Xipe_Totec#Human_sacrifice | tlacaxipehualiztli]] in the context of human skin as trophies in Oaxaca: "with rods they hit throughout the body until it swelled, and then flayed the bodies and washed the meat with hot water and ate it, and carried the skins in the nearby villages for begging."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch03|Urcid 2010]]: 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Mangales (Early Preclassic)===

Los Mangales lies within the [[Salamá River|Salama Valley]] in the Northern Highlands of Guatemala. It has been estimated that this site was active from approximately 1000 until 400 BC and was the site of vast, elaborate burials. Three principal mounds entail the main composition of the site, (Str. D6-1) containing varied amounts of adult male crania that have been interpreted as trophy heads or possibly dismembered sacrificial retainers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch07|Chacon, Mendoza &amp; Berryman]]:389&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the three principal burial mounds, there were multiple burial sites. In particular at burial site 6, there was conclusive evidence of human sacrifice, where were located at least 12 dismembered victims and three possible trophy heads. The heads were found lying inside the crypt with specific individuals. A common trend at this site is that the victims found outside the formal crypt were lying in the [[prone position]] (their wrists and ankles were bound tightly together and that they were faced down) and the individuals that were inside the crypt were in the [[supine position]] (face up and unbound). However, finding a body in the prone position does not necessarily mean that the individual was a victim of sacrifice. It is believed that finding isolated crania was seen as early evidence of trophy taking in the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch08|Berryman]]:389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chalchuapa (Preclassic) ===

Evidence of sacrifice and trophy taking was found at an evacuation site in [[Chalchuapa|El Chalchuapa]], El Salvador. The remains of 33 individuals were found and had appeared to have been victims of ritual sacrifice that had spanned five different episodes of construction to the structure. Many of the individuals were found to be male and most were lying in the prone position. Of the individuals found it was noted that they were represented as crania and were determined to have been trophy heads. The others had a range of signs of mutilation, including: one individual was missing his/her head, two were cut in half at the waist, one individual was missing his/her legs and another was missing his/her feet. Given the age of the individuals, the absence of grave goods, the positions and placement of the bodies, the lack of grave preparation and the evidence for dismemberment, this site seems to show that these individuals were war captives and then used in a form of ritualistic sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch09|Berryman]]:389-390&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuello, Belize (Late Preclassic)===

[[Cuello]] is a site that provides several examples of decapitation, dismemberment, and sacrifice of young to middle-aged males at public events. Here we see evidence of the sacrifice of children, one of whom appeared to have been decapitated demonstrating the incidence of decapitated individuals in common grounds and public structures. In most mass burials there seem to be primary individuals in the center, surrounded by the remains of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch12|Berryman]]:391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colha, Belize (Terminal Classic)===

In [[Colha, Belize]], archaeologists discovered a large pit next to a stairway near the center of a monumental structure (operation 2010). This "Skull Pit" contained the heads of around 30 individuals. Ten of these were children ranging in age from 6 months to 6 or 7 years old. The remaining 20 individuals were adults. There were cut marks on the crania and the remains were burnt, and the age grouping and the location of the pit has led to multiple conclusions on the reasons behind these sacrifices. One theory is that they were sacrificed as a part of a religious ceremony. Other hypotheses are that the victims were political prisoners treated with ritual violence or that they were ancestors of an elite lineage that was violently deposed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ch13|Berryman]]:392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teotihuacan (Feathered Serpent Pyramid)===

At this excavation site in Mexico, archaeologists found roughly 72 males. Due to the evidence surrounding them they were determined to be soldiers. The individuals were placed in a series of highly structured graves that were below, and just outside, the pyramid. From the other evidence unearthed, it was found that each individual had between 7 and 11 human maxillae, or human jaw bones, in his possession. These maxillae were mostly worn around the arm, generally on the biceps of soldiers. This was seen as a testament of strength and power that proved that these individuals had been in multiple battles or campaigns. Along with the maxillae, the men had necklaces made of teeth, obsidian projectile points and slate disks located behind their lower back, which were commonly found on Teotihuacan military figures. This led the excavators to believe that these soldiers were of an elite class of warrior, and not just some semi-organized militia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sp10|Spence, White, Longstaffe &amp; Law 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the remains of apparent soldiers, there were also remains found of other males with rich offerings that would suggest they were members of higher social status. This evidence proved that even at an early stage of Teotihuacan’s existence there was large scale human sacrifice as well as warfare-related symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sp11|Spence, White, Longstaffe &amp; Law 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">An '''idiosyncrasy''' is an unusual feature of a person (though there are also other uses, see below). It can also mean an odd habit. The term is often used to express [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or peculiarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rundell|first=Michael|title=Macmillan English Dictionary|year=2002|publisher=Schroedel Diesterweg|location=Hannover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cambridge Dictionaries Online |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/idiosyncrasy |title=Idiosyncrasy |accessdate=October 26, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028200843/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/idiosyncrasy |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[synonym]] may be "[[wikt:quirk|quirk]]".

==Etymology==
The term "idiosyncrasy" originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἰδιοσυνκρασία#Ancient Greek|ἰδιοσυνκρασία]]}} ''idiosynkrasía'', "a peculiar temperament, habit of body" (from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδιος]]}} ''idios'', "one's own", {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σύν#Ancient Greek|σύν]]}} ''syn'', "with" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κρᾶσις#Ancient Greek|κρᾶσις]]}} ''krasis'', "government") or literally "self-ruled".

==Linguistics==
The term can also be applied to [[symbol]]s or words. ''Idiosyncratic symbols'' mean one thing for a particular person, as a blade could mean [[war]], but to someone else, it could symbolize a [[surgery]].

===Idiosyncratic property===
In [[phonology]], an ''idiosyncratic property'' contrasts with a ''systematic regularity''. While systematic regularities in the sound system of a language are useful for identifying phonological rules during analysis of the forms morphemes can take, idiosyncratic properties are those whose occurrence is ''not'' determined by those rules. For example, the fact that the English word ''cab'' starts with a /k/ is an idiosyncratic property; on the other hand that its vowel is long is a systematic regularity, as it arises from the fact that final consonant is voiced rather than voiceless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0q0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=phonology+idiosyncratic+property&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx-UQZ7tjQ&amp;sig=cbIcFJcdWz43NBqQcIsSX5unVi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV17SmmoHZAhVNwlkKHV8cAf4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=phonology%20idiosyncratic%20property&amp;f=false|title=Generative Phonology: Description and Theory|author=Michael Kenstowicz, Charles Kisseberth|accessdate=30 January 2018|publisher=Academic Press|date=10 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509175337/https://books.google.com/books?id=a0q0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=phonology+idiosyncratic+property&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gx-UQZ7tjQ&amp;sig=cbIcFJcdWz43NBqQcIsSX5unVi4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV17SmmoHZAhVNwlkKHV8cAf4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=phonology%20idiosyncratic%20property&amp;f=false|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==

===Disease===
Idiosyncrasy defined the way physicians conceived [[disease]]s in the 19th century. They considered each disease as a unique condition, related to each patient. This understanding began to change in the 1870s, when discoveries made by researchers in [[Europe]] permitted the advent of a "scientific medicine", a precursor to the [[evidence-based medicine]] that is the standard of practice today. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Pharmacology===
The term [[idiosyncratic drug reaction]] denotes an aberrant or bizarre reaction or [[hypersensitivity]] to a substance, without connection to the pharmacology of the drug. It is what is known as a Type B reaction. Type B reactions have the following characteristics: They are usually unpredictable, might not be picked up by toxicological screening, not necessarily dose-related, incidence and morbidity low but mortality is high. Type B reactions are most commonly immunological (e.g. penicillin allergy){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Psychiatry and psychology===
In [[psychiatry]], the term means a specific and unique mental condition of a patient, often accompanied by [[neologism]]s. In [[psychoanalysis]] and [[behaviorism]], it is used for the personal way a given individual reacts, perceives and experiences a common situation: a certain dish made of meat may cause [[nostalgic]] memories in one person and disgust in another. These reactions are called ''idiosyncratic''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Economics==
In [[portfolio theory]], risks of price changes due to the unique circumstances of a specific security, as opposed to the overall market, are called "idiosyncratic risks". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple securities means the specific risks cancel out. In [[complete market]]s, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the [[capital asset pricing model]] holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of [[systematic risk]] in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a [[landlord]] from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.&lt;ref name=NYT032913&gt;{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one macroeconomic model including a financial sector,&lt;ref&gt;Brunnermeier, Markus K. and Sannikov, Yuliy, "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160894 A macroeconomic model with a financial sector]" (April 8, 2012). National Bank of Belgium Working Paper No. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; hedging idiosyncratic risk can be self-defeating as it leads to higher systemic risk, as it takes on more leverage. This makes the system less stable. Thus, while securitisation in principle reduces the costs of idiosyncratic shocks it ends up amplifying systemic risks in equilibrium.

In [[econometrics]], "idiosyncratic error" is used to describe error from [[panel data]] that both changes over time and across units (individuals, firms, cities, etc.)

'''Informative modelling''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]]  methodological approach 
linking [[information technologies]] with architectural analysis and [[Architectural model|modelling]] 
(at various scales, from architectural elements to [[building]]s and structures). 
Informative modelling aims at improving the way [[information]] and evidences about how architectural objects evolved through time can be visually displayed.

Informative modelling applies to the study of historic architecture, where objects have most often been widely transformed, and consequently where what is known about objects remains partial. As a consequence, whereas in traditional architectural modelling a realistic representation 
of objects is considered as an end, in the informative modelling methodology the representation of architectural objects is used primarily as support for [[scientific visualization|information search and visualisation]], [[reasoning]] and [[cognition]]:
it does not strive for realism.

Abstraction (the ''infovis'' legacy) and figuration (the ''architectural representation'' legacy) are integrated as alternative/mixable modes of representation, allowing partial knowledge to be communicated and important notions in historic sciences such as data [[uncertainty]] to be conveyed graphically.

Informative modelling puts the data about evolutions of architectural artefacts first, 
and provides rules for outputting [[2D computer graphics|2D]]/[[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics thought to become sustainable investigation 
and [[Software visualization|visualization]] tools (knowledge and discovery tools, as J.Bertin says it), striving for the readability 
of a dynamic geographical map. Examples of such rules are accessibility of the underlying documentary 
justification (archives, research material, etc.), information credibility assessment, visual underlining 
of lacking information, relation to an exogenous theoretical model of architectural elements, dynamic visualisation, 
research process progress assessment, etc.

Informative modelling has roots in architectural modelling, [[:Category:3D imaging]], [[:Category:3D computer graphics]], [[Georeference]], [[database]], 
[[scientific modelling]], [[scientific visualization]], [[knowledge visualization]], [[Knowledge management]], [[information retrieval]], [[Information science]], [[Computer graphics]], [[Information graphics]], 
and intersects methods and issues stemming from these disciplines.

'''Les amis du bus des femmes''' is a French association established in 1990 by former [[sex workers]] as a support group for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deschamps|first=Catherine|title=Femmes publiques: Les féminismes à l'épreuve de la prostitution|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-915547-08-5|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VpUnAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;dq=%22Les+amis+du+bus+des+femmes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D_UDUujBFaTuyAGx6IH4AQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBTgK|author2=Souryis, Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original initiative stemmed from a need to educate sex workers on [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt; It quickly became established as a bridging organisation between sex workers on the street and the provision of medical, social and administrative services. Its [[Paris]] headquarters is open daily to the population it serves. In addition it has eight permanent mobile units ([[buses]]) operating day and night in the areas frequented by sex workers in the capital, staffed by organisational and health professionals.&lt;ref name="Égré"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Égré |first1=Pascale |title=Confidences dans le Bus des femmes |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/confidences-dans-le-bus-des-femmes-15-05-2000-2001375118.php |accessdate=12 August 2018 |language=fr |date=May 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal mission of the association, whose administration consists of both sex workers and non-sex workers, is to work with and for sex workers to prevent [[HIV]], [[hepatitis]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]]. They distribute condoms and encourage sex workers to visit the office to get help with administrative, medical, and social needs, and conducts job searches for those who decide to transition out of sex work. Emphasis is placed on helping workers access their health, social and human rights. The objective is to enable workers to develop an environment that supports an active role for them in stating their needs and demands. In working with and for sex workers, the association fights against [[discrimination]], [[social exclusion]] and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Égré" /&gt;&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

The association opposes abolitionism and its objective to eradicate sex work, and recognizes that some women have freely chosen to engage in sex work and that that choice must be respected. The association deals with both voluntary and involuntary sex workers, such as those trafficked from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="florian" /&gt;

Currently the association has fourteen employees including doctors and nurses, facilitators and an employment counsellor. It is funded from government grants which are allocated by agencies such as [[Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales|DDASS]] Paris (Direction départementale des Affaires sanitaires et sociales), the Paris [[conseil général]], the CPAM de Paris (Caisse primaire d'assurance maladie) and the [[Conseil régional]].&lt;ref name="florian"&gt;{{cite web |title=Les Amis du bus des femmes |url=http://florian-cabirol.com/bus-des-femmes/qui-sommes-nous/ |website=florian-cabirol.com |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also receives funding from the [[European Commission]]'s Daphne Funding Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daphne Toolkit |url=https://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants/results/daphne-toolkit/en/content/la-pr%C3%A9vention-des-violences-faites-aux-femmes-travaillant-dans-le-milieu-de-la-prostitution |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association has been politically active, for instance opposing the [[Sarkozy]] laws on solicitation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">The '''lynching at Włodowo''' took place in a village of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] in North-Eastern [[Poland|Poland]] on 1 July 2005, when a group of local men killed a criminal Józef "Ciechanek" Ciechanowicz who was terrorizing the community.

== Background ==

Ciechanowicz was a 60 year old recidivist who spent over 30 years in prison, for batteries, thefts and rapes. During breaks between his times he was extorting pensions from elder people, bullying other residents of [[Włodowo|Włodowo]] and [[Brzydowo|Brzydowo]] villages and robbing local shops. According to relations of his neighbors, he was often wandering around while drunk, with an [[axe|axe]] or a [[cleaver|cleaver]] in his hand, mumbling that he will kill someone eventually, because he wants to go back home (prison). The police did not always respond to calls, and when they did, their intervention had no effect.

== Lynching ==

On the day of the event, Ciechanowicz entered the yard of Winek's family house where he saw Jagoda Rybak, daughter of his former concubine. The woman took her mother in hiding, after he had wounded her with screwdriver. Ciechanowicz was upset because he could no longer seize pension of her. Earlier he also broke a bottle on Jagoda’s head. Tomasz Winek, owner of the house, ordered him to leave but instead of retreating, Ciechanowicz drawed [[beetroot|beetroot]] [[cleaver|cleaver]]. Winek took a wooden bat from the pile and clashed with Ciechanowicz who swinged with a [[cleaver|cleaver]] aiming at Winek's head, who saved it with his hand, receiving a gash. Winek's neighbour came to help and forced Ciechanowicz to flee. In the meantime, Winek's wife called the police but heard that there are no police cars available at the moment. Later on they drove to [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] (nearby town) and visited medical and police station. Police officers were still refusing to accept crime's submission and send any officers to [[Włodowo|Włodowo]], claiming that none of them are available. After they returned, a group of locals (including two Winek's brothers) gathered. When Ciechanowicz returned, waiving his [[cleaver|cleaver]] and threatening that he will kill "you all and your brats" (four years old Winek's son was playing in the yard at the time), the group of men started to chase him. They caught him in the hollow near the forest and started to beat with bats, shovels and car spring. Though they confessed later, that he was still alive when they left him, he died from wounds. Later on that day other village dwellers were visiting the place, to ensure themselves if Ciechanowicz is dead.

== Trials ==

After the incident Tomasz Winek and his brothers Mirosław and Krzysztof were arrested for a short period but they were released by the prosecutor's decision on 7 November 2005. People of nearby villages gathered money for the best advocate for accused ones. On 23 October 2007 they were  sentenced for 2 years in prison with the suspension for the probation period of 3 years. However on 15 January 2009, appeal court changed the ruling to 4 years of prison, without suspension. On 18 December 2009, they were eventually pardoned by the president of [[Poland|Poland]] [[Lech Kaczyński|Lech Kaczyński]] - their sentence was put into the suspension for the period of 10 years of probation.

Other three persons involved into lynching received minor sentences in suspension for battery and desecration of a corpse.

Two police officers from [[Dobre Miasto|Dobre Miasto]] police station who did not react to calls for help also received prison sentences in suspension, for failure in complying to their duty tasks. One of them was dismissed from service and the other one was downgraded. The court did not accept their defense clarifications that they had no means to react and stressed, that they could ask nearby police stations and regional HQ to send reinforcements.

In January 2012 Winek brothers have been apprehended again for 48 hours in relation with the disappearance of a man living in their village. They were released without setting an accusation and later on court ruled financial compensation for them, evaluating the police action as “ungrounded show of power”.

== In popular culture ==

The event was pictured in television series "Pitbull" and "Kryminalni". It was also an inspiration for the  Polish thriller movie "Lincz".

==Early life and education==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon in the garden of Villon's studio, Puteaux, France, c.1913.jpg|thumb|230px|Three Duchamp brothers, left to right: Marcel Duchamp, [[Jacques Villon]], and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] in the garden of Jacques Villon's studio in Puteaux, France, 1914, ([[Smithsonian Institution]] collections)]]
Marcel Duchamp was born at [[Blainville-Crevon]] in [[Normandy]], France, and grew up in a family that enjoyed cultural activities. The art of painter and engraver {{Interlanguage link multi|Émile Frédéric Nicolle|fr}}, his maternal grandfather, filled the house, and the family liked to play chess, read books, paint, and make music together.

Of Eugene and Lucie Duchamp's seven children, one died as an infant and four became successful artists. Marcel Duchamp was the brother of:
* [[Jacques Villon]] (1875–1963), painter, printmaker
* [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] (1876–1918), sculptor
* [[Suzanne Duchamp|Suzanne Duchamp-Crotti]] (1889–1963), painter.

As a child, with his two elder brothers already away from home at school in [[Rouen]], Duchamp was closer to his sister Suzanne, who was a willing accomplice in games and activities conjured by his fertile imagination. At eight years old, Duchamp followed in his brothers' footsteps when he left home and began schooling at the [[Lycée Pierre-Corneille]], in Rouen. Two other students in his class also became well-known artists and lasting friends: [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]] and [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Pessiot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2v3xkP3ekEC&amp;pg=PA271 ''Histoire de Rouen'' volume 2 ''1900–1939 en 800 photographies''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122200759/https://books.google.com/books?id=u2v3xkP3ekEC&amp;pg=PA271 |date=22 January 2017 }}, repr. Rouen: PTC, 2004, {{ISBN|9782906258877}}, p. 271 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next eight years, he was locked into an educational regime which focused on intellectual development. Though he was not an outstanding student, his best subject was mathematics and he won two mathematics prizes at the school. He also won a prize for drawing in 1903, and at his commencement in 1904 he won a coveted first prize, validating his recent decision to become an artist.

He learned academic drawing from a teacher who unsuccessfully attempted to "protect" his students from [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], and other [[avant-garde]] influences. However, Duchamp's true artistic mentor at the time was his brother Jacques Villon, whose fluid and incisive style he sought to imitate. At 14, his first serious art attempts were drawings and watercolors depicting his sister Suzanne in various poses and activities. That summer he also painted landscapes in an Impressionist style using oils.

==Early work==
Duchamp's early art works align with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] styles. He experimented with classical techniques and subjects. When he was later asked about what had influenced him at the time, Duchamp cited the work of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painter]] [[Odilon Redon]], whose approach to art was not outwardly anti-academic, but quietly individual.

[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1911-12, Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train (Nu -esquisse-, jeune homme triste dans un train), Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice.jpg|thumb|Marcel Duchamp, ''Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train (Nu [esquisse], jeune homme triste dans un train)'', 1911–12, oil on cardboard mounted on Masonite, 100 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm (39 3/8 × 28 3/4 in), [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]], Venice. This painting was identified as a self-portrait by the artist. Duchamp's primary concern in this painting is the depiction of two movements; that of the train in which there is a young man smoking, and that of the lurching figure itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1179 |title=Marcel Duchamp, 1911–12, ''Nude (Study), Sad Young Man on a Train'', Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice |publisher=Guggenheim.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1179 |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He studied art at the [[Académie Julian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-duchamp-marcel.htm theartstory.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627194840/http://www.theartstory.org/artist-duchamp-marcel.htm |date=27 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(fr)[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rl7vBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1152&amp;dq=Acad%C3%A9mie+Julian&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj50Iu_qsHPAhUFQBQKHUIzB7w4UBDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian&amp;f=false  Victoria Charles, Joseph Manca, Megan McShane, ''1000 Chefs-d'œuvre de la peinture''] {{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1904 to 1905, but preferred playing billiards to attending classes. During this time Duchamp drew and sold cartoons which reflected his ribald humor. Many of the drawings use verbal [[pun]]s (sometimes spanning multiple languages), [[visual pun]]s, or both. Such play with words and symbols engaged his imagination for the rest of his life.

In 1905, he began his compulsory military service with the 39th Infantry Regiment,&lt;ref name="François Lespinasse"&gt;François Lespinasse, ''Robert Antoine Pinchon: 1886–1943'', 1990, repr. Rouen: Association les amis de l'École de Rouen, 2007, {{ISBN|9782906130036}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; working for a printer in Rouen. There he learned [[typography]] and [[printing]] processes—skills he would use in his later work.

Due to his eldest brother [[Jacques Villon|Jacques']] membership in the prestigious [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] Duchamp's work was exhibited in the 1908 [[Salon d'Automne]], and the following year in the [[Salon des Indépendants]]. [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and [[Paul Cézanne]]'s [[proto-Cubism]] influenced his paintings, although the critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]—who was eventually to become a friend—criticized what he called "Duchamp's very ugly nudes" ("les nus très vilains de Duchamp").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=2847420436 Pierre Lartigue, ''Rose Sélavy et caetera''], University of Michigan, Le Passage, 2004, p. 65, {{isbn|2847420436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?isbn=2246630819 Judith Housez, ''Marcel Duchamp: biographie''], Grasset, 2006, p. 93, {{ISBN|2246630819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=tKlIAQAAIAAJ Bernard Marcadé, ''Marcel Duchamp: la vie à crédit : biographie''], Flammarion, 2007, p. 28, {{ISBN|2080682261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp also became lifelong friends with exuberant artist [[Francis Picabia]] after meeting him at the 1911 Salon d'Automne, and Picabia proceeded to introduce him to a lifestyle of fast cars and "high" living.

In 1911, at Jacques' home in [[Puteaux]], the brothers hosted a regular discussion group with [[Cubism|Cubist]] artists including Picabia, [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]], and [[Alexander Archipenko]]. Poets and writers also participated. The group came to be known as the [[Puteaux Group]], or the [[Section d'Or]]. Uninterested in the Cubists' seriousness, or in their focus on visual matters, Duchamp did not join in discussions of Cubist theory, and gained a reputation of being shy. However, that same year he painted in a Cubist style, and added an impression of motion by using repetitive imagery.

During this period Duchamp's fascination with transition, change, movement, and distance became manifest, and as many artists of the time, he was intrigued with the concept of depicting the [[fourth dimension in art]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Sad Young Man on a Train'' embodies this concern:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, there's the idea of the movement of the train, and then that of the sad young man who is in a corridor and who is moving about; thus there are two parallel movements corresponding to each other. Then, there is the distortion of the young man—I had called this ''elementary parallelism''. It was a formal decomposition; that is, linear elements following each other like parallels and distorting the object. The object is completely stretched out, as if elastic. The lines follow each other in parallels, while changing subtly to form the movement, or the form of the young man in question. I also used this procedure in the ''Nude Descending a Staircase''.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, 1971 p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1911, ''Portrait of Chess Players'' (''Portrait de joueurs d'échecs'') there is the Cubist overlapping frames and multiple perspectives of his two brothers playing chess, but to that Duchamp added elements conveying the unseen mental activity of the players. (Notably, "échec" is French for "failure".)

Works from this time also included his first "machine" painting, ''Coffee Mill (Moulin à café)'' (1911), which he gave to his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon. The later more figurative machine painting of 1914, "Chocolate Grinder" (''Broyeuse de chocolat''), prefigures the mechanism incorporated into the ''Large Glass'' on which he began work in New York the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin Tomkins, ''The Bride and the Bachelors'', New York 1962, pp.31-2&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Duchamp - Nude Descending a Staircase.jpg|thumb|right|Marcel Duchamp. ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' (1912). Oil on canvas. 57 7/8" x 35 1/8". [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].]]

===''Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2''===
{{Main|Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2}}
Duchamp's first work to provoke significant controversy was ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]'' ''(Nu descendant un escalier n° 2)'' (1912). The painting depicts the mechanistic motion of a nude, with superimposed facets, similar to motion pictures. It shows elements of both the fragmentation and synthesis of the Cubists, and the movement and dynamism of the [[futurism (art)|Futurists]].

He first submitted the piece to appear at the Cubist [[Salon des Indépendants]], but [[Albert Gleizes]] (according to Duchamp in an interview with Pierre Cabanne, p.&amp;nbsp;31)&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20two/duchamp Peter Brooke, The 'rejection' of Nude Descending a Staircase] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109091932/http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20two/duchamp |date=9 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asked Duchamp's brothers to have him voluntarily withdraw the painting, or to paint over the title that he had painted on the work and rename it something else. Duchamp's brothers did approach him with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt; The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether it should be hung with the Cubist group.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

Of the incident Duchamp later recalled, "I said nothing to my brothers. But I went immediately to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really a turning point in my life, I can assure you. I saw that I would not be very much interested in groups after that."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Duchamp did appear in the illustrations to ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', he participated in the ''[[La Maison Cubiste|La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)]]'', organized by the designer [[André Mare]] for the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1912 (a few months after the Indépendants); he signed the [[Section d'Or]] invitation and participated in the Section d'Or exhibition during the fall of 1912. The impression is, Brooke writes, "it was precisely because he wished to remain part of the group that he withdrew the painting; and that, far from being ill treated by the group, he was given a rather privileged position, probably through the patronage of Picabia".&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;

The painting was exhibited for the first time at [[Galeries Dalmau]], ''Exposició d'Art Cubista'', Barcelona, 1912; the first exhibition of Cubism in Spain&lt;ref name="Robinson et al"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=6EvIx6zOuqgC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=%22August+Agero%22+%22galeries+dalmau%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=egrZl065OV&amp;sig=Jzul0X2w7oi0sxSnSlNlFxlUC4E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYobvKrcPaAhWIxxQKHefzBLMQ6AEIajAN#v=onepage&amp;q=dalmau&amp;f=false William H. Robinson, Jordi Falgàs, Carmen Belen Lord, ''Barcelona and Modernity: Picasso, Gaudí, Miró, Dalí''], Cleveland Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0300121067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp later submitted the painting to the 1913 "[[Armory Show]]" in New York City. In addition to displaying works of American artists, this show was the first major exhibition of modern trends coming out of Paris, encompassing experimental styles of the European [[avant-garde]], including Fauvism, Cubism, and [[Futurism]]. American show-goers, accustomed to realistic art, were scandalized, and the ''Nude'' was at the center of much of the controversy.

==Leaving "retinal art" behind==
At about this time, Duchamp read [[Max Stirner]]'s philosophical tract, ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', the study which he considered another turning point in his artistic and intellectual development. He called it "a remarkable book ... which advances no formal theories, but just keeps saying that the ego is always there in everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tomkins|1996|p=unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Munich in 1912, he painted the last of his Cubist-like paintings. He started ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]]'' image, and began making plans for ''The Large Glass'' – scribbling short notes to himself, sometimes with hurried sketches. It would be more than ten years before this piece was completed. Not much else is known about the two-month stay in Munich except that the friend he visited was intent on showing him the sights and the nightlife, and that he was influenced by the works of the sixteenth century German painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in Munich's famed [[Alte Pinakothek]], known for its Old Master paintings. Duchamp recalled that he took the short walk to visit this museum daily. Duchamp scholars have long recognized in Cranach the subdued ochre and brown color range Duchamp later employed.&lt;ref name="Naumann"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=Marcel Duchamp Slept Here|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/11/art/marcel-duchamp-slept-here|work=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=2014-12-16|date=November 6, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216191723/http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/11/art/marcel-duchamp-slept-here|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Duchamp also attended a performance of a stage adaptation of [[Raymond Roussel]]'s 1910 novel, ''Impressions d'Afrique,'' which featured plots that turned in on themselves, word play, surrealistic sets and humanoid machines. He credited the drama with having radically changed his approach to art, and having inspired him to begin the creation of his ''The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even'', also known as ''The Large Glass''. Work on ''The Large Glass'' continued into 1913, with his invention of inventing a repertoire of forms. He made notes, sketches and painted studies, and even drew some of his ideas on the wall of his apartment.

Toward the end of 1912, he traveled with Picabia, Apollinaire and Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia through the [[Jura mountains]], an adventure that Buffet-Picabia described as one of their "forays of demoralization, which were also forays of witticism and clownery ... the disintegration of the concept of art".&lt;ref name="Mink, J. 2004. Duchamp. Taschen"&gt;Mink, J. (2004). Duchamp. Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp's notes from the trip avoid logic and sense, and have a surrealistic, mythical connotation.

Duchamp painted few canvases after 1912, and in those he did, he attempted to remove "[[painterly]]" effects, and to use a technical drawing approach instead.

His broad interests led him to an exhibition of aviation technology during this period, after which Duchamp said to his friend [[Constantin Brâncuși]], "Painting is washed up. Who will ever do anything better than that propeller? Tell me, can you do that?".&lt;ref name="Mink, J. 2004. Duchamp. Taschen"/&gt; Brâncuși later sculpted [[Bird in Space|bird forms]]. U.S. Customs officials mistook them for aviation parts and attempted to collect import duties on them.

In 1913, Duchamp withdrew from painting circles and began working as a librarian in the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève to be able to earn a living wage while concentrating on scholarly realms and working on his ''Large Glass''. He studied math and physics – areas where exciting new discoveries were taking place. The theoretical writings of [[Henri Poincaré]] particularly intrigued and inspired Duchamp. Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that "understood" them and that no theory could be considered "true". "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H. (1902) Science and Hypothesis. London: Walter Scott Publishing Co., p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the influence of Poincaré's writings, Duchamp tolerated any interpretation of his art by regarding it as the creation of the person who formulated it, not as truth.&lt;ref&gt;Mink, J. (2000). Marcel Duchamp. Art as Anti-Art. Taschen Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's own art-science experiments began during his tenure at the library. To make one of his favorite pieces, ''3 Standard Stoppages'' (''3 stoppages étalon''), he dropped three 1-meter lengths of thread onto prepared canvases, one at a time, from a height of 1 meter. The threads landed in three random undulating positions. He varnished them into place on the blue-black canvas strips and attached them to glass. He then cut three wood slats into the shapes of the curved strings, and put all the pieces into a croquet box. Three small leather signs with the title printed in gold were glued to the "stoppage" backgrounds. The piece appears to literally follow Poincaré's ''School of the Thread'', part of a book on classical mechanics.

In his studio he mounted a bicycle wheel upside down onto a stool, spinning it occasionally just to watch it. Although it is often assumed that the ''Bicycle Wheel'' represents the first of Duchamp's [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|"Readymades"]], this particular installation was never submitted for any art exhibition, and it was eventually lost. However, initially, the wheel was simply placed in the studio to create atmosphere: "I enjoyed looking at it just as I enjoy looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace."&lt;ref&gt;Mink, J. (2004) Duchamp. Taschen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

New York: Viking Press. Hachette UK, Jul 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp felt uncomfortable in Paris. Meanwhile, ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase No. 2]]'' had scandalized Americans at the [[Armory Show]], and helped secure the sale of all four of his paintings in the exhibition. Thus, being able to finance the trip, Duchamp decided to emigrate to the United States in 1915. To his surprise, he found he was a celebrity when he arrived in New York in 1915, where he quickly befriended art patron [[Katherine Dreier]] and artist [[Man Ray]]. Duchamp's circle included art patrons [[Walter Conrad Arensberg|Louise]] and [[Walter Conrad Arensberg]], actress and artist [[Beatrice Wood]] and [[Francis Picabia]], as well as other [[avant-garde]] figures. Though he spoke little English, in the course of supporting himself by giving French lessons, and through some library work, he quickly learned the language. Duchamp became part of an artist colony in [[Ridgefield, New Jersey]], across the [[Hudson River]] from [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=63436#.UcujCm28M6s "Icons of twentieth century photography come to Edinburgh for major Man Ray exhibition"], ArtDaily. Accessed 15 December 2013. "In 1915, whilst at Ridgefield artist colony in New Jersey, he [Man Ray] met the French artist Marcel Duchamp and together they tried to establish a New York outpost of the Dada movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

For two years the Arensbergs, who would remain his friends and patrons for 42 years, were the landlords of his studio. In lieu of rent, they agreed that his payment would be ''The Large Glass''. An art gallery offered Duchamp $10,000 per year in exchange for all of his yearly production, but he declined the offer, preferring to continue his work on ''The Large Glass''.

===Société Anonyme===
Duchamp created the [[Société Anonyme (art)|Société Anonyme]] in 1920, along with Katherine Dreier and Man Ray. This was the beginning of his lifelong involvement in art dealing and collecting. The group collected modern art works, and arranged modern art exhibitions and lectures throughout the 1930s.

By this time [[Walter Pach]], one of the coordinators of the 1913 Armory Show, sought Duchamp's advice on modern art. Beginning with Société Anonyme, Dreier also depended on Duchamp's counsel in gathering her collection, as did Arensberg. Later [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Museum of Modern Art]] directors [[Alfred Barr]] and [[James Johnson Sweeney]] consulted with Duchamp on their modern art collections and shows.

===Dada===
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' 1917, photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]

Dada or Dadaism was an [[art movement]] of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. It began in [[Zurich]], Switzerland in 1916, spreading to [[Berlin]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;de Micheli, Mario(2006). ''Las vanguardias artísticas del siglo XX.'' Alianza Forma. pp.135–137&lt;/ref&gt; To quote Dona Budd's ''The Language of Art Knowledge'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of [[World War I]]. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality, and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Marcel Janco]]'s frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] language. Another theory says that the name "Dada" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'.&lt;ref&gt;Budd, Dona, ''The Language of Art Knowledge'', Pomegranate Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movement primarily involved [[visual arts]], literature, poetry, [[art manifesto]]es, [[aesthetics|art theory]], theatre, and [[graphic design]], and concentrated its [[anti-war]] politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-[[bourgeois]] and had political affinities with the radical left.

Dada activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement, apart from Duchamp, included: [[Hugo Ball]], [[Emmy Hennings]], [[Hans Arp]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Tristan Tzara]], Francis Picabia, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Georg Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Beatrice Wood]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], and [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], among others. The movement influenced later styles, such as the avant-garde and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[surrealism]], [[Nouveau réalisme]], [[pop art]], and [[Fluxus]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to [[postmodernism]], an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that lay the foundation for Surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lowenthal, translator's introduction to [[Francis Picabia]]'s ''I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, And Provocation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New York Dada]] had a less serious tone than that of European Dadaism, and was not a particularly organized venture. Duchamp's friend Francis Picabia connected with the Dada group in Zürich, bringing to New York the Dadaist ideas of absurdity and "anti-art". Duchamp and Picabia first met in September 1911 at the Salon d'Automne in Paris, where they were both exhibiting.  Duchamp showed a larger version of his ''Young Man and Girl in Spring'' 1911, a work that had an Edenic theme and a thinly veiled sexuality also found in Picabia's contemporaneous ''Adam and Eve'' 1911.  According to Duchamp, "our friendship began right there".&lt;ref&gt;'' Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia'' ; Edited by Jennifer Mundy; TATE 2008; p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A group met almost nightly at the [[Walter Arensberg|Arensberg]] home, or caroused in [[Greenwich Village]]. Together with Man Ray, Duchamp contributed his ideas and humor to the New York activities, many of which ran concurrent with the development of his [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]] and ''The Large Glass''.

The most prominent example of Duchamp's association with Dada was his submission of ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal, to the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit in 1917. Artworks in the Independent Artists shows were not selected by jury, and all pieces submitted were displayed. However, the show committee insisted that ''Fountain'' was not art, and rejected it from the show. This caused an uproar among the Dadaists, and led Duchamp to resign from the board of the Independent Artists.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|181–186}}

Along with [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] and Beatrice Wood, Duchamp published a Dada magazine in New York, entitled ''[[The Blind Man]]'', which included art, literature, humor and commentary.

When he returned to Paris after World War I, Duchamp did not participate in the Dada group.

==Readymades==
{{Main|Readymades of Marcel Duchamp}}
"Readymades" were [[found objects]] which Duchamp chose and presented as art. In 1913, Duchamp installed a ''[[Bicycle Wheel]]'' in his studio. However, the idea of ''Readymades'' did not fully develop until 1915. The idea was to question the very notion of Art, and the adoration of art, which Duchamp found "unnecessary".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Interview, BBC TV, Joan Bakewell, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote| My idea was to choose an object that wouldn't attract me, either by its beauty or by its ugliness. To find a point of indifference in my looking at it, you see.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;}}

''[[Bottle Rack]]'' (1914), a bottle drying rack signed by Duchamp, is considered to be the first "pure" readymade. ''[[Prelude to a Broken Arm]]'' (1915), a snow shovel, also called ''In Advance of the Broken Arm'', followed soon after. His ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal signed with the pseudonym "R. Mutt", shocked the art world in 1917.&lt;ref name="Cabanne, P"/&gt; ''Fountain'' was selected in 2004 as "the most influential artwork of the 20th century" by 500 renowned artists and historians.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out:  --&gt;
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1919, L.H.O.O.Q.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Marcel Duchamp, 1919, ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]''&lt;ref name="dadart"&gt;[http://www.dadart.com/dadaism/dada/035a-duchamp-cage.html Marcel Duchamp 1887-1968, dadart.com]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1919, Duchamp made a [[parody]] of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by adorning a cheap reproduction of the painting with a mustache and goatee. To this he added the inscription ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'', a phonetic game which, when read out loud in French quickly sounds like ''"Elle a chaud au cul"''. This can be translated as "She has a hot ass," implying that the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and availability. It may also have been intended as a Freudian joke, referring to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s alleged homosexuality. Duchamp gave a "loose" translation of L.H.O.O.Q. as "there is fire down below" in a late interview with [[Arturo Schwarz]]. According to [[Rhonda Roland Shearer]], the apparent ''Mona Lisa'' reproduction is in fact a copy modeled partly on Duchamp's own face.&lt;ref name="asrl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscienceresearchlab.org/articles/panorama.htm|title=Mona Lisa: Who is Hidden Behind the Woman with the Mustache?|accessdate=27 April 2008|publisher=Art Science Research Laboratory|year=2003|author=Marting, Marco De|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320203734/http://www.artscienceresearchlab.org/articles/panorama.htm|archivedate=20 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published by Shearer also speculates that Duchamp himself may have created some of the objects which he claimed to be "found objects".

==''The Large Glass''==
{{Main|The Large Glass}}
[[File:Duchamp LargeGlass.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Large Glass]]'' (1915–23) [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] Collection]]
Duchamp worked on his complex [[Futurism]]-inspired piece ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even|The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass)]]'' from 1915 to 1923, except for periods in [[Buenos Aires]] and Paris in 1918–1920. He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. He published notes for the piece, ''The Green Box'', intended to complement the visual experience. They reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work. He stated that his "hilarious picture" is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors.

A performance of the stage adaptation of [[Raymond Roussel|Roussel]]'s novel ''Impressions d'Afrique,'' which Duchamp attended in 1912, inspired the piece. Notes, sketches and plans for the work were drawn on his studio walls as early as 1913. In order to concentrate on the work free from material obligations, Duchamp found work as a librarian while living in France. After immigrating to the United States in 1915, he began work on the piece financed by the support of the Arensbergs.

The piece is partly constructed as a retrospective of Duchamp's works, including a three-dimensional reproduction of his earlier paintings ''Bride'' (1912), ''Chocolate Grinder'' (1914) and ''Glider containing a water mill in neighboring metals'' (1913–1915), which has led to numerous interpretations. The work was formally declared "Unfinished" in 1923. Returning from its first public exhibition in a shipping crate, the glass suffered a large crack. Duchamp repaired it, but left the smaller cracks in the glass intact, accepting the chance element as a part of the piece.

[[Joseph Nechvatal]] has cast a considerable light on ''The Large Glass'' by noting the autoerotic implications of both bachelorhood and the repetitive, frenetic machine; he then discerns a larger constellation of themes by insinuating that autoeroticsm — and with the machine as omnipresent partner and practitioner — opens out into a subversive pan-sexuality as expressed elsewhere in Duchamp's work and career, in that a trance-inducing pleasure becomes the operative principle as opposed to the dictates of the traditional male-female coupling; and he as well documents the existence of this theme cluster throughout modernism, starting with Rodin's controversial [[Monument to Balzac]], and culminating in a Duchampian vision of a techno-universe in which one and all can find themselves welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/4/67|author=Joseph Nechvatal|date=18 October 2018|title=Before and Beyond the Bachelor Machine|journal=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7040067|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1969 when the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] revealed Duchamp's ''[[Étant donnés]]'' tableau, ''The Large Glass'' was thought to have been his last major work.

==Kinetic works==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, photo Man Ray, 391 n. 13, July 1920.jpg|thumb|Marcel Duchamp, 1918, ''A regarder d'un oeil, de près, pendant presque une heure, To Be Looked at (from the Other Side of the Glass) with One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour''. Photograph by Man Ray, published in [[391 (magazine)|391]], July 1920 (N13), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
Duchamp's interest in [[kinetic art|kinetic works]] can be discerned as early as the notes for ''[[The Large Glass]]'' and the ''[[Bicycle Wheel]]'' readymade, and despite losing interest in "retinal art," he retained interest in visual phenomena. In 1920, with help from Man Ray, Duchamp built a motorized sculpture, ''Rotative plaques verre, optique de précision'' ("Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics"). The piece, which he did not consider to be art, involved a motor to spin pieces of rectangular glass on which were painted segments of a circle. When the apparatus spins, an optical illusion occurs, where the segments appear to be closed [[Concentric objects|concentric circles]]. Man Ray set up equipment to photograph the initial experiment, but when they turned the machine for the second time, a belt broke, and caught a piece of the glass, which after glancing off Man Ray's head, shattered into bits.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|227–228}}

After moving back to Paris in 1923, at [[André Breton]]'s urging, with financing by [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]], Duchamp built another optical device based on the first one, ''Rotative Demisphère, optique de précision'' (Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics). This time the optical element was a globe cut in half, with black concentric circles painted on it. When it spins, the circles appear to move backward and forward in space. Duchamp asked that Doucet not exhibit the apparatus as art.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|254–255}}

''Rotoreliefs'' were the next phase of Duchamp's spinning works. To make the optical "play toys", he painted designs on flat cardboard circles and spun them on a phonographic turntable. When spinning, the flat disks appeared three-dimensional. He had a printer produce 500 sets of six of the designs, and set up a booth at a 1935 Paris inventors' show to sell them. The venture was a financial disaster, but some optical scientists thought they might be of use in restoring three-dimensional [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] sight to people who have lost vision in one eye.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|301–303}} In collaboration with Man Ray and [[Marc Allégret]], Duchamp filmed early versions of the ''Rotoreliefs'' and they named the film, ''[[Anemic Cinema|Anémic Cinéma]]'' (1926). Later, in [[Alexander Calder]]'s studio in 1931, while looking at the sculptor's kinetic works, Duchamp suggested that these should be called "[[Mobile (sculpture)|mobiles]]". Calder agreed to use this novel term in his upcoming show. To this day, sculptures of this type are called "mobiles".&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"/&gt;{{rp|294}}

==Musical ideas==
Between 1912 and 1915, Duchamp worked with various musical ideas. At least three pieces have survived: two compositions and a note for a musical happening. The two compositions are based on [[Aleatoric music|chance operations]]. ''Erratum Musical'', written for three voices, was published in 1934. ''La Mariée mise à nu par ses célibataires même. Erratum Musical'' is unfinished and was never published or exhibited during Duchamp's lifetime. According to the manuscript, the piece was intended for a mechanical instrument "in which the virtuoso intermediary is suppressed". The manuscript also contains a description for "An apparatus automatically recording fragmented musical periods," consisting of a funnel, several open-end cars and a set of numbered balls.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Kotik. Liner Notes to CD "The Music of Marcel Duchamp", Edition Block + Paula Cooper Gallery, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces predate [[John Cage]]'s ''[[Music of Changes]]'' (1951), which is often considered the first modern piece to be conceived largely through random procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael. 2002. The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians. {{ISBN|0-674-00978-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duchamp and John Cage appeared together at a concert entitled "Reunion", playing a game of chess and composing [[Aleatoric music]] by triggering a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard.&lt;ref name="toutfait.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/lotringer.html |title="Becoming Duchamp" by Sylvère Lotringer |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312133029/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/lotringer.html |archivedate=12 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rrose Sélavy==
[[File:Label for the Belle Haleine cropped.png|thumb|left|200px|''Rrose Sélavy'' (Marcel Duchamp), 1921 photograph by Man Ray, art direction by Marcel Duchamp, silver print, 5-7/8" x 3"-7/8", [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]]]
"Rrose Sélavy", also spelled Rose Sélavy, was one of Duchamp's pseudonyms. The name, a [[pun]], sounds like the French phrase ''[[Eros (concept)|Eros]], c'est la vie'', which may be translated as "Eros, such is life." It has also been read as ''arroser la vie'' ("to make a toast to life"). Sélavy emerged in 1921 in a series of photographs by Man Ray showing Duchamp dressed as a woman. Through the 1920s Man Ray and Duchamp collaborated on more photos of Sélavy. Duchamp later used the name as the byline on written material and signed several creations with it.

Duchamp used the name in the title of at least one [[sculpture]], ''[[Why Not Sneeze Rose Selavy?]]'' (1921).  The sculpture, a type of readymade called an [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], consists of an [[Medical thermometer#Oral|oral thermometer]], a couple of dozen small cubes of [[marble]] resembling [[sugar]] cubes and a [[cuttlefish bone]] inside a [[birdcage]]. Sélavy also appears on the label of ''[[Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette]]'' (1921), a readymade that is a perfume bottle in the original box. Duchamp also signed his film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926) with the Sélavy name.

The inspiration for the name Rrose Sélavy has been thought to be [[Belle da Costa Greene]], [[J.P. Morgan]]'s librarian at [[The Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] (formerly The Pierpont Morgan Library) who, following his death, became the Library's director, working there for a total of forty-three years. Empowered by J.P. Morgan, and then by his son Jack, Greene built the collection buying and selling rare [[manuscripts]], [[books]] and [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=866 Duchamp Bottles Belle Greene: Just Desserts For His Canning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027213202/http://www.toutfait.com/online_journal_details.php?postid=866 |date=27 October 2012 }} by Bonnie Jean Garner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rrose Sélavy, and the other pseudonyms Duchamp used, may be read as a comment on the fallacy of romanticizing the conscious individuality or subjectivity of the artist, a theme that is also a prominent subtext of the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|Readymades]]. Duchamp said in an interview, "You think you're doing something entirely your own, and a year later you look at it and you see actually the roots of where your art comes from without your knowing it at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|title=Marcel Duchamp: The Afternoon Interviews|year=2013|publisher=ARTBOOK {{!}} D.A.P.|location=New York, NY|isbn=1936440393|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 the name Rrose Sélavy also started appearing in a series of [[aphorism]]s, puns, and [[spoonerism]]s by the French [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[poet]] [[Robert Desnos]]. Desnos tried to portray Rrose Sélavy as a long-lost aristocrat and rightful queen of France. Aphorism 13 paid homage to Marcel Duchamp: "Rrose Sélavy connaît bien le marchand du sel" ‒ in English: "Rrose Sélavy knows the [[merchant]] of [[salt]] well"; in French the final words sound like Mar-champ Du-cel. Note that the 'salt seller' aphorism – "mar-chand-du-sel" – is a phonetic rearrangement of the syllables in the artist's name:  "mar-cel-du-champ." (Duchamp's compiled notes are entitled, 'Salt Seller'.) In 1939 a collection of these aphorisms was published under the name of Rrose Sélavy, entitled, ''Poils et coups de pieds en tous genres''.

== Transition from art to chess ==
[[File:Man Ray, 1920, Three Heads (Joseph Stella and Marcel Duchamp), gelatin silver print, 20.7 x 15.7 cm, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|Man Ray, 1920, ''Three Heads'' ([[Joseph Stella]] and Marcel Duchamp, painting bust portrait of Man Ray above Duchamp), gelatin silver print, 20.7 x 15.7 cm, [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]
In 1918, Duchamp took leave of the New York art scene, interrupting his work on the ''Large Glass'', and went to Buenos Aires, where he remained for nine months and often played [[chess]]. He [[woodcarving|carved]] his own [[chess set]] from wood with help from a local craftsman who made the [[Knight (chess)|knights]]. He moved to Paris in 1919, and then back to the United States in 1920. Upon his return to Paris in 1923, Duchamp was, in essence, no longer a practicing artist. Instead, his main interest was chess, which he studied for the rest of his life to the exclusion of most other activities.

Duchamp is seen, briefly, playing chess with Man Ray in the short film ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924) by [[René Clair]]. He designed the 1925 Poster for the Third French Chess Championship, and as a competitor in the event, finished at fifty percent (3–3, with two draws), earning the title of [[chess master]]. During this period his fascination with chess so distressed his first wife that she glued his pieces to the [[chessboard|board]]. Duchamp continued to play in the French Championships and also in the [[Chess Olympiad]]s from 1928–1933, favoring [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodern]] openings such as the [[Nimzo-Indian]].

Sometime in the early 1930s, Duchamp reached the height of his ability, but realized that he had little chance of winning recognition in top-level chess. In the following years, his participation in chess tournaments declined, but he discovered [[correspondence chess]] and became a chess journalist, writing weekly newspaper columns. While his contemporaries were achieving spectacular success in the art world by selling their works to high-society collectors, Duchamp observed,  "I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art—and much more. It cannot be [[commercialized]]. Chess is much purer than art in its social position."&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine. 10 March 1952&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Duchamp elaborated, "The chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a visual design on the chess-board, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem. ... I have come to the personal conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists."&lt;ref&gt;"Marcel Duchamp." Kynaston McShine.1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Duchamp's Problem with White to play&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Duchamp's Problem - Chess Forums - Chess.com|url=https://www.chess.com/forum/view/endgames/marcel-duchamps-problem|website=Chess.com|accessdate=19 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119121038/https://www.chess.com/forum/view/endgames/marcel-duchamps-problem|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1932, Duchamp teamed with chess theorist [[Vitaly Halberstadt]] to publish ''L'opposition et cases conjuguées sont réconciliées'' ([[Opposition (chess)|Opposition]] and Sister Squares are Reconciled), known as [[corresponding squares]]. This treatise describes the [[Corresponding squares#Lasker-Reichhelm position|Lasker-Reichhelm position]], an extremely rare type of position that can arise in the [[Chess endgame|endgame]]. Using [[Enneagram (geometry)|enneagram]]-like charts that fold upon themselves, the authors demonstrated that in this position, the most Black can hope for is a [[Draw (chess)|draw]].

The theme of the "endgame" is important to an understanding of Duchamp's complex attitude toward his artistic career. Irish playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] was an associate of Duchamp, and used the theme as the narrative device for the 1957 play of the same name, ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]''. In 1968, Duchamp played an artistically important chess match with avant-garde composer John Cage, at a concert entitled "Reunion". Music was produced by a series of photoelectric cells underneath the chessboard, triggered sporadically by normal game play.&lt;ref name="toutfait.com"/&gt;

On choosing a career in chess, Duchamp said, "If [[Bobby Fischer]] came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would try to make it positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted."&lt;ref&gt;Brady, Frank: ''Bobby Fischer: profile of a prodigy'', Courier Dover Publications, 1989; p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp left a legacy to chess in the form of an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition ''Through the Big End of the Opera Glass'', printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.&lt;ref&gt;Beliavsky, A &amp; Mikhalchishin, A: ''Winning Endgame Technique'' Batsford, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later artistic involvement==
Although Duchamp was no longer considered to be an active artist, he continued to consult with artists, art dealers and collectors. From 1925 he often traveled between France and the United States, and made New York's Greenwich Village his home in 1942. He also occasionally worked on artistic projects such as the short film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), ''Box in a Valise'' (1935–41), ''Self Portrait in Profile'' (1958) and the larger work ''Étant Donnés'' (1946–66). In 1943, he participated with [[Maya Deren]] in her unfinished film ''[[The Witch's Cradle]]'', filmed in [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[Art of This Century gallery]].

From the mid-1930s onward, he collaborated with the [[surrealism|Surrealists]]; however, he did not join the movement, despite the coaxing of [[André Breton]]. From then until 1944, together with [[Max Ernst]], [[Eugenio Granell]], and Breton, Duchamp edited the Surrealist periodical ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'', and served as an advisory editor for the magazine ''[[View (magazine)|View]]'', which featured him in its March 1945 edition, thus introducing him to a broader American audience.

Duchamp's influence on the art world remained behind the scenes until the late 1950s, when he was "discovered" by young artists such as [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]], who were eager to escape the dominance of [[Abstract Expressionism]]. He was a co-founder of the international literary group [[Oulipo]] in 1960. Interest in Duchamp was reignited in the 1960s, and he gained international public recognition. In 1963, the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] mounted his first retrospective exhibition, and there he appeared in an iconic photograph playing chess opposite nude model [[Eve Babitz]].&lt;ref name="Anolik"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anolik|first=Lili|title=All About Eve—and Then Some|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene|work=Vanity Fair|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=2014-03-01|date=March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228110425/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/eve-babitz-los-angeles-party-scene|archivedate=28 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was later described by the [[Smithsonian Archives of American Art]] as being "among the key documentary images of American modern art".&lt;ref name=Karlstrom&gt;{{cite web|last=Karlstrom|first=Paul|title=Oral history interview with Eve Babitz, 2000 Jun 14|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-eve-babitz-12164|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2014-03-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306082515/http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-eve-babitz-12164|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the [[Tate Gallery]] hosted a large exhibit of his work. Other major institutions, including the [[Philadelphia Art Museum]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], followed with large showings of Duchamp's work. He was invited to lecture on art and to participate in formal discussions, as well as sitting for interviews with major publications. As the last surviving member of the Duchamp family of artists, in 1967 Duchamp helped to organize an exhibition in Rouen, France, called ''Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp''. Parts of this family exhibition were later shown again at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris.

===Exhibition design===
Duchamp participated in the design of the 1938 International Surrealist Exhibition, which was held at the ''Galerie des Beaux-arts'', Paris. The show featured more than 60 artists from different countries, including approximately 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs, and installations. The surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act, and André Breton named Duchamp, [[Wolfgang Paalen]], Man Ray, [[Salvador Dali]], and [[Max Ernst]] to help him. At the exhibition's entrance Breton placed Salvador Dalí's ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'', a work consisting of a [[taxicab]] rigged to produce a drizzle of water down the inside of its windows, with a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat, and a blond [[mannequin]] covered with live [[snail]]s in the back. In this way Duchamp confronted guests entering the exhibition, who were in full evening dress.

''Surrealist Street'' filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists. The main hall was a simulation of a dark subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. In the middle of the grand hall underneath Duchamp's coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]] and reeds, which he called ''Avant La Mare''. A single light bulb provided the only illumination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302054012/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_8.html |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; so patrons were given [[flashlight]]s with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of [[Coffee roasting|roasting coffee]] filled the air. Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl who suddenly arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.

In 1942, for the ''First Papers of Surrealism'' show in New York, surrealists called on Duchamp to design the exhibition. He wove a three-dimensional web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making it almost impossible to see the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |title=Marcel Duchamp |publisher=Toutfait.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623062319/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/interviews/hirschhorn/popup_9.html |archivedate=23 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring young friends to the opening of the show. When the formally-dressed patrons arrived, they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope. When questioned, the children were told to say "Mr. Duchamp told us we could play here". Duchamp's design of the catalog for the show included "found", rather than posed, photographs of the artists.

==Personal  life==
Throughout his adult life, Duchamp  was a passionate smoker of Habana cigars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=door K-films |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdxdm6_les-grandes-repetitions-extraits-de_music |title=see him on film |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2014-05-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512220326/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xdxdm6_les-grandes-repetitions-extraits-de_music |archivedate=12 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp became a United States citizen in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Duchamp|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/marcel-duchamp|website=Guggenheim|accessdate=26 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703130334/https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/marcel-duchamp|archivedate=3 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1927, Duchamp married [[:fr:Lydie Sarazin-Levassor|Lydie Sarazin-Lavassor]]; however, they divorced six months later. It was rumored that Duchamp had chosen a marriage of convenience, because Sarazin-Lavassor was the daughter of a wealthy automobile manufacturer. Early in January 1928, Duchamp said that he could no longer bear the responsibility and confinement of marriage, and they were soon divorced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pontus Hultén|Hulten, Pontus]].

Between 1946 and 1951 [[Maria Martins (artist)|Maria Martins]] was his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/arts/design/28duchamp.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;  |title=Landscape of Eros, Through the Peephole |last=Cotter |first=Holland |date=August 27, 2009 |website=nytimes.com |access-date=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he and [[Alexina Duchamp|Alexina "Teeny" Sattler]] married. They remained together until his death.

Duchamp died suddenly and peacefully in the early morning of 2 October 1968 at his home in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], France. After an evening dining at home with his friends Man Ray and [[:fr:Robert Lebel (critique)|Robert Lebel]], Duchamp retired at 1:05&amp;nbsp;A.M., collapsed in his studio, and died of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Marcel+Duchamp+died+peacefully&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mg3KUcGACYjK4ASZx4CAAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Duchamp%20died%20peacefully&amp;f=false |title=Rudolf Ernst Kuenzli, Francis M.

Duchamp was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogues with Marcel Duchamp|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780786749713|page=106|quote=Cabanne: "Do you believe in God?"

Even in his death, Duchamp retained a sense of humor (a means for him of reaffirming his freedom, while undermining absolutes and certainties).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

He advised modern art collectors, such as Peggy Guggenheim and other prominent figures, thereby helping to shape the tastes of [[Western art history|Western art]] during this period.&lt;ref name="TomkinsBio"&gt;Tomkins: ''Duchamp: A Biography''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't know what pages right now. I'll have to read the book again. -sparkit--&gt; He challenged conventional thought about artistic processes and rejected the emerging art market, through subversive anti-art.&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, 1966, p.38-39&lt;/ref&gt; He famously dubbed a urinal art and named it ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]''. Duchamp produced relatively few artworks and remained mostly aloof of the avant-garde circles of his time. He went on to pretend to abandon art and devote the rest of his life to chess, while secretly continuing to make art.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Chilvers &amp; John Glaves-Smith, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Duchamp said of creativity,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Duchamp, from Session on the Creative Act, Convention of the American Federation of Arts, Houston, Texas, April 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duchamp in his later life explicitly expressed negativity toward art. In a BBC interview with Duchamp conducted by [[Joan Bakewell]] in 1968 he compared art with religion, saying that he wished to do away with art the same way many have done away with religion. Duchamp goes on to explain to the interviewer that "the word art etymologically means to do," that art means activity of any kind, and that it is our society that creates "purely artificial" distinctions of being an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Bakewell in conversation with Marcel Duchamp|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04826th|website=BBC Arts|date=1968|accessdate=8 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926044032/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04826th|archivedate=26 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marcel Duchamp | isbn = 9780262610728 | author1 = Kuenzli | first1 = Rudolf Ernst | last2 = Naumann | first2 = Francis M | year = 1990 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170122065407/https://books.google.com/books?id=Hn5f4u3PUVoC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=bbc+1966+interview+duchamp+joan+bakewell#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate = 22 January 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation erroneously attributed to Duchamp suggests a negative attitude toward later trends in 20th century art:

{{quote|This Neo-Dada, which they call New Realism, Pop Art, Assemblage, etc., is an easy way out, and lives on what Dada did. When I discovered the ready-mades I sought to discourage aesthetics. In Neo-Dada they have taken my readymades and found aesthetic beauty in them, I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal into their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty.}}

However, this was written in 1961 by fellow Dadaist [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], in the second person, i.e. "You threw the bottle-rack...". Although a marginal note in the letter suggests that Duchamp generally approved of the statement, Richter did not make the distinction clear until many years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/girst2/girst1.html "(Ab)Using Marcel Duchamp: The Concept of the Readymade in Post-War and Contemporary American Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507233803/http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_5/articles/girst2/girst1.html |date=7 May 2006 }} by Thomas Girst at toutfait.com, Issue 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp's attitude was more favorable, however, as evidenced by another statement made in 1964:

{{quote|Pop Art is a return to "conceptual" painting, virtually abandoned, except by the Surrealists, since [Gustave] Courbet, in favor of retinal painting... If you take a Campbell soup can and repeat it 50 times, you are not interested in the retinal image. What interests you is the concept that wants to put 50 Campbell soup cans on a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Constable, "New York's Avant-garde, and How It Got There," ''New York Herald Tribune'', May 17, 1964, p. 10,  cited in Jennifer Gough-Cooper and Jacques Caumont, "Ephemerides on and about Marcel Duchamp and Rrose Sélavy, 1887-1968," in Pontus Hulten, ed., ''Marcel Duchamp'', Cambridge, MIT Press, 1993, entry for May 17, 1964. See also [[Campbell's Soup Cans#Message]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Marcel Duchamp Prize|Prix Marcel Duchamp]] (Marcel Duchamp Prize), established in 2000, is an annual award given to a young artist by the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]. In 2004, as a testimony to the legacy of Duchamp's work to the art world, a panel of prominent artists and art historians voted ''Fountain'' "the most influential artwork of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt;

[[File:The Yuza-no-ki.jpg|thumb|A teaching material in [[Ashikaga Gakko]] (Japan) to teach students the importance of moderation. The cup is inclined when it's empty. When you pour water into it, it goes upright. If you pour more water, it becomes inclined again.]]

'''Moderation''' is the process of eliminating or lessening extremes.  It is used to ensure [[Assimilation (sociology)|normality]] throughout the medium on which it is being conducted.  Common uses of moderation include:
*Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of [[Test (student assessment)|student assessments]].
*A [[Forum moderator|moderator]] may remove unsuitable contributions from the [[website]], [[Internet forum|forum]] or [[IRC channel]] they represent in accordance with their [[moderation system]].
*A more proactive nuance is found in the [[Methodist]] church's use of the term for the heads of its conferences.
*A [[neutron moderator]] is used to slow down [[neutron]]s in a [[nuclear reactor]].
*A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

Moderation is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]] bore the inscription ''Meden Agan'' ({{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}}) - 'Nothing in excess'. Doing something "in moderation" means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels.

According to the [[history of science and technology|historian]] and [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]] [[Steven Shapin]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]], ''Never Pure: Historical Studies of Science as if It Was Produced by People with Bodies, Situated in Time, Space, Culture, and Society, and Struggling for Credibility and Authority'', second edition, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2010, 568 pages, page 245 ({{ISBN|978-0801894213}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|From the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] through the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] and [[Galen|Galenic]] corpus, and in the writings of such [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers as [[Epictetus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], health was seen to flow from observing ''moderation'' – in exercise, in study, and in diet.}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Venne Merrymaking peasants.jpg|thumb|''Everything in moderation'', illustration of a [[proverb]] by [[Adriaen van de Venne]], 1650s, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
Similarly, in [[Christianity]], ''moderationism'' is the position that drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s temperately is permissible, though [[drunkenness]] is forbidden (see [[Christianity and alcohol]]).

In the [[Book of Wisdom]] moderation is listed among the greatest virtues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/8#7|title=scripture|website=www.usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taoism ===

Moderation is considered a key part of one's personal development in Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophy and religion and is one of the three jewels of Taoist thought. There is nothing that cannot be moderated including one's actions, one's desires and even one's thoughts. It is believed that by doing so one achieves a more natural state, faces less resistance in life and recognises one's limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoism.net/articles/mason/ethics.htm#Moderation|title=Taoist Ethics|website=www.taoism.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to the extreme, moderation is complex and can be difficult to not only accept, but also understand and implement. It can also be recursive in that one should moderate how much one moderates (i.e. to not be too worried about moderating everything or not to try too hard in finding a middle ground)

Moderation as a principle of Taoist philosophy turns up in all three of its main texts. 

=== Others ===

Moderation is a characteristic of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym [[Lagom]]. 

[[Islamic Modernism|Moderate Muslims]] adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way to grasp meaning from the [[Quran]].

In an [[internet forum]] a moderator is one who enforces the rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11017">'''Moral skepticism''' (or '''moral scepticism''') is a [[Class (philosophy)|class]] of  [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theories all members of which [[logical consequence|entail]] that no one has any moral knowledge. Many moral skeptics also make the stronger, [[Modal logic|modal]] claim that [[Moral nihilism|moral knowledge is impossible]]. Moral skepticism is particularly opposed to [[moral realism]]: the view that there are knowable and objective moral truths.

Some defenders of moral skepticism include [[Pyrrho]], [[Aenesidemus]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[David Hume]], [[J. L. Mackie]] (1977), [[Max Stirner]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]] (2001), [[Michael Ruse]], Joshua Greene, Richard Garner, [[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] (2006b), and the psychologist [[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]]. Strictly speaking, [[Gilbert Harman]] (1975) argues in favor of a kind of [[moral relativism]], not moral skepticism. However, he has influenced some contemporary moral skeptics.

==Forms of moral skepticism==
Moral skepticism divides into three subclasses: moral error theory (or [[moral nihilism]]), epistemological moral skepticism, and [[Non-cognitivism|noncognitivism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/ Moral Skepticism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these theories share the same conclusions, which are:

:(a) we are never justified in believing that moral claims (claims of the form "state of affairs x is good," "action y is morally obligatory," etc.) are true and, even more so
:(b) we never know that any moral claim is true.

However, each method arrives at (a) and (b) by different routes.

Moral error theory holds that we do not know that any moral claim is true because
:(i) all moral claims are false,
:(ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false, and so, because
:(iii) since we are not justified in believing any claim we have reason to deny, we are not justified in believing any moral claims.

Epistemological moral skepticism is a subclass of theory, the members of which include [[Pyrrhonian]] moral skepticism and dogmatic moral skepticism. All members of epistemological moral skepticism share two things in common: first they acknowledge that we are unjustified in believing any moral claim, and second, they are [[agnostic]] on whether (i) is true (i.e. on whether all moral claims are false).
*Pyrrhonian moral skepticism holds that the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim is that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral claim is true or that any moral claim is false. Thus, in addition to being agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).
*Dogmatic moral skepticism, on the other hand, ''affirms'' (ii) and cites (ii)'s truth as the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim.

Finally, Noncognitivism holds that we can never know that any moral claim is true because moral claims are ''incapable'' of being true or false (they are not [[truth-apt]]). Instead, moral claims are [[Universal prescriptivism|imperatives]] (e.g. "Don't steal babies!"), [[emotivism|expressions of emotion]] (e.g. "stealing babies: Boo!"), or [[expressivism|expressions of "pro-attitudes"]] ("I do not believe that babies should be stolen.")

==Moral error theory==
Moral [[error theory]] is a position characterized by its commitment to two propositions: (i) all moral claims are false and (ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false. The most famous moral error theorist is J. L. Mackie, who defended the metaethical view in ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977). Mackie has been interpreted as giving two arguments for moral error theory.

The first argument people attribute to Mackie, often called the [[argument from queerness]],&lt;ref&gt;D. Brink, "Moral Realism and the Skeptical Arguments from Disagreement and Queerness," ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 62 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; holds that moral claims imply motivation internalism (the doctrine that "It is necessary and ''a priori'' that any agent who judges that one of his available actions is morally obligatory will have some (defeasible) motivation to perform that action" &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Joyce, Richard (2001). ''The Myth of Morality'', [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Because motivation internalism is false, however, so too are all moral claims.

The other argument often attributed to Mackie, often called the argument from disagreement,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; maintains that any moral claim (e.g. "Killing babies is wrong") entails a correspondent "reasons claim" ("one has reason not to kill babies"). Put another way, if "killing babies is wrong" is true then everybody has a reason to not kill babies. This includes the psychopath who takes great pleasure from killing babies, and is utterly miserable when he does not have their blood on his hands. But, surely, (if we assume that he will suffer no reprisals) this psychopath has every reason to kill babies, and no reason not to do so. All moral claims are thus false.

==Epistemological moral skepticism==
All versions of epistemological moral skepticism hold that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. However, in contradistinction to moral error theory, epistemological moral skeptical arguments for this conclusion do not include the premise that "all moral claims are false." For example, Michael Ruse &lt;ref&gt;M. Ruse, ''Taking Darwin Seriously'' (Oxford: [[Basil Blackwell]], 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; gives what Richard Joyce &lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  calls an "evolutionary argument" for the conclusion that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. He argues that we have evolved to believe moral propositions because our believing the same enhances our genetic fitness (makes it more likely that we will reproduce successfully). However, our believing these propositions would enhance our fitness even if they were all false (they would make us more cooperative, etc.). Thus, our moral beliefs are unresponsive to evidence; they are analogous to the beliefs of a [[paranoiac]]. As a paranoiac is plainly unjustified in believing his [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], so too are we unjustified in believing moral propositions. We therefore have reason to jettison our moral beliefs.

==Consequences==

There are two different opinions that may follow from moral skepticism.

[[Amoralism]] is the idea that we should abandon morality.

[[John E. Hare]] claims there are some reasons to obey moral rules. He claims that amoralists are logically consistent, but have plenty of disadvantages in their lives.&lt;ref name="Gressis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gressis|first1=Robert|title=God and Morality: A Philosophical History, Reviewed|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23248-god-and-morality-a-philosophical-history/|website=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018164107/http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23248-god-and-morality-a-philosophical-history/|archivedate=18 October 2015|date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of moral skepticism come primarily from [[moral realism|moral realists]]. The moral realist argues that there is in fact good reason to believe that there are objective moral truths and that we are justified in holding many moral beliefs. One moral realist response to moral error theory holds that it "proves too much"—if moral claims are false because they entail that we have reasons to do certain things regardless of our preferences, then so too are "hypothetical imperatives" (e.g. "if you want to get your hair-cut you ought to go to the barber"). This is because all hypothetical imperatives imply that "we have reason to do that which will enable us to accomplish our ends" and so, like moral claims, they imply that we have reason to do something ''regardless'' of our preferences.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/lillehammer/CIG-chapter3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616140214/http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/teaching_staff/lillehammer/CIG-chapter3.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-16 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

If moral claims are false because they have this implication, then so too are hypothetical imperatives. But hypothetical imperatives are true. Thus the argument from the non-instantiation of (what Mackie terms) "objective prescriptivity" for moral error theory fails. Russ Shafer-Landau and Daniel Callcut have each outlined anti-skeptical strategies. Callcut argues that moral skepticism should be scrutinized in introductory ethics classes in order to get across the point that "if all views about morality, including the skeptical ones, face difficulties, then adopting a skeptical position is not an escape from difficulty."
&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Callcut, “The Value of Teaching Moral Skepticism,” in ''Teaching Philosophy'' Volume 29, Number 3 (Sept 2006), p.231, paper online at http://philpapers.org/archive/CALTVO-2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8139">'''Narcissistic elation''' or '''narcissistic coenaesthetic expansion''' were terms used by Hungarian psychoanalyst [[Béla Grunberger]] to highlight 'the narcissistic situation of the primal self in narcissistic union with the mother'.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Figlio, ''Psychoanalysis, Science and Masculinity'' (2001) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic elation has also been used more widely to describe a variety of conditions, including states of being in [[love]], of triumph,  and of obtaining self-understanding.

== Grunberger's definition==

The term was coined to describe the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus: a state of [[megalomania]]cal happiness amounting to a perfect homeostasis, devoid of needs or desires. The ideal here is bliss experienced in absolute withdrawal from the object and from the outside world. Narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness. Narcissistic elation is characteristic of an object relationship that is played out, in its negative version, as a state of splendid isolation, and, in its positive version, as a desperate quest for fusion with the other, for a mirror-image relationship. It involves a return to paradise lost and all that is attached to this idea: fusion, self-love, megalomania, omnipotence, immortality, and invulnerability. After birth, the infant continues to enjoy the protonarcissistic existence as before, and this is reinforced by the fact that people around it, in particular the mother, meet all its needs and wishes. This state of illusion is soon compromised, however, as inevitable frustrations begin to occur. The traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence, nevertheless provide a source of psychic energy that will remain active throughout life. The child, and later the adult, will seek to preserve and return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy. Perhaps, after all, what fascinated Narcissus was the sight—beyond his own reflection—of the amniotic water, and the deep, regressive promise of happiness that it held out. Following an initial period of elation known as the "honeymoon", psychoanalytic treatment must succeed in bringing together the narcissistic elements of the self by integrating them into interpretations of reality: ego-libido and object-libido must arrive at a satisfactory compromise.

==Oceanic origins==

[[Freud]] had used the term [[oceanic feeling]] to describe 'an early phase of ego-feeling...the oceanic feeling, which might seek something like the restoration of limitless [[narcissism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Grunberger and [[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] have subsequently 'traced narcissism to pre-natal states of elation, making it biological and drive-driven'.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Kilbourne, ''Disappearing Persons'' (2002) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Building on 'the state of prenatal beatitude, which according to him characterizes the life of the fetus', Grunberger therefore considered that 'narcissistic elation is at once the memory of this unique and privileged state of elation; a sense of well-being of completeness and omnipotence linked to that memory, and pride in having experienced this state, pride in its (illusory) oneness'.

==Ego ideal==
{{Main|Ego ideal}}
Freud also explored how 'in cases of [[mania]] the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and ego ideal have fused together...in a mood of triumph and self-satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Grunberger considered such states as reaching back to the primal narcissistic elation, and as drawing on 'traces of this state of elation and megalomania, based on the notions of harmony and omnipotence'.

Building on his work, [[Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel]] claims that 'it is indeed therefore narcissistic elation, the meeting of ego and ideal, that dissolves the [[Id, ego and super-ego|superego]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, ''The Ego Ideal'' (1985) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; One may consider in general that 'the feeling of triumph...brings with it "oceanic" feelings, because it represents reunion with the omnipotent one'.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph R. Greenson, "On Gambling", in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toddling==
With respect to a slightly later phase of early development, [[Margaret Mahler]] 'describes the practising junior [[toddler|toddler's]] [[omnipotent]] exhilaration (excitement) and narcissistic elation (joy)'&lt;ref&gt;Allan N. Schore, ''Affect Regulation and the Origins of the Self'' (1999) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; at learning to walk—the 'tremendously exhilarating, truly dramatic effect that upright locomotion had'—noting however that 'it is precisely at the point where the child is at the peak of his delusion of omnipotence...that his narcissism is particularly vulnerable to deflation'.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret S. Mahler, ''The Psychological Birth of the Human Infant'' (London 1975) p. 74 and p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the toddler's new achievement, 'from dawn to dusk he marches around in an ecstatic, drunken dance...quite in love with himself for being so clever'.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1996) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-understanding==

Narcissistic elation may subsequently be reactivated within a therapeutic context. [[Edmund Bergler]] wrote of 'the narcissistic elation that comes from self-understanding';&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Lindesmith, ''Addiction and Opiates'' (2008) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] described what he called the re-emergence of '"narcissistic omnipotent object relations"...in the clinical situation'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Grotstein, "Foreword", in [[Neville Symington]], ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat similarly, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] spoke of 'the megalomaniac ebriety which...[i]s the index of the termination of the analysis in present practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997( p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love==

In later life, the adult may seek to 'return to this narcissistic mode of being, notably through music, passionate love, or mystical ecstasy'. For some, the whole 'purpose of love...[is] equal exchange in an atmosphere of shared narcissistic elation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Starobinski, ''Blessings in Disguise'' (1993) p. 43-4&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others may consider as ultimately futile this 'search for a pure narcissistic exaltation, the elation procured by [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the imaginary]] contemplation of the object';&lt;ref&gt;Chasseguet-Smirgal, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; and yet still recognise the power of 'the enchantment of love...as the exaltation of the other...this breathlessness which, with the other, has created the most false of demands, that of narcissistic satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1993) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

In ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', a 'cold intellectual arrogance and narcissistic elation' have been identified in 'the highly ambitious speculations attributed to [[Stephen Dedalus|Stephen]]—the central protagonist—with respect to aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;André Bleikasten, ''The Most Splendid Failure'' (1976) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15552">'''National trauma''' is a concept in [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]]. A national trauma is one in which the effects of a trauma apply generally to the members of a collective group such as a country or other well-defined group of people. Trauma is an injury that has the potential to severely negatively affect an individual, whether [[Major trauma|physically]] or [[Psychological trauma|psychologically]].  Psychological trauma is a shattering of the fundamental assumptions that a person has about themselves and the world.&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|title=Shattered Assumptions: Towards a New Psychology of Trauma|date=1992|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0029160152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7OVCUpFiLgC&amp;dq|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An adverse experience that is unexpected, painful, extraordinary, and shocking results in interruptions in ongoing processes or relationships and may also create [[Maladaptation|maladaptive responses]].&lt;ref name="Neal2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neal|first1=Arthur G.|title=National Trauma and Collective Memory: Extraordinary Events in the American Experience|date=2005|publisher=Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=978-0765615817|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irs2272ORb4C&amp;dq|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such experiences can affect not only an individual but can also be collectively experienced by an entire group of people.&lt;ref name="Neal2005" /&gt; Tragic experiences can collectively wound or threaten the [[national identity]],&lt;ref name="Elovitz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elovitz|first1=Paul H.|title=Presidential Responses to National Trauma: Case Studies of G.W. Bush, Carter, and Nixon|journal=The Journal of Psychohistory|date=Summer 2008|volume=36|issue=1|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; that sense of belonging shared by a nation as a whole represented by tradition culture, language, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|title =Definition of National Identity in English|date =|accessdate =|website =Oxford Dictionaries|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151117063449/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/national-identity|archivedate =2015-11-17|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In individual psychological trauma, fundamental assumptions about how the individual relates to the world, such as that the world is benevolent and meaningful and that the individual has worth in the world, are overturned by overwhelming life experiences.&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman" /&gt;  Similarly, national trauma overturns fundamental assumptions of social identity – something terrible has happened and social life has lost its predictability.&lt;ref name="Neal2005" /&gt; The causes of such shatterings of assumptions are diverse and defy neat categorization.  For example, wars are not always national traumas; while the Vietnam War is experienced by Americans as a national trauma&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiernan|first1=David|title=Why Americans still can’t move past Vietnam|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/10/10/why-americans-still-cant-move-past-vietnam/|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=Washington Post|date=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] famously titled the closing volume of his history of the [[The Second World War (book series)|Second World War]] ''Triumph and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|last2=Keegan|first2=John|title=Triumph and Tragedy: The Second World War, Volume 6|date=1954|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=978-0304929733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VArC_rYqimoC|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar types of natural disasters can also provoke different responses. The [[2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire]] in Alberta was a collective trauma for not only that local community but also the large Canadian Province of Alberta despite causing no direct deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koziol|first1=Carol A.|title=Individual and Collective Trauma: The Fort McMurray Fire|url=https://www.academia.edu/30682848|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Academia|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet the much larger [[Peshtigo Fire]] responsible for thousands of deaths is largely forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hipke|first1=Deana C.|title=The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871|url=http://www.peshtigofire.info/|website=The Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responses to national trauma also vary.  A nation that experiences clear defeat in war which had mobilized the nation to a high degree will almost inevitably also experience national trauma but the way in which that defeat is felt can change the response.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schivelbusch|first1=Wolfgang|title=The culture of defeat : on national trauma, mourning, and recovery|date=2004|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=978-0312423193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcUTAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former peoples of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]] both created post-war mythologies (the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] in the former and the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|Stab-in-the-back Myth]] in the latter) of "glorious" defeat in unfair fights.&lt;ref name="Schivelbusch" /&gt;  The post-war experience of Germany after World War Two, however, is much more complex and provoked reactions from a sense of [[German collective guilt|German national guilt]]&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Mark|title=How World War II shaped modern Germany|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/05/how-world-war-ii-shaped-modern-germany|accessdate=1 December 2017|work=euronews|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collective ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowie|first1=Laura|title=The Impact of World War Two on the Individual and Collective Memory of Germany and its Citizens|url=https://www.societies.ncl.ac.uk/pgfnewcastle/files/2015/05/Bowie-The-Impact-of-World-War-Two.pdf|publisher=Newcastle University|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common national response to these traumas is repeated calls for national unity and moral purification, as in the post-9/11 United States&lt;ref name="Janoff-Bulman&amp;Sheikh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janoff-Bulman|first1=Ronnie|last2=Sana|first2=Sheikh|title=From national trauma to moralizing nation."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">'''Negative staining''' is an established method, often used in diagnostic [[microscopy]], for contrasting a thin specimen with an optically opaque fluid. In this technique, the background is stained, leaving the actual specimen untouched, and thus visible. This contrasts with 'positive staining', in which the actual specimen is stained.

For [[bright field microscopy]], negative staining is typically performed using a black ink fluid such as nigrosin and India ink. The specimen, such as a wet [[bacteria]]l culture spread on a glass slide, is mixed with the negative stain and allowed to dry. When viewed with the [[microscope]] the bacterial cells, and perhaps their [[spore]]s, appear light against the dark surrounding background. An alternative method has been developed using an ordinary waterproof marking pen to deliver the negative stain.&lt;ref&gt;S. Woeste and P. Demchick (1991). Appl Environ Microbiol. 57(6): 1858-1859 http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/6/1858&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[transmission electron microscopy]], opaqueness to [[electron]]s is related to the [[atomic number]], i.e., the number of protons. Some suitable negative stains include [[ammonium molybdate]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl formate]], [[phosphotungstic acid]], [[osmium tetroxide]], osmium ferricyanide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle| author = D. Chadwick| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| year = 2002| isbn = 0-470-84479-5| pages =259–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[auroglucothionate]]. These have been chosen because they scatter electrons strongly and also adsorb to biological matter well. The structures which can be negatively stained are much smaller than those studied with the light microscope. Here, the method is used to view [[virus]]es, bacteria, bacterial [[flagella]], [[biological membrane]] structures and [[protein]]s or protein aggregates, which all have a low electron-scattering power.  Some stains, such as osmium tetroxide and osmium ferricyanide, are very chemically active. As strong oxidants, they cross-link lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, and thereby both fix biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stain them.&lt;ref name="Bozzola"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-7637-0192-5|chapter = Specimen Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscopy|pages = 21&amp;ndash;31|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&amp;pg=PA21|first = John J.|last = Bozzola|author2=Russell, Lonnie D.| year = 1999|publisher = Jones and Bartlett|location = Sudbury, Mass.|title = Electron microscopy : principles and techniques for biologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 45–61| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nfsVMH8it1kC| title = Principles and techniques of electron microscopy: biological applications| author = M.

The choice of negative stain in [[electron microscopy]] can be very important. An early study of plant viruses using negatively stained leaf dips from a diseased plant showed only spherical viruses with one stain and only rod-shaped viruses with another. The verified conclusion was that this plant suffered from a mixed infection by two separate viruses. 
Negative staining at both light microscope and electron microscope level should never be performed with [[infection|infectious]] organisms unless stringent safety precautions are followed. Negative staining is usually a very mild preparation method and thus does not reduce the possibility of operator infection.

'''''Nirvana''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|nirvāṇa}}''; [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|nibbana}}'', ''{{IAST|nibbāna}}'') is the earliest and most common term used to describe the goal of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] path.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}} The literal meaning is "blowing out" or "quenching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the ultimate spiritual goal in Buddhism and marks the [[soteriological]] release from rebirths in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]''.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}}{{Sfn|Keown|2004|pp=194-195}} Nirvana is part of the Third Truth on "cessation of ''[[dukkha]]''" in the [[Four Noble Truths]],{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|pp=589-590}} and the ''[[summum bonum]]'' destination of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].{{Sfn|Keown|2004|pp=194-195}}

Within the Buddhist tradition, this term has commonly been interpreted as the extinction of the "three fires",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=65}} or "three poisons",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gombrichthreefires"|According to Gombrich, the use of the term "three fires" alludes to the three fires which a brahmin householder had to keep alight, and tend daily. In later Buddhism, the origin of this metaphor was forgotten, and the term was replaced with "the three poisons.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}}} passion (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]''), aversion (''[[dvesha]]'') and ignorance (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' or ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}} When these ''fires'' are extinguished, release from the cycle of rebirth (''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'') is attained.

Nirvana has also been deemed in Buddhism to be identical with ''[[anatta]]'' (non-self) and ''[[sunyata]]'' (emptiness) states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39726-1|pages=82–84}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Genjun Sasaki |title=Linguistic Approach to Buddhist Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUBPAzlxJPUC |year=1986|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0038-0 |pages=124–125 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton |title=Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pE9lwuScpWwC |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7007-1280-9 |pages=18–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Choong1999p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mun-Keat Choong|title=The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJafx7uO0VsC| year=1999| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass| isbn=978-81-208-1649-7| pages=1–4, 85–88}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author= Ray Billington|title= Understanding Eastern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dACFAgAAQBAJ |year=2002|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-79348-8 |pages=58–60 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy|title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8 |pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, with the development of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as the absence of the weaving (''vana'') of activity of the mind,{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} the elimination of desire, and escape from the woods, cq. the five ''[[skandha]]s'' or aggregates.

Buddhist scholastic tradition identifies two types of nirvana: ''sopadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana with a remainder), and ''[[parinirvana]]'' or ''anupadhishesa-nirvana'' (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=590}} The founder of Buddhism, the Buddha, is believed to have reached both these states.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=590}} 

''Nirvana'', or the liberation from cycles of rebirth, is the highest aim of the [[Theravada]] tradition. In the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the highest goal is ''[[Buddhahood]]'',  in which there is no abiding in Nirvana, but a Buddha continues to take rebirths in the world to help liberate beings from ''saṃsāra'' by teaching the Buddhist path.

==Etymology==
The term ''nirvana'' describes a state of freedom from suffering and rebirth,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}} but different Buddhist traditions have interpreted the concept in different ways.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{refn|group=quote|Buswell: "It is found in dictionaries as an English word, nirvana, and has acquired a patina that makes many assume its meaning is obvious. Yet, it is a word about which Buddhists themselves have never reached agreement.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}} The origin is probably pre-Buddhist,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} and its etymology may not be conclusive for its meaning.{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} The term was a more or less central concept among the Jains, the Ajivikas, the Buddhists, and certain Hindu traditions, and it may have been imported into Buddhism with much of its semantic range from other [[Sramanism|sramanic]] movements.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}

Nirvana has a wide range of meanings,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}} although the literal meaning is "blowing out" or "quenching".{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} It refers both to the act and the effect of blowing (at something) to put it out, but also the process and outcome of burning out, becoming extinguished.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{refn|group=quote|Buswell: "The Sanskrit term nirvana is an action noun signifying the act and effect of blowing (at something) to put it out, to blow out, or to extinguish, but the noun also signifies the process and outcome of burning out, becoming extinguished, cooling down, and hence, allaying, calming down, and also taming, making docile. Technically, in the religious traditions of India, the term denotes the process of accomplishing and experiencing freedom from the unquenchable thirst of desire and the pains of repeated births, lives, and deaths.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}}

The term ''nirvana'' in the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] sense of "blown out, extinguished" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishad]]s. According to [[Steven Collins (Buddhist studies scholar)|Collins]], "the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, is found in ancient texts of non-Buddhist Indian traditions, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Müller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
The prevalent interpretation of nirvana as "extinction" is based on the etymology of ''nir√vā'' to "blow out".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}} ''Nir'' is a negative, while ''va'' is commonly taken to refer to "to blow".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}}

The term ''nirvana'' is part of an extensive metaphorical structure that was probably established at a very early age in Buddhism. According to Gombrich, the number of three fires alludes to the three fires which a Brahmin had to keep alight, and thereby symbolise life in the world, as a family-man.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} The meaning of this metaphor was lost in later Buddhism,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{refn|group=quote|Gombrich: "I hope it is not too farfetched to suggest that this may have contributed to an important development in the Mahayana: that it came to separate nirvana from bodhi, 'awakening' to the truth, Enlightenment, and to put a lower value on the former (Gombrich, 1992d). Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving, with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth. This interpretation ignores the third fire, delusion: the extinction of delusion is of course in the early texts identical with what can be positively expressed as gnosis, Enlightenment.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66-67}}}} and other explanations of the word ''nirvana'' were sought. Not only passion, hatred and delusion were to be extinguished, but also all cankers (''asava'') or defilements (''khlesa'').{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|Not only the three fires, but also the extinction of the defilements and ''tanha'' are mentioned as ''nirvana'':{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 934-953}}

It thus signifies the extinguishing of the worldly "fires" of greed, hatred, and delusion. But the Pali commentators prefer to treat it as the negation of, or "departure from" (nikkhantatta), the entanglement (vāna) of craving, the derivation which is offered here. For as long as one is entangled by craving, one remains bound in saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death; but when all craving has been extirpated, one attains Nibbāna, deliverance from the cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 5193-5198}}}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|pp=51-52, Quote: Etymologically [nirvana] means "to blow out" or "to extinguish," not transitively, but as a fire ceases to draw.

**  based on this root, ''vana'' has been metaphorically explained by Buddhist scholars as referring to the "forest of defilements",{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}} or the [[skandha|five aggregates]];{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} ''nirvana'' then means "escape from the aggregates",{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} or to be "free from that forest of defilements".{{sfn|Collins|2010|p=64}}{{refn|group=note|Gombrich explains that the five ''skandhas'' or aggregates are the bundles of firewood that fuel the three fires.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=67}} The Buddhist practitioner ought to "drop" these bundles, so that the fires are no longer fueled and "blow out".{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=67-68}}}}

The "blowing out" does not mean total annihilation,{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}} but the extinguishing of a flame, which returns, and exists in another way.{{sfn|Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=262}} The term ''nirvana'' can also be used as a verb: "he or she nirvāṇa-s," or "he or she parinirvānṇa-s" (''parinibbāyati'').{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=75}}{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "Literally nirvāṇa means 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing', although Buddhist commentarial writings, by a play on words, like to explain it as 'the absence of craving'. But where English translations of Buddhist texts have 'he attains nirvāṇa/parinirvāṇa', the more characteristic Pali or Sanskrit idiom is a simple verb: 'he or she nirvāṇa-s' or more often 'he or she parinirvānṇa-s' (parinibbāyati). What the Pali and Sanskrit expression primarily indicates is the event or process of the extinction of the 'fires' of greed, aversion, and delusion."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=75}}}}

The term ''nirvana'', "to blow out",{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|pp=51-52}} has also been interpreted as the extinction of the "three fires",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=65}} or "three poisons",{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}} namely of passion or sensuality (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]''), aversion or hate (''[[dvesha]]'') and of delusion or ignorance (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' or ''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|loc=Kindle loc. 44535}} Another explanation of nirvana is the absence of the weaving (''vana'') of activity of the mind.{{sfn|Cousins|1998|p=9}}

===To uncover===
Author Paul Swanson states that some contemporary Buddhism scholars have questioned the above etymologies and whether these are consistent with the core doctrines of Buddhism, particularly about ''anatman'' (non-self) and ''pratityasamutpada'' (causality).{{sfn|Swanson|1997|pp=119-124}} Matsumoto Shirō, for example, states that the original etymological root of ''nirvana'' should not be considered as nir√vā which means "extinction", but should be considered to be nir√vŗ, to "uncover".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}} The problem with considering it as extinction or liberation, is that it presupposes a "self" to be extinguished or liberated.{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}} According to Matsumoto, the original meaning of ''nirvana'' was therefore not "to extinguish" but "to uncover" the ''atman'' from that which is ''anatman'' (not atman).{{sfn|Swanson|1997|pp=123-124, Swanson cites Matsumoto Shiro (1989), Engi to ku-Nyoraizo shiso hihan [Causality and emptiness – A critique of tathagata-garbha thought], Tokyo Daizo Shuppan, pages 191-192, 195-219}} Other Buddhist scholars such as Takasaki Jikidō disagree, states Swanson, and call the Matsumoto proposal as "too far and leaving nothing that can be called Buddhist".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=124}}

===Moksha, vimutti===
''Nirvana'' is used synonymously with ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit), also ''vimoksha'', or ''vimutti'' (Pali), "release, deliverance from suffering".{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=547}}&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O101-Vimutti.html John Bowker (1997), ''Vimutti'', The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"''Vimoksha'' [解脱] (Skt; Jpn gedatsu ).

Ceto-vimutti becomes permanent, only with the attainment of pañña-vimutti.&lt;ref group=web name="Bowker-vimutti" /&gt; According to Gombrich and other scholars, these may be a later development within the canon, reflecting a growing emphasis in earliest Buddhism on ''prajña'', instead of the liberating practice of ''dhyana''; it may also reflect a successful assimilation of non-Buddhist meditation practices in ancient India into the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=96-134}}{{Sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=63-65 with footnotes}} According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Anālayo]], the term ''uttari''-''[[Moksha|vimutti]]'' (highest liberation) is also widely used in the early buddhist texts to refer to liberation from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Anālayo, From Craving to Liberation – Excursions into the Thought-world of the Pāli Discourses (1), 2009, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern scholars such as [[Rupert Gethin]], [[Richard Gombrich]], Donald Lopez and Paul Williams hold that nirvāṇa (''nibbana'' in Pali, also called ''nibbanadhatu'', the property of nibbana), means the 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing' of [[Three poisons|greed, aversion, and delusion]], and that this signifies the permanent cessation of [[Saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002), Buddhist Thought (Kindle ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis, p 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Gethin, Rupert (1998), Foundations of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2000), Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction (Kindle ed.), Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Sue, Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see [[Samyutta Nikaya]] IV 251 and SN IV 261.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|See:

* Paul Williams: "Nirvana is broadly speaking the result of letting-go, letting-go the very forces of craving which power continued experiences of pleasure and inevitably suffering throughout this life, death, rebirth, and redeath. That, in a nutshell, is what nirvana is. It is the complete and permanent cessation of samsara, thence the cessation of all types of suffering, resulting from letting-go the forces which power samsara, due to overcoming ignorance (thence also hatred and delusion, the 'three root poisons') through seeing things the way they really are."{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=47-48}}

According to Steven Collins, a synonym widely used for nirvana in early texts is "deathless" or "deathfree" ([[Pali]]: ''amata,'' [[sanskrit]]'': [[Amrita|amrta]]'') and refers to a condition "where there is no death, because there is also no birth, no coming into existence, nothing made by conditioning, and therefore no time."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adds that "the most common thing said about nirvana in Buddhist texts is that it is the ending of suffering ([[dukkha|''dukkha'']])."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Gethin notes, "this is not a 'thing' but an event or experience" that frees one from rebirth in [[Saṃsāra|samsara]]. According to Collins, the term is also widely used as a verb, one therefore "nirvanizes."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Richard Gombrich|Gombrich]] argues that the metaphor used in the texts of flames going out, refers to fires which were kept by priests of [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]], and symbolize life in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard F. (2006), How Buddhism Began. The conditioned genesis of the early teachings. Second edition, Routledge, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Nirvana is also called "unconditioned" (''asankhata''), meaning it is unlike all other conditioned phenomena. 

The cycle of rebirth and suffering continues until a being attains nirvana. One requirement for ending this cycle is to extinguish the fires of attachment (''[[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]''), aversion (''[[dvesha]]'') and ignorance (''[[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]'' or ''[[Avidya (Buddhism)|avidya]])''. As [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states "For as long as one is entangled by [[Taṇhā|craving]], one remains bound in saṃsāra, the cycle of birth and death; but when all craving has been extirpated, one attains Nibbāna, deliverance from the cycle of birth and death."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 5188-5193}}

According to Donald Swearer, the journey to nirvana is not a journey to a "separate reality" (contra [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] or [[Jainism]]), but a move towards calm, equanimity, nonattachment and [[Anatta|nonself]].&lt;ref&gt;Loy, David R. A New Buddhist Path: Enlightenment, Evolution, and Ethics in the Modern World, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] view of early Buddhism is seen as a reaction to earlier Indic metaphysical views. Thomas Kasulis notes that in the early texts, nirvana is often described in negative terms, including “cessation” (''nirodha''), “the absence of craving” (''trsnaksaya''), “detachment,” “the absence of delusion,” and “the unconditioned” (''asamskrta'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jones, Lindsay, Encyclopedia of Religion, volume 10, p. 6628.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that there is little discussion in the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early buddhist texts]] about the metaphysical nature of nirvana, since they seem to hold that metaphysical speculation is an obstacle to the goal. Kasulis mentions the [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|''Malunkyaputta sutta'']] which denies any view about the existence of the Buddha after his final bodily death, all positions (the Buddha exists after death, does not exist, both or neither) are rejected.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Likewise, another sutta ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] II 161) has [[Sariputta|Sāriputta]] saying that asking the question "is there anything else?" after the physical death of someone who has attained nirvana is conceptualizing or proliferating (''[[Conceptual proliferation|papañca]]'') about that which is without proliferation (''appapañcaṃ'') and thus a kind of distorted thinking bound up with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Brahmali, B. What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna, BSRV 26.1 (2009) 33–66 Buddhist Studies Review ISSN (print) 0256-2897.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early texts]], the practice of the noble path and the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyanas]] was said to lead to the extinction of the three fires, and then proceed to the cessation of all discursive thoughts and apperceptions, then ceasing all feelings (happiness and sadness).{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=68-69}}{{Sfn|Trainor|2004|pp=80-81}} According to Collins, nirvana is associated with a meditative attainment called the 'Cessation of Perception/Ideation and Feeling' (''sannavedayitanirodha''), also known as the 'Attainment of Cessation' ([[Nirodha-samāpatti|''nirodhasamapatti'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In later Buddhism, dhyana practice was deemed sufficient only for the extinguishing of passion and hatred, while delusion was extinguished by insight.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66-67}}

=== As a metaphysical place or transcendent consciousness ===
[[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]] has defended the idea that nirvana in the Pali suttas refers to a kind of transformed and transcendent consciousness or discernment (''[[Vijñāna|viññana]]'') that has "stopped" (''nirodhena''). According to Harvey this nirvanic consciousness is said to be "objectless", "infinite" (''anantam''), "unsupported" (''appatiṭṭhita'') and "non-manifestive" (''anidassana'') as well as "beyond time and spatial location".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of The Buddha, in "Werner, ''The Yogi and the Mystic."'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter, The Selfless Mind, p. 200-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Rune Johansson's ''The Psychology of Nirvana'' also argued that nirvana could be seen as a transformed state of mind (''citta'').&lt;ref&gt;Johansson, Rune, ''The Psychology of Nirvana,'' 1969, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jain_universe.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jain_universe.JPG|thumb|In the cosmology of [[Jainism]], another [[Śramaṇa|sramana]] tradition like Buddhism, liberated beings abide in an actual place (loka) associated with nirvana.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90-92}} Some scholars have argued that originally, Buddhists held a similar view.]]
[[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|Stanislaw Schayer]], a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the [[Nikāya|Nikayas]] preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the [[Mahayana]] tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Contrary to popular opinion, the Theravada and Mahayana traditions may be "divergent, but equally reliable records of a pre-canonical Buddhism which is now lost forever."{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}} The Mahayana tradition may have preserved a very old, "pre-Canonical" and oral Buddhist tradition, which was largely, but not completely, left out of the Theravada-canon.{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} Schayer's view saw nirvana as an immortal, deathless sphere, a transmundane reality or state.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=374-377}} [[Edward Conze]] had similar ideas about nirvana, citing sources which speak of an eternal and "invisible infinite consciousness, which shines everywhere" as point to the view that nirvana is a kind of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} A similar view was defended by M. Falk, who held that the nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within [[Saṃsāra|samsara]].{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} M. Falk argues that the early Buddhist view of nirvana is that it is an "abode" or "place" of [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]], which is gained by the enlightened.{{refn|See Digha Nikaya 15, ''Mahanidana Sutta'', which describes a nine-fold chain of causation. Mind-and-body (''nama-rupa'') and consciousness (''vijnana'') do condition here each other (verse 2 &amp; 3). In verse 21 and 22, it is stated that consciousness comes into the mother's womb, and finds a resting place in mind-and-body. {{sfn|Walshe|1995|p=223, 226}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=375}}{{refn|M. Falk (1943, ''Nama-rupa and Dharma-rupa''|group=note}} This nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within [[Saṃsāra|samsara]].{{sfn|Ray|p=375}}{{refn|According to Alexander Wynne, Schayer:"referred to passages in which "consciousness" (''vinnana'') seems to be the ultimate reality or substratum (e.g. A I.10) 14 as well as the ''Saddhatu Sutra'', which is not found in any canonical source but is cited in other Buddhist texts — it states that the personality (pudgala) consists of the six elements (dhatu) of earth, water, fire, wind, space and consciousness; Schayer noted that it related to other ancient Indian ideas. Keith’s argument is also based on the ''Saddhatu Sutra'' as well as "passages where we have explanations of Nirvana which echo the ideas of the Upanishads regarding the ultimate reality." He also refers to the doctrine of "a consciousness, originally pure, defiled by adventitious impurities."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}|group=note}}

A similar view is also defended by C. Lindtner, who argues that in precanonical Buddhism Nirvana is:{{quote|... a place one can actually go to. It is called ''nirvanadhatu'', has no border-signs (''animitta''), is localized somewhere beyond the other six ''dhatus'' (beginning with earth and ending with ''vijñana'') but is closest to ''akasa'' and ''vijñana''. One cannot visualize it, it is ''anidarsana'', but it provides one with firm ground under one’s feet, it is dhruva; once there one will not slip back, it is ''acyutapada''. As opposed to this world, it is a pleasant place to be in, it is sukha, things work well.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{refn|group=note|Cited in Wynne (2007) p.99.{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=99}}}}}}

According to Christian Lindtner, the original and early Buddhist concepts of nirvana were similar to those found in competing [[Śramaṇa]] (strivers/ascetics) traditions such as [[Jainism]] and Upanishadic Vedism. It was not a psychological idea or purely related to a being's inner world, but a concept described in terms of the world surrounding the being, cosmology and consciousness.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|pp=112-113, 118-119}} All Indian religions, over time, states Lindtner evolved these ideas, internalizing the state but in different ways because early and later [[Vedanta]] continued with the metaphysical idea of [[Brahman]] and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|soul]], but Buddhism did not.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|pp=131-132, 110-112, 122-123}} In this view, the canonical Buddhist views on Nirvana was a reaction against early [[Precanonical Buddhism|(pre-canonical) Buddhism]], along with the assumptions of Jainism and the Upanishadic thought on the idea of personal liberation.{{Sfn|Lindtner|1997|p=129}} As a result of this reaction, Nirvana came to be seen as a state of mind, instead of a concrete place.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}} Elements of this precanonical Buddhism may have survived the canonisation, and its subsequent filtering out of ideas, and re-appeared in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]].{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}} According to Lindtner, the existence of multiple, and contradicting ideas, is also reflected in the works of [[Nagarjuna]], who tried to harmonize these different ideas. According to Lindtner, this lead him to taking a "paradoxical" stance, for instance regarding nirvana, rejecting any positive description.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}

Referring to this view, Alexander Wynne holds that there is no evidence in the [[Sutta Pitaka]] that the Buddha held this view, at best it only shows that "some of the early Buddhists were influenced by their Brahminic peers".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Wynne, 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Wynne concludes that the Buddha rejected the views of the [[Vedas]] and that his teachings present a radical departure from these [[Historical Vedic religion|brahminical]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

However, his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable, still feels pleasure and pain. It is the destruction of lust, hatred, and delusion in him that is called the Nibbana element with residue remaining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And what, monks, is the Nibbana element without residue remaining?

== Synonyms and metaphors ==
A commonly used metaphor for nirvana is that of a flame which goes out due to lack of fuel:&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as an oil-lamp burns because of oil and wick, but when the oil and wick are exhausted, and no others are supplied, it goes out through lack of fuel (''anaharo nibbayati''), so the [enlightened] monk … knows that after the break-up of his body, when further life is exhausted, all feelings which are rejoiced in here will become cool.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Collins argues that the Buddhist view of awakening reverses the [[Vedas|Vedic]] view and its metaphors. While in Vedic religion, the fire is seen as a metaphor for the good and for life, Buddhist thought uses the metaphor of fire for the [[three poisons]] and for suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the [[Fire Sermon|''Adittapariyaya Sutta'']] commonly called "the fire sermon" as well as in other similar [[Early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]]. The fire sermon describes the end of the "fires" with a refrain which is used throughout the early texts to describe nibbana:&lt;blockquote&gt;Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html Thanissaro (1993)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|Dhammacakkapavattanasutta]],'' the third noble truth of cessation (associated with nirvana) is defined as: "the fading away without remainder and cessation of that same craving, giving it up, relinquishing it, letting it go, not clinging to it."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Collins lists some examples of synonyms used throughout the Pali texts for nibbana:&lt;blockquote&gt;the end, (the place, state) without corruptions, the truth, the further (shore), the subtle, very hard to see, without decay, firm, not liable to dissolution, incomparable, without differentiation, peaceful, deathless, excellent, auspicious, rest, the destruction of craving, marvellous, without affliction, whose nature is to be free from affliction, nibbana [presumably here in one or more creative etymology,= e.g., non-forest], without trouble, dispassion, purity, freedom, without attachment, the island, shelter (cave), protection, refuge, final end, the subduing of pride (or ‘intoxication’), elimination of thirst, destruction of attachment, cutting off of the round (of rebirth), empty, very hard to obtain, where there is no becoming, without misfortune, where there is nothing made, sorrowfree, without danger, whose nature is to be without danger, profound, hard to see, superior, unexcelled (without superior), unequalled, incomparable, foremost, best, without strife, clean, flawless, stainless, happiness, immeasurable, (a firm) standing point, possessing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Steven, Nirvana: Concept, Imagery, Narrative, 2010, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unconditioned===
In the Theravada-tradition, ''nibbāna'' is regarded as an uncompounded or unconditioned (''asankhata'') [[Abhidharma|dhamma]] (phenomenon, event) which is "transmundane",{{sfn|Choong|1999|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|According to Peter Harvey, the Theravada-tradition tends to minimize mystical tendencies, but there is also a tendency to stress the complete otherness of ''nirvana'' from ''samsara''.

Then Udāyi asked: 'But, friend Sāriputta, what happiness can it be if there is no sensation?' Sāriputta's reply was highly philosophical and beyond ordinary comprehension: "That there is no sensation itself is happiness'."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 1105-1113}}}} In Theravada [[Abhidharma|Abhidhamma]] texts like the ''[[Vibhanga]],'' ''nibbana'' or the ''asankhata-dhatu'' (unconditioned element) is defined thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘What is the unconditioned element (''asankhata dhatu'')? It is the cessation of passion, the cessation of hatred and the cessation of delusion.’&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the "Snake-Simile Discourse" ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 22), where the Buddha states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Monks, this Teaching so well proclaimed by me, is plain, open, explicit, free of patchwork. In this Teaching that is so well proclaimed by me and is plain, open, explicit and free of patchwork; for those who are arahants, free of taints, who have accomplished and completed their task, have laid down the burden, achieved their aim, severed the fetters binding to existence, who are liberated by full knowledge, there is no (future) round of existence that can be ascribed to them. – Majjhima Nikaya i.130 ¶ 42, Translated by Nyanaponika Thera [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.nypo.html (Nyanaponika, 2006)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, for the Theravada, nirvana is uniquely the only ''asankhata'' ''dhamma'' (unconditioned phenomenon) and unlike other schools, they do not recognize different unconditioned phenomena or different types of nirvana (such as the ''apratistha'' or non-abiding nirvana of [[Mahayana]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Thích, Thiện Châu (1984) The Literature of the Personalists, p. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Thiện Châu, the Theravadins and the Pudgalavadins "remained strictly faithful to the letter of the sutras" and thus held that nirvana is the only unconditioned [[Dhamma theory|dhamma]], while other schools also posited various ''asankhata dhammas'' (such as the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadin]] view that space or ''[[Akasha|akasa]]'' was unconditioned).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

===Stages===

{{Main article|Four stages of enlightenment}}
The [[Theravada]] tradition identifies four progressive stages.{{refn|group=note|These four stages are: Stream-enterer (Sotapanna), Once returner (Sakadagami), Non-returner (Anagami), Worthy one (Arhat)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E.

The first three are reborn because they still have some of the fetters, while arhat has abandoned all ten fetters and, upon death will never be reborn in any realm or world, having wholly escaped ''saṃsāra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E.

At the start, a monk's mind treats nirvana as an object (''nibbanadhatu''). This is followed by realizing the insight of three universal ''lakshana'' (marks): impermanence (''anicca''), suffering (''dukkha'') and nonself (''anatman''). Thereafter the monastic practice aims at eliminating the ten fetters that lead to rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert E. Buswell Jr. |author2=Donald S.

Curzon Press 1989, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; At that point of contemplation, which is reached through a progression of [[Vipassana|insight]], if the meditator realizes that even that state is constructed and therefore impermanent, the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] are destroyed, arahantship is attained, and ''nibbāna'' is realized.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 1989, page 93"&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.''

===Visuddhimagga===
The [[Theravada]] exegete [[Buddhaghosa]] says, in his ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;It is called nibbana (extinction) because it has gone away from (nikkhanta), has escaped from (nissata), is dissociated from, craving, which has acquired in common usage the name ‘fastening (vana)’ because, by ensuring successive becoming, craving serves as a joining together, a binding together, a lacing together, of the four kinds of generation, five destinies, seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of being.&lt;ref&gt;Both the stream-enterer and the once-returner abandon the first three fetters. What distinguishes these stages is that the once-returner additionally attenuates lust, hate and delusion, and will necessarily be reborn only once more.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Buddhaghosa]], ''nibbāna'' is achieved after a long process of committed application to the path of purification (Pali: ''Vissudhimagga''). The Buddha explained that the disciplined way of life he recommended to his students (''dhamma-vinaya'') is a [[gradual training]] extending often over a number of years. To be committed to this path already requires that a seed of wisdom is present in the individual. This wisdom becomes manifest in the experience of awakening (''[[bodhi]]''). Attaining ''nibbāna'', in either the current or some future birth, depends on effort, and is not pre-determined.{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=87}}

In the ''Visuddhimagga'', chapter I.v.6, [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies various options within the [[Pali canon]] for pursuing a path to nirvana.{{refn|group=note|A number of the suttas referenced below as well as Buddhaghosa himself refer not explicitly to nirvana but to "the path of purification" (Pali: ''Visuddhimagga'').

=== The mind of the Arahant is ''nibbāna'' ===
A related idea, which finds support in the Pali Canon and the contemporary Theravada practice tradition despite its absence in the Theravada commentaries and [[Abhidhamma]], is that the mind of the arahant is itself ''nibbāna''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.''

=== Modern Theravada views ===

[[K. N. Jayatilleke|K.N. Jayatilleke]], a modern [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] Buddhist philosopher, holds that nirvana must be understood by a careful study of the Pali texts. Jayatilleke argues that the Pali works show that nirvana means 'extinction' as well as 'the highest positive experience of happiness'.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke writes that despite the definition of nirvana as 'extinction', this does not mean that it is a kind of annihilation or a state of dormant nonentity, for this contradicts the statements of the Buddha that reject this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Jayatilleke holds that the early texts clearly proclaim that nothing can be said about the state of the Buddha after ''[[Parinirvana|paranibbana]]'' (the end of his psycho-physical personality) because "we do not have the concepts or words to describe adequately the state of the emancipated person." &lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; This transcendent reality which our normal minds cannot grasp is not located in time or space, it is not causally conditioned, and beyond existence and non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Because trying to explain ''nibbana'' by means of logic is impossible, the only thing to be done is to explain how to reach it, instead of dwelling on what it "is". Explaining what happens to the Buddha after nibbana is thus said to be an [[The unanswered questions|unanswerable]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similarly [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] position is also defended by [[Walpola Rahula Thero|Walpola Rahula]], who states that the question of what nirvana is "can never be answered completely and satisfactorily in words, because human language is too poor to express the real nature of the Absolute Truth or Ultimate Reality which is Nirvana."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula affirms that nibbana is most often described in negative terms because there is less danger in grasping at these terms, such as "the cessation of continuity and becoming (''bhavanirodha'')", "the abandoning and destruction of desire and craving for these five aggregates of attachment", and "the extinction of "thirst" (''tanhakkhayo'')."&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also affirms however that nibbana is not a negative or an annihilation, because there is no self to be annihilated and because 'a negative word does not necessarily indicate a negative state'.&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also notes that more positive terms are used to describe nibbana such as "freedom" (''mutti'') and "truth" (''sacca'').&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Rahula also agrees that nirvana is unconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Rahula, Walpola, What the Buddha Taught, Revised edition, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has defended the traditional Theravada view which sees nirvana as "a reality transcendent to the entire world of mundane experience, a reality transcendent to all the realms of phenomenal existence."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, NIBBANA, https://www.dhammatalks.net/Books16/Bhikkhu_Bodhi-Nibbana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lankan philosopher [[David Kalupahana]] has taken a different position, he argues that the Buddha's "main philosophical insight" is the principle of causality ([[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]) and that this "is operative in all spheres, including the highest state of spiritual development, namely, nirvana."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kalupahana "later scholars attempted to distinguish two spheres, one in which causation prevailed and the other which is uncaused. This latter view was, no doubt, the result of a confusion in the meanings of the two terms, ''sankhata'' ('compounded') and ''paticcasamuppanna'' ('causally conditioned')."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Thus, even though nibbana is termed "''asankhata''" (un-compounded, not-put together) there is no statement in the early texts which say that nirvana is ''not'' dependently originated or is uncaused (the term would be ''appaticcasamuppana'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; He thus argues that "nirvana is a state where there is 'natural or causal happening' (''paticcasamuppada''), but not 'organized,' or 'planned' conditioning (''sankha-rana'')", as well as "a state of perfect mental health (''aroga''), of perfect happiness (''parama sukha''), calmness or coolness (''sitibhuta''), and stability (''aneñja''), etc. attained in this life, or while one is alive."&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David J. Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism, pp. 140, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahasi Sayadaw]], one of the most influential 20th century Theravada ''[[Vipassanā|vipassana]]'' teachers, states in his "''On the nature of Nibbana''" that "nibbana is perfect peace (''santi'')" and "the complete annihilation of the three cycles of defilement, action, and result of action, which all go to create mind and matter, volitional activities, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 2, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that for [[Arhat|arahants]] "no new life is formed after his decease-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi Sayadaw further states that nibbana is the cessation of the five aggregates which is like "a flame being extinguished". However this doesn't mean that "an arahant as an individual has disappeared" because there is no such thing as an "individual" in an ultimate sense, even though we use this term conventionally. Ultimate however, "there is only a succession of mental and physical phenomena arising and dissolving." For this reason, Mahasi Sayadaw holds that although for an arahant "cessation means the extinction of the successive rise and fall of the aggregates" this is not the view of annihilation (''uccheda-diṭṭhi'') since there is ultimately no individual to be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi further notes that "feeling [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Vedanā|''vedana'']]] ceases with the parinibbāna of the Arahant" and also that "the cessation of [[Ayatana|senses]] is nibbāna" (citing the ''Pañcattaya Sutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 41, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahasi also affirms that even though nibbana is the "cessation of mind, matter, and mental formations" and even the cessation of "formless consciousness", it is not nothing, but it is an "absolute reality" and he also affirms that "the peace of nibbana is real."&lt;ref&gt;Mahāsi Sayādaw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibbāna, Buddha Sāsanānuggaha Organisation Mahāsi Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 60, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Unorthodox interpretations, ''nibbana'' as ''citta'', ''viññana'' or ''atta''===
In [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Theravada]], as well as among some modern Theravada scholars, there are alternative interpretations which differ from the traditional orthodox Theravada view. These interpretations see nibbana as equivalent in some way with either a special kind of mind ([[Luminous mind|''pabhassara citta'']]) or a special consciousness called ''anidassana viññāṇa,'' "non-manifest" consciousness which is said to be 'luminous'. In one interpretation, the "luminous consciousness" is identical with nibbana.&lt;ref&gt;See also Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.''&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree, finding it to be not nibbana itself, but instead to be a kind of consciousness accessible only to [[arahants]].&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Brahmali, [http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=107 bswa.org]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806044051/http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?page=107|date=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Gethin]] objects to parts of Harvey's argument; [http://www.buddhistethics.org/4/gethin1.html buddhistethics.org]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616002503/http://www.buddhistethics.org/4/gethin1.html|date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some teachers of the [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]], such as [[Ajahn Maha Bua]] taught an idea called "original mind" which when perfected is said to exist as a separate reality from the world and the [[Skandha|aggregates]]''.''&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073822/http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf|date=2009-03-27}} (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maha Bua, the indestructible mind or ''[[citta]]'' is characterized by awareness or knowing, which is intrinsically bright ([[Luminous mind|''pabhassaram'']]) and radiant, and though it is tangled or "darkened" in samsara, it is not destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Maha Boowa, ‘Straight From the Heart,’ pp 139-40, (Thanissaro Bhikkhu trans.)&lt;/ref&gt; This mind is unconditioned, deathless and an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf (consulted 19 March 2009)p.99&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bua, this mind is impure, but when it is purified of the [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]], it remains abiding in its own foundation.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Maha Boowa, ‘Straight From the Heart,’ pp 139-40, (Thanissaro Bhikkhu trans.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ajahn Maha Bua|Maha Bua]] also publicly argued (in a newspaper in 1972) that one could meet with and discuss the teachings with arahants and Buddhas of the past (and that [[Mun Bhuridatta|Ajahn Mun]] had done so) therefore positing that nibbana is a kind of higher existence.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Seeger, Martin, Phra Payutto and Debates ‘On the Very Idea of the Pali Canon’ in Thai Buddhism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayudh Payutto]], a modern scholar-monk who is widely seen as the most influential authority on Buddhist doctrine in Thailand, has played a prominent role in arguing against the views of Maha Bua, strictly basing his views on the [[Pāli Canon|Pali canon]] to refute such notions.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

[[Ajahn Pasanno|Ajahns Pasanno]] and [[Ajahn Amaro|Amaro]], contemporary western monastics in the [[Thai Forest Tradition|Thai forest tradition]], note that these ideas are rooted in a passage in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (1.61-62) which mentions a certain "''[[Luminous mind|pabhassara citta]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha's Teachings on nibbāna'', page 212. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/ abhayagiri.org].&lt;/ref&gt; Citing another passage from the canon which mentions a "consciousness that is signless, boundless, all-luminous" (called ''anidassana viññāṇa'') they state that this "must mean a knowing of a primordial, transcendent nature."&lt;ref name="Ajahn"&gt;Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha's Teachings on nibbāna'', page 131. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/ abhayagiri.org].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro: "The Buddha avoided the nit-picking pedantry of many philosophers contemporary with him and opted for a more broad-brush, colloquial style, geared to particular listeners in a language which they could understand. Thus 'viññana' here can be assumed to mean 'knowing' but not the partial, fragmented, discriminative (vi-) knowing (-ñana) which the word usually implies. Instead it must mean a knowing of a primordial, transcendent nature, otherwise the passage which contains it would be self-contradictory." They then give further context for why this choice of words may have been made; the passages may represent an example of the Buddha using his "skill in means" to teach Brahmins in terms they were familiar with.&lt;ref name="Ajahn" /&gt;}}

A related view of nibbana has been defended by the American Thai forest monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]]. According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro,]] "non-manifestive consciousness" (''anidassana viññāṇa'') differs from the kinds of consciousness associated to the six sense media, which have a "surface" that they fall upon and arise in response to.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#t-1 Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]&lt;/ref&gt; In a liberated individual, this is directly experienced, in a way that is free from any dependence on conditions at all.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhukkhu's commentary on the Brahma-nimantanika Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.049.than.html#n-9 Access to Insight: Readings in Theravada Buddhism.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Thanissaro's view, the luminous, unsupported consciousness associated with nibbana is directly known by noble ones without the mediation of the mental consciousness factor in dependent co-arising, and is the transcending of all objects of mental consciousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The British academic [[Peter Harvey (Buddhism)|Peter Harvey]] has defended a similar view of nibbana as ''anidassana viññāṇa''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 87, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], there is also a trend in modern Thai Theravada that argues that "nirvana is indeed the true Self ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|''Atman'']]; Pali: [[Ātman (Buddhism)|''atta'']])".{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}} This dispute began when the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] published a book of essays in 1939 arguing that while the conditioned world is ''anatta'', nibbana is ''atta''. According to Williams, this interpretation echoes the Mahayana ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras. This position was criticized by [[Buddhadasa|Buddhadhasa Bhikkhu]], who argued that the not-self (''[[anatta]]'') perspective is what makes Buddhism unique.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} Fifty years after this dispute, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] also began to teach that nibbana is not [[anatta]], but the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} According to Williams, this ''dhammakaya'' (dharma body) is "a luminous, radiant and clear Buddha figure free of all defilements and situated within the body of the meditator."{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} This view has been strongly criticized as "insulting the Buddha’s teaching" and "showing disrespect to the Pali canon" by [[Prayudh Payutto]] (In his ''The Dhammakaya case'') and this has led to fervent debates in Thai Buddhist circles.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Another western monastic in the [[Thai Forest Tradition|thai forest tradition]], Ajahn Brahmāli, has recently written against all of these views, drawing on a careful study of the [[Nikāya|Nikāyas]]. Brahmāli concludes that the "most reasonable interpretation" of final nibbāna is "no more than the cessation of the five khandhas."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Brahmāli also notes that there is a kind of [[Samadhi|samādhi]] that is attainable only by the awakened and is based on their knowledge of nibbana (but is ''not'' nibbana itself), this meditation is what is being referred to by terms such as non-manifest consciousness (''anidassana viññāṇa'') and unestablished consciousness (''appatiṭṭhita viññāṇa'').&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;   

== In other Buddhist schools ==

=== Sthavira schools ===

The later Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] schools gave different meaning and interpretations of the term, moving away from the original metaphor of the extinction of the "three fires". The [[Sarvastivada]] Abhidharma compendium, the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahavibhasasastra]],'' says of nirvana: &lt;blockquote&gt;As it is the cessation of [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]] (klesanirodha), it is called nirvana. As it is the extinction of the triple fires, it is called nirvana. As it is the tranquility of [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]], it is called nirvana. As there is separation (viyoga) from bad odor (durgandha), it is called nirvana. As there is separation from destinies (gati), it is called nirvana. Vana means forest and nir means escape. As it is the escape from the forest of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], it is called nirvana. Vana means weaving and nir means negation. As there is no weaving, it is called nirvana. In a way that one with thread can easily be woven while one without that cannot be woven, in that way one with action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]) and defilements (klesa) can easily be woven into life and death while an asaiksa who is without any action and defilements cannot be woven into life and death. That is why it is called nirvana. Vana means [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|new birth]] and nir means negation. As there is no more new birth, it is called nirvana. Vana means bondage and nir means separation. As it is separation from bondage, it is called nirvana. Vana means all discomforts of life and death and nir means passing beyond. As it passes beyond all discomforts of life and death, it is called nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Soonil Hwang, the [[Sarvastivada]] school held that there were two kinds of nirodha (extinction), extinction without knowledge (''apratisamkhyanirodha'') and extinction through knowledge (''pratisamkhyanirodha''), which is the equivalent of nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sarvastivada [[Abhidharma]], extinction through knowledge was equivalent to nirvana, and was defined by its intrinsic nature ([[Svabhava|''svabhava'']]), ‘all extinction which is disjunction (''visamyoga'')’.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This dharma is defined by the [[Abhidharmakośakārikā|''Abhidharmakosha'']] as "a special understanding, the penetration (''pratisamkhyana'') of suffering and the other noble truths."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Soonil explains the Sarvastivada view of nirvana as "the perpetual separation of an impure dharma from a series of aggregates through the antidote, ‘acquisition of disjunction’ (''visamyogaprapti'')."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Sarvastivadins held that all dharmas exist in the three times, they saw the destruction of defilements as impossible and thus "the elimination of a defilement is referred to as a ‘separation’ from the series."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Soonil adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;That is to say, the acquisition of the defilement is negated, or technically ‘disjoined’ (''visamyoga''), through the power of knowledge that terminates the junction between that defilement and the series of aggregates. By reason of this separation, then, there arises ‘the acquisition of disjunction’ (''visamyogaprapti'') that serves as an antidote (''pratipaksa''), which henceforward prevents the junction between the defilement and this series.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The Sarvastivadins also held that nirvana was a real existent (''dravyasat'') which perpetually protects a series of dharmas from defilements in the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 42, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Their interpretation of nirvana became an issue of debate between them and the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] school. For the Sautrantikas, nirvana "was not a real existent but a mere designation (''prajñaptisat'') and was non-existence succeeding existence (''pascadabhava'')."&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; It is something merely spoken of conventionally, without an intrinsic nature (''[[svabhava]]'').&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Hwang, 2006, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Abhidharmakosha'', explaining the Sautrantika view of nirvana, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The extinction through knowledge is, when latent defilements (''anusaya'') and life (''janman'') that have already been produced are extinguished, non-arising of further such by the power of knowledge (''pratisamkhya'').&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus for the Sautrantikas, nirvana was simply the "non-arising of further latent defilement when all latent defilements that have been produced have already been extinguished."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

Meanwhile, the [[Pudgalavada]] school interpreted nirvana as the single Absolute truth which constitutes "the negation, absence, cessation of all that constitutes the world in which we live, act and suffer".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Thiện Châu, for the Pudgalavadins, nirvana is seen as totally different than the compounded realm, since it the uncompounded (''asamskrta'') realm where no compounded things exist, and it is also beyond reasoning and expression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the few surviving Pudgalavada texts defines nirvana as:&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolute truth is the definitive cessation of all activities of speech (vac) and of all thoughts (citta). Activity is bodily action (kayakarman): speech (vac) is that of the voice (vakkarman); thought is that of the mind (manaskarman). If these three (actions) cease definitively, that is absolute truth which is Nirvana.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to [[André Bareau|Andre Bareau]], the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school held that the nirvana reached by [[Arhat|arhats]] was fundamentally inferior to that of the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 55-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the nirvana reached by the Buddha, they held that his longevity (''ayu''), his body (''rupa, sarira'') and divine power (''tejas'') were infinite, unlimited and supramundane (''lokuttara'').&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha, Buddhist Sects in India, p. 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they held to a kind of [[docetism]] which posited that Buddhas only ''appear'' to be born into the world and thus when they die and enter nirvana, this is only a fiction. In reality, the Buddha remains in the form of a body of enjoyment (''sambhogakaya'') and continues to create many forms (''nirmana'') adapted to the different needs of beings in order to teach them through clever means (''[[upaya]]'').&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

According to Guang Xing, [[Mahāsāṃghika]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s held that there were two aspects of a Buddha's attainment: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through his skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsāṃghikas, the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] was merely one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''[[Nirmanakaya|nirmāṇakāya]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bareau also writes that for the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] school, only wisdom ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]]) can reach nirvana, not samadhi. Bareau notes that this might be the source of the [[Prajnaparamita|''prajñaparamita'']] sutras.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the [[Ekavyāvahārika]] branch of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Bareau states that both samsara and nirvana were nominal designations (''prajñapti'') and devoid of any real substance.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bareau, ''Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit Vehicule'' (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nalinaksha Dutt, for the [[Ekavyāvahārika]], all dharmas are conventional and thus unreal (even the absolute was held to be contingent or dependent) while for the [[Lokottaravāda|Lokottaravada]] branch, worldly dharmas are unreal but supramundane dharmas like nirvana are real.&lt;ref&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha, Buddhist Sects in India, p. 69.

The [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] (Great Vehicle) tradition, which promotes the [[bodhisattva]] path as the highest spiritual ideal over the goal of [[Arhat|arhatship]], envisions a different view of nirvana than the [[Nikāya|Nikaya]] Buddhist schools.&lt;!---START OF NOTES---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: The Mahāyāna sūtras express two basic attitudes towards [the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle]. The first [attitude] is that the path of the disciple [sravaka] and the path of the pratyeka-buddha do lead to a kind of awakening, a release from suffering, nirvāna, and as such are real goals. These goals are, however, inferior and should be renounced for the superior attainment of buddhahood. The second attitude, classically articulated by the Lotus Sūtra, sees the goal of the disciple and the pratyeka-buddha as not true goals at all.{{refn|group=lower-roman|Gethin footnote: Also Śrīmālādevī 78–94; and Lankāvatāra Sūtra 63; cf. Herbert V. Guenther (trans.), The Jewel Ornament of Liberation (London, 1970), 4–6.}} The fact that the Buddha taught them is an example of his 'skill in means' (upaya-kauśalya) as a teacher.{{refn|group=lower-roman|Gethin footnote: On the notion of 'skill in means' see Michael Pye, Skilful Means (London, 1978); Williams, Mahāyāna Buddhism, 143–50.}} These goals are thus merely clever devices (upāya) employed by the Buddha in order to get beings to at least begin the practice of the path; eventually their practice must lead on to the one and only vehicle (eka-yāna) that is the mahāyāna, the vehicle ending in perfect buddhahood.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=228-229}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Tibetan teacher Pabongka Rinpoche presents the path in three levels (or scopes. The first stage indicates a level of understanding or ethical conduct for non-Buddhists, and the second two stages are ''nirvana'' and ''Buddhahood''. Pabongka Rinpoche: "The subject matter of these teachings can be included in the various paths of the three scopes. The small scope covers the causes to achieve the high rebirth states of the gods and humans: the ethics of abandoning the ten nonvirtues, etc. The medium scope includes the practices that will cause one to gain the definite excellence of liberation— such practices as abandoning [the first two of the] four truths, engaging in [the last two of these truths], and the practice of the three high trainings. The great scope contains the practices that bring about the definite excellence of omniscience— such practices as the development of bodhichitta, the six perfections, etc. Hence, all this subject matter forms a harmonious practice that will take a person to enlightenment and should be understood as being completely without contradiction."{{sfn|Pabongka Rinpoche|2006|loc=Kindle loc. 1790-1796}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTES---&gt; The classic Mahāyāna view posits that there are at least two types of nirvana, holding that what is called ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;apratiṣṭhita-nirvana&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("non-abiding", non-localized", "non-fixed") to be the highest nirvana, and more profound than ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;pratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', the ‘localized’, lesser nirvana.

According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;apratiṣṭhita-nirvana&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' is the standard Mahāyāna view of the attainment of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], which enables them to freely return to [[Saṃsāra|''samsara'']] in order to help sentient beings, while still being in a kind of nirvana.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Mahāyāna path is thus said to aim at a further realization, namely an active Buddhahood that does not dwell in a static ''nirvana'', but out of [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''[[karuṇā]]'') engages in enlightened activity to liberate beings for as long as ''samsara'' remains.{{sfn|Duckworth|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 430-436}}&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|name=nonabiding1|From the Mahayana point of view, the ''nonabiding (apratiṣṭhita) nirvana'' is superior to the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle:
* Thubten Thardo (Gareth Sparham) states: "The term "non-abiding nirvāṇa" indicates that a fully awakened buddha is utterly free from saṃsāra, yet due to compassion has not entered into a more restricted form of nirvāṇa that precludes continued activity within the world."{{sfn|Khunu Rinpoche|2012|loc=Kindle loc. 1480-1482}}
* Erik Pema Kunsang states (based on teachings by Tulku Orgyen Rinpoche and Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche): "The lesser nirvana refers to the liberation from cyclic existence attained by a hinayana practitioner. When referring to a buddha, ''nirvana'' is the great nondwelling state of enlightenment which falls neither into the extreme of samsaric existence nor into the passive state of cessation attained by an arhant."{{sfn|Tsele Natsok Rangdrol|1987|p=114}}
* Thrangu Rinpoche states: "The samadhi with the union of samatha and vipasyana fully developed will free one from the bondage of samsara so one attains a state of nonabiding nirvana, which is Buddhahood.{{sfn|Thrangu Rinpoche|1993|p=125}}
* The Padmakara Translation Group states: "It  is important to realize that the term [nirvana] is understood differently by the different vehicles: the nirvana of the Basic Vehicle, the peace of cessation that an Arhat attains, is very different from a Buddha's "nondwelling" nirvana, the state of perfect enlightenment that transcends both samsara and nirvana."{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 8211-8215}}
* Peter Harvey states: "An advanced Bodhisattva who has experienced Nirvana does not rest content with this. He turns again to samsara in the service of others, which the ''Mahayana-samgraha'' calls his 'non-abiding' (apratiṣṭhita) Nirvana, not clinging either to samsara or to Nirvana as something supposedly separate from this (Nagao, 1991)."{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=137}}
* Rupert Gethin states: "For the Mahayana becoming a Buddha generally involves attaining what is characterized as the 'unestablished' or 'non-abiding' (apratiṣṭhita) nirvāṇa: on the one hand the knowledge of a buddha that sees emptiness, is not 'established' in saṃsāra (by seizing on birth as an individual being, for example), on the other hand the great compassion of a buddha prevents the complete turning away from saṃsāra. So ultimately he abides neither in saṃsāra nor in nirvāṇa."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=232}}
* Duckworth: The Lesser Vehicle does not result in the practitioner becoming a complete buddha; rather, the aim is to achieve a personal nirvana that is the total extinction of existence. The Great Vehicle, however, does result in becoming a complete buddha. A buddha remains actively engaged in enlightened activity to liberate beings for as long as samsara remains. Thus, those who accomplish the Great Vehicle do not abide in samsara due to their wisdom that sees its empty, illusory nature. Further, unlike those who attain the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle to escape samsara, they do not abide in an isolated nirvana due to their compassion. For these reasons, in the Great Vehicle, nirvana is said to be "unlocated" or "nonabiding" (''apratiṣṭhita''), staying in neither samsara nor nirvana.{{sfn|Duckworth|2011|loc=Kindle loc. 430-436}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt;}} ''Apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' is said to be reached when bodhisattvas eradicate both the afflictive obstructions (''klesavarana'') and the obstructions to omniscience (''jñeyavarana''), and is therefore different than the nirvana of arhats, who have eradicated only the former.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to Alan Sponberg, ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' is "a nirvana that is not permanently established in, or bound to, any one realm or sphere of activity".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sponberg, Alan, Dynamic liberation in Yogacara Buddhism, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted with a kind of nirvana which is "permanently established or fixed (''pratiṣṭhita'') in the transcendent state of nirvana-without-remainder (''nirupadhisesa-nirvana'')." According to Sponberg this doctrine developed among Yogacara Buddhists who rejected earlier views which were based on an individual liberation aimed at a transcendent state, separated from the mundane sphere of human existence. Mahayana Buddhists rejected this view as inconsistent with the universalist Mahayana ideal of the salvation of all beings and with the absolutist non-dual Mahayana perspective that did not see an ultimate distinction between samsara and nirvana.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Sponberg also notes that the [[Madhyamaka|Madhyamika]] school also had a hand in developing this idea, due to their rejection of dualistic concepts which separated samsara and nirvana and their promotion of a form of liberation which was totally without duality.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

Though the idea that Buddhas remain active in the world can be traced back to the Mahasamghika school, the term ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' seems to be a Yogacara innovation. According to Gadjin Nagao, the term is likely to be an innovation of the Yogacaras, and possibly of the scholar [[Asanga]] (fl. 4th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin, M. Madhyamika and Yogacara: A Study of Mahayana Philosophies, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Sponberg states that this doctrine presents a "Soteriological Innovation in [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] Buddhism" which can be found mainly in works of the Yogacara school such as the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Sandhinirmocana-sutra]],'' the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra|Lankavatarasutra]]'', the [[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|''Mahayanasutralamkara'']], and is most fully worked out in the [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha|''Mahayana-samgraha'']] of [[Asanga]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Chapter IX of the ''samgraha'', Asanga presents the classic definition of ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' in the context of discussing the severing of mental obstacles (''avarana''):&lt;blockquote&gt;This severing is the ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' of the bodhisattva. It has as its characteristic (''laksana'') the revolution (''paravrtti'') of the dual base (''asraya'') in which one relinquishes all defilements (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesa]]''), but does not abandon the world of death and rebirth (''samsara'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;In his commentary on this passage, Asvabhava (6th century), states that the wisdom which leads to this state is termed non-discriminating cognition (''nirvikalpaka-jñana)'' and he also notes that this state is a union of wisdom (''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajña]]'') and compassion (''karuna''): &lt;blockquote&gt;The bodhisattva dwells in this revolution of the base as if in an immaterial realm (''arupyadhatu''). On the one hand—with respect to his own personal interests (''svakartham'')—he is fully endowed with superior wisdom (''adhiprajña'') and is thus not subject to the afflictions (''klesa'') while on the other hand—with respect to the interests of other beings (''parartham'')—he is fully endowed with great compassion (''mahakaruna'') and thus never ceases to dwell in the world of death and re-birth (''samsara'').&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Sponberg, in Yogacara, the Buddha's special wisdom that allows participation in both nirvana and samsara, termed non-discriminating cognition (''nirvikalpaka-jñana)'' has various aspects: a negative aspect which is free from discrimination that binds one to samsara and positive and dynamic aspects which intuitively cognize the Absolute and give a Buddha "access to the Absolute without yielding efficacy in the relative."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

=== Paths to Buddhahood ===
Most sutras of the Mahāyāna tradition, states Jan Nattier, present three alternate goals of the path: [[Arhat|Arhatship]], [[Pratyekabuddha|Pratyekabuddhahood]], and [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5mWcbAXqb0C|title=The Bodhisattva Path: Based on the Ugraparipṛcchā, a Mahāyāna Sūtra|author=Jan Nattier|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2007|isbn=978-81-208-2048-7|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according an influential Mahāyāna text called the [[Lotus Sutra]], while the lesser attainment of individual ''nirvana'' is taught as a skillful means by the Buddha in order to help beings of lesser capacities; ultimately, the highest and ''only'' goal is the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=540}}{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=36}}{{sfn|Kornberg Greenberg|2008|p=88}} The Lotus sutra further states that, although these three paths are ''seemingly'' taught by Buddhas as separate vehicles (''yana''), they are really all just [[Upaya|skillful ways]] (''upaya'') of teaching a single path (''ekayana''), which is the bodhisattva path to full Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;Suguro, Shinjo; Nichiren Buddhist International Center, trans. (1998), Introduction to the Lotus Sutra, Jain Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0875730787}}, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these three separate goals are not really different at all, the 'lesser' paths are actually just clever teaching devices used by Buddhas to get people to practice, eventually though, they will be led to the one and only path of Mahāyāna and full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=228-229}}

The Mahāyāna commentary the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'' presents the path of the bodhisattva as a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|''Five Paths'' (''pañcamārga'').]] A practitioner on the ''Five Paths'' advances through a progression of ten stages, referred to as the bodhisattva ''[[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|bhūmis]]'' (grounds or levels).

===Omniscience===
The end stage practice of the Mahāyāna removes the imprints of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|delusions]], the obstructions to [[omniscience]] (''sarvākārajñatā''), which prevent simultaneous and direct knowledge of all phenomena. Only Buddhas have overcome these obstructions and, therefore, only Buddhas have omniscience knowledge, which refers to the power of a being in some way to have "simultaneous knowledge of all things whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Sara L. Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason: Santaraksita and Kamalasila on Rationality, Argumentation, and Religious Authority, 2010, p. 37.

&lt;/ref&gt; From the Mahāyāna point of view, an arhat who has achieved the nirvana of the [[Hinayana|Lesser Vehicle]] will still have certain subtle obscurations that prevent the arhat from realizing complete omniscience. When these final obscurations are removed, the practitioner will attain ''apratiṣṭhita-nirvana'' and achieve full omniscience.{{refn|group=quote|Contemporary translator Jeffrey Hopkins provides the following analogy:"If you put garlic in a vessel, it deposits some of its odor in the vessel itself; Thus when you seek to clean the vessel, it is necessary to first remove the garlic.&lt;br&gt;Similarly, a [[Avidyā (Buddhism)#Uprooting avidya|consciousness conceiving inherent existence]], like garlic, deposits predispositions in the mind that produce the ''appearance'' of inherent existence; Thus,there is no way to cleanse the mind of those predispositions, which are like the flavor of garlic left in the vessel of the mind,until one removes all consciousnesses conceiving of inherent existence from the mind. First, the garlic must be removed; then, its odor can be removed.&lt;br&gt;For this reason, according to the [[prasangika|Consequence School]], until one has utterly removed all the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|afflictive obstructions]], one cannot begin to remove the obstructions to omniscience. Since this is the case, a practitioner cannot begin overcoming the obstructions to omniscience on any of the seven first [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva grounds]], which are called "impure" because one still has afflictive obstructions to be abandoned.&lt;br&gt;Rather, one begins abandoning the obstructions to omniscience on the eighth bodhisattva ground, and continues to do so on the ninth and tenth, these three being called the 'three pure grounds" because the afflictive obstructions have been abandoned."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Hopkins (author).

Some Mahāyāna traditions see the Buddha in [[Docetism|docetic]] terms, viewing his visible manifestations as projections from its nirvanic state. According to Etienne Lamotte, Buddhas are always and at all times in nirvana, and their corporeal displays of themselves and their Buddhic careers are ultimately illusory. Lamotte writes of the Buddhas:{{quote|They are born, reach enlightenment, set turning the Wheel of Dharma, and enter nirvana. However, all this is only illusion: the appearance of a Buddha is the absence of arising, duration and destruction; their nirvana is the fact that they are always and at all times in nirvana.'&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Lamotte, tr. Sara Boin-Webb,  ''Suramgamasamadhisutra'', Curzon, London, 1998, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

This doctrine, developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahāsaṃghikas]], where the historical person, Gautama Buddha, was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''nirmāṇakāya''), while the essential Buddha is equated with the transcendental Buddha called ''[[dharmakāya]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; In Mahāyāna, this eventually developed into the doctrine of the "Three Bodies" of the Buddha (''[[Trikaya]]''). This doctrine is interpreted in different ways by the different Mahāyāna traditions. According to Reginald Ray, it is "the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is."&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQMLAAAAYAAJ|title=Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet|last=Ray|first=Reginald|publisher=Shambhala|year=2001|isbn=978-1-57062-772-9|page=13|authorlink=Reginald Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddha-nature===

An alternative idea of Mahāyāna nirvana is found in the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]''. The title itself means a ''garbha'' (womb, matrix, seed) containing ''Tathagata'' (Buddha). These [[Sutra]]s suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'.&lt;ref name="paulwilliamsp104"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|author=Paul Williams|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Buddha-nature|tathāgatagarbha]]'' doctrine ''(''also called ''buddhadhatu, buddha-nature)'', at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name="paulwilliamsp104" /&gt; Most scholars consider the ''tathāgatagarbha'' doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and it contradicts the "no self" (or no soul, no atman, anatta) doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|author=Paul Williams|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–105, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|author=Merv Fowler|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}, '''Quote:''' "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahāyāna tradition thus often discusses nirvana with its concept of the ''tathāgatagarbha'', the innate presence of Buddhahood.{{sfn|Wayman|1990}} According to Alex Wayman, Buddha nature has its roots in the idea of an innately pure [[luminous mind]] (''prabhasvara citta''{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}}), "which is only adventitiously covered over by defilements ([[Kleshas (Buddhism)|''agantukaklesa'']])"{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=288-289}} lead to the development of the concept of [[Buddha-nature]], the idea that Buddha-hood is already innate, but not recognised.{{sfn|Wayman|1990|p=42}} 

The ''[[Buddha-nature|tathāgatagarbha]]'' has numerous interpretations in the various schools of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. Indian [[Madhyamaka]] philosophers generally interpreted the theory as a description of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and as a non implicative negation (a negation which leaves nothing un-negated).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karl Brunnholzl, early Indian [[Yogachara|Yogacaras]] like [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]] referred to the term as "nothing but [[Tathātā|suchness]] in the sense of twofold [[Śūnyatā|identitylessness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However some later Yogacarins like [[Ratnākaraśānti|Ratnakarasanti]] considered it "equivalent to naturally luminous mind, nondual self-awareness."&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate as to whether ''tathāgatagarbha'' was just a way to refer to emptiness or whether it referred to some kind of mind or consciousness also resumed in [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhism,]] with some Chinese Yogacarins, like [[Fazang]] and Ratnamati supporting the idea that it was an eternal non-dual mind, while Chinese Madhyamikas like [[Jizang]] rejecting this view and seeing ''tathāgatagarbha'' as [[emptiness]] and "the middle way."&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;Hurley, Scott, The doctrinal transformation of twentieth-century Chinese Buddhism: Master Yinshun’s interpretation of the tathagatagarbha doctrine, Contemporary Buddhism, Vol. 5, No. 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;Liu , Ming-Wood. The Yogaacaaraa and Maadhyamika Interpretation of the Buddha-nature Concept in Chinese Buddhism, Philosophy East and West, Volume 35, no. 2, April 1985 P.171-192 © by University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] Buddhist texts such as the ''Samputa Tantra,'' nirvana is described as purified, non-dualistic 'superior mind'.&lt;ref&gt;Takpo Tashi Namgyal, ''Mahamudra'' Shambhala, Boston and London, 1986, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] philosophy, the debate continues to this day. There are those like the [[Gelug]] school, who argue that ''tathāgatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as [[Dharmadhatu|''dharmadhatu'']], the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation).{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}} Then there are those who see it as the non-dual union of the mind's unconditioned emptiness and conditioned lucidity (the view of [[Gorampa]] of the [[Sakya]] school).&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston &amp; London, 2014, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as the [[Jonang]] school and some [[Kagyu]] figures, see ''tathāgatagarbha'' as a kind of Absolute which "is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}

=== ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' ===
According to some scholars, the language used in the ''tathāgatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language. Kosho Yamamoto translates the explanation of nirvana in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' (c. 100-220 CE) as follows: 
{{quote|"O good man! We speak of "Nirvana". But this is not "Great" "Nirvana". Why is it "Nirvana", but not "Great Nirvana"? This is so when one cuts away defilement without seeing the Buddha-Nature. That is why we say Nirvana, but not Great Nirvana. When one does not see the Buddha-Nature, what there {{not a typo|is| is}} the non-Eternal and the non-Self. All that there {{not a typo|is| is}} but Bliss and Purity. Because of this, we cannot have Mahaparinirvana, although defilement has been done away with. When one sees well the Buddha-Nature and cuts away defilement, we then have Mahaparinirvana. Seeing the Buddha-Nature, we have the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and the Pure. Because of this, we can have Mahaparinirvana, as we cut away defilement."&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! "Nir" means "not"; "va" means "to extinguish". Nirvana means "non- extinction". Also, "va" means "to cover". Nirvana also means "not covered". "Not covered" is Nirvana. "Va" means "to go and come". "Not to go and come" is Nirvana. "Va" means "to take". "Not to take" is Nirvana." "Va" means "not fixed". When there is no unfixedness, there is Nirvana. "Va" means "new and old". What is not new and old is Nirvana.&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! The disciples of Uluka [i.e. the founder of the [[Vaishesika]] school of philosophy] and Kapila [founder of the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy] say: "Va means characterisitic". "Characteristiclessness" is Nirvana."&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! Va means "is". What is not "is" is Nirvana. Va means harmony. What has nothing to be harmonised is Nirvana. Va means suffering. What has no suffering is Nirvana.&lt;br&gt;
"O good man! What has cut away defilement is no Nirvana. What calls forth no defilement is Nirvana. O good man! The All-Buddha-Tathagata calls forth no defilement. This is Nirvana.
|Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Chapter 31|Translated by Kōshō Yamamoto&lt;ref&gt;Kosho Yamamoto (1973), The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 12, No. 374, page 346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kōshō Yamamoto|title=The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana-sutra: a complete translation from the classical Chinese language in 3 volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwQHAAAAYAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Karinbunko|pages=504–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|The names of the founders of Hindu philosophy, along with Rishaba of Jainism, as well as Shiva and Vishnu, are found in the Chinese versions of the Mahaparinirvana Sutra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis Hodous|author2=William E.

In the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', the Buddha speak of four attributes which make up nirvana. Writing on this Mahayana understanding of nirvana, [[William Edward Soothill]] and [[Lewis Hodous]] state:
{{quote|'The Nirvana Sutra claims for nirvana the ancient ideas of permanence, bliss, personality, purity in the transcendental realm. Mahayana declares that Hinayana, by denying personality in the transcendental realm, denies the existence of the Buddha. In Mahayana, final nirvana is both mundane and transcendental, and is also used as a term for the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Edward Soothill]], [[Lewis Hodous]], ''A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms'', Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1997, p. 328.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">In [[Buddhism]], especially the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] ([[Zen]]) traditions, '''non-abidance''' (in [[Sanskrit]]: ''apratiṣṭhita'', with the ''[[privative a|a-]]'' prefix, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} ‘unlimited’, ‘unlocalized’&lt;ref&gt;''Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', by [[M. Monier William]]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice of avoiding mental constructs during daily life. That is, other than while engaged in [[meditation]] (''[[Zazen]]'').

Some [[schools of Buddhism]], especially the [[Mahāyāna]], consider ''apratisthita-[[nirvana]]'' ("non-abiding cessation") to be the highest form of [[Bodhi|Buddhahood]], more profound than ''pratiṣṭhita-nirvāṇa'', the ‘localized’, lesser form.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Buswell and Donald Lopez, ''apratisthita-nirvana'' is the standard mahayana view of [[buddhahood]], which enables them to freely return to [[samsara]] in order to help sentient beings, while still remaining in nirvana and being a buddha&lt;ref&gt;Buswell, Robert E; Lopez, Donald S. ''The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism'' Princeton University press. Entry: apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa.&lt;/ref&gt; via the usage of [[nirmanakaya]] and [[sambhogakaya]].

== Term ==
Here, ''[[wikt:abide|abide]]''&lt;ref&gt;From [[wikt:abide]]: "To stay; to continue in a place; to remain stable or fixed in some state or condition; to be left."&lt;br&gt;From [[wikt:abidance]]: The sense of 'continuance; dwelling' is older than 'compliance' (19th century).&lt;/ref&gt; is used to translate ''pratiṣṭhita'', meaning "to be contained in [a locale]" or "situated", from the prefix ''prati-'' ('towards', 'in the direction of') and ''ṣṭhita'' ('established', 'set up').&lt;ref&gt;The [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=pratisthita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU ''Spoken Sanskrit Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

To translate ''pratiṣṭhita'', Chinese Buddhists used ''zhù'' (住), literally "to reside, lodge, remain". Both ''wúsuǒzhù'' (無所住 'no means of staying') and ''wúzhù'' (無住 'not staying')&lt;ref name=Soothill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soothill|first1=W.E.|authorlink1=William Edward Soothill|last2=Hodous|first2=Lewis|authorlink2=Lewis Hodous|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used for ''apratiṣṭhita''.

== Sutras ==

The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', a [[classic book|classic]] Buddhist text, is primarily concerned with the idea of non-abidance. The concept seems to have originated with the 1st-century [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist philosopher]] [[Nagarjuna]], whose version of ''[[shunyata|śūnyatā]]'', or [[emptiness]], entails that [[entity|entities]] neither exist, nor do they not exist.

Realizing the depth of this concept was also responsible of a Chan master's [[subitism|sudden enlightenment]]. The ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' relates how the spiritual patriarch [[Huineng]] was enlightened after hearing his master [[Daman Hongren|Hongren]] reciting from the ''Diamond Sutra'':
{{quote|Responding to ''the non-abiding'', yet generating the mind.&lt;br&gt; (應'''無所住'''，而生其心。 ''Yìng '''wúsuǒzhù''', er sheng qi xin''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =McRae | first =John | year =2000 | title =The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch.

Huineng then responded that [[self-nature]]s are intrinsically pure, cannot be generated or extinguished, are self-sufficient and capable of generating ''[[dharma]]''.
However, this key incident, though found in the majority of texts, is absent in the older [[Dunhuang]] version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=Transmission and Enlightenment in Chan Buddhism Seen Through the ''Platform Sūtra''|journal=Chung-hwa Buddhist Journal|year=2007|issue=20|page=396|location=Taipei|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/HistoricalZen/Transmission_and_Enlightenment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar-monk Qisong (契嵩) also noted in his foreword of the ''Platform Sutra'':
{{quote|
: The formless is the essence. (無相為體 wúxiang wei ti) 
: Non-thought is the tenet. (無念為宗 wúnian wei zong)
: ''Non-abiding'' is the fundamental. ('''無住'''為本 '''wúzhù''' wei ben)}}

Non-abiding leads to ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajñā]]'' (wisdom), as it enables one to consider that worldly issues are [[śūnyatā|empty]], so there is no point in retaliation or disputes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Platform Sutra'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pacem in terris''''' ({{lit|''Peace on Earth''}}) was a papal [[encyclical]] issued by [[Pope John XXIII]] on 11 April 1963 on the rights and obligations of individuals and of the state, as well as the proper relations between states. It emphasized [[human dignity]] and [[Human equality|equality among all people]], and made mention of issues such as the [[rights of women]], [[nuclear non-proliferation]], and the [[United Nations]], all of which it endorsed. It was the last encyclical drafted by John XXIII, who had been diagnosed with [[cancer]] in September 1962 and died two months after the encyclical's completion. Biographer [[Peter Hebblethwaite]] called it Pope John's "last will and testament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hebblethwaite |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Hebblethwaite |title=John XXIII: Pope of the Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=j0UdCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |location=London |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |year=2010 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SnZAAAAMAAJ 1st ed: ''John XXIII: Pope of the Council'' (1984)] |pages=[https://books.google.comt/books?&amp;id=j0UdCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=+%22last+will+and+testament%22 4, 214, 232, 240, 241−251] |edition=abridged, revised, and retitled |id={{ISBN|1-44118413-9}} |ISBN=978-1-441-18413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Published on [[Holy Thursday]], the Pope called it his "Easter gift".

Due to her importance and popularity, ''Pacem in Terris'' is deposited at the UN archives.

==Title==
The full title of the encyclical is ''On Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty''. The short title ''Pacem in terris'' is derived from the [[incipit|opening words]] of the encyclical, as is customary with papal documents:
{{Social teachings of the popes}}
:''Pacem in terris, quam homines universi cupidissime quovis tempore appetiverunt, condi confirmarique non posse constat, nisi ordine, quem Deus constituit, sancte servato."''
:("Peace on earth, for which all men of every era have most eagerly yearned, cannot be firmly established unless the order which God laid down is dutifully observed.")

==History==
[[Image:Stamps of Germany (BRD) 1969, MiNr 609.jpg|thumb|German Stamp 1969]]
''Pacem in terris'' was the first encyclical that a pope addressed to "all men of good will", rather than only to [[Catholic]]s, quote of the praise to God said by the heavenly army above the manger of Bethlehem ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: ''in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis'', [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleref2-nb|Luke|2:14|VULGATE}}; English translation: {{bibleref2-nb|Luke|2:13-14|DRA;WYC;TLV}}).&lt;ref&gt;Other translations did not follow the Latin version or, as in the case of the [[Italian Episcopal Conference|CEI]], have stopped following it with the 1973 revised edition of the [[Jerusalem Bible]]: compare the [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:w2.vatican.va/content/john-xxiii/it/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem.html+A+TUTTI+GLI+UOMINI+%22DI+BUONA+VOLONTÀ%22 Italian text of the encyclical's address] and the [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luca+2%3A14&amp;version=CEI different translation subsequently introduced by the Italian bishops].&lt;/ref&gt; Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, [[Mary Ann Glendon]], interprets this to mean "He was insisting that the responsibility for setting conditions for peace does not just belong to the great and powerful of the world—it belongs to each and every one of us."&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/2329/iPacem_in_Terrisi_at_50.aspx Ziegler, J.J., "Pacem in Terris at 50", ''The Catholic World Report'', June 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In theological terms, it marked a major shift in papal teaching from reliance on classical scholastic categories of natural law to a more inductive approach based on the signs of the times.&lt;ref name=Filteau/&gt;

In this work, John XXIII reacted to the political situation in the middle of the [[Cold War]]. Coming just months after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, during which the Vatican served as an intermediary between the White House and the Kremlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mncc.org/of-popes-presidents-and-peace/ Adkins, Jason. "Catholic Spirit: Of Popes, Presidents and Peace", Minnesota Catholic Conference, April 26, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the document also reflected the Pope's experience of 1960 in trying to resolve difficulties arising out the four-power occupation of Berlin. The "peace encyclical" was issued only two years after the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]]. It also draws on Pope John's reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]{{'}}s ''[[The City of God]]'' and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' view of Eternal Law.&lt;ref name=Hittinger&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-hittinger.pdf Hittinger, Russell. "Quinquagesimo Ante: Reflections on Pacem in Terris Fifty Years Later", ''The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In this it echoes the Gospel’s core values and principles of patristic and medieval thought, while reflecting the historical period in which it was written.&lt;ref name=Sanchez&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-sanchez.pdf Sanchez Sorondo, Marcelo. "The Magnitude of 'Walking in the Truth' (3 Jn 1)", ''The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis. Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Monsignor [[Pietro Pavan]] and a small group of theologians helped draft it.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Francis X., "Cardinal Pietro Pavan: inveterate optimist", ''America'', February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In Pavan’s view ''Pacem in terris'' would present the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]] on the eternal law, "in light of the changing tides of history, and allow them to resonate with a much wider audience".&lt;ref name=Hittinger/&gt;

The Pope explains in this encyclical that conflicts "should not be resolved by recourse to arms, but rather by negotiation". He further emphasizes the importance of respect of [[human rights]] as an essential consequence of the [[Christian]] understanding of men and [[nuclear disarmament]]. He clearly establishes "...That every man has the [[right to life]], to [[bodily integrity]], and to the means which are suitable for the proper development of life..."

''Pacem in terris'' is an extended reflection on the moral order. The document is divided into four sections.
*The first section of the encyclical establishes the relationship between individuals and humankind, encompassing the issues of human rights and moral duties. 
*The second section addresses the relationship between man and state, dwelling on the collective authority of the latter. 
*The third section establishes the need for equality amongst nations and the need for the state to be subject to rights and duties that the individual must abide by.
*The final section presents the need for greater relations between nations, thus resulting in collective states assisting other states. The encyclical ends with the urging of Catholics to assist non-Christians and non-Catholics in political and social aspects.

==Reception==
“Pacem in Terris was more than an encyclical—it was an event," recalls Glendon.&lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt;
''Pacem in Terris'' was the first papal encyclical published in its entirety in the ''New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/pacem-in-terris-Mannion/document/1242786616642/Mannion-Pacem+in+Terris+at+50.pdf Mannion, Gerard. "Pacem in Terris@50: Gifts Old and New for Church and Society in Recent Times", Pacem in Terris Conference 2013, Georgetown University]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Washington Post'' said, "''Pacem in terris'' is not just the voice of an old priest, nor just that of an ancient Church; it is the voice of the conscience of the world.” &lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt; Two years later, it was the subject of a conference at the United Nations attended by over 2,000 statespersons and scholars.&lt;ref name=Ziegler/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Russell Hittinger|F. Russell Hittinger]] describes the encyclical "as a kind of magna carta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law".&lt;ref name=Hittinger/&gt; Pope John XXIII's 1963 encyclical ''Pacem in terris'' ("Peace on Earth") radically affected Catholic social teaching not only on war and peace, but on church-state relations, women's rights, religious freedom, international relations and other major issues. Fr. J. Bryan Hehir, called ''Pacem in terris'' "a pivotal text in [papal] encyclical history" that played a major role in the development of the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom and its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, and on Pope John Paul II's encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'' ("The Hundredth Year"), which marked the centennial of Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical on labor, [[Rerum Novarum]].&lt;ref name=Filteau&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/theology/experts-pacem-terris-had-radical-impact-church-teaching Filteau, Jerry. "Experts: 'Pacem in Terris' had radical impact on church teaching", ''National Catholic Reporter'', Apr. 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced the 1965 ''Declaration on Religious Freedom'' ([[Dignitatis humanae]]).&lt;ref name=Filteau/&gt;

In commemoration of this encyclical, the annual ''[[Pacem in Terris Award|Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom award]]'' was instituted in 1964, first by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport]] and later by the ''[[Quad Cities]] Pacem in Terris Coalition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacem In Terris |url=http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapaceminterris.htm |publisher=Diocese of Davenport |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512050739/http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapaceminterris.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dear"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.catholicmessenger.org/articles/2010/05/19/news/doc4bf40e0730eea126578341.txt |title=Peace activist Fr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16479">The '''person–situation debate''' in [[personality psychology]] refers to the controversy concerning whether the person or the situation is more influential in determining a person's [[behavior]]. [[Personality trait]] psychologists believe that people have consistent personalities that guide their behaviors across situations. [[Situationism (psychology)|Situationists]], opponents of the trait approach, argue that people are not consistent enough from situation to situation to be characterized by broad personality traits.

==Background==

Interest in determining whether there were any generalities in behavior began in the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Epstein, S. &amp; O'Brien, E.J. (1985). The Person-Situation Debate in Historical and Current Perspective. ''Psychological Bulletin, 98'' (3), 513–537.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] and [[Henry Murray]] both supported the idea of a consistent personality with occasional situational influences.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;Hogan, R. (2009). Much ado about nothing: The person-situation debate. ''Journal of Research in personality, 43'' 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Allport noted that "traits become predictable to the extent that identities in stimulus situations are predictable."&lt;ref name=Allport&gt;Allport, G. W. (1927). Concepts of trait and personality. ''Psychological Bulletin, 24''(5), 284–293. doi:10.1037/h0073629&lt;/ref&gt; Others like [[Edward Thorndike]] viewed behavior as a composition of responses an individual has to situations.&lt;ref name=Epstein /&gt;

In 1968, [[Walter Mischel]] published a book called ''Personality and Assessment'' claiming that behavior is too cross-situationally inconsistent to be classified with personality traits. He stated:

"...with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalised behavioral consistencies have not been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad dispositions is thus untenable"&lt;ref name="Mischel1968"&gt;Mischel, Walter. (1968). ''Personality and Assessment'', London, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|146}}

His book was a non-systematic meta-analysis of some of the research on the relationship between behavioral and personality traits (assessed by either self-report or peer-report). The book also assessed studies regarding measurements of behavior from one situation to another.&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt; This book generated a formidable dispute between [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] and [[Trait theory|trait theorists]] because trait questionnaires had been used to measure personality for many decades.  Behaviorism had dominated the field of psychology up until this time, making Mischel's claim devastating to the mainstream consensus amongst personality psychologists and causing many psychologists to question and doubt whether personality exists.&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

According to [[David C. Funder]], Mischel's book posed three main questions: 
*Is personality consistent and does it overcome situational influences? 
*Are people's intuitions about each other's personalities generally flawed or generally correct?
*If personality is really that consistent, why are psychologists continuing to argue about this issue?&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;

More recently, Mischel has retracted some of his original claims, protesting that some psychologists misinterpreted his argument to mean he believes personality does not exist.&lt;ref name=Mischel&amp;Shoda&gt;Mischel, W. &amp; Shoda, Y. (1995). A cognitive-affective system theory of personality: Reconceptualizing situations, dispositions, dynamics, and invariance in personality structure. ''Psychological Review, 102,'' 246–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situationist argument==

Situationists had a number of arguments, but they can be generally summarized into four:&lt;ref name=Funder&gt;Funder, D.C. (2010). The Personality Puzzle. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, B.W. (2009). Back to the future: ''Personality and Assessment'' and personality development, ''Journal of Research in Personality 43''. 137–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Low correlations between measures of behavior and personality: In psychological research, whether relationships between variables exist are compared by the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]].  Mischel argued that in his literature review of personality research, the [[correlation]] between personality and behavior, or behavior across situations, rarely exceeded .30-.40. Because the correlations are close to zero, Mischel concluded that personality traits have little to no relationship to shaping behavior. This claim was especially detrimental to personality psychology and continues to haunt many fields of psychology research today.&lt;ref name="Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt;
# The validity of self-report measures and clinical assessment procedures: Most of the studies that Mischel reviewed had taken place in laboratory settings. Rarely was behavior analyzed in natural settings. The claim was that trait psychologists did not adequately combat issues of method variance,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. T, &amp; Fiske, D. W. (1959). Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix. ''Psychological Bulletin,'' 56, 81–105.&lt;/ref&gt; social desirability and response sets,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, A. L. (1957). The social desirability variable in personality assessment and research. New York: Dryden Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and construct validity&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J., &amp; Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. ''Psychological Bulletin, 52,'' 281–302.&lt;/ref&gt; when they constructed their measures of traits. The practical utility of trait measurements in predicting behavior was also questioned.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Even when observation studies were conducted, there was observer bias (that is, traits are in the eye of the beholder).&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;
# The type of behavioral assessment and treatment procedures that were becoming popular at the time: These treatments and behavioral assessment methods focused on the situational influences on behavior, rather than personality traits.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1967). Behavioral psychotherapy. ''Scientific American,'' 216, 78–86.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Stability: behavior is not cross-situationally consistent, and any stability can be attributed to the consistency of the situation, not the person. Situationists questioned whether personality traits exist when behaviors are not consistent across situations; after all, why spend time studying a construct that has no validity?&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

Because of the aforementioned points, situationists argued that the predictive ability of personality traits is severely lacking. Opponents of the trait approach claimed that the idea of personality traits is fundamentally flawed and that behavior would be better understood through conditioning and learning processes.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt;

==Responses==
Over time, personality psychologists have formed rebuttals to Mischel's criticisms. According to Funder, Mischel's analysis was quite short (only 16 pages), and therefore was not comprehensive of the personality literature available at the time.&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; With a fair review of the literature, the predictability of behavior from traits may be larger than what researchers previously assumed.

Improved research methods can increase the predictability. The situationist argument was formed based on research studies that were conducted in laboratory situations, and therefore did not reflect behavior in real life. When studying behaviors in a more natural setting, personality is likely to influence behavior. According to Allport, personality will be more likely to exhibit greater apparent effects in real situations that are important and influential to the individual being observed.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. (1961). ''Pattern and growth in personality.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart.&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictability can also be influenced depending on what is being measured, and some behaviors may be more consistent than others. For example, the amount a person gestures or the volume of a person's voice are more likely to be consistent across situations than goal-directed behaviors, such as when a person is trying to impress another person.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C., &amp; Colvin, C.R. (1991). Explorations in behavioral consistency: Properties of persons, situations, and behaviors. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60,'' 773–794.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W., &amp; Vernon, P.E. (1933). ''Studies in expressive movement.'' New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be that on average, individuals act consistently, and therefore personality research may be more telling as general behavioral trends than specific instances. This is evident in when people are interested in personalities of others, they are more interested in how others will generally act, not one specific behavior at a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;McCrae, R.R. (2002). The maturation of personality psychology: Adult personality development and psychological well-being. ''Journal of Research in Personality, 36,'' 307–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation of .40 is not that small of a correlation and can explain more variance than most people think. Correlation  coefficients of the effects found in studies of personality variables cannot be comparable with effects found in studies of situational variables because the two styles of research do not employ a common metric.  After converting the statistics that social psychologists use in analyzing situation variables and behavior into correlations used by personality psychologists in analyzing trait variables and behavior, Funder and [[Daniel J. Ozer]] found that the correlations between situations and behaviors are also around the .30–.40 range.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C., &amp; Ozer, D.J. (1983). Behavior as a function of the situation. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 44,'' 107–112.&lt;/ref&gt; After conversion, it was found that even well-respected studies, like the one conducted by [[Stanley Milgram]] on obedience that used fake electric shocks to study how people react to being asked to cause harm to others ([[Milgram Experiment]]), found correlations of situations and behaviors to be around .40.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, S. (1975). ''Obedience to authority.'' New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, survey studies that compare the effects of situational variables on behavior show that the correlation between situation and behavior are also around the .30–.40 range.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; [[Seymour Epstein]] found that if the behaviors were aggregated over time, the cross situational consistency of behaviors is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1979). The stability of behavior: I. On predicting most of the people much of the time. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, 1097–1126.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in highly controlled studies, cross-situational consistency is around the .40 range.&lt;ref&gt;Borkenau, P., Mauer, N., Riemann, R., Spinath, F. M., &amp; Angleitner, A. (2004). Thin slices of behavior as cues of personality and intelligence. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86,'' 599–614.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personality traits are important because personality traits exist. The field of personality psychology gained attention when Allport had his assistant, [[Henry Odbert]], count how many different words in the English dictionary could be used to describe differences in personality. Odbert reported 17, 953.&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W., &amp; Odbert, H.S. (1936). Trait-names: A psycho-lexical study. ''Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 47''(1, Whole No. 211), 171–220.&lt;/ref&gt; With such a large number of words that are related to personality trait differences, Allport and Odbert proposed the [[Lexical hypothesis]], or the theory that traits are obviously an important part of how people think and talk about each other, or else it would not be a part of the language. Words that make people more sensitive to individual differences are continuing to be created and formed today.&lt;ref name=Funder /&gt;

==Current directions==
Mischel's book raised important questions about trait concepts and measures in psychological research. Researchers like [[Douglas Kenrick]] and Funder note that controversy is beneficial to scientific research because it helps narrow down competing hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, D.T. &amp; Funder, D.C. (1988). Profiting from Controversy: Lessons from the Person-Situation Debate. ''American Psychologist, 43'' (1), 23–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most personality researchers have now concluded that both the person and the situation contribute to behavior. Specifically, situational variables are more conclusive when it comes to predicting behavior in specific situations, while traits are more descriptive of patterns of behavior that influence behavior across situations.&lt;ref&gt;Fleeson, W. (2001). Toward a structure- and process-integrated view of personality: Traits as density distribution of states. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 80,'' 1011–1027.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have also suggested the possibility of situational factors (like social roles) eliciting situation-specific goals which then influence the development of personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, D., Perunovic, W. Q. E., Reichman, D. (2009). The future of person-situation integration in the interface between traits and goals: A bottom-up framework. ''Journal of Research in Personality, 43,'' 171–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactionism===
The [[interactionism]] perspective recognizes that the effect of personality depends on the situation and that situations are affected by the personalities of the people who are present. Interactionism also recognizes that people often choose situations that reflect their personalities.&lt;ref name=Funder/&gt; One of the many interactionism researchers, [[Allan R. Buss]], introduced the idea that persons and situations interact in three different ways: 
*The effect of personality on behavior depends on the situation and vice versa
*Certain people typically find themselves in certain situations, depending on their personality
*People change situations by how they act and what they do in these situations.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, A.R. (1977). The trait-situation controversy and the concept of interaction. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 5,'' 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly used example of person-situation interaction is the [[Stanford prison experiment]], where college students participated in a study that simulated a prison setting with some students acting as guards and others as prisoners. The study was terminated when the guards became even more abusive than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Haney, C., Banks., C., &amp; Zimbardo, P. (1973). Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison. ''International Journal of Criminology and Penology, 1,'' 69–97.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Philip Zimbardo]] concluded that the study shows evidence of the effect of the situation transcending personality traits, more recent studies show that these students were drawn to participate in a study of "prison life" because of their personality characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Carnahan, T., &amp; McFarland, S. (2007). Revisiting the Stanford Prison Experiment: Could participant self-selection have led to the cruelty? ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 33,'' 603–614.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
Recently, personality psychologists William Fleeson and Erik Noftle have suggested that the person-situation debate ended in a [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]. According to them, there is more than one type of behavior consistency. Traits are not robustly predictive of cross-situational consistency, but rather, predictive of consistency for a wide distribution of behaviors over time.&lt;ref&gt;Fleeson, W., &amp; Noftle, E. E. (2009). The end of the person-situation debate: an emerging synthesis in the answer to the consistency question. ''Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 2'' (4), 1667–1684.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleeson has also proposed that traits can be better understood as density distributions of behaviors.  He posited that an individual has an anchor mean level of a trait, but the individual's behavior can vary around this mean depending on situations. Therefore, this distribution could account for the low cross-situational consistency of single acts of behavior while also explaining the high consistency of behaviors over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">In [[artificial intelligence]], '''preference-based planning''' is a form of [[automated planning and scheduling]] which focuses on producing plans that additionally satisfy as many user-specified [[preference]]s as possible. In many [[problem domain]]s, a task can be accomplished by various sequences of actions (also known as plans). These plans can vary in quality: there can be many ways to solve a problem but one generally prefers a way that is, e.g., cost-effective, quick and safe.

Preference-based planners take these preferences into account when producing a plan for a given problem. Examples of preference-based planning software include ''PPLAN''&lt;ref name="pplan"&gt;[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sheila/PPLAN/ PPLAN], Bienvenu et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''HTNPlan-P''&lt;ref name="htnplanp"&gt;[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kr/publications/1242050782_Sohrabi-IJCAI09.pdf HTN Planning with Preferences], Sohrabi et al.&lt;/ref&gt; (preference-based [[Hierarchical task network|HTN planning]]).

== Overview ==

Preferences can be regarded as soft constraints on a plan. The quality of a plan increases when more preferences are satisfied but it may not be possible to satisfy all preferences in a single plan. This differs from hard constraints which must be satisfied in all plans produced by the planning software. These hard constraints are part of the domain knowledge while the soft constraints (or preferences) are separately specified by the user. This allows the same domain knowledge to be reused for various users who may have different preferences.

The use of preferences may also increase the length of a plan in order to satisfy more preferences. For example, when planning a journey from home to school, the user may prefer to buy a cup of coffee along the way. The planning software could now plan to visit [[Starbucks]] first and then continue to school.&lt;ref name="starbucks"&gt;[http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/papers/tplp-plan-prefs.pdf Planning with Preferences using Logic Programming], Son and Pontelli&lt;/ref&gt; This increases the length of the plan but the user's preference is satisfied.

== Planning Domain Definition Language ==

The [[Planning Domain Definition Language]] (as of version 3.0&lt;ref name="pddl3"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2008.10.012 Deterministic planning in the fifth international planning competition: PDDL3 and experimental evaluation of the planners], Gerevini et al.&lt;/ref&gt;) supports the specification of preferences through &lt;code&gt;preference&lt;/code&gt; statements. For example, the statement

:&lt;code&gt;(preference (always (clean room1)))&lt;/code&gt;

indicates that the user prefers that &lt;code&gt;room1&lt;/code&gt; should be clean at each state of the plan. In other words, the planner should not schedule an action that causes &lt;code&gt;room1&lt;/code&gt; to become dirty. As this example shows, a preference is evaluated with regard to all states of a plan (if [[Semantics|semantically]] required).

In addition to &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, other constructs based on [[linear temporal logic]] are also supported, such as &lt;code&gt;sometime&lt;/code&gt; (at least once during the plan), &lt;code&gt;sometime-after&lt;/code&gt; (to be planned after a particular state) and &lt;code&gt;at-most-once&lt;/code&gt; (the preference holds during at most one sequence of states in the plan).

=== Plan quality ===

In addition to determining whether a preference is satisfied, we also need to compute the quality of a plan based on how many preferences are satisfied. For this purpose, PDDL 3.0 includes an expression called &lt;code&gt;is-violated &lt;name&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is equal to "the number of distinct preferences with the given name that are not satisfied in the plan".&lt;ref name="pddl3"/&gt; For a plan, a value can now be computed using a metric function, which is specified with &lt;code&gt;:metric&lt;/code&gt;:

:&lt;code&gt;(:metric minimize (+ (* 5 (is-violated pref1)) (* 7 (is-violated pref2))))&lt;/code&gt;

This example metric function specifies that the calculated value of the plan should be minimized (i.e., a plan with value ''v1'' and a plan with value ''v2'' such that ''v1'' &lt; ''v2'', the former plan is strictly preferred). The value of a plan is computed by the given function, which is expressed in [[Polish notation]]. In this case, violation of the second preference has been given a greater penalty than the first preference.

== Constraints satisfaction problem ==

In the area of [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s, flexible variants exist that deal with soft constraints in a similar way to preferences in preference-based planning.

A '''radar chart''' is a [[List of graphical methods|graphical method]] of displaying [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[data]] in the form of a two-dimensional [[chart]] of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. The relative position and angle of the axes is typically uninformative.

The radar chart is also known as '''web chart''', '''spider chart''', '''star chart''',&lt;ref&gt;Nancy R. Tague (2005) ''The quality toolbox''. page 437.&lt;/ref&gt; '''star plot''', '''cobweb chart''', '''irregular polygon''', '''polar chart''', or '''Kiviat diagram'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolence|first1=Kenneth W.|title=The Software Empiricist|journal=ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review|date=1973|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.1145/1113644.1113647 |quote=Dr. Philip J. Kiviat suggested at a recent NBS/ACM workshop on performance measurement that a circular graph, using radii as the variable axes might be a useful form. […] I recommend they be called "Kiviat Plots" or "Kiviat Graphs" to recognize his insight as to their importance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=radarandpolar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.content-workshops.com/toolbox/2015/2/find-content-gaps-using-radar-charts |title=Find Content Gaps Using Radar Charts |publisher=Content Strategy Workshops |date=March 3, 2015 |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is equivalent to a [[parallel coordinates]] plot in [[polar coordinates]].

== Overview ==
The radar chart is a [[chart]] and/or [[Plot (graphics)|plot]] that consists of a sequence of equi-angular spokes, called radii, with each spoke representing one of the variables. The data length of a spoke is proportional to the magnitude of the variable for the data point relative to the maximum magnitude of the variable across all data points. A line is drawn connecting the data values for each spoke. This gives the plot a star-like appearance and the origin of one of the popular names for this plot. The star plot can be used to answer the following questions:&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;
* Which observations are most similar, i.e., are there clusters of observations? (Radar charts are used to examine the relative values for a single data point (e.g., point 3 is large for variables 2 and 4, small for variables 1, 3, 5, and 6) and to locate similar points or dissimilar points.)&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;
* Are there outliers?

Radar charts are a useful way to display [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] observations with an arbitrary number of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, John, William Cleveland, Beat Kleiner, and Paul Tukey, (1983). ''Graphical Methods for Data Analysis''. Wadsworth. pp. 158-162&lt;/ref&gt;  Each star represents a single observation. Typically, radar charts are generated in a multi-plot format with many stars on each page and each star representing one observation.&lt;ref name="NIST03"&gt;NIST/SEMATECH (2003). [http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/starplot.htm Star Plot] in: ''e-Handbook of Statistical Methods''. 6/01/2003 (Date created)&lt;/ref&gt; The star plot was first used by [[Georg von Mayr]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Mayr |first=Georg von |year=1877 |title=Die Gesetzmäßigkeit im Gesellschaftsleben |language=German |publisher=Oldenbourg |location=Munich |url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23294909M/Die_Gesetzm%C3%A4ssigkeit_im_Gesellschaftsleben |doi= }}, p.78. Linien-Diagramme im Kreise: Line charts in circles.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MF08"&gt;[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].&lt;/ref&gt; Radar charts differ from [[glyph plot]]s in that all variables are used to construct the plotted star figure. There is no separation into [[foreground]] and [[background variables]]. Instead, the star-shaped figures are usually arranged in a rectangular array on the page. It is somewhat easier to see patterns in the data if the observations are arranged in some non-arbitrary order (if the variables are assigned to the rays of the star in some meaningful order).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Friendly (1991). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/sugi/sugi16-paper.html "Statistical Graphics for Multivariate Data"]. Paper presented at the SAS SUGI 16 Conference, Apr, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
One application of radar charts is the control of [[Quality management|quality improvement]] to display the [[performance metric]]s of any ongoing program.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Basu (2004). ''Implementing Quality: A Practical Guide to Tools and Techniques''. p.131.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used in sports to chart players' strengths and weaknesses, where they are usually called spider charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtowatchsports.com/spider-graphs-charting-basketball-statistics/ Spider Graphs: Charting Basketball Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Radar charts are primarily suited for strikingly showing ''[[outlier]]s'' and ''[[commonality]]'', or when one chart is greater in every variable than another, and primarily used for [[Ordinal scale|ordinal measurement]]s – where each variable corresponds to "better" in some respect, and all variables on the same scale.

Conversely, radar charts have been criticized as poorly suited for making trade-off decisions – when one chart is greater than another on some variables, but less on others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/09/18/better-radar-charts-excel/ You are NOT spider man, so why do you use radar charts?], by Chandoo, September 18th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, it is hard to visually compare lengths of different spokes, because radial distances are hard to judge, though concentric circles help as grid lines. Instead, one may use a simple line graph, particularly for time series.&lt;ref name="ratc" /&gt;

=== Artificial structure ===
Radar charts impose several structures on data, which are often artificial:
* Relatedness of neighbors – radar charts are often used when neighboring variables are unrelated, creating spurious connections.
* Cyclic structure – the first and last variables are placed next to each other.
* Length – variables are often most naturally ''ordinal:'' better or worse, though the ''degree'' of difference may be artificial.
* Area – area scales as the ''square'' of values, exaggerating the effect of large numbers. For example, 2, 2 takes up 4 times the area of 1, 1. This is a general issue with area graphs, and area is hard to judge – see "Cleveland's hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Cleveland|1984}}, summarized at http://processtrends.com/toc_data_visualization.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325233432/http://processtrends.com/toc_data_visualization.htm |date=March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the alternating data 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1 yields a spiking radar chart (which goes in and out), while reordering the data as 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1 instead yields two distinct wedges (sectors).

In some cases there is a natural structure, and radar charts can be well-suited. For example, for diagrams of data that vary over a 24-hour cycle, the hourly data is naturally related to its neighbor, and has a cyclic structure, so it can naturally be displayed as a radar chart.&lt;ref name="ratc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peltier |first=Jon |url=http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/rock-around-the-clock/ |title=Rock Around The Clock - Peltier Tech Blog |publisher=Peltiertech.com |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/charting-around-the-clock/ |title=Charting around the clock The Excel Charts Blog |publisher=Excelcharts.com |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clockthis"&gt;[http://i-ocean.blogspot.com/2008/08/clock-this.html Clock This]&lt;/ref&gt;

One set of guidelines on the use of radar charts (or rather the closely related "polar area graph") is:&lt;ref name="clockthis" /&gt;
* you don't mind reading stacked areas instead of position along a common scale (see Cleveland's Hierarchy),
* the data set is truly ''cyclic,'' not linear, and
* there are ''two'' series to ''compare,'' one ''much smaller'' than the other

=== Data set size ===
Radar charts are helpful for small-to-moderate-sized multivariate [[data set]]s. Their primary weakness is that their effectiveness is limited to data sets with less than a few hundred points. After that, they tend to be overwhelming.&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Star_Plot_of_16_cars.jpg|alt=|thumb|354x354px]]
[[Image:Star plot Detail.gif|thumb|right|Detail for the star plot of the Cadillac Seville.]]
The chart on the right&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;  contains the star plots of 15 [[car]]s. The variable list for the sample star plot is:

#  Price
#  Mileage (MPG)
#  1978 Repair Record (1 = Worst, 5 = Best)
#  1977 Repair Record (1 = Worst, 5 = Best)
#  Headroom
#  Rear Seat Room
#  Trunk Space
#  Weight
#  Length

We can look at these plots individually or we can use them to identify clusters of cars with similar features. For example, we can look at the star plot of the Cadillac Seville (the last one on the image) and see that it is one of the most expensive cars, gets below average (but not among the worst) gas mileage, has an average repair record, and has average-to-above-average roominess and size. We can then compare the [[Cadillac]] models (the last three plots) with the AMC models (the first three plots). This comparison shows distinct patterns. The AMC models tend to be inexpensive, have below average gas mileage, and are small in both height and weight and in roominess. The Cadillac models are expensive, have poor gas mileage, and are large in both size and roominess.&lt;ref name="NIST03"/&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Most simply, one may use a simple line graph, particularly for time series.&lt;ref name="ratc" /&gt;

For graphical qualitative comparison of 2-dimensional tabular data in several variables, a common alternative are [[Harvey Balls]], which are used extensively by [[Consumer Reports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supportanalytics.com/blog/2007/12/qualitative-comparison/ |title=Qualitative Comparison |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 December 2007 |website=Support Analytics Blog |publisher=&lt;!--Substantially similar to website.--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408192509/http://supportanalytics.com/blog/2007/12/qualitative-comparison/ |archivedate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison in Harvey Balls (and radar charts) may be significantly aided by ordering the variables algorithmically to add order.&lt;ref name="reorder" /&gt;

An excellent way for visualising structures within multivariate data is offered by [[principal component analysis]] (PCA).

Another alternative is to use small, inline bar charts, which may be compared to [[sparkline]]s.&lt;ref name="reorder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-ocean.blogspot.com/2008/09/reorderable-tables-ii-bertin-versus.html |title=Information Ocean: Reorderable tables II: Bertin versus the Spiders |publisher=I-ocean.blogspot.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2013-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although radar and polar charts are often described as the same chart types,&lt;ref name=radarandpolar /&gt; some sources make a difference between them and even consider the radar chart to be a polar chart's variation that does not display data in terms of polar coordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd239337.aspx |title=Polar Charts (Report Builder and SSRS) |publisher=Microsoft Developer Network |accessdate=December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7811">{{About|the literary concept||Resistance (disambiguation){{!}}Resistance}}
'''Resistance''' is a mythical concept created by [[United States|American]] novelist [[Steven Pressfield]] that illustrates the universal force that he claims acts against human [[creativity]].{{sfn|Holiday|2012}} It was first described in his non-fiction book ''[[The War of Art (book)|The War of Art]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|2002}} and elaborated in the follow-up books ''[[Do The Work]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|2011a}} and ''Turning Pro'',{{sfn|Pressfield|2012}} and in other essays.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Pressfield|2011b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a recurring theme in some of his fiction novels such as ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|1995}} and ''[[The Virtues of War]]''.{{sfn|Pressfield|2004}}

Resistance is described in a [[mythical]] fashion as a universal force that has one sole mission: to keep things as they are. Pressfield claims that Resistance does not have a personal vendetta against anyone, rather it is simply trying to accomplish its only mission.{{sfn|Pressfield|2002|p=11}} It is the force that will stop an individual's creative activity through any means necessary, whether it be [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalizing]], inspiring [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], emphasizing other [[distraction]]s that require attention, raising the voice of an [[inner critic]], and much more. It will use any tool to stop creation flowing from an individual, no matter what field the creation is in.{{sfn|Pressfield|2002|pp=4–56}}

Pressfield goes on to claim that Resistance is the most dangerous element to one's life and dreams since its sole mission is to [[sabotage]] aspirations. He explains steps that human beings can take to overcome this force and keep it subdued so that they can create to their fullest potential, although Resistance is never fully gone.{{sfn|Pressfield|2012|p=74}}

Pressfield's concept of Resistance has been cited by authors such as [[Seth Godin]],{{sfn|Godin|2010}} [[David Kadavy]], [[David M. Kelley]] and Tom Kelley,{{sfn|Kelley|Kelley|2013}} [[Eric Liu]] and the [[Lincoln Center Institute]],{{sfn|Liu|Noppe-Brandon|2009}} [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and [[Sharon Lechter]],{{sfn|Kiyosaki|Lechter|2005}} and [[Gina Trapani]].{{sfn|Trapani|2008}}

==Criticism==
Psychologist Frederick Heide has cited Pressfield's book ''[[The War of Art (book)|The War of Art]]'' and questioned whether "fighting" Resistance is always a helpful metaphor; Heide suggested that such [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] metaphors could end up "ironically perpetuating the resistance it predicts."{{sfn|Heide|2010|p=68}} Nevertheless, Heide noted, such an agonistic approach to resistance remains widespread in [[psychotherapeutic]] thinking.{{sfn|Heide|2010|p=79}} Heide cites a scholarly article that points to some alternative nonagonistic strategies for working with resistance in [[Relational psychoanalysis|relational psychoanalytic]] psychotherapy, [[Personal construct theory|personal construct]] therapy, [[narrative therapy]], [[motivational interviewing]], [[process-experiential therapy]], and [[coherence therapy]].{{sfn|Frankel|Levitt|2006|pp=220–221}}

'''SS ''Politician''''' was an 8000-ton cargo ship owned by T &amp; J Harrison of Liverpool. It left [[Liverpool]] on 3 February 1941, bound for [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]] and [[New Orleans]] with a cargo including 28,000 cases of [[malt whisky]].  The ship sank off the north coast of [[Eriskay]] in the Outer Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland, and much of the wreck's cargo was [[Marine_salvage|salvaged]] by the island's inhabitants.  The story of the wreck and looting was the basis for the book and film ''[[Whisky Galore (disambiguation)|Whisky Galore!]]''.

== Origin ==

The ship was called ''Politician'' only after 1935, when she was purchased by T &amp; J Harrison from [[Furness Withy|Furness, Withy and Co.]], who had called her ''London Merchant''.
&lt;ref name="merchant"&gt;[http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/harrisons.html T &amp; J Harrisons]. Quoting A.G. Collingwood. ''Sea Breezes''. May 1977 – via ''Merchant Navy Officers''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same transaction, the vessels ''Royal Prince'', ''Imperial Prince'' and ''British Prince'' became ''Collegian'', ''Craftsman'' and ''Statesman'' respectively. All four [[steam turbine|turbine]]-engined [[sister ship]]s were built in 1922-3 to have a length of {{convert|450|ft|6|in}} and beam {{convert|58|ft}}, gross {{convert|8000|LT|t}} and achieve {{convert|14|kn}}. Built for the Furness London-New York route, Harrisons employed them to South Africa in peacetime.&lt;ref name="duster"&gt;[http://www.red-duster.co.uk/PRINCE13.htm Prince Line]. ''Red Duster''. The Merchant Navy Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrisons had previously owned another ''Politician'', built by [[Swan Hunter]] in 1899, which was bought by [[Christian Salvesen]] in 1922, renamed ''Coronda'' and used from 1940-5 as a store ship on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]].&lt;ref name="merchant"/&gt;

== History ==

On 5 February 1941, during [[gale force]] winds, she ran aground off the Island of [[Eriskay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] and later broke in two near the islet of [[Calvay]]. The crew were all unharmed and were looked after by the locals for a while.

When the locals learned from the crew of the ''Politician'' what the ship was carrying, a series of illegal, and later well-organised salvage operations took place at night, before the [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|customs and excise]] officials arrived. The island's supplies of whisky had dried up due to war-time rationing, so the islanders periodically helped themselves to some of the 28,000 cases (264,000 bottles) of Scotch whisky before winter weather broke up the ship. The men wore women's dresses on their "fishing trips", to keep their own clothes from being covered in incriminating oil from the ship's holds.  Boats came from as far away as [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] as news of the whisky spread across the Hebrides. No islander regarded it as stealing; for them the rules of salvage meant that once the bounty was in the sea, it was theirs to rescue.&lt;ref name="macphee"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/ss-politician-whisky-galore-off-eriskay-1-465109 Scotsman Heritage article valid December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the view of the local customs officer. Charles McColl was incensed at what he saw as outright thievery going on. None of the whisky had paid a penny of duty, and he railed against this loss to the public purse. McColl whipped up a furore and made the police act. Villages were raided and [[Croft (land)|croft]]s turned upside down. Bottles were hidden, secreted, or simply drunk in order to hide the evidence.

== Trials ==

McColl and the police caught plenty of locals red-handed, and they were sent to trial. On 26 April at [[Lochmaddy]] Sheriff Court, a group of men from [[Barra]] pleaded guilty to theft and were charged between three and five pounds. McColl was beside himself at the leniency of the sentence, but the police (being largely locals themselves) were tired of harassing the locals who had not, in their minds, done such a bad thing.

But McColl continued on his crusade, and more men did appear in court, some of whom were sentenced to up to six weeks imprisonment in [[Inverness]] and [[Peterhead]].

At sea, salvage attempts did not go well, and it was eventually decided to let ''Politician'' remain where she was. McColl, who had already estimated that the islanders had purloined 24,000 bottles of whisky, ensured that there would be no more temptation. He applied for, and was granted, permission to explode her hull.

The islanders watched this extraordinary action, their emotions summed up by Angus John Campbell, who commented, "Dynamiting whisky. You wouldn't think there'd be men in the world so crazy as that!"&lt;ref name="macphee"/&gt;

== Banknotes ==
At the time, [[the Crown]] remained very unforthcoming about the incident, the cargo and the salvage. The majority of its hold was taken up by the whisky, but there was also an assortment of other cargo ranging from baths, plumbing fittings, pianos, art silks, motor parts, bedding, furniture, food and banknotes for Jamaica.

[[Public Record Office]] files released in January 2001&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1319533/Banknotes-galore-after-whisky-ship-hit-the-rocks.html The Daily Telegraph 26 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; show that ''Politician'' was also carrying nearly 290,000 ten-shilling notes (145,000 pounds), which would be worth the equivalent of several million pounds at current exchange rates. (To give an idea of how much that was worth, a corporal on full pay in the [[British Army]] received 35 shillings a week). The British government hoped that they would not get into circulation, but they started turning up at banks all around the world. Some sources&lt;ref name="swinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antonia Swinson 'Return of scotch on the rocks' "&gt;[http://www.antoniaswinson.co.uk/resources.php?type=article&amp;pid=57 Antonia Swinson 'Return of scotch on the rocks'] &lt;/ref&gt; suggest that these supplies were being sent to the colonies in case there was need of evacuation in the war.

As soon as the weather allowed, Eriskay was besieged with customs officials, insurance agents and legitimate salvage companies. It is reported{{by whom|date=August 2013}} that the custom officials were not well received and one agent was refused accommodation by most of the townsfolk.

In April 1941 Captain E Lauriston, who was in charge of the operation, claimed that the banknotes had turned up in [[Benbecula]], {{convert|25|mi}} north of the wreck. The salvage company stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is reported that some of the children on the island have been playing with them and the locals, most of whom are known to be incriminated in the looting, are too wily to give anything away.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a memorandum, the Crown Agents noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The local police service is in no doubt on a very, very small scale but the nature of the place and its surroundings should tend to reduce the chances of serious loss through the notes being presented and paid.&lt;ref name="telegraph 2001 26 January"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Suspicions only began to rise when an empty cash case was found abandoned in the hold of the ship. By June, the banknotes from ''Politician'' were turning up in branches as far away as Liverpool. By mid July, a hundred or so had been tendered in Jamaica and almost two hundred in Britain.

By 1958 the Crown Agents reported that 211,267 notes had been recovered by the salvage company and the police and had been destroyed. A further 2,329 had been presented in banks in England, Scotland, Ireland, Switzerland, Malta, Canada, the US, and Jamaica. Only 1,509 were thought to have been presented in good faith. That still leaves 76,404 banknotes which have never been accounted for. Their fate remains a mystery.

The wreck of the ''Politician'' still lies off the coast of Eriskay, although it is below water line now as the winter gales destroyed the deck and cabins. In 1988 the island got its own legitimate pub, named The Politician ({{lang-gd|Am Politician}}).

== SS ''Politician'' in popular culture ==

The story of the shipwreck inspired the [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s 1947 novel ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]'' which was made into an [[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Ealing Comedy film]] in 1949.

A "Poem of the S.S ''Politician''" is attributed to Angus Mcintyre, Tobermory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.searoom.com/veleda/logsec05/politician.htm |title=Whiskey Galore: SS Politician |website=SeaRoom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003062832/http://www.searoom.com/veleda/logsec05/politician.htm |archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Oi Polloi]] wrote a song about this ship on their album ''Ar Ceòl Ar Cànan Ar-A-Mach''.

Two books have been written detailing the history:

== Recent history ==

In 1987 Donald MacPhee, a local [[South Uist]] man, found eight bottles of whisky in the wreck; he sold them at Christies' auction for £4,000.&lt;ref name="macphee"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/ss-politician-whisky-galore-off-eriskay-1-465109 Scotsman Heritage article valid December 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1989 a salvage company, SS Politician plc, was founded by Churchill Baron Financial Services of Glasgow, with Jeremy Brough as company chairman.
About £400,000 was invested by more than 500 people, but moving hundreds of tons of sand and steel plates only uncovered 24 more bottles, thereby creating a notional rate of return of £16,667/[[fifth (unit)|bottle]].  Some of the whisky was blended and bottled by SS Politician plc.

In 2013 two of the original eight bottles of whisky salvaged in 1987 by Donald MacPhee, sold for £12,050 after an online auction. Scotch Whisky Auctions, which sold the bottles, said they had gone to a buyer in the UK after worldwide interest.&lt;ref name="macphee3"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-22428609 Whisky Galore bottles fetch £12,050].

{{emotion}}
'''Sorrow''' is an [[emotion]], feeling, or sentiment. Sorrow "is more 'intense' than [[sadness]]... it implies a long-term state".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Wierzbicka, ''Emotions across Languages and Cultures'' (1999) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time "sorrow — but not unhappiness — suggests a degree of resignation... which lends sorrow its peculiar air of dignity".&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka, p. 66"&gt;Wierzbicka, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, "in terms of attitude, sorrow can be said to be half way between ''sadness'' (accepting) and ''distress'' (not accepting)".&lt;ref name="Wierzbicka, p. 66"/&gt;

==Cult==
[[Romanticism]] saw a cult of sorrow develop, reaching back to ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' of 1774, and extending through the nineteenth century with contributions like [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.|In Memoriam]]" — "O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me/No casual mistress, but a wife"&lt;ref&gt;''In Memoriam'' (London 1851) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; — up to [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1889, still "of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (London 1983) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; While it may be that "the [[Romantic hero]]'s cult of sorrow is largely a matter of pretence",&lt;ref&gt;Lilian R. Furst, ''Romanticism in Perspective'' (1979) p. 102-3&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Jane Austen]] pointed out satirically through [[Marianne Dashwood]], "brooding over her sorrows... this excess of suffering"&lt;ref&gt;Jane Austen, ''Sense and Sensibility'' (London 1932) p. 183 and p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; may nevertheless have serious consequences.

Partly in reaction, the 20th century has by contrast been pervaded by the belief that "''acting'' sorrowful can actually make me sorrowful, as William James long ago observed".&lt;ref&gt;Jenefer Robinson, ''Deeper than Reason'' (2005) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly "in the modern Anglo-emotional culture, characterized by the 'dampening of the emotions' in general... sorrow has largely given way to the milder, less painful, and more transient sadness".&lt;ref&gt;Wierzbicka, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; A latter-day Werther is likely to be greeted by the call to '"Come off it, Gordon. We all know there is no sorrow like unto your sorrow"';&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Last Things'' (Penguin 1974) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; while any conventional 'valeoftearishness and deathwhereisthystingishness' would be met by the participants 'looking behind the sombre backs of one another's cards and discovering their {{Sic|?|hide=y|brightly|-}}colored faces'.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Grass, ''The Meeting at Telgte'' (London 1981) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps only the occasional subculture like the [[Jung]]ian would still seek to 'call up from the busy adult man the sorrow of animal life, the grief of all nature, "the tears of things"'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modernity]] has (if anything) only intensified the shift: 'the postmodern is closer to the human comedy than to the abyssal discontent...the abyss of sorrow'.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Black Sun'' (New York 1989) p. 258-9 and p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postponement==
'Not feeling sorrow invites fear into our lives. The longer we put off feeling sorrow, the greater our fear of it becomes. [[Postponement of affect|Postponing]] the expression of the feeling causes its energy to grow'.&lt;ref&gt;Erika M. Hunter, ''Little Book of Big Emotions'' (London 2004) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it would seem that 'grief in general is a "taming" of the primitive violent discharge affect, characterized by fear and self-destruction, to be seen in mourning'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 19460 p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Kristeva]] suggests that 'taming sorrow, not fleeing sadness at once but allowing it to settle for a while...is what one of the temporary and yet indispensable phases of [[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] might be'.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 84-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shand and McDougall==
Sadness is one of four interconnected ''sentiments'' in the system of [[Alexander Faulkner Shand]], the others being fear, anger, and joy.  In this system, when an impulsive tendency towards some important object is frustrated, the resultant sentiment is sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=73|chapter=Sentiments, Character, Free Will|title=Ethical Problems|author=Beatrice Edgell|location=London|publisher=Methuen &amp;amp; Co. Ltd|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shand's view, the emotion of sorrow, which he classifies as a primary emotion, has two ''impulses'': to cling to the object of sorrow, and to repair the injuries done to that object that caused the emotion in the first place.  Thus the primary emotion of sorrow is the basis for the emotion of pity, which Shand describes as a fusion of sorrow and joy: sorrow at the injury done to the object of pity, and joy as an "element of sweetness" tinging that sorrow.&lt;ref name=McDougall&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction To Social Psychology|author=[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]]|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp;amp; Distributors|date=1994|isbn=9788171564965|pages=68&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] disagreed with Shand's view, observing that Shand himself recognized that sorrow was itself derived from simpler elements. To support this argument, he observes that [[grief]], at a loss, is a form of sorrow where there is no impulse to repair injury, and that therefore there are identifiable subcomponents of sorrow. He also observes that although there is an element of emotional pain in sorrow, there is no such element in pity, thus pity is not a compound made from sorrow as a simpler component.&lt;ref name=McDougall /&gt;

'''Sparśa''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''phassa'') is a Sanskrit/Indian term that is translated as "contact", "touching", "sensation", "sense impression", etc. It is defined as the coming together of three factors: the [[Ayatana|sense organ]], the [[Ayatana|sense object]], and [[Vijnana|sense consciousness (vijnana)]].&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 401-405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, contact (''sparsha'') is said to occur at the coming together of the eye organ, a visual object, and the visual sense consciousness.

Sparśa is identified within the Buddhist teachings as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Seven universal mental factors|''seven universal mental factors'']] in the Theravada Abhidharma.
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Five universal mental factors|''five universal mental factors'']] in the Mahayana Abhidharma
* The sixth link in the [[Twelve Nidanas|twelve links of dependent origination]]

==Explanation==

===Theravada===
The [[Atthasālinī]] (Expositor, Part IV, Chapter I, 108) states:

: Contact means “it touches”. It has touching as its salient characteristic, impact as its function, “coinciding” (of the physical base, object and consciousness) as its manifestation, and the object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Contact.html#Contact Definition of Contact]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:Phassa is manifested by coinciding or concurrence, namely, by the coinciding of three factors: physical base (vatthu), object and consciousness.

:When there is seeing, there is the coinciding of eye (the eyebase), visible object and seeing-consciousness; through this concurrence phassa, which is in this case eye-contact, is manifested.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

Nina van Gorkom also explains:
:Phassa is different from what we mean in conventional language by physical contact or touch. When we use the word contact in conventional language we may think of the impingement of something external on one of the senses, for example the impingement of hardness on the bodysense. We may use words such as touching or impingement in order to describe phassa, but we should not forget that phassa is nāma, a cetasika which arises together with the citta and assists the citta so that it can experience the object which presents itself through the appropriate doorway. When hardness presents itself through the bodysense there is phassa, contact, arising together with the citta which experiences the hardness. Phassa is not the mere collision of hardness with the bodysense, it is not touch in the physical sense. Impact is the function of phassa in the sense that it assists the citta so that it can cognize the object.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states:
:What is sparsha (contact)? It is it determination, a transformation in the controlling power, which is in accordance with the three factors coming together. Its function is to provide it basis for feeling.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

Herbert Guenther explains:
: It is an awareness in which a pleasant [or unpleasant or neutral] feeling is felt when the object, sensory capacity, and cognitive process have come together and which is restricted to the appropriate object. Transformation in the controlling power means that when the visual sense meets a pleasant object [for example] and the feeling becomes the cause of adhering to this pleasure, rapport [sparsha] restricts the pleasant color-form and the feeling becomes the cause of pleasure.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

===Six classes===
The Theravada and Mahayana traditions both identify six "classes" of contact:&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html Paticca-samuppada-vibhanga Sutta: Analysis of Dependent Co-arising, SN 12.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* eye-contact
* ear-contact 
* nose-contact 
* tongue-contact 
* body-contact 
* mind-contact

For example, when the ''ear sense'' and a ''sound object'' are present, the associated ''auditory consciousness'' (Pali: [[viññāṇa]]) arises. The arising of these three elements (dhātu) – ear-sense, sound and auditory consciousness – lead to "contact" (phassa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Chachakka Sutta: The Six Sextets M148]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the twelve nidanas==
Sparśa is the sixth of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Nidānas]].  It is conditioned by the presence of the ''six sense-openings'' ([[Sadayatana|''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'']]), and in turn is a condition for the arising of physical ''sensations'' ([[Vedana|''vedanā'']]).

Dan Lusthaus explains:
:''sparśa'' (P. ''phassa'') - Literally 'touch' or 'sensory contact'. This term accrued varied usages in later Indian thought, but here it simply means that the sense organs are 'in contact with' sensory objects. The circuit of intentionality, or to borrow Merleau-Ponty's term ''intentional arc'', is operational. This term could be translated as 'sensation' as long as this is qualified as a constitutional, active process that is invariably contextualized within its psycho-cognitive dimensions. For Buddhists, sensation can neither be passive nor purely a physical or neurological matter. When the proper sensorial conditions aggregate, i.e., come into contact with each other, sensation occurs. These proper conditions include a properly functioning sense organ and a cognitive-sensory object, which already presuppose a linguistically-complex conscious body (''nāma-rūpa'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59 Buddhist Phenomenology, Dan Lusthaus, p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Hopkins explains:
:Roughly speaking, [sparsha refers to] the coming together of an object, a sense organ, and a moment of consciousness. Hence contact, in the twelve links, refers to contact with a sense-object and the subsequent discrimination of the object as attractive, unattractive, or neutral. Sense objects are always present, and thus when a sense organ—the subtle matter that allows you to see, hear, and so forth—develops,&lt;ref&gt;The sense organs develop in the fifth link of the Twelve Links.&lt;/ref&gt; an eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose consciousness, tongue consciousness, or body consciousness will be produced.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1992), p. 18 (from the Introduction by Jeffrey Hopkins)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] provides an explanation of the sixth link in the context of the development of the fetus; he states:
:The sixth of the twelve links of dependent arising. The subsidiary awareness (mental factor) of contacting awareness [sparsha] during the period of time in the development of a fetus when the distinguishing aggregate and such other affecting variables as contacting awareness are functioning, but the feeling aggregate is not yet functioning. During this period, one experiences contacting awareness of objects as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, but does not feel happy, unhappy, or neutral in response to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary_tibetan.html#xreg-pa Definitions of Sparsha (Tibetan: reg-pa), Alexander Berzin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within the five aggregates==
In terms of the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], sparśa is the ''implicit'' basis by which Form (''[[rūpa]]'') and Consciousness (''[[Vijnana|viññāna]]'') lead to the mental factors of Feeling (''[[Vedana|vedanā]]''), Perception (''[[Samjna|sañña]]'') and Formations (''[[sankhara|sankhāra]]'').

Cellular automata are a discrete-time [[dynamical system]] of interacting entities, whose state is discrete.

The state of the collection of entities is updated at each discrete time according to some simple homogeneous rule. All entities' states are updated in parallel or synchronously. Stochastic Cellular Automata are CA whose updating rule is a [[stochastic]] one, which means the new entities' states are chosen according to some probability distributions. It is a discrete-time [[random dynamical system]]. From the spatial interaction between the entities, despite the simplicity of the updating rules, [[complex system|complex behaviour]] may [[emergence|emerge]] like [[self-organization]]. As mathematical object, it may be considered in the framework of [[stochastic processes]] as an [[interacting particle system]] in discrete-time.

== PCA as Markov stochastic processes ==

As discrete-time Markov process, PCA are defined on a [[product space]] &lt;math&gt; E=\prod_{k \in G} S_k &lt;/math&gt; (cartesian product) where &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;
is a finite or infinite graph, like &lt;math&gt; \mathbb Z &lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt; S_k &lt;/math&gt; is a finite space, like for instance
&lt;math&gt;  S_k=\{-1,+1\} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;  S_k=\{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt;. The transition probability has a product form
&lt;math&gt;  P(d\sigma | \eta) = \otimes_{k \in G} p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta) &lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;  \eta \in E &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta) &lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution on &lt;math&gt;  S_k &lt;/math&gt;.
In general some locality is required &lt;math&gt;  p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta)=p_k(d\sigma_k | \eta_{V_k}) &lt;/math&gt; where 
&lt;math&gt;  \eta_{V_k}=(\eta_j)_{j\in V_k} &lt;/math&gt;  with &lt;math&gt;  {V_k}  &lt;/math&gt; a finite neighbourhood of k. See &lt;ref&gt;[https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00002203v1 P.-Y. Louis PhD]&lt;/ref&gt; for a more detailed introduction following the probability theory's point of view.

== Examples of stochastic cellular automaton ==

=== Majority cellular automaton ===

There is a version of the [[majority problem (cellular automaton)|majority cellular automaton]] with probabilistic updating rules. See the [[Toom's rule]].

=== Relation to lattice random fields ===
PCA may be used to simulate the [[Ising model]] of [[ferromagnetism]] in [[statistical mechanics]].&lt;ref name="vichniac"&gt;{{citation|title=Simulating physics with cellular automata|journal=Physica D|first=G.|last=Vichniac|volume=10|year=1984|pages=96–115|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(84)90253-7|bibcode = 1984PhyD...10...96V }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some categories of models were studied from a statistical mechanics point of view.

=== Cellular Potts model ===

==New York art world==
Pivar earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] in chemistry at [[Hofstra University]]. An inventor, he made a large fortune in plastics, founding Chem-Tainer industries in 1959. The business specialised in bulk-storage [[plastic container]]s. While remaining active in the [[plastics industry]], he became an independently wealthy investor and buyer on the art scene.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alexander, ''Death and disaster: the rise of the Warhol empire and the race for Andy's millions'', Villard Books, 1994, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Pivar soon met [[Andy Warhol]], becoming one of his closest longtime friends. With Warhol he would go on regular shopping trips to buy "masterpieces", which could be objects bought anywhere, from a high-end auction house to a fleamarket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the artist's death, Pivar recalled that "Andy Warhol loved to buy art. We used to go shopping together for it for a few hours practically every day in the past couple of years."&lt;ref&gt;Russell W. Belk, ''Collecting in a consumer society'', Psychology Press, 1995, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Pivar was a collector of 19th-century [[academic art]] at a time when it was unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;''Art &amp; antiques'', Volume 22, 1999, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; A scholar of the work of the sculptor [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], he wrote "The Barye Bronzes: A Catalogue Raisonne" in 1974, a collation of critical commentary on all the sculptor's known works.&lt;ref&gt;

Pivar wished to reintroduce traditional skills to the teaching of art, including human and animal anatomy. With Warhol, he helped to found the [[New York Academy of Art]] in 1979, becoming one of its board members. The academy opposed [[abstract art]] and promoted traditional skills. According to [[Eliot Goldfinger]], Pivar "strongly supported the acquisition of an anatomical collection of comparative skeletons, related artwork, anatomical models and charts, and the use of dissection as part of the curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Goldfinger, ''Animal anatomy for artists: the elements of form'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt; He donated over $1.2 million to the Academy during his involvement with it.&lt;ref name = "conn"/&gt;

He resigned from the Academy in 1994, complaining that he had been "lied to and outmaneuvered" by other senior figures at the institution. A report placed most of the blame on his "disruptive, angry and abusive" behavior for problems at the institution.&lt;ref name = "conn"&gt;

Beginning with his book ''Lifecode'' in 2004 Pivar has published novel claims about the evolution of species. He asserts that the body form of [[species]] are encoded not in [[DNA]] but in the patterned structure of a primordial [[germ plasm]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Origin of Form: Evolution by Self-Organization, Stuart Pivar, North Atlantic Books, 2009 {{ISBN|1-55643-886-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macmenamin&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:CU2gyUDK2twJ:www.ilasol.org.il/ILASOL/uploads/files/ILASOLintroductionV6.pdf+stuart+pivar+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgA0o56t0DdMsclymOItS6OIWzPV56kTS3wQLD-PR3oVeFoSq65ffq6ao3hpRCK2uIO_Xa2GIXgXb5FRAQtfEmXVnsEKZbjvoN4FK6Toiybb6Y2855TZQhmxR0tCF84NG0A9cFc&amp;sig=AHIEtbRqUvyz5yqYuyyf9A9wINXZDT3ynQ ILAOL introduction by Mark Macmenamin]&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics have stated that Pivar's proposed developmental sequences bear no resemblance to anything actually observed during embryological development.&lt;ref name=Macmenamin /&gt; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] says that Pivar's ideas constitute [[pseudoscience]].

'''Subjectivity''' is a central [[philosophical]] concept, related to [[consciousness]], [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[personhood]], [[reality]], and [[truth]], which has been variously defined by sources. Three common definitions include that subjectivity is the quality or condition of:
* Something being a ''[[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]'', narrowly meaning an individual who possesses conscious experiences, such as perspectives, feelings, beliefs, and desires.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon|Solomon, Robert C.]] "Subjectivity," in Honderich, Ted. ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] (Oxford University Press, 2005), p.900.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Something being a ''subject'', broadly meaning an entity that has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], meaning that it acts upon or wields power over some other entity (an ''[[Object (philosophy)|object]]'').&lt;ref name=Allen2002&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550210121432 |title=Power, Subjectivity, and Agency: Between Arendt and Foucault |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=131–49 |year=2002 |last1=Allen |first1=Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some information, idea, situation, or physical thing considered true only from the perspective of a [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] or subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.07.018 |title=Proximity, subjectivity, and space: Rethinking distance in human geography |journal=Geoforum |volume=75 |pages=249–52 |year=2016 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These various definitions of subjectivity are sometimes joined together in philosophy. The term is most commonly used as an explanation for that which influences, informs, and biases people's judgments about truth or reality; it is the collection of the perceptions, experiences, expectations, personal or cultural understanding, and beliefs specific to a person. 

Subjectivity is contrasted to the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], which is described as a view of truth or reality that is free of any individual's biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings.&lt;ref name="solomon" /&gt; 

==Philosophy==
The rise of the notion of subjectivity has its philosophical roots in the thinking of [[Descartes]] and [[Kant]], and its articulation throughout the modern era has depended on the understanding of what constitutes an individual. There have been various interpretations of such concepts as the self and the soul, and the identity or [[self-consciousness]] which lies at the root of the notion of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strazzoni |first1=Andrea |year=2015 |title=Subjectivity and individuality: Two strands in early modern philosophy: Introduction |journal=Societate si Politica |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5–9 |hdl=1765/92270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjectivity is, for instance, frequently the implicit topic of [[existentialism]], Sartre as one of its main proponents emphasizing subjectivity in his phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.ophen.org/2016/11/02/jean-paul-sartre-subjectivity-2/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre: What is Subjectivity?
 |last=Thalos |first=Mariam |date=2016 |website=http://reviews.ophen.org/ |publisher=(Article review of Sartre's 'What is Subjectivity' published byVerso Books) |access-date=11/10/18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike his colleague [[Merleau-Ponty]], Sartre believed that, even within the material force of human society, the ego was an essentially transcendent being- posited, for instance, in his opus ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' through his arguments about the 'being-for-others' and the 'for-itself' (i.e., an objective and subjective human being).

==Sociology==
Subjectivity is an inherently social mode that comes about through innumerable interactions within society. As much as subjectivity is a process of [[individuation]], it is equally a process of socialization, the individual never being isolated in a self-contained environment, but endlessly engaging in interaction with the surrounding world.
Culture is a living totality of the subjectivity of any given society constantly undergoing transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, H.J. ed., 2014. Questioning foundations: truth, subjectivity and culture. Routledge.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectivity is both shaped by it and shapes it in turn, but also by other things like the economy, political institutions, communities, as well as the natural world.

Though the boundaries of societies and their cultures are indefinable and arbitrary, the subjectivity inherent in each one is palatable and can be recognized as distinct from others. Subjectivity is in part a particular experience or organization of [[reality]], which includes how one views and interacts with humanity, objects, consciousness, and nature, so the difference between different cultures brings about an alternate experience of existence that forms life in a different manner. A common effect on an individual of this disjunction between subjectivities is [[culture shock]], where the subjectivity of the other culture is considered alien and possibly incomprehensible or even hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.693876 |title=Learning Wisdom Through Geographical Dislocations |journal=The Professional Geographer |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=390–5 |year=2013 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political subjectivity]] is an emerging concept in social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref name=Allen2002/&gt; Political subjectivity is a reference to the deep embeddedness of subjectivity in the socially intertwined systems of power and meaning.  "Politicality," writes [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi] in ''[http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/ Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject ''is''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rahimi|first1=Sadeq|title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity: A Study of Schizophrenia and Culture in Turkey|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford &amp; New York|isbn=1138840823|page=8|url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/|ref=Rahimi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synchronization''' is the coordination of events to operate a [[system]] in unison. The [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or ''in time''. Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be '''synchronous''' or ''in sync''—and those that are not are ''[[Asynchronous system|asynchronous]]''.

Today, '''time synchronization''' can occur between systems around the world through [[satellite navigation]] signals.

== Transport ==
Time-keeping and synchronization of clocks has been a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation.  Before [[radio navigation]] and [[Radionavigation-satellite service|satellite-based navigation]], navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. The invention of an accurate [[marine chronometer]] revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, important ports provided  [[time signal]]s in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping [[time ball]] so that mariners could check their chronometers for error.

Synchronization was important in the operation of 19th century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for differences in local time between adjacent towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard [[Time zone#Railroad time|railroad time]]. In some territories, sharing of single railroad tracks was controlled by the timetable.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local [[mean solar time]] in favor of that standard.

== Communication ==
{{further information|Synchronization in telecommunications}}
In [[electrical engineering]] terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a [[synchronous circuit]] requires a [[clock signal]].  However, the use of the word "clock" in this sense is different from the typical sense of a clock as a device that keeps track of time-of-day; the clock signal simply signals the start and/or end of some time period, often very minute (measured in microseconds or nanoseconds), that has an arbitrary relationship to sidereal, solar, or lunar time, or to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.

In a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective.  (Albert Einstein proved in 1905 in his first relativity paper that there actually are no such things as absolutely simultaneous events.) Timekeeping technologies such as the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the [[UTC]] timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.

Synchronization is an important concept in the following fields:
* [[Synchronization (computer science)|Computer science]] (In computer science, especially [[parallel computing]], synchronization refers to the coordination of simultaneous [[thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected [[race condition]]s.)
* [[Cryptography]]
* [[Multimedia]]
* Music (rhythm)
* [[Neural synchronization|Neuroscience]]
* Photography
* [[Physics]] (The idea of [[simultaneity]] has many difficulties, both in practice and theory.)
* [[Oscillator sync|Synthesizers]]
* Telecommunication

== Dynamical systems ==
Synchronization of multiple interacting [[dynamical system]]s can occur when the systems are [[Self-oscillation|autonomous oscillators]].  For instance, integrate-and-fire oscillators with either two-way (symmetric) or one-way coupling can synchronize when the strength of the coupling (in frequency units) is greater than the differences among the free-running natural oscillator frequencies.  Poincare phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks.&lt;ref name="Nolte"&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Nolte | title = Introduction to Modern Dynamics: Chaos, Networks, Space and Time  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |  year = 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold.  This is known as the [[Kuramoto model]] phase transition.  Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves.

== Human movement ==
{{primary sources|section|date=February 2017}}
Synchronization of movement is defined as similar movements between two or more people who are temporally aligned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Condon|first=W. S.|last2=Ogston|first2=W.

In groups, synchronization of movement has been shown to increase conformity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Ping|last2=Dai|first2=Xianchi|last3=Wyer|first3=Robert S.|date=1 January 2015|title=Actors conform, observers react: the effects of behavioral synchrony on conformity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=108|issue=1|pages=60–75|doi=10.1037/pspi0000001|issn=1939-1315|pmid=25437130}}&lt;/ref&gt; cooperation and trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Synchrony+and+Cooperation|title=Synchrony and Cooperation – PubMed – Search Results|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; however more research on group synchronization is needed to determine its effects on the group as a whole and on individuals within a group. In [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]], groups of two people, synchronization has been demonstrated to increase affiliation,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1521/soco.2009.27.6.949 |title=It's All in the Timing: Interpersonal Synchrony Increases Affiliation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=949 |year=2009 |last1=Hove |first1=Michael J. |last2=Risen |first2=Jane L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-esteem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lumsden|first=Joanne|last2=Miles|first2=Lynden K.|last3=Macrae|first3=C.

There has been dispute regarding the true effect of synchrony in these studies. Research in this area detailing the positive effects of synchrony, have attributed this to synchrony alone; however, many of the experiments incorporate a shared intention to achieve synchrony. Indeed, the Reinforcement of Cooperation Model suggests that perception of synchrony leads to reinforcement that cooperation is occurring, which leads to the pro-social effects of synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddish|first=Paul|last2=Fischer|first2=Ronald|last3=Bulbulia|first3=Joseph|date=1 January 2013|title=Let's dance together: synchrony, shared intentionality and cooperation|journal=PLoS One|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e71182|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071182|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3737148|pmid=23951106}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is required to separate the effect of intentionality from the beneficial effect of synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellamil|first=Melissa|last2=Berson|first2=Josh|last3=Margulies|first3=Daniel S.|date=1 January 2016|title=Influences on and Measures of Unintentional Group Synchrony|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=7|pages=1744|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01744|pmc=5101201|pmid=27881968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
* Film synchronization of image and sound in [[sound film]].
* Synchronization is important in fields such as [[digital telephony]], video and [[digital audio]] where streams of sampled data are manipulated.
* In [[electric power]] systems, [[alternator synchronization]] is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.
* [[Arbiter (electronics)|Arbiters]] are needed in digital electronic systems such as [[microprocessor]]s to deal with asynchronous inputs.  There are also electronic digital circuits called ''synchronizers'' that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle.  Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure.  (See [[metastability in electronics]]).
* [[Encryption]] systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.
* Automotive [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] contain [[synchromesh|synchronizers]] that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.
* Film, video, and [[sound|audio]] applications use [[time code]] to synchronize audio and video.
* [[Flash (photo)|Flash]] photography, see [[Flash synchronization]]

Some systems may be only approximately synchronized, or [[plesiochronous]]. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the [[Partially ordered set|order]] of the event is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12632">[[Trace fossil]]s are [[Biological classification|classified]] in various ways for different purposes. Traces can be classified [[#Taxonomic classification|taxonomically]] (by morphology), [[#Ethologic classification|ethologically]] (by behavior), and [[#Toponomic classification|toponomically]], that is, according to their relationship to the surrounding sedimentary layers. Except in the rare cases where the original maker of a trace fossil can be identified with confidence, phylogenetic classification of trace fossils is an unreasonable proposition.

==Taxonomic classification== &lt;!--intro links here--&gt;
The '''taxonomic classification of trace fossils''' parallels the taxonomic classification of [[organism]]s under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. In [[trace fossil]] nomenclature a [[Latin]] [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] is used, just as in [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with a [[genus]] and [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]]. However, the binomial names are not linked to an organism, but rather just a trace fossil. This is due to the rarity of association between a trace fossil and a specific organism or group of organisms. Trace fossils are therefore included in an ''[[ichnotaxon]]'' separate from [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. When referring to trace fossils, the terms ''ichnogenus'' and ''ichnospecies'' parallel genus and [[species]] respectively.

The most promising cases of phylogenetic classification are those in which similar trace fossils show details complex enough to deduce the makers, such as [[bryozoan]] [[bioerosion|borings]], large [[trilobite]] trace fossils such as ''[[Cruziana]]'', and [[vertebrate]] [[footprints]]. However, most trace fossils lack sufficiently complex details to allow such classification.

==Ethologic classification==

===The Seilacherian System===
[[File:BoredEncrustedShell.JPG|thumb|Sponge borings (''[[Entobia]]'') and encrusters on a modern bivalve shell, North Carolina; an example of ''Domichnia''.]]
[[Adolf Seilacher]] was the first to propose a broadly accepted [[ethology|ethological]] basis for trace fossil classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1953 |title=Studien zur Paläontologie: 1. Über die Methoden der Palichnologie |journal=Neues Jahrbuch für Geologie und Paläontologie |series=Abhandlungen |volume=96 |pages=421–452 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1964 |title=Sedimentological classification and nomenclature of trace fossils |journal=Sedimentology |volume=3 |issue= |pages=253–256 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1964.tb00464.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized that most trace fossils are created by [[animal]]s in one of five main behavioural activities, and named them accordingly:

* ''Cubichnia'' are the traces of organisms left on the surface of a soft [[sediment]]. This behaviour may simply be resting as in the case of a [[starfish]], but might also evidence the hiding place of [[prey]], or even the ambush position of a [[predator]].
* ''Domichnia'' are dwelling structures that reflect the life positions of organisms, for example the subsurface [[burrow]]s or [[bioerosion|borings]] of [[suspension feeder]]s, and are perhaps the most common of the established ethological classes.
* ''[[Fodinichnia]]'' are feeding traces which are formed as a result of organisms disturbing the sediment in their search for food. They are normally created by [[deposit feeder]]s as they tunnel through soft sediments, usually producing a 3D structure.
* ''Pascichnia'' are a different type of feeding trace for which the trophic guild responsible are [[grazing|grazer]]s. They create 2D features as they scour the surface of a hard or soft [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] in order to obtain [[nutriment]].
* ''Repichnia'' are locomotory tracks that show evidence of organisms moving from one station to another, usually in a near-straight to slightly curved line. Most of the very few traces to be verifiably assigned to a specific organism are in this category, such as various [[arthropod]] and [[vertebrate]] trackways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seilacher |first=A. |year=1967 |title=Bathymetry of trace fossils |journal=Marine Geology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=413–428 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(67)90051-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ethological classes===

Since the inception of behavioural categorization, several other ethological classes have been suggested and accepted, as follows:

* ''Aedificichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bown |first=T. M. |last2=Ratcliffe |first2=B. C. |year=1988 |title=The origin of ''Chubutolithes'' Ihering, ichnofossils from the Eocene and Oligocene of Chubut province, Argentina |journal=Journal of Paleontology |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=163–167 |doi=10.1017/S0022336000029802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; evidence of organisms building structures outside of the [[infauna]]l realm, such as [[termite]] mounds or [[wasp]] nests.
* ''Agrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA; Bromley, RG; Pemberton, SG (1984) Ichnology: Trace fossils in sedimentology and stratigraphy. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists Short Course, no 15, 317 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; so called "gardening traces", which are systematic burrow networks designed to capture migrating [[meiofauna]] or perhaps even to culture [[bacteria]]. The organism would have continually inspected this burrow system to prey on any smaller organisms that strayed into it.
* ''Calichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Genise, JF &amp; Bown, TM (1991) New Miocene scarabaeid and hymenopterous nests and Early Miocene (Santacrucian) palaeoenvironments, Patagonian Argentina. Ichnos, 3: 107–117.&lt;/ref&gt; structures that were created by organisms specifically for [[Reproduction|breeding]] purposes, e.g. [[bee]] cells.
* ''Equilibrichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, RG (1990) Trace fossils: biology and taphonomy. Unwin Hyman Ltd, London, 280 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; burrows within the sediment that show evidence for organisms' responses to variations in sedimentation rate (i.e. the burrow moves upwards to avoid burial, or downwards to avoid exposure). Typically this evidence will be in the form of [[spreiten]], which are small laminations in the sediment that reflect previous positions the organisms were in.
* ''[[Fugichnia]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1975) The morphological classification of trace fossils. In Frey, RW (ed.) The study of trace fossils. New York, Springer-Verlag, pp 39-54.&lt;/ref&gt; "escape traces" that are formed as a result of organisms' attempts to escape burial in sudden high-sedimentation events like [[turbidity current]]s. The burrows are often marked with chevron patterns showing the upward direction the organisms were tunnelling.
* ''Praedichnia'':&lt;ref&gt;Ekdale, AA (1985) Palaeoecology of the marine endobenthos. Palaeogeography, Palaeoecology, Palaeoclimatology 50: 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt; trace fossils that show evidence of [[predator]]y behaviour, such as the drill holes ([[bioerosion|borings]]) left in [[Animal shell|shell]]s by [[carnivorous]] [[gastropod]]s, or more dramatically, the bite marks found on some [[vertebrate]] [[bone]]s.

Over the years several other behavioural groups have been proposed, but in general they have been quickly discarded by the ichnological community. Some of the failed proposals are listed below, with a brief description.

* ''Chemichnia'': a type of agrichnia applied specifically to those instances of [[bacteria]]l harvesting.
* ''Cecidoichnia'': a plant trace in which a gall is left on the plant as a result of interaction with animals, bacteria, or other plants.
* ''Corrosichnia'': traces that are left by plant [[root]]s as a result of their [[corrosive]] action on the sediments.
* ''Cursichnia'': a subgroup of the repichnia, created by a crawling or walking habit.
* ''Fixichnia'': traces left by [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms that anchored themselves to a hard substrate.
* ''Mordichnia'': a praedichnial subgroup that shows evidence of the prey's death as a result of the attack.
* ''Natichnia'': a type of repichnia caused by disturbances to a soft sediment by a swimming organism, e.g. a [[benthic]] [[fish]].
* ''Polychresichnia'': traces that show an origin in the combination of two or more established trace-producing behaviours, e.g. domichnia that served as the feeding position of the organisms.
* ''Sphenoichnia'': a plant trace created by the [[bioturbation]]al action of roots.
* ''Taphichnia'': fugichnia in which the organism failed to escape and was buried, often resulting in its body fossil being found in association with the trace.
* ''Volichnia'': traces that show the position a flying organism (usually an insect) landed on a soft sediment.

Fixichnia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibert |first=J. M. de |last2=Domènech |first2=R. |last3=Martinell |first3=J. |year=2004 |title=An ethological framework for animal bioerosion trace fossils upon mineral substrates with proposal of new class, fixichnia |journal=Lethaia |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=429–437 |doi=10.1080/00241160410002144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is perhaps the group with the most weight as a candidate for the next accepted ethological class, being not fully described by any of the eleven currently accepted categories. There is also potential for the three plant traces (cecidoichnia, corrosichnia and sphenoichnia) to gain recognition in coming years, with little attention having been paid to them since their proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mikuláš |first=R. |year=1999 |title=Notes on the concept of plant trace fossils related to plant-generated sedimentary structures |journal=Věštník Českého geologického ústavu |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=39–42 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponomic classification==

Another way to classify trace fossils is to look at their relation to the [[sediment]] of origin. Martinsson&lt;ref&gt;Martinsson, A (1970) Toponomy of trace fossils. In Crimes, TP &amp; Harper, JC (eds.) (1970) Trace fossils. Geological Journal, Special Issue 3: 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided the most widely accepted of such systems, identifying four distinct classes for traces to be separated in this regard:

* ''Endichnia'' are those traces that are found wholly within the casting medium, and therefore can only have been made by an infaunal organism.
* ''Epichnia'' are found on the tops of the strata of origin, being those ridges and grooves that were formed by benthic organisms or infaunal burrows that have been exposed by [[erosion]].
* ''Exichnia'' are traces that are made of material that is different from the surrounding medium, having either been actively filled by an organism or eroded out and re-covered by an alien sediment.
* ''Hypichnia'' are ridges and grooves found on the soles of the beds of origin at their interfaces with other [[stratum|strata]], representing the opposite of epichnia.

Other classifications have been proposed,&lt;ref name="Seilacher, A 1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, CK (1971) Morphology and ethology of trace fossils from the Ouachita Mountains, southeast Oklahoma. Journal of Paleontology, 45: 212-246.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, S (1957) On the trace fossil ''Chondrites''. Quarterly Journal, Geological Society of London 112: 475-99.&lt;/ref&gt; but none stray far from the above.

==History==

Early paleontologists originally classified many burrow fossils as the remains of marine [[algae]], as is apparent in ichnogenera named with the ''-phycus'' suffix. [[Alfred Gabriel Nathorst]] and Joseph F. James both controversially challenged this incorrect classification, suggesting the reinterpretation of many "algae" as marine invertebrate trace fossils.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter | editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts to classify trace fossils have been made throughout the history of paleontology. In 1844, [[Edward Hitchcock]] proposed two [[order (biology)|orders]]: ''Apodichnites'', including footless trails, and ''Polypodichnites'', including trails of organisms with more than four feet.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

{{Rights}}
'''Unenumerated rights''' are legal rights inferred from other legal rights that are officiated in a retrievable form codified by law institutions, such as in written constitutions, but are not themselves expressly coded or "enumerated" among the explicit writ of the law. Alternative terminology sometimes used are: '''implied rights''', '''natural rights''', '''background rights''', and '''fundamental rights'''.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm "Committee on the Judiciary Tushnet Statement re Hearing on 'the Origin and Scope of Roe v. Wade'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808233931/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm# |date=2007-08-08 }}. [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], [[United States House of Representatives]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]. April 22, 1996. {{deadlink|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unenumerated rights will be actual rights insofar as they necessitate the systematization of positively enumerated rights anywhere laws would become logically incoherent, or could not be adhered to or maintained in the exclusion of those unenumerated items as rights. Examples of this include federal systems where constituent member constitutions have to be interpreted in relation to their membership in the federal whole, adjudicative of whether authority is rightfully [[Devolution|devolved]] or more rightly federative.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

This term alternatively, is used loosely to mean any perceived rights, often considered peremptory or intuitively fiat (such as rights innate to each individual or inherent to mankind), that are without expression or instance of articulation.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

==In Australia==
{{main|Implied rights in Australian constitutional law}}
Implied rights are the political and civil freedoms that necessarily underlie the actual words of the constitution but are not themselves expressly stated directly in the constitution. Since the 1990s the High Court has discovered rights which are said to be implied by the very structure and textual form of the Constitution. Chief amongst these is an implied right to freedom of communication on political matters, which was first recognised in ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills]]''. In addition, some protections of civil liberties have been the result of the High Court's zealous attempts to safeguard the independence of, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary.  A good example of this can be seen in ''[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]'', in which the High Court struck down a criminal law passed by the New South Wales Parliament that was directed at a single named individual in a similar manner to a [[Bill of attainder]]. The High Court also inferred a limited right to vote from the text of the Constitution in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'',  invalidating legislation that prevented all prisoners from voting.

==In Ireland==

Article 40.3 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] refers to and accounts for the recognition of unenumerated rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theundisciplined.com/2014/05/13/something-from-nothing-the-irish-unenumerated-rights-doctrine/ TheUndisciplined.com – ''Something from Nothing: The Irish Unenumerated Rights Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] is often the main source of such rights, such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to marry and the right to earn a living, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/SupremeCourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/D5F78352A387D74480257315005A419E?opendocument&amp;l=en Supreme Court of Ireland – '''The Legal System''' (''Fundamental Rights'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Republic of China==
Article 22 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] guarantees unenumerated freedoms and rights of the people that are not detrimental to social order or public welfare, now in effect in [[Taiwan]].

==In the United States==
In the United States, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] protects against federal infringement of unenumerated rights. The text reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has also interpreted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] to protect against state infringement of certain unenumerated rights including, among others, the [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters|right to send one's children to private school]] and the [[Griswold v. Connecticut|right to marital privacy]].

The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to keep personal matters private and to make important decisions about one’s health care or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/ninth-amendment-non-enumerated-rights-retained-by-people|title=Ninth Amendment: Non-Enumerated Rights Retained by People - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CVRD7windrow.turner.jpg|thumb|right|Windrow turner used on maturing piles at a biosolids composting facility in Canada.]]
[[Image:CVRD6windrow.matureing.jpg|thumb|right|Maturing windrows at an [[in-vessel composting]] facility.]]
In [[agriculture]], '''windrow composting''' is the production of [[compost]] by piling [[organic matter]] or [[biodegradable waste]], such as animal manure and crop residues, in long rows (''[[windrow]]s''). This method is suited to producing large volumes of compost. These rows are generally turned to improve porosity and oxygen content, mix in or remove moisture, and redistribute cooler and hotter portions of the pile. Windrow composting is a commonly used farm scale [[composting]] method. Composting process control parameters include the initial ratios of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich materials, the amount of bulking agent added to assure air porosity, the pile size, moisture content, and turning frequency.

The temperature of the windrows must be measured and logged constantly to determine the optimum time to turn them for quicker compost production.

==Compost windrow turners==

Compost windrow turners were developed to produce [[compost]] on a large scale by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4&amp;nbsp;feet (1.25&amp;nbsp;meters) or more high, by as much as 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air ([[oxygen]]) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial [[decomposition]] are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.

;Utilization
To properly use a compost windrow turner, it is ideal to compost on a hard surfaced pad. Heavy-duty compost windrow turners allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using [[four wheel drive]] or [[Caterpillar track|tracks]] the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a [[self-trailering]] option this allows the compost windrow turner to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck [[tractor]]. These two options combined allow the compost windrow turner to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.

==Specific applications==
Molasses-based distilleries all over the world generate large amount of effluent termed as spent wash or [[vinasse]]. For each liter of alcohol produced, around 8&amp;nbsp;liters of effluent is generated. This effluent has [[Chemical_oxygen_demand|COD]] of 1,50,000 PPM and [[Biochemical_oxygen_demand|BOD]] of 60,000 PPM and even more. This effluent needs to be treated and the only effective method for conclusive disposal is by composting.

Sugar factories generate pressmud / cachaza during the process and the same has about 30% fibers as carbon and has large amounts of water. This pressmud is dumped on prepared land in the form of 100&amp;nbsp;meters long windrows of 3&amp;nbsp;meters x 1.5&amp;nbsp;meters and spent wash is sprayed on the windrow while the windrow is being turned. These machines help consume spent wash of about 2.5 times of the volume of the pressmud, which means that a 100&amp;nbsp;meters of windrow accommodates about 166 MT of pressmud and uses about 415&amp;nbsp;m³ of Spent wash in 50&amp;nbsp;days.

Microbial Culture (organic solution) TRIO COM-CULT is used about 1&amp;nbsp;kg per MT of pressmud for fast de-composing of the spent wash. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of spent wash is being composted all over the world in countries like India, Colombia, Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa etc.

The compost yard has to be prepared in such a way that the land is impervious and does not allow the liquid effluent to pass down into the earth. The compost thus generated is of excellent quality and is rich in nutrients.

The '''working class''' (or '''labouring class''') comprises the people employed for [[wage]]s, especially in [[manual labour|manual-labour]] occupations and industrial work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=working class |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/working-class |work=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class occupations (see also "[[Designation of workers by collar color]]") include [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs, some [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs, and most [[Pink-collar worker|pink-collar]] jobs. The working class only rely upon their earnings from [[wage labour]], thereby, the category includes most of the working population of [[developed country|industrialized economies]], of the [[urban area]]s (cities, towns, villages) of [[developing country|non-industrialized economies]], and of the rural workforce.

In [[Marxist theory]] and [[socialism|socialist]] literature, the term ''working class'' is often used interchangeably with the term ''[[proletariat]]'' and includes all workers who expend both physical and mental labour (salaried [[knowledge worker]]s and [[white-collar worker]]s) to produce [[Value (economics)|economic value]] for the owners of the [[means of production]] (the [[bourgeoisie]] in [[Marxism|Marxist]] literature).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Glaberman |first=Martin |author-link=Martin Glaberman |year=1975 |title=Marxist Views of the Working Class |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/glaberman/1974/09/wclass.htm |work=The Working Class and Social Change |access-date=18 January 2013 |via=Marxists Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

As with many terms describing [[social class]], ''working class'' is defined and used in many different ways.  The most general definition, used by [[Marxism|Marxists]] and many [[socialism|socialists]], is that the working class includes all those who have nothing to sell but their labour power and skills.  In that sense it includes both white and blue-collar workers, manual and mental workers of all types, excluding only individuals who derive their income from business ownership and the labour of others.{{sfn|McKibbin|2000|p=164}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}

When used non-academically in the United States, however, it often refers to a section of society dependent on physical [[labour economics|labour]], especially when compensated with an hourly [[wage]]. For certain types of science, as well as less scientific or journalistic political analysis, for example, the working class is loosely defined as those without college degrees.&lt;ref name="NYTCanary"&gt;{{cite news |last=Edsall |first=Thomas B. |author-link=Thomas B. Edsall |date=17 June 2012 |title=Canaries in the Coal Mine |url=http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/canaries-in-the-coal-mine/ |url-access=limited |department=Campaign Stops |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=June 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class occupations are then categorized into four groups: unskilled labourers, artisans, [[outworker]]s, and factory workers.{{sfn|Doob|2013}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

A common alternative, {{citation needed span |date=November 2018 |text=sometimes used in [[sociology]],}} is to define class by income levels.{{sfn|Linkon|1999|p=4}} When this approach is used, the working class can be contrasted with a so-called ''[[middle class]] ''on the basis of differential terms of access to economic resources, [[education]], cultural interests, and other goods and services. The cut-off between working class and middle class here might mean the line where a population has discretionary income, rather than simply  sustenance (for example, on [[fashion]] versus merely [[nutrition]] and shelter).

Some researchers have suggested that working-class status should be defined subjectively as self-identification with the working-class group.{{sfn|Rubin|Denson|Kilpatrick|Matthews|2014}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} This subjective approach allows people, rather than researchers, to define their own social class.

==History and growth==
[[File:Victorian Bishopgate.jpg|thumb|Working-class life in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Wetherby]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England]]

In [[feudalism|feudal]] Europe, the working class as such did not exist in large numbers. Instead, most people were part of the labouring class, a group made up of different professions, trades and occupations. A lawyer, craftsman and peasant were all considered to be part of the same [[social unit]], a [[Estates of the realm|third estate]] of people who were neither [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] nor church officials. Similar hierarchies existed outside Europe in other [[pre-industrial societies]]. The social position of these labouring classes was viewed as ordained by [[natural law]] and common religious belief. This social position was contested, particularly by peasants, for example during the [[German Peasants' War]].{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

In the late 18th century, under the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], European society was in a state of change, and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless god-created social order. Wealthy members of these societies created ideologies which blamed many of the problems of working-class people on their morals and ethics (i.e. excessive consumption of alcohol, perceived laziness and inability to save money). In ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', [[E.&amp;nbsp;P. Thompson]] argues that the English working class was present at its own creation, and seeks to describe the transformation of pre-modern labouring classes into a modern, politically self-conscious, working class.{{sfn|Abendroth|1973}}{{verification needed|date=November 2018}}

Starting around 1917, a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class (see [[Soviet working class]]). Some historians have noted that a key change in these Soviet-style societies has been a massive a new type of [[proletarianization]], often effected by the administratively achieved forced displacement of peasants and rural workers. Since then, four major industrial states have turned towards semi-market-based governance ([[China]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cuba]]), and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalization ([[North Korea]]). Other states of this sort have either collapsed (such as the [[Soviet Union]]), or never achieved significant levels of industrialization or large working classes.{{sfn|Kuromiya|1990|p=87}}

Since 1960, large-scale proletarianization and [[enclosure]] of commons has occurred in the [[third world]], generating new working classes. Additionally, countries such as [[India]] have been slowly undergoing social change, expanding the size of the urban working class.{{sfn|Gutkind|1988}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

==Marxist definition: the proletariat==
{{main|Proletariat}}
[[File:battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|Striking teamsters battling police on the streets of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], June 1934]]
[[Karl Marx]] defined the working class or [[proletariat]] as individuals who sell their [[labour power]] for [[wage]]s and who do not own the [[means of production]]. He argued that they were responsible for creating the [[wealth]] of a society.  He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}

A sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:
*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].
*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.
*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.
*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.
*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, et al.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.

Possible responses to some of these issues are:
*Unemployed workers are proletariat.
*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.
*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.
*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).

In general, in Marxist terms, [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. For example, retired factory workers are working-class in the popular sense; but to the extent that they live off [[fixed income]]s, financed by stock in [[corporations]] whose earnings are [[Profit (economics)|profit]], retired factory workers' interests, and possibly their identities and politics, are not working class. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.
