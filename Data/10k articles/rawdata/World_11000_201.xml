Sabar had been apprehended and sent to Guantanamo in 2002, based on allegations he helped facilitate [[Osama bin Laden]]'s escape from Afghanistan.
He was repatriated in 2007.  But American special forces kept taking him captive.
According to Deen Muhammed the Peace Council had secured assurance that Americans
would stop harassing Sabar.  Nevertheless, Sabar was killed by US special forces, in his home, during a [[night raid (Afghanistan)|night raid]], just two days after the Peace Council received assurances that harassment of him would stop.

This is a short history of '''[[anarchism]] in [[Monaco]]''', primarily in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Monaco, a principality formerly under the absolute rule of the [[House of Grimaldi]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] since 1911, is located on the [[French Riviera]] in [[Western Europe]]. The [[city-state]] and [[microstate]] is bordered exclusively by [[France]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==History==
Amid a period of militant upheaval, in March 1894 Prime Minister [[Francesco Crispi]] of [[Italy]] responded to a request from the government of Monaco to help the Principality monitor political radicals. Crispi, a former insurrectionist himself, sent a confidential informant to watch over the community of [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] residing in the country. All expenses were paid for by Monaco. The same year, the Prime Minister had deployed the army and declared a state of siege in [[Sicily]] to put down the partially anarchist-led [[Fasci Siciliani]], crushing an anarchist [[Lunigiana revolt|solidarity revolt in Lunigiana]] along the way. Only months later in June anarchists unsuccessfully attempted to shoot Crispi himself, successfully assassinating President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bach Jensen|first=Richard|date=2013|title=The Battle against Anarchist Terrorism: An International History, 1878–1934|url= |location=[[Cambridge]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=86|isbn=110-703-405-1}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominent  [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] moved from the [[United States]] first to France and then to Monaco, after a 1908 fire in his [[New York City]] bookstore saw him lose both uninsured printing equipment and his 30-year stock of books and pamphlets. At the time of the fire his partner Pearl Johnson – 25 years his junior – was pregnant with their daughter, Oriole Tucker. Tucker moved to Monaco, where his daughter grew up, to better make use of the income from his invested inheritance. He spent much of the rest of his life in the city-state, mostly in almost complete political retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shone|first=Steven J.|date=2013|title=American Anarchism|url= |location=[[Leiden]]|publisher=Brill Publishers|page=36|isbn=900-425-195-2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tucker died in Monaco in 1939, in the company of his family. His daughter, Oriole, reported, "Father's attitude towards communism never changed one whit, nor about religion... In his last months he called in the French housekeeper. 'I want her,' he said, 'to be a witness that on my death bed I'm not recanting. I do not believe in God!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=1996|title=[[Anarchist Voices]]|url= |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=11|isbn=0-691-04494-5}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léo Ferré]] (1916-1993) was born and, partially, schooled in Monaco. A Monegasque poet, composer and a dynamic and controversial live performer, he became a very prominent [[Protest song|protest singer]] in France, releasing some forty albums and many successful singels throughout his career. An staunch anarchist, Ferré's often heavily political songs mixed revolt with love and melancholy. While he spent much of his life away from his birthplace, he returned to live in Monaco several times, before finally being buried there in 1993.

The '''Austrian Mathematical Society''' ({{lang-de|Österreichische Mathematische Gesellschaft}}) is the national mathematical society of [[Austria]] and a member society of the [[European Mathematical Society]].

==History==
The society was founded in 1903 by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Gustav von Escherich]] and [[Emil Müller (mathematician)|Emil Müller]] as ''Mathematical Society in Vienna'' ({{lang-de|Mathematische Gesellschaft in Wien}}).

After the [[Second World War]] it resumed operation in May 1946 and was formally reestablished at the 10th of August 1946 by [[Rudolf Inzinger]]. In autumn 1948 the name was changed to ''Austrian Mathematical Society''.

==Publications==

It publishes the "International Mathematical News" ({{lang-de|Internationale Mathematische Nachrichten}}) with three issues per year (not to be confused with ''[[Mathematische Nachrichten]]'', an unrelated mathematics journal).

The term '''Better Ghana Agenda''', is a policy vision, that was used by the former ruling party of Ghana, the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] of [[Ghana]]. The term "Better Ghana Agenda" was coined in the year 2007, prior to the 2008 elections, by [[John Atta Mills]], the late [[President of Ghana]] because in his view the NPP government had failed to live up to its expectations. They expressed much concern about several shortcomings in the areas of the economy, employment, the environment, health, education, the utilities and many more. Since its inception, there have been huge gains made in all sectors of the Ghanaian economy, notably the attainment of single digit inflation, a fast economic growth rate, solid environmental sustainability portfolios, elimination of schools under trees and expansion of universal healthcare coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Ghana Agenda|url=http://www.presidency.gov.gh/agenda|publisher=Presidency.gov.gh|accessdate=3 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401021932/http://www.presidency.gov.gh/agenda|archivedate=1 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bácskai Hírlap''''' (lit. ''Bachkan Newspapers'') was a [[Hungarian language]] daily [[newspaper]]. The first issue of Bácskai Hírlap was published on 3 October 1897 with the purpose of serving as the information source for the Magyars and Hungarian language-speaking population in [[Bács-Bodrog County]] within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] and later in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. It was published in [[Subotica]] (Today in [[Serbia]]). Bácskai Hírlap was originally social, economic, political and literary newspaper. Later it shifted to political newspaper on 6 April 1902 until 1909. After that it became the organ of [[Bács-Bodrog County]] branch of [[Függetlenségi és 48-as Párt|Independence Party]]. Bácskai Hírlap was banned in 1919. It reappeared as Magyar Újság and in 1921 under the old name. Its editors-in-chief were from 1901 Károly Csillag, Henrik Braun, Emil Havas, Henrik Braun from 1909, and Emil Havas again in 1917. Bácskai Hírlap was disestablished in 1921.

==Historical outlook==
Capital punishment in Ukraine existed soon after fall of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917. Among of known people who was executed by the Ukrainian authorities was [[Ivan Samosenko]]. In 1920 Ukraine was split primarily between the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Russian SFSR]].

In 1995 Ukraine entered the [[Council of Europe]] and one of the obligations it had to undertake with this act was to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAjvp2LnjMC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=death+penalty+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7TIeUrv0IO6I7AbM04CYBA&amp;ved=0CG8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20penalty%20Ukraine&amp;f=false International Actors, Democratization and the Rule of Law: Anchoring Democracy?], [[Routledge]], 2008, {{ISBN|0415492955}} (page 196 a.f.)&lt;/ref&gt; Little actions to do so were undertaken by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukraine's parliament) until September 1998 after international pressure by the Council of Europe and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr2/&gt;  (At the request of [[People's Deputy of Ukraine|People's Deputies of Ukraine]]) the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in December 1999.&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr2/&gt; The Verkhovna Rada introduced amendments to the then acting [[Criminal Code of Ukraine|Criminal Code]] in April 2000 that (finally) withdrew capital punishment from the list of official punishments of Ukraine (in peace and wartime).&lt;ref name="OnoprienkoIU28813"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr/&gt;&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zKsfGi3y3YgC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=death+penalty+Ukraine&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lTgeUvOSIZOThQfUqICgBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20penalty%20Ukraine&amp;f=false The Death Penalty: Beyond Abolition], [[Council of Europe]], 2004, {{ISBN|9287153337}} (page 74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine was the last [[Member states of the Council of Europe|Council of Europe member state]] that used to be part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref name=bookdpUkr/&gt;

==Politics==
[[National Corps]] Ukrainian far-right political party supports bringing back the death penalty.
==Reintroduction in Donetsk People's Republic==
The [[Donetsk People's Republic]], an [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized state]], introduced the death penalty in 2014 for cases of treason, espionage, and assassination of political leaders. There had already been accusations of [[extrajudicial execution]] occurring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/donetsk-separatists-introduce-death-penalty-for-treason/505271.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="953">The '''Code of Leovigild''' or '''Codex Revisus''' was a [[Visigothic]] [[legal code]], a revision of the [[Codex Euricianus]] made in the late sixth century under [[Leovigild]] (568&amp;ndash;586). The code does not survive and all we know of it is derived from the writings of [[Isidore of Seville]], a near contemporary eccelsiastic and encyclopaedist. Nevertheless, it was the Gothic basis of the later [[Liber Iudiciorum]], an Iberian law code which united it with the law code of the [[Hispano-Roman]] population, the [[Breviary of Alaric]].

In 1974, García Gallo made a critical examination of the evidence for the code and came to reject the claim of Isidore that Leovigild had formulated a new code, since the laws of [[Chindasuinth]] dictated modifications to laws more ancient the reign of Leovigild.

The '''Commissioner for the British Indian Ocean Territory''' is the head of government in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]]. The Commissioner is appointed by the [[British monarch]] on the advice of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The Commissioner does not reside in the territory, as it has had no native population since the forced depopulation of the Chagosian people in the 1970s, and the only population is the military of the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] at the joint base at [[Diego Garcia]].

The Commissioner's role is to administer the territory on behalf of the British government. This involves the passing of any necessary legislation for the territory, usually [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] or [[Statutory Instruments]]. The Commissioner is also responsible for liaising with the [[military of the United States]] in matters concerning the territory. An [[Administrator of the British Indian Ocean Territory]] acts as the Commissioner's assistant. The Commissioner also appoints a representative on the territory, who is the senior British military officer at Diego Garcia.

The current Commissioner is [[Ben Merrick]]. Since 1998, the Commissioner of the BIOT has also served as Commissioner of the British Antarctic Territory.

Unlike the other governors and commissioners of other [[British overseas territories]], there is no separate flag for the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory. This is mainly because he is never resident in the territory, and he would be unable to fly any flag from his offices in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London.

! rowspan=2|{{flagicon|Ottoman Empire}} Ottoman Empire&lt;br&gt;{{small|([[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Army]])}}&lt;br&gt;{{efn|Military personnel in the Ottoman Empire were assigned different duties according to their capabilities in order to administer the Armed Forces and particularly to be successful in battle. They were given various ranks so that they could conduct relations with each other and be fully aware of their duties. The issue of what sort of duties should be allocated to which unit or to which military institution used to be determined by the ranking within the Armed Forces. In [[Islam]]ic countries, certain 'degrees', instead of ranks, were given in accordance with the categorization of government duties. In the course of time, these 'degrees' had taken on certain characteristics. In the Ottoman Empire, besides the ranks that were awarded after passing through certain stages of promotion, there was also the rank of "[[Pasha]]" that was given directly by the [[Ottoman Sultan]]. This rank, which continued until the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]], was also given to civilian administrators who were approved of and found suitable. After the establishment of the Republic, the Sultanate was abolished, and the title became synonymous with the General rank, restricted to the Armed Forces only. Paymaster of a regiment - Captain of the Right Wing (Alay Emini - Sağ Kolağası): The rank of the Captain of the Right Wing was very high. The rank of the Adjutant and Paymaster of a regiment was also high but such individuals were not from the military class and they dealt with clerical duties and equipment needed by the regiment. Captain of the Wing - The Captain of the Left Wing- (Kolağası - Sol Kolağası): Captain of the Wing or the Captain of the Left Wing was the senior Captain. If he was educated in the regiment, he was called "Ağa" but if he was the son of a pasha, he was called "Bey".}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1909 TILL 1918 OTTOMAN RANK INSIGNIA |url=https://www.ottoman-uniforms.com/1909-till-1918-ottoman-rank-insignia/ |website=ottoman-uniforms.com |publisher=Ottoman Uniforms |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eidsivating Court of Appeal''' ({{lang-no|Eidsivating lagmannsrett}}) is the [[court of appeal (Norway)|court of appeal]] located in [[Hamar]], [[Norway]]. It serves the counties of [[Hedmark]], [[Oppland]] and northern [[Akershus]]. In addition to Hamar, the court may meet in [[Lillehammer]] and [[Eidsvoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.domstol.no/DAtemplates/Article____10270.aspx?epslanguage=NO |title=Om Eidsivating lagmannsrett |author=[[Norwegian National Courts Administration]] |accessdate=2008-10-11 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208120448/http://domstol.no/DAtemplates/Article____10270.aspx?epslanguage=NO |archivedate=2009-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court is administrated by the [[Norwegian National Courts Administration]].

{{Neo-fascism}}
'''Europe a Nation''' was a policy developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Fascist]] politician [[Oswald Mosley]] as the cornerstone of his [[Union Movement]]. It called for the integration of [[Europe]] into a [[polity|single political entity]]. Although the idea failed to gain widespread support for the Union Movement, it nonetheless proved highly influential on the [[far-right]] thought in Europe.

==Origins==
The idea of a united Europe began to develop in the final days of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Concepts such as ''Nation Europa'' and ''Eurafrika'', both of which looked for an ever-closer union between European countries, gained some currency in the German far-right underground in the immediate aftermath of the [[Second World War]]. Mosley, who towards the end of the war had learned to read the [[German language]], read a number of pamphlets discussing these ideas and was strongly influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Another important influence was [[Benito Mussolini]]'s manifesto of the [[Italian Social Republic]], which included a call for the establishment of a European Community.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Mosley would later claim that he had first advocated something akin to Europe a Nation in speeches as early as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oswald Mosley]], ''My Life'', Nelson, 1970, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, however, [[British Union of Fascists]] policy at any time.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Development==
Mosley first presented his idea of Europe forming a single state in his book ''The Alternative'' in 1947.&lt;ref name="Mack36"&gt;Macklin, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the traditional vision of nationalism that had been followed by the various shades of pre-war fascism had been too narrow in scope and that the post-war era required a new paradigm in which Europe would come together as a single state.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected any notion of a [[federal Europe]], instead calling for full integration.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, ''Fascism: A History'', Random House, 2011, pp. 330-331&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Mosley insisted that a supranational European state was essential to the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was presented to the wider electorate in October 1948 when Mosley called for elections to a European Assembly as the first step towards his vision.&lt;ref name="Harris31"&gt;Harris, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion also had an important [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] dimension as Mosley saw it as the only defence against Europe becoming the scene of the power struggles between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the racial kinship between the Germanic peoples of Europe, whom he defined as the Germans, British, Scandinavians and northern French, would be the basis for unity, whilst also declaring his admiration for the contributions of the Latin peoples to Europe's cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

He was opposed to both the [[United Nations]] and its predecessor the [[League of Nations]], dismissing both as part of a Jewish plot to undermine nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Europe a Nation was to include an [[anti-Semitic]] dimension, with the entire Jewish population of Europe to be expelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], where they could decide their own fate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa, most of which was still in the hands of the European colonial empires, was to be retained by the united Europe as a giant colony, with [[apartheid]] implemented on a continental basis, effectively excluding Blacks from Europe.&lt;ref name="Harris31"/&gt; Notions of any indigenous rule in Africa were excluded altogether from the idea.&lt;ref name="Thur245"/&gt; With [[autarky]] a central aim of Europe a Nation, Africa was to be exploited by the new state for its mineral and food resources. In this aspect, Mosley was heavily influenced by the works of [[Anton Zischka]].&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosley subsequently built upon the policy by calling for the European state to have its prices and incomes regulated by a "wage price mechanism", whilst also calling for "European Socialism", a syndical style organisation basis for the continent's industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively though the vision he presented was one that was highly steeped in [[corporatism]] and [[elitism]].&lt;ref name="Mack82"&gt;Macklin, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were to be corporatist in nature with an occupation-based franchise (previously a British Union of Fascists policy) whilst "European Socialism" was to include an effective free hand for business leaders but the co-ordination of workers in bodies called "labour Charters", a policy borrowed from the Fascist Italy.&lt;ref name="Mack82"/&gt;

Mosley summed up the arguments himself by stating that 'no lesser degree of union than that of an integral nation can give the will and power to act on the great scale.... No lesser space than all Europe, and the overseas possessions of Europe in a common pool, can give the room within which to act effectively'.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Mosley, 'European Socialism', ''The European'', May 1956&lt;/ref&gt; However Europe a Nation drew heavily on the existing heritage of fascism and indeed Graham Macklin has argued that it "merely adapted and enlarged the parameters of his fascist panacea to suit the times, and is thus easily recognisable as 'Fascist'".&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Within the UK, the notion of Europe a Nation largely failed to attract the younger far-right activists, most of whom deserted Mosley in favour of the [[League of Empire Loyalists]] (LEL) and other more minor and more extreme groups.&lt;ref&gt;Thurlow, pp. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.K. Chesterton]], who went on to lead the LEL, was a strong critic of Europe a Nation from 1947 when ''The Alternative'' was first published, preferring to emphasise [[British nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Mack36"/&gt;

The policy also failed to capture the minds of the British electorate, with the Union Movement enjoying comparative success in voting terms only when they emphasised more basic anti-immigrant rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Thur245"&gt;Thurlow, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Alexander Raven Thomson]], one of Mosley's closest lieutenants and noted for his sycophantic attitudes towards his leader, eventually told Mosley in 1950 that Europe a Nation held little attraction to British voters. As a consequence, the Union Movement briefly downplayed the idea, although Thomson's preferred alternative, [[neo-Nazism]], was soon abandoned as well when it proved equally unpalatable to the electorate.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wider European far-right, however, Europe a Nation did gain some wider currency. [[Fritz Rössler]], at the time going by the alias Dr. Franz Richter, became an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and attempted to make it [[Deutsche Reichspartei]] policy. He failed in this attempt and was expelled from the party, decamping to the [[Socialist Reich Party]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; For a time it also had the support of [[Adolf von Thadden]], who helped Mosley to organise the [[National Party of Europe]], a largely failed attempt to build a continental Europe a Nation political party.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately however the plan's main supporter in Germany proved to be [[Arthur Erhardt]], who established the journal ''[[Nation Europa]]'' to support far-right pan-European nationalist ideas, to which Mosley was a frequent contributor.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Germany it also gained some currency within the [[Italian Social Movement]], although by the early 1950s that wing of the party lost influence, the Italian nationalist arm gaining supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas would later be developed by [[Jean-François Thiriart]] and others interested in [[Europeanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Lee]], ''[[The Beast Reawakens]]'', Warner Books, 1998, pp. 170–174&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Europe a Nation was also an important influence on the thinking of [[Alain de Benoist]] and in particular the work of the think tank ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'' which he established in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Juggling Convention''' ('''EJC'''), is the largest [[juggling]] convention in the world, regularly attracting several thousand participants. It is held every year in a different [[Europe]]an country. It is organised by changing local organisation committees which are supported by the European Juggling Association (EJA), a non-profit association founded in 1987 in [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eja.net/en/eja.html |title=The Stichting European Juggling Association |accessdate=2007-04-27 |year=2006 |publisher=European Juggling Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most [[juggling convention]]s, it features a mix of workshops for jugglers, a "renegade" performance performed for participants, games, performances and a public show, usually spread out over a period of a week in the European summer. Accommodation is usually in the form of tents provided by participants.

== History ==

The first EJC was inspired by the [[International_Jugglers'_Association|IJA]] Festival and organised by jugglers who didn't want to travel to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eja.net/en/handbook/Thoughts,%20Philosophy,%20History/Toby%20Philpott%20on%20Conventions.html |title=Thoughts, Philosophy, History by Toby Philpott |accessdate=2015-06-26 |year=2015 |publisher=European Juggling Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA helped by giving the organisers a list (known as the roster) of IJA members living in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/30-4/30-4,p6.htm |title=Report on Brighton IJA Convention April 15 &amp; 16, 1978 by Lindsay Leslie |accessdate=2015-06-28 |year=2015 |publisher=International Juggling Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as the "first European IJA mini-convention" and had an attendance of 11 jugglers from 5 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juggle.org/festival/IJA-EJC-Brighton.shtml |title=First European IJA Mini-Convention Brighton, England |accessdate=2015-06-26 |year=2015 |publisher=International Juggling Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; EJC has now grown much bigger than its inspiration and has much less focus on competitive juggling, but is more about the sharing of juggling.

The [[flag]] of the short-lived [[Republic of Benin (Nigeria)|Republic of Benin]] in [[Nigeria]] consists of the colours black, and green, with black taking up two-thirds of the flag. It was inspired by the flag of the now-defunct Republic of [[Biafra]]. The main difference was that Biafran flag was a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] of red, black, and green. As with the Biafran flag, it was charged in the centre with a golden rising sun but it did not have a golden bar below it.

The '''Fête des Vignerons''' is a traditional festival which takes place in [[Vevey]], in [[Switzerland]].

It has been organised by the Confrérie des Vignerons (Brotherhood of Winegrowers) in Vevey since 1797. The organising committee is free to choose how often the festival takes place, but the maximum number of times is five times in a century. Up to now, the interval between two festivals has varied between 14 and 28 years. The next festival will take place in 2019, which will be 20 years after the preceding one (1999).

The festival features a show celebrating the world of winemaking; many performances take place in the market place near the shore of [[Lake Geneva]],      and festivities also take place in the town itself.

[[File:Carte Européenne d'Assurance Maladie France.jpg|thumb|[[European Health Insurance Card]] (French version pictured)]]

'''Healthcare in Europe''' is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the [[nation]]al level. The systems are primarily [[Publicly-funded health care|publicly funded]]  through taxation ([[universal health care]]). Private funding may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of costs or may reflect totally private (non-subsidized) [[healthcare]] either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.  Many [[Europe]]an countries (and all [[European Union]] countries) offer their citizens a [[European Health Insurance Card]] which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries. 

==European Union==
The [[European Union]] has no major administrative responsibility in the field of healthcare. The [[European Commission|European Commission's]] [[Directorate-General for Health and Consumers]] however seeks to  align national laws on the safety of food and other products, on consumers' rights and on the protection of people's health, to form new EU wide laws and thus strengthen its internal markets.

'''Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service''' ('''HMDS''') is the [[diplomatic service]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], dealing with foreign affairs, as opposed to the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Home Civil Service]], which deals with domestic affairs. It employs around 14,000 people, roughly one-third of whom are crown servants working directly for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], either in London or abroad. The remaining two thirds of staff are employed locally by one of nearly 270 British diplomatic missions abroad (such as embassies, consulates or high commissions).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/about/recruitment "Working for FCO", Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, retrieved 28/12/2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] is also the Head of the Diplomatic Service.

The Foreign Service, which originally provided [[civil servant]]s to staff the Foreign Office, was once a separate service, but it amalgamated with the Diplomatic Service in 1918. The Diplomatic Service also absorbed the [[Colonial Service]] in the late 1960s.

Women were not allowed to join the Diplomatic Service until 1946. Until 1973, they were required to leave when they married. The first female ambassador to be appointed was [[Barbara Salt]], to Israel in 1962, but ill-health prevented her from taking up the post. The first woman to serve as an ambassador was [[Anne Warburton]], appointed to Denmark in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28039460 "The women who serve in danger zones", BBC News, 9 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==His Journey==
'''Puharkkandam'''

Kovalan, the son of a wealthy merchant, Machattuvan, married [[Kannagi]], the lovely daughter of another merchant, Manayakan. At the time of his marriage, he was sixteen years old. They lived together happily in the city of Kaveripattinam, until Kovalan met the courtesan [[Madhavi (Silappatikaram)|Madhavi]] and fell in love with her. In his infatuation, he completely forgot his wife and spent his time with Mathavi. Meanwhile, Kovalan spent all his wealth, bestowed upon by his parents, on his new lover. During the annual festival in the honour of Indra, there was a misunderstanding between the young lovers. As a result, Kovilan returned to his chaste wife, Kannagi, who welcomed him whole-heartedly, despite him being penniless. Realising his mistake, he decided to start a new life by migrating to the Madura(Madurai) city along with his wife. 

'''Maduraikkandam'''

Kovalan along with his wife Kannagi, started their journey towards Madura city at the stroke of first light. A Buddhist nun also accompanied them in the journey. After walking for many days, they reached the city of Madura. In the middle of the journey, Kovalan has send word to his parents about his intentions of starting a new life in a new city. Upon arrival, impressed by the grandeur of Madurai city, Kovalan set out to sell one of Kannagi's [[anklet]]s (Tamil: Silambu), the only left-over asset they owned, with which he intended to start the business. Kovalan entrusted the anklet to be sold to the Palace's Chief jeweller, who promises to fetch him good money from the king. The king, who is tricked by the Chief Jeweller, orders to behead Kovalan without a trial, on account of stealing the Queen's anklet. Thereby, Kovalan dies in the city of Madurai. 

==In popular culture==
A [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala film]] called ''[[Paththini (2016 film)|Paththini]]'' was released on 5 May 2016 in [[Sri Lanka]]. Goddess Paththni or Kovalan was live acted by [[Uddika Premarathna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sandeshaya.org/pathini-sinhala-film-by-sunil-ariyaratne/ | title=Pathini Sinhala Film by Sunil Ariyaratne | publisher=Sandeshaya | accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mongolian Revolution of 1990''' (1990 Democratic Revolution, {{Lang-mn|Ардчилсан хувьсгал}}, Ardchilsan Khuvĭsgal) was a democratic [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s to overthrow the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] and eventually moved towards the democratic present day [[Mongolia]] and the writing of the new [[Constitution of Mongolia|constitution]]. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

This was the beginning of the end of the 70-year period of [[socialism]] in [[Mongolia]]. Although a [[multi-party system]] was established, the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] (MPRP) actually remained in power until [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996]]. Nevertheless, reforms were implemented and the transition to a market economy begun. The revolution was inspired by the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|reforms]] in the [[Soviet Union]], and by the [[Revolutions of 1989|similar revolutions in Eastern Europe in late 1989]].

==Background==
There were [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|pro-independence movements]] in 1911 against the colonization policy of the late [[Qing dynasty]]. Finally, the [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in [[Mongolia]] in 1921 with the help of the [[Soviet Union]], after [[White movement|White Russian]] and [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Chinese]] forces had been expelled. In 1924, the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|ISBN=9028600701|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the following decades, Mongolia was always very closely aligned with the [[Soviet Union]]. After the resignation of [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] in 1984, and inspired by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the Soviet Union, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|ISBN=1134396732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of events==
[[File:Hunger strikers in Mongolia.png|thumb|left|Hunger strikers]]
Young people in Mongolia wanted a change in the society, the way the government was conducting its business. They began to meet and discuss secretly. For example, during his studies in the USSR, [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] learned about [[Glasnost]], the concepts such as freedom of speech and economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He told the audience "We consider that [[Perestroika]] is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are:&amp;nbsp;... following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost,&amp;nbsp;... and supporting fair progressive power&amp;nbsp;... These are the objectives of an initiatives' group-an organization that shall work. After the congress I hope we will gather and discuss with you about it in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles."&lt;ref name="young artists"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsakhia |first=Elbegdorj |editors=Mongolian Democratic Union, New Period Youth Organization, and Mongolia's Young Leaders Foundation|title=The Footstep of Truth is White book "Speech of Ulaan Od newspaper's correspondent Elbegdorj at Young Artists' Second National Congress"|publisher=Hiimori |place=Ulaanbaatar|year=1999 |page=15|isbn=99929-74-01-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him not to say such things.

One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.&lt;ref name="young artists" /&gt;

On the morning of 10 December 1989, the first open pro-democracy public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in Ulaanbaatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]&amp;mdash;which most Mongolians could not read&amp;mdash;as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview to ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; On 2 January 1990, Mongolian Democratic Union began distributing leaflets calling for a democratic revolution.&lt;ref name="Amarsanaa"&gt;{{cite book|last=S. and S.|first=Amarsanaa &amp;  Mainbayar|title=Concise historical album of the Mongolian Democratic Union|year=2009|pages=3–5, 10, 33–35, 44, 47, 51–56, 58, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the government did not comply with this and later, more aggressive demands, demonstrations occurred.

On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met on square in front of Lenin Museum which was named as Freedom Square since then in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. A demonstration on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] on 21 January (in weather of -30&amp;nbsp;C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to [[Genghis Khan]]), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise.&lt;ref name="Fineman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-609_1_rock-music/2|title=Mongolia Reform Group Marches to Rock Anthem|first=Mark|last=Fineman|date=1990-01-24|accessdate=2012-12-26|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Mongolia-watchers in Beijing said that... the democracy movement is rooted more in nationalism than in dissent....

And the rebels carried a modified [[Flag of Mongolia]] which lacked a star symbolizing socialism; this flag would become the new flag after the revolution.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt;

In subsequent months activists continued to organize demonstrations, rallies, protests and hunger strikes, as well as teachers' and workers' strikes.&lt;ref name="Politburo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Parliaments in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slpaAe40kn0C&amp;pg=PA143 |last=Ahmed and Norton|first=Nizam U. and Philip|page=143|publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co.Ltd|place=London|isbn=0-7146-4951-1|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists had growing support from Mongolians, both in the capital and the countryside and the union's activities led to other calls for democracy all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baabar.niitlelch.mn/content/112.shtml|title=Democratic Revolution and Its Terrible Explanations|author=[[Baabar]]|publisher=baabar.mn (in Mongolian)|date=16 November 2009|accessdate=25 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227133854/http://baabar.niitlelch.mn/content/112.shtml|archivedate=27 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Democracy's Hero"&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy's Hero: Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj|url=http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/democracy%E2%80%99s-hero-tsakhiagiin-elbegdorj|publisher=The International Republican Institute|location=Washington|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=8 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428055254/http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/democracy%E2%80%99s-hero-tsakhiagiin-elbegdorj|archivedate=28 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia Celebrates 20th Anniversary of Democratic Revolution|url=http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/mongolia-celebrates-20th-anniversary-democratic-revolution|publisher=The International Republican Institute|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=11 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219062034/http://iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/mongolia-celebrates-20th-anniversary-democratic-revolution|archivedate=19 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After came weekend demonstrations in January and February and the forming of Mongolia's first opposition parties. The demonstrations expanded to many thousands of people in the capital city, in [[Erdenet]] and [[Darkhan (city)|Darkhan]], and to the provincial centers, notably [[Mörön (city)|Mörön]] in [[Khövsgöl Province|Khövsgöl]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossabi, Morris.  ''Modern Mongolia: From Khans to Commissars to Capitalists''.  2005, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-24419-1}}.  pp. 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;

After numerous demonstrations of many thousands of people in the capital city as well as provincial centers, on 4 March 1990, the MDU and three other reform organizations held a joint outdoor mass meeting, inviting the government to attend. The government sent no representative to what became a demonstration of over 100,000 people demanding democratic change.&lt;ref name="Amarsanaa" /&gt; On March 7, 1990, on [[Sükhbaatar Square]], Democratic Union launched a hunger strike of ten urging that the communists to resign. Hunger strikers number increased and thousands supported them. Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party(MPRP) (present [[Mongolian People's Party]])'s Politburo – the authority of the government eventually gave way to the pressure and entered into negotiations with the leaders of the democratic movement Mongolian Democratic Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilhelm|first=Kathy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19900312&amp;id=H-FLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b4sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4798,2084369|title=Mongolian Politburo resigns en masse|pages=4|newspaper=The Free Lance Star|place=Fredericksburg, VA|date=12 March 1990|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jambyn Batmönkh]], chairman of Politburo of MPRP's Central Committee decided to dissolve the Politburo and to resign on 9 March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19900312&amp;id=QkUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_uQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4637,3539885|title=Entire Mongolian Politburo resigns|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|pages=8A|place=Lawrence, KS|date=12 March 1990|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ch.|first=Munkhbayar|url=http://news.dorgio.mn/politics/other/772|title=What was the Mongolian democratic revolution?|publisher=dorgio.mn (in Mongolian)|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Behind the scenes, however, the MPRP had seriously considered cracking down on the protesters, writing a decree that was left to be signed by the party leader [[Jambyn Batmönkh]]. Batmönkh opposed it, maintaining a strict policy of never using force ({{lang-mn|Хэрхэвч Хүч хэрэглэж болохгүй}}).

Elbegdorj announced the news of Politburo resignation to the hunger strikers and to people who'd gathered on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] at 10PM on that day after the negotiations between leaders of MPRP and Mongolian Democratic Union.&lt;ref name="young artists" /&gt; The hunger strike stopped. The MPRP Politburo resignation paved the way for the first multi-party elections in Mongolia.&lt;ref name="Politburo" /&gt; The new government announced Mongolia's first free parliamentary elections, which were to be held in July.

The role of women in the protest was low-key, such as providing food and drink to the demonstrators; all the visible protest leaders were men, mirroring the traditional subordinate role of [[women in Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Zorig memorial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A monument to pro-democracy leader [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], assassinated in 1998]] 
Following the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia, Mongolia's first free, multi-party elections for a bicameral parliament were held on 29 July 1990.&lt;ref name="Amarsanaa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-24/news/wr-748_1_mongolian-democratic-party|title=Briefing Paper : For the First Time, Mongolians Have Political Choices|last=Holley|first=David|date=24 July 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|place=Los Angeles, CA|accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 Mongolian parliamentary elections, parties ran for 430 seats in the [[State Great Hural|Great Hural]]. Opposition parties were not able to nominate enough candidates. The opposition nominated 346 candidates for the 430 seats in the Great Hural (upper house). The [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] MPRP won 357 seats in the Great Hural and 31 out of 53 seats in the Small Hural (which was later abolished) as well.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Staisch, Werner M. Prohl, ''Dschingis Khan lächelt'', Bonn 1998, p.38ff&lt;/ref&gt; The MPRP enjoyed a strong position in the countryside.

Nonetheless, the new MPRP government under [[Dashiin Byambasüren|D. Byambasüren]] shared power with the democrats, and implemented constitutional and economic reforms. As these reforms coincided with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], which had until 1990 provided significant economic aid to Mongolia's state budget, the country did experience harsh economic problems: enterprises closed down, inflation rose, and basic food had to be [[Rationing|rationed]] for a time. Foreign trade broke down, economic and technical aid from the former socialist countries ended, and domestic economy was struggling with privatization. Inflation rose, stores' shelves were depleted, ration cards for food were issued for a period of time. A thriving black market arose in Ulaanbaatar by 1988 to accommodate the needs of the populace.&lt;ref name="Amarsanaa" /&gt;

The [[State Great Hural]] (upper house) first met on 3 September and elected a president (MPRP), vice president ([[Mongolian Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]]), prime minister (MPRP), and 50 members to the Baga Hural (lower house). The vice president was also chairman of the Baga Hural. In November 1991, the People's Great Hural (Parliament) began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition to establishing Mongolia as an independent, sovereign republic and guaranteeing a number of rights and freedoms, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH).

The constitution was amended in 1992. The first election win for the democrats was the [[Mongolian presidential election, 1993|presidential election of 1993]], when the opposition candidate [[Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat]] won.&lt;ref&gt;Ochirbat was originally a MPRP member, but when his party nominated an orthodox communist as their presidential candidate, he agreed to run as the candidate of the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] that stemmed from the Democratic Union.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Democratic Union Coalition]] co-led by [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] chairman [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] for the first time succeeded in winning the majority in the [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Susan V.|publisher=Congressional Research Service|title=Mongolia: Issues for Congress|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41867.pdf|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] has been part of three coalition governments with the former ruling MPRP in 2004-2008 and in 2008-2012 respectively; and with the [[Civil Will-Green Party]] and new MPRP from 2012 and on.

In the [[Mongolian presidential election, 2009|2009 Mongolian Presidential election]], the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] candidate, [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] — one of the democratic revolution leaders — defeated the MPRP candidate, incumbent President [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia Profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15460528|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this victory, in the [[Mongolian legislative election, 2012|2012 Parliamentary elections]], the Democratic Party won again.&lt;ref name="parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.mn|title=Mongolia's State Great Hural (the Parliament)|publisher=parliament.mn (in Mongolian)|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 local elections of the capital city, provinces and districts, the Democratic Party won for the first time in the country's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dashrentsen.niitlelch.mn/content/5374.shtml|title=A party that is defeated in five elections in row is dissolved|publisher=baabar.mn (in Mongolian)|date=1 July 2013|last=G.|first=Dashrentsen|accessdate=6 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719233841/http://dashrentsen.niitlelch.mn/content/5374.shtml|archivedate=19 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Mongolian presidential election, 2013|2013 Mongolian Presidential election]], the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]] candidate, incumbent President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], won.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|title=Incumbent Mongolian president wins 2nd term on pro-Western, anti-graft platform|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/incumbent-mongolian-president-wins-2nd-term-on-pro-western-anti-graft-platform/2013/06/26/2bbce73e-deca-11e2-ad2e-fcd1bf42174d_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|place=Washington|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Democratic Party that stemmed from the Democratic Union — that is, the pro-democracy activists — has been in control of Mongolia's presidency, parliament and government between 2013 and 2016, when it was defeated at the Parliamentary Elections.&lt;ref name="parliament" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

The '''Moro-Naba Ceremony''' takes place every Friday around 07:00 in [[Ouagadougou]], the capital of [[Burkina Faso]].

[[Mossi people|Mossi]] leaders travel to the compound of the [[Moro-Naba]] chief. They are seated by rank for the Moro-Naba's appearance. The Moro-Naba wears red and appears with a horse as if prepared for war. A [[cannon]] fires, the most senior chiefs pledge [[allegiance]], and the Moro-Naba leaves before reappearing in white, as if making [[peace]]. Doolo, the traditional [[beer]], and [[kola nut]] drinks are distributed, after which the Moro-Naba holds court.

The [[ceremony]] is said to represent the Moro-Naba's [[Political minister|minister]]s dissuading him from going to war.

The '''National Council for the Defense of Democracy''' ({{Lang-fr|Conseil National Pour la Défense de la Démocratie}}, CNDD) is a political party in [[Burundi]].

==History==
The CNDD was established in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] on 24 September 1994 and was initially led by [[Léonard Nyangoma]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford (2014) ''Political Handbook of the World 2014 '', CQ Press, p211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; The party also established an armed wing, the [[Forces for the Defence of Democracy]], which was involved in the country's ethnic conflict. In the early 2000s the party split, with a faction led by [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] becoming the [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] (CNDD–FDD).

A '''number translation service''' translates a dialled [[telephone number]], typically beginning 08 in the [[UK]] to a geographical 'connect number' beginning 01 or 02 in the UK. The connect number may be changed without changing the published dialled number. Originally NTS numbers were used, for example, to allow any caller to dial a [[local call]] to the called party irrespective of location, saving money if the connect number was not also a local call, but the system gradually came to be seen as a way of making money and now most phone companies charge the caller more for 08 numbers than for 01, 02 or 03 numbers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

{{History of Indonesia}}

'''Riau-Lingga Sultanate''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]/[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Kesultanan Riau-Lingga'', [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: كسلطانن رياو-ليڠڬ), also known as the '''Lingga-Riau Sultanate''', '''Riau Sultanate''' or '''Lingga Sultanate''' was a [[Malay people|Malay]] [[sultanate]] that existed from 1824 to 1911, before being dissolved following Dutch intervention.

The sultanate came into existence as a result of the [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of the [[Johor Sultanate#Golden Age|Johor-Riau Sultanate]] that separated [[Johor|Peninsular Johor]], together with the island of [[Singapore]], from the [[Riau archipelago]].  This partition followed the succession dispute following the death of [[Sultan of Johor#Office-holder|Mahmud III of Johor]], when Abdul Rahman was crowned as the first Sultan of Riau-Lingga. The [[Island country|maritime kingdom]] was recognised by both the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] following the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]].

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Kesultanan-riau-lingga-08.jpg|thumb|left|The region witnessed the triumph of Haji Fisabillah of Johor-Riau during the battle against the [[Dutch East India Company]] on 6 January 1784 in Tanjung Pinang, Riau. It was the largest military campaign in the Strait of Malacca during the 18th century.]]
The Riau Archipelago became a part of the [[Malaccan Empire]] after the expansion by [[Tun Perak]] in the 15th century, following the decline of the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]]. After the fall of Malacca at the hands of [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|the Portuguese]], the axis of regional power was inherited by the [[Johor Empire|Johor Sultanate]]. During the golden age of Johor, the kingdom stretched across half of the [[Malay Peninsular]], eastern [[Sumatra]], Singapore, [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Jambi]] and the Riau Islands.

According to the 1849 Johor Annals, on 27 September 1673 the [[Laksamana]] (admiral) of Johor, Tun Abdul Jamil, was ordered by [[Abdul Jalil Shah III]] to found a settlement in Sungai Carang, Ulu Riau, on [[Bintan Island]]. The settlement in Sungai Carang was later known as Riau Lama. Initially a fortress to protect the Johor Empire, Riau Lama then prospered and became an increasingly prominent [[entrepôt]] for regional trade in the [[Strait of Malacca]].

Ulu Riau became the capital of Johor during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim when he relocated the capital from Batu Sawar, [[Kota Tinggi]] in [[Malay Peninsular|Peninsular]] Johor after the old capital was sacked by [[Jambi Sultanate|Jambi]] forces on 4 October 1722. Riau Lama then became the capital of the empire for 65 years, from 1722 to 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Uac5dHGsI |title=Dari Sinilah Kejayaan Melayu Riau Bermula |publisher=[[YouTube]] |location=[[Batam]] |language=Indonesian|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[Lingga Island|Lingga]] began during the reign of [[Mahmud Shah III]]. In 1788, he relocated the capital from Riau Lama, Ulu Riau, Bintan to [[Daik]], Lingga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indië, Volumes 76-77|year=1920|contribution=Institut voor taal-, land- en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch Indië, The Hague|publisher=M. Nijhoff|isbn=|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan did this as he believed that he was being reduced to a mere [[figurehead]] under the Dutch. He then requested aid from his distant relative, Raja Ismail, a local ruler of [[Tuaran|Tempasuk]] to organise a successful campaign against the Dutch. Out of fear of retaliation by the Dutch, he organised a mass transfer of the populace: the Sultan left for Lingga with 2000 people, the ''[[Bendahara]]'' ([[vizier]]) went to [[Pahang]] with 1000 people while others headed to [[Terengganu]]. When the Dutch arrived in Riau, there were only a few Chinese planters left, who persuaded the Dutch not to chase the ''Orang-orang Melayu'' ([[Malay people]]).

The Sultan then developed Lingga and welcomed new settlers to the island. Dato Kaya Megat was appointed as the new Bendahara of Lingga. New dwellings were constructed, roads were built and buildings were improved. He found unprecedented new wealth when tin mines were organised in Singkep. Both the British and Dutch then restored his claim on the Riau island.{{clarify|reason=not clear whether this means the British and Dutch recognised his claim, or restored his rule|date=February 2017}} He began to revive maritime trade discreetly with the British as a major source of commodities, especially valuable [[tin]], [[Gambier (extract)|gambier]] and [[spices]].

===Succession crisis and Sultan Abdul Rahman===
[[File:PedraBranca-MapofDominionsofJohore-Hamilton-1727.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander Hamilton]]'s "A Map of the Dominions of Johore and of the Island of Sumatra with the Adjacent Islands" (1727). Illustrating mainland Johore, eastern Sumatra, Singapore, Bangka and Riau Archipelago as a single political entity, the map was made a century prior to the partition of 1824.]]
In 1812, the Johor-Riau Sultanate experienced a succession crisis. The death of the Mahmud Shah III in Lingga left no [[heir apparent]]. Royal custom required that the succeeding sultan must be present at his predecessor's [[wikt:deathbed|deathbed]]. However at the time Mahmud Shah III died, the eldest prince, Tengku Hussein, was in [[Pahang]] to celebrate his marriage to the daughter of the [[Bendahara]] (governor). The other candidate was Tengku Hussein's half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman.  To complicate matters, neither of the candidates was of full royal blood. The mother of Tengku Hussein, Cik Mariam, owed her origin to a [[Balinese people|Balinese]] slave lady and a [[Bugis people|Bugis]] commoner. Tengku Abdul Rahman had a similarly [[wikt:low-born|lowborn]] mother, Cik Halimah. The only unquestionably royal wife and [[Queen consort|consort]] of Mahmud Shah was Engku Puteri Hamidah, whose only child had died an hour after birth.

In the following chaos, Engku Puteri was expected to install Tengku Hussein as the next sultan, because he had been preferred by the late Mahmud Shah. Based on the royal ''[[adat]]'' (customary observance), the consent of Engku Puteri was crucial as she was the holder of the ''Cogan'' ([[Regalia|Royal Regalia]]) of Johor-Riau, and the installation of a new sultan was only valid if it took place with the regalia. The regalia was fundamental to the installation of the sultan; it was a symbol of power, legitimacy and the sovereignty of the state.

Nonetheless, [[#Yang Dipertuan Muda|Yang Dipertuan Muda]] Jaafar (then-[[viceregal|viceroy]] of the sultanate) supported the reluctant Tengku Abdul Rahman, adhering to the rules of royal protocol, as he had been present at the late Sultan's deathbed. Unwilling and furious, the outspoken Queen is then reported to have said, "Who elected Abdul Rahman as sovereign of Johor? Was it my brother Raja Jaafar or by what law of succession has it happened? It is owing to this act of injustice that the ancient empire of Johor is fast falling to decay".

Rivalry between the British and the Dutch now came into play.  The British had earlier gained [[Dutch Malacca|Malacca]] from the Dutch under the [[Treaty of The Hague (1795)|Treaty of The Hague]] in 1795 and saw an opportunity to increase their regional influence. They crowned Tengku Hussein in Singapore, and he took the title [[Hussein Shah of Johor]]. The British were actively involved in the Johor-Riau administration between 1812–1818, and their intervention further strengthened their dominance in the Strait of Malacca. The British recognised Johor-Riau as a [[sovereign state]] and offered to pay Engku Puteri 50,000 Ringgits ([[Spanish dollar|Spanish Coins]]) for the royal regalia, which she refused.

Seeing the diplomatic advantage gained in the region by the British, the Dutch responded by crowning Tengku Abdul Rahman as sultan instead. They also obtained, at the [[Congress of Vienna]], a withdrawal of British recognition of Johor-Riau sovereignty.{{clarify|reason=this does not make sense. Does it mean the Dutch secured British agreement to Dutch supremacy in Johor-Riau?|date=February 2017}} To further curtail the British domination over the region, the Dutch entered into an agreement with the Johor-Riau Sultanate on 27 November 1818. The agreement stipulated that the Dutch were to be the paramount leaders of the Johor-Riau Sultanate and that only [[Dutch people]] could engage in trade with the kingdom. A Dutch garrison was then stationed in Riau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/singapore/singapore_history_johore_sultanate.html|title=Singapore-Johor Sultanate|publisher=Countries of the world|location= |language=|date=December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch also secured an agreement that Dutch consent was required for all future appointments of Johor-Riau Sultans. This agreement was signed by Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar representing Abdul Rahman, without the sultan's consent or knowledge.

[[File:Cogan.jpg|thumb|right|''Cogan'', the Royal Regalia of Johor-Riau. The coronation of the sultan would be only be official if the regalia were used. This caused both the British and the Dutch to try to claim the regalia from Engku Puteri Hamidah in order to install their preferred sultan.]]
Just as the British had done, both the Dutch and Yang Dipertuan Muda then desperately tried to win the royal regalia from Engku Puteri. The reluctant Abdul Rahman, believing he was not the rightful heir, decided to move from Lingga to [[Terengganu]], claiming that he wanted to celebrate his marriage. The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the ''Kroonprins'' (Dutch: Crown Prince's) Fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue. With the royal regalia in Dutch hands, Abdul Rahman was invited from Terengganu and proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor, Riau-Lingga and Pahang on 27 November 1822. Hence, the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau Empire was now Abdul Rahman, rather than the British-backed Hussein.

This led to the [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of Johor-Riau under the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824, by which the region north of the [[Singapore Strait]] including the island of Singapore and Johor were to be under British influence, while the south of the strait along with Riau and Lingga were to be controlled by the Dutch. By installing two sultans from the same kingdom, both the British and the Dutch effectively destroyed the Johor-Riau polity and satisfied their colonial ambitions.

Under the treaty, Tengku Abdul Rahman was crowned as the Sultan of Riau-Lingga, bearing the name of Sultan Abdul Rahman, with the royal seat in Daik, Lingga. Tengku Hussein, backed by the British, was installed as the Sultan of Johore and ruled over Singapore and the Peninsular Johor. He later ceded Singapore to the British in return for their support during the dispute. Both sultans of Johor and Riau acted mainly as [[puppet monarch]]s under the guidance of the colonial powers.

===Sultan Mahmud IV and the crisis of 1857===

During the reign of Mahmud IV, increasing tensions developed with Dutch administrators. The Sultan felt that his kingdom was being heavily manipulated by the Dutch and the Yang Dipertuan Muda, and wanted to throw off their yoke. He frequently traveled to Singapore, [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] to gain recognition for his rule by the British, and support from his circle of kin in other [[Malay people|Malay]] Royal Houses against the viceregal house of Riau, who came from [[Bugis]] stock. He also asserted his claim to be the rightful heir of the preceding Johor-Riau throne, rather than Hussein Shah of Johor. The sultan's actions were met with suspicion by the British, who warned the Dutch that as their [[vassal]], he was in breach of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Angered and embarrassed by the Sultan, the Dutch then prohibited him from travelling without their consent. He ignored this prohibition.

The crisis reached its peak in 1857 when, following the death of the Yang Dipertuan Muda, the Sultan delayed in naming his successor. This was due to the fact that the Sultan do not approve of any of the candidates offered by the Yang Dipertuan Muda's family. The Sultan then tried to name a candidate from Singapore and claimed that the revenues gained by the Yang Dipertuan Muda ought to be paid to him. The final blow came when he decided to sail to Singapore without naming a viceroy, despite the Dutch travel prohibition. The Dutch therefore deposed him on 7 October 1857 while he was in Singapore. He then remained in Singapore and sought [[mediation]] with the Dutch, but the British decided not to interfere in the issue.

===Sultan Badrul Alam Syah II===
[[File:Riouw.jpg|thumb|right|Tandjoengpinang in 1859]]
In Riau, the Dutch and Yang Dipertuan Muda then enthroned Mahmud IV's uncle, Sultan Badrul Alam Syah II as the fourth Sultan of Riau (1857–1883). He was assisted by Yang Dipertuan Muda IX Raja Haji Abdullah (1857–1858). During his reign, Daik found unprecedented prosperity. The Sultan improved the local economy by encouraging rice cultivation and [[opium]] preparation. He also possessed a small armada to promote trade relations. He introduced [[sago]] from the [[Moluccas]] to the local people, which he believed was a better crop than rice as a staple food, as rice can be only harvested once yearly. Daik then become a regional trade centre attracting traders from [[China]], [[Celebes]], [[Borneo]], [[Malay Peninsular]], [[Sumatra]], [[Pagaruyung]], [[Java Island|Java]], [[Siak Regency|Siak]] and [[Pahang]].

This caused the Dutch concern, as they feared that the sultanate might gather enough supplies and forces to defeat them. Due to this fear, the Dutch appointed an [[Resident (title)|assistant resident]] to be stationed in Tanjung Buton, a port close to Mepar Island, 6 kilometres from the Riau administrative centre.

===The rise of nationalism===
[[File:JERUMAT-Raja-Ali-Klana-171x300.jpg|thumb|left|Ali Kelana, Crown Prince of Riau-Lingga, one of the founding fathers of the Roesidijah Club Riouw, the first modern organisation in the Netherlands East Indies. (taken in 1899)]]
The globalisation of the 19th century opened new opportunities for the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Proximity to [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] Singapore, just 40 miles away, shaped the political climate of the kingdom, giving Riau Malays an opportunity to familiarise themselves with new ideas from the [[Middle East]]. The opening of [[Suez Canal]] meant a journey to [[Mecca]] via [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]] and Singapore could take no more than a fortnight; thus these cities became major ports for the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://batampos.co.id/04-11-2014/meneroka-peran-cendekiawan-kerajaan-riau-lingga-dalam-menentang-belanda-2/ |title=Meneroka Peran Cendekiawan Kerajaan Riau-Lingga dalam Menentang Belanda (2) |publisher=Batampos.co.id|location=[[Batam]] |language=Indonesian |date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the experience and intellectual progress attained in the Middle East and influenced by the [[Pan-Islamism]] brotherhood, the Riau Malay intelligentsia established the Roesidijah (Club) Riouw in 1895. The association was born as a literary circle to develop the religious, cultural and intellectual needs of the sultanate, but as it matured, it changed into a more critical organisation and began to address the fight against Dutch rule in the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/60597/verzeparty-dan-lydelyk-verzet-perdirian-roesidijah-club-riouw-1890-an-1991/ |title=Verzeparty dan Lydelyk Verzet: Perdirian Roesidijah (Club) Riouw 1890-an -1991 |publisher=Tanjungpinangpos.co.id|location=[[Tanjung Pinang]] |language=Indonesian |date=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The era was marked by growing awareness among the elite and rulers of the importance of ''watan'' ([[homeland]]) and one's duty towards his or her native soil. In order to succeed to establish a ''watan'', the land must be [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]], a far-cry from a Dutch-controlled sultanate. Moreover, it was also viewed that the penetration of the [[Western country|west]] in the state was slowly tearing apart the fabric of the [[Malayness|Malay-Muslim]] identity.

By the dawn of the 20th century, the association had become a political tool for rising against the colonial power, with Raja Muhammad Thahir and Raja Ali Kelana acting as its backbone. Diplomatic missions were sent to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1883, 1895 and in 1905 to secure the liberation of the kingdom by Raja Ali Kelana, accompanied by a renowned [[Pattani]]-born [[Ulema]], Syeikh Wan Ahmad Fatani. The Dutch Colonial Office in Tanjung Pinang labelled the organisation as a ''versetpartai'' (Dutch: Left-leaning party). The organisation also won momentous support from the ''Mohakamah'' (Malay Judiciary) and the ''Dewan Kerajaan'' (Sultanate Administrative Board). It critically monitored and researched every step taken by the Dutch Colonial Resident in the sultanate's administration, which led to Dutch outrage.

[[File:RiauIslands-versteeg-1860.jpg|thumb|right|A Dutch map of ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden'' (Residence of Riau and Dependencies) in 1860.]]
The movement was an early form of [[Malay nationalism]]. Non-violence and [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts. The Dutch then branded the movement as ''leidelek verset'' (Dutch: Passive resistance), and passive acts such as ignoring the raising of the Dutch flag were met with anger by the [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]]-based ''Raad van Indie'' (Dutch East Indies Council) and the Advisor on Native Affairs, [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]]. In a ''eheim'' (Dutch: secret) letter 660/G, dated 7 May 1904 to the Dutch East Indies Council, Hurgronje advocated that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the Governor of Netherlands East Indies that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore ''verzetparty''. Later, on 1 January 1903, the Dutch Colonial Resident found that the Dutch flag was not being raised during his visit to the royal palace. In his report to the governor he wrote; "it seems that he (Sultan Abdul Rahman II) acted as if he was a sovereign king and he raises his own flag". Based on several records in the Indonesian National Archive, there were some reports that the Sultan then apologised to the governor over the "flag incident".

In its reply to the ''eheim'' letter numbered 1036/G 9 August 1904, the Dutch East Indies Council agreed on the proposal put forward by Hurgronje and authorised action against the nationalist association. Nonetheless, advice to the Sultan was to be first to put forward a military action towards the kingdom and association. The council also advised the Dutch Resident in Riau to avoid entering contractual agreement before achieving consensus with the ruling elite of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate.{{clarify|reason=not clear what the content of the Council's letter was, or what the sultan and resident were required to do|date=February 2017}}

===Dissolution by the Dutch===
[[File:Abdul Rahman II of Riau Lingga.jpg|thumb|left|The last Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Abdul Rahman II. He was forced to live in exile after his refusal to sign an agreement with the Dutch that was intended to totally limit his powers.]]
On 18 May 1905, the Dutch demanded a new agreement with the sultan, stipulating further limits on the powers of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, requiring that the [[Dutch flag]] must be raised higher than the flag of Riau, and specifying that Dutch officials should be given supreme honour in the land. The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere ''achazat'' (Dutch: loan){{clarify|reason=no source traceable for this word or meaning in Dutch|date=February 2017}} from the Dutch Government. The agreement was drawn up due to the fact that the appointment of Sultan Abdul Rahman II (1885–1911) had not been made with the consent of the Dutch and he was also clearly against colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbtanjungpinang/2014/06/08/sejarah-kerajaan-riau-lingga-kepulauan-riau/ |title=Sejarah Kerajaan Riau-Lingga Kepulauan Riau |publisher=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Tanjung Pinang, [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]] |language=Indonesian |date=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch insisted that the sultan sign the agreement, but after consulting the fellow rulers of the state, Engku Kelana, Raja Ali, Raja Hitam and other members of the ruling elite, he refused, and decided to form a military regiment under the leadership of the prince regent, Tengku Umar. During a visit of the Dutch Resident's visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the emirs (local Malay rulers) of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being besieged by the sultanate. The affiliates of the Roesidijah Klub, mainly the members of the administrative class, were thus able to slowly maneuvere Abdul Rahman, once a supporter of Dutch rule, to act against the colonial power's wishes.

[[File:1 Tijd godsdienstig-staatkundig-dagblad 11-feb-1911.jpg|thumb|The dissolution of the sultanate as reported in Rotterdam's [[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant]] on 19 February 1911.]]
The bold resolution shown by the sultan and fellow officials was not welcomed by the Dutch. According to the journal kept by the ''Syahbandar'' ([[Harbourmaster]]), the decision of the sultan was deplored by the Dutch Resident, [[Frans de Bruijn Kops|G.F Bruijn Kops]] who stated "they molded the sultan to retaliate (against the Dutch), so a retaliation (by the Dutch) shall be administered".

On the morning of 11 February 1911, when the sultan and the court officials were in Daik to perform the ''[[Bathing#Types of baths|Mandi]] Safar'' (a ritual purifying bath), Dutch [[Naval ships]] of Java, Tromp and Koetai [[Torpedo Boat]] anchored in Penyengat Island and deployed hundreds of ''marechausse'' (Dutch: [[pribumi]] soldiers) to lay siege to the royal court. This was followed by the arrival of Dutch official K.M Voematra from Tanjung Pinang at the Roesidijah Club headquarters to announce the deposition of Abdul Rahman II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://batampos.co.id/05-11-2014/meneroka-peran-cendekiawan-kerajaan-riau-lingga-dalam-menentang-belanda-3-habis/ |title=Meneroka Peran Cendekiawan Kerajaan Riau-Lingga dalam Menentang Belanda (3) |publisher=Batampos.co.id|location=[[Batam]] |language=Indonesian |date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the letter of deposition had been read by the Dutch official, he described the crown prince and other members of the Roesidijah Klub as ''"sebagai orang berniat bermusuhan dengan Sri Padoeka Gouvenrnement Hindia Nederland"'' (individuals who harbour animosity against his excellency the Governor of Netherlands Indies).

The Dutch then seized the official coronation regalia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/72410/riau-lingga-dan-politik-kontrak-belanda-1905-1911/ |title=Riau-Lingga dan politik kontrak belanda 1905-1911/ |publisher=TanjungPinangPos|location=[[Tanjung Pinang]] |language=Indonesian |date=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to prevent their seizure by the Dutch, many official buildings were deliberately razed by members of the court themselves. A mass exodus of civilians and officials to [[Johor]] and Singapore then took place.To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and  ''Tengku Ampuan'' (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel ''Sri Daik'', while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Riau 1911.jpg|thumb|The ''Datuk Kaya'' or local Malay rulers of ''Poelau Toedjoeh'' ([[Tudjuh Archipelago]]) with G.F Bruijn Kops, the Dutch Resident of Riouw. Taken in Tanjung Pinang, a week after the abdication of the Sultan (1911).]]
The Dutch officially [[Annexation|annexed]] the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. ''Rechtreek bestuur'' (Dutch: Direct rule) over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden'' (Dutch: Residence of Riau and Dependencies). The Dutch Residence comprised Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, Riau and Indragiri, while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as "Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh" (Dutch: The Division of Pulau Tudjuh).&lt;ref name="hubert-herald1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm |title=Riau |publisher=Hubert de Vries |location=[[Amsterdam]] |language= |date= 11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sultan appealed to the British administration for aid, but although he was given refuge and protection in Singapore, the British were reluctant to interfere. Diplomatic missions were sent to the [[Empire of Japan]] by Raja Khalid Hitam in 1911 and to the Ottoman Empire by Raja Ali Kelana in 1913 to call for the restoration of the sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2004&amp;dt=0712&amp;pub=utusan_malaysia&amp;sec=bicara_agama&amp;pg=ba_01.htm&amp;arc=hive |title=Raja Ali Kelana - Ulama pejuang Riau dan Johor|publisher=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |location=[[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] |language=Malay |date= 12 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point the sultan even wanted to abdicate in favour of his son, Tengku Besar, as these diplomatic initiatives seemed to be in vain. The sultan died in Singapore in 1930. Several members of the royal family later asserted their claim to be recognised as the sultan.

===Restoration attempts and the Dewan Riow===
When [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. This led the British to consider creating a [[buffer state]] in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in [[Terengganu]]. However, as the war approached [[Southeast Asia]], the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and the British decided to shelve the restoration plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalark.net/Indonesia/lingga.htm |title=Lingga-The Bendahara Dynasty |publisher=The Royal Arc |location= |language=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kliping-Koran-Tentang-Gerakan-Sultan-Riau.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Straits Times]], dated 11 December 1947 on the establishment of Riouw Raad, with Tengku Ibrahim (left) to be crowned as the sultan if the sultanate were to be revived. Seen in right was his grandfather, the late Sultan Abdul Rahman II.]]In the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'' (PMRS) (Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays) emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay émigrés and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for [[self-governance]] in the region with the foundation of the ''Dewan Riouw'' (Dutch: Riouw Raad, English: Riouw Council). The Riouw Raad was the [[devolved]] national [[unicameral]] legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a [[Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/ |title=Gerakan Sultan Riau |publisher=Tanjung Pinang Post |location= Tanjung Pinang |language= Indonesian|date= 9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], [[Great Karimun]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Singkep]]. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded.

[[File:Anggota-Riouw-Raad-Sementara-1947.jpg|thumb|right|The Riouw Raad building with Encik Mohamad Apan (middle, don under a [[peci]]) the temporary leader of the council, with other members of the Riouw Raad during the appointment of the Provincial Resident on 4 August 1947.]]
The royalist association met with resistance from the [[Republicanism|republican]] group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minangkabaus]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Batak people|Bataknese]], [[Palembang|Palembagese]], [[Indian Indonesian|Indians]] and [[Arab Indonesian|Arabs]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Soekarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.

The royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it.

[[File:Flag of Various Autonomous Indonesian States.svg|thumb|left|The flag of ''Federasi Bangka Belitung dan Riau'' (Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation), an autonomous territory under Dutch rule in [[United States of Indonesia]] until 1950.]]
The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous rule]] to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The Council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the [[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]] from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation''.

The call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] following the absorption by the [[United States of Indonesia]]. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.

The leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt. The [[geopolitical|geopolitical roots]] of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred [[Monarchism|monarchist]] Peninsular [[Ethnic Malays#Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalism]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the [[Republicanism|pro-republic]] and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own [[Dutch East Indies]] domain.

==Government==
[[File:Abdul Rahman II.jpg|thumb|right|A picture Sultan Abdul Rahman II (1890-1911) shows him with a headdress with a crescent and five-pointed star from which a lily-shaped ornament rises. The crescent and star symbolise "Head of State" as the crescent is the Islamic emblem of state, and the star the emblem of a (Muslim) ruler.&lt;ref name="hubert-herald1"/&gt;]]
The Riau Sultanate had an unusual division of authority at its heart.  The Sultan, who was a Malay, acted as [[Head of State]] while the ''Dipertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda'' (deputy ruler or Viceroy), a position held by the [[Bugis]] ruling elite, served as the [[Head of Government]]. (Following the partition of Johor-Riau, the position of Yang Dipertuan Muda was retained only in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate and not in Johor). The sultan's royal palace was located in Penyengat Inderasakti and the Yang Dipertuan Muda resided in Daik, Lingga. The Sultan was dominant in Lingga and its dependencies, while the Bugis Yang Dipertuan Muda controlled Riau (consisting of Bintan, Penyengat and the surrounding islands), with each of them having no claim on the revenues of the other. These spheres of control would only begin to erode during the time of Yang Dipertuan Muda Yusuf Ahmadi.

Riau later became the heart of Bugis political influence in the western [[Malay World]]. It should be noted that however, the power division between the Malay and the Bugis was not met without any major dispute between the two houses.{{clarify|reason=sentence contains a double negative, so not clear whether it means 'the division did not cause any major dispute' or whether it means 'the division was only achieved after major disputes'|date=February 2017}}

===Adat===
[[File:Mohor YDM Raja Abdullah.jpg|thumb|right|''Onderkoning Van Riau'' (Dutch: Viceroy of Riau) inscribed on the ''mohor'' (royal seal) of Yang Dipertuan Muda Abdullah, the XI Yang Dipertuan Muda of Riau Lingga (1857–8). In a fusion of [[Arab language|Arab]]-[[Malay language|Malay]] written in [[Jawi script]] the seal also bears the inscription ''Al Watik Baladun Al Aziz Al Ghaffar Sultan Alauddin Syah Ibni Al Marhum Raja Jaafar 1273-Hijrah'' (lit: the trusted governor, the powerful, the protector, Sultan Alauddin Syah Ibni Al Marhum Raja Jaafar, Year 1273 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (1856[[Gregorian calendar|AD]])]]
The [[adat|adat istiadat]] (custom) called for a [[separation of powers]] and a [[pledge of allegiance]] called ''Persetiaan Sungai Baru'' (The Oath of Sungai Baru) sworn between the Bugis and the Malays and renewed for five times between 1722-1858. Under the adat, only Malays could be Sultan and the position of the Yang Dipertuan Muda was reserved exclusively to the Bugis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjurnal.my/filebank/published_article/22932/082_090.PDF |title=Johor dan Kepulauan Riau: Berlainan negara tetapi tetap bersaudara|publisher=Abdullah Zakaria bin Ghazali |location=[[Malaysia]] |language=Malay |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional system was retained until the appointment of Abdul Rahman II, the last sultan of Riau-Lingga. Abdul Rahman's father, Raja Muhammad Yusuf, was a Bugis aristocrat and the 10th and the last Yang Dipertuan Muda of Riau. He was married to Tengku Fatimah, the daughter of Sultan Mahmud and the only full-blooded member of the Malay royalty.

On 17 September 1883, in wake of the death of Badrul Alam Syah II, the Bugis-Malay elites voted for Tengku Fatimah as his successor, making her the first [[queen regnant]] in the history of the empire since the [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malaccan]] period. Nearly a month later, on 13 October, another gathering was convened, and on this occasion Abdul Rahman II, was crowned as the new sultan after Tengku Fatimah voluntarily abdicated in favour of her son.

Unusually, because of his parentage, Abdul Rahman II was both sultan and first in line of succession to the Yang Dipertuan Muda position as well. 1895 was the last occasion the pledge of allegiance was sworn, in this instance between the sultan and his father, the last Yang Dipertuan Muda. His father later renounced his position as the Yang Dipertuan Muda and thereafter both roles were combined, symbolising of unity between the Bugis and the Malay dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/67087/silsilah-politik-dalam-sejarah-johor-riau-lingga-pahang-1722-1784/ |title=Silsilah Politik dalam Sejarah Johor-Riau-Lingga-Pahang 1722-1784|publisher=Aswandi Syahri |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language=Malay, Indonesian |date= 11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pledge of allegiance included the following words:

===Yang Dipertuan Muda===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bezoek van de resident van Riouw aan de Sultan van Lingga Riouw TMnr 60029915.jpg|thumb|right|The Dutch Resident with the Sultan. (1890-1910)]]
The [[Viceroy|viceregal house]] of Riau claimed to trace their ancestry from the [[Bugis]] Royal House in [[Luwu]], [[Celebes]]. The Bugis prominence in the region began during the reign of Abdu'l-Jalil Rahmat of Johor-Riau, during the period of turbulence the Sultan was killed by Raja Kecil who claimed that he was an offspring of the late Sultan Mahmud. He later descent as the Sultan of old Johor. The death of Abdul Jalil was witnessed by his son, Sulaiman of Johor-Riau, who later then requested aid from the Bugis of [[Klang (city)|Klang]] to combat Raja Kecil and his troops. The alliance formed between Sulaiman and the Bugis managed to defeat Raja Kecil off from his throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://multikulturalui.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/prosiding-simg-ui-2012-jilid-1-11.pdf |title=Malay-Bugis in the Johor-Riau and Riau-Lingga Kingdoms |publisher=Dedi Zuraidi |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language=Indonesian|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the settlement for the debt of honour by Sulaiman of Johor-Riau in 1772, a joint government were structured between the Bugis incomer and the native Malays and several [[political marriage]] were formed between the two dynasties. The Bugis chieftain were awarned with the titles of Yang di-Pertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda (deputy ruler or Viceroy) and Raja Tua (principal prince), receiving the second and third paramount seat in the sultanate. Although the latter title became obsolete, the position of Yang Dipertuan Muda dominated until the reformation that merged the sovereignty of the two Royal houses in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalark.net/Indonesia/riau.htm |title=Riau-The Vice Regal or Bugis Dynasty |publisher=The Royal Arc |location= |language=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yang Dipertuan Muda possessed a [[de facto]] prerogative powers exceeding that of the sultan himself. Despite the fact his function under the law was second highest in the office, nonetheless in practice he can over-ruled the sultan. This is strongly evident during the rule of Sultan Abdul Rahman II when Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar is perceived to be dominant when he acted as the regent of the sultanate. Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar is responsible for the crowning of Abdul Rahman and highly influential during the negotiation with the Dutch and English powers during the succession dispute between Tengku Hussein and Tengku Abdul Rahman.

===Resident===
For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] authority. Albeit he is [[de jure]] on the apex of the monarchy system, he is under the direct control of the Dutch Resident in [[Tanjung Pinang]]. All matters pertaining the administration of the sultanate including the appointment of the Sultan and the Yang Dipertuan Muda, must be made within the knowledge and even the consent of the Dutch Resident.

==Territory==
Following the partition of Johor and the relinquishing of rights over the [[Malay peninsular|mainland peninsular]], the sultanate was effectively a maritime state. The Riau Sultanate's dominions encompassed the [[Riau archipelago|Riau]], [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]] and [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], including [[Batam]], [[Rempang]], [[Galang Island|Galang]], [[Bintan]], [[Combol]], [[Kundur Island|Kundur]], [[Karimun Regency|Karimun]], [[Bunguran Islands|Bunguran]], [[Lingga Island|Lingga]], [[Singkep]], [[Badas Islands|Badas]], [[Tambelan]], [[Natuna]], [[Anambas]] and many smaller islands. There were also several territories in Igal, Gaung, Reteh and Mandah located in [[Indragiri Hilir Regency|Indragiri]] on mainland [[Sumatra]]. All these territories were headed by a ''Datuk Kaya'' (nobleman), known as an [[Emir|Amir]] (equivalent to a [[Viscount]]) who had been chosen by the sultan or by the ruling elite to deal with the local administration.

==Foreign relations and trade==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indamming van de groeve Sultan Singkep Tin Maatschappij Riouw TMnr 10007347.jpg|thumb|A [[tin mine]] belonging to the Sultan in Singkep.]]
There were two main economic and commercial sources of wealth in Riau-Lingga, spices (especially peppers) and [[tin]]. The Dutch monopolised the trade system in the Riau archipelago even before the partition of 1824, and were keen to control the region after gaining influence following the Dutch-Johor-Riau agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/history/dig/35 |title=Kesultanan Riau-Lingga |publisher=Balai Melayu |location= [[Yogyakarta]] |language= Indonesian|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch===
One of the most prominent battles during the Riau-Dutch wars was between Raja Haji and the Dutch militia. The fight against the Dutch, led by Raja Haji in Tanjung Pinang, managed to prevent the Dutch force from advancing on Malacca. In June 1784, Raja Haji was killed in Teluk Ketapang and was posthumously known was "Marhum Teluk Ketapang". After his death, in November 1784, the Dutch entered into an agreement with Mahmud Syah of the Johor-Riau Sultanate. The agreement contained 14 clauses which proved to be detrimental to the Johor-Riau Sultanate. For instance, the Dutch were free to engage in commerce in the kingdom and were permitted to open their own [[trade post]] in Tanjung Pinang. Every passing ship in the region had to obtain consent from the Dutch and only the Dutch could bring the ores and spices.

===British===
Dutch dominance began to wane when the [[Dutch East India Company]] went bankrupt in 1799. The British influence then started to supersede the Dutch in the region. In contrast to the Dutch, the British followed a more moderate approach in engaging with the Johor-Riau Empire. Apart from controlling Malacca in 1795, the British recognised the Johor-Riau Sultanate as a [[sovereign state]]. The British were free to engage in commercial activities with the Riau traders without any major economic burden on them. The commercial ties between the Johor-Riau sultanate and the British were initially secret before being disclosed openly later on.

===Ottomans===
[[File:Riouw Stamps.gif|thumb|Japanese stamps issued in Tandjoengpinang, Riow in 1943. The territory was occupied by [[Imperial Japan]] during World War II, with its [[Territorial principle|territorial jurisdiction]] incorporated into [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Malaya]].]]
Observing the rise of the Islamic Brotherhood that gained momentum in the late 18th century, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate regarded the [[Ottoman Empire]] as a protector against non-Muslim colonial powers. In the eyes of the ruling elite of the court, the Ottomans were a source of inspiration and a balancing power between the western powers and Islamic world. The [[Crimean War]] fought by the Ottomans was regarded as a struggle of a "Muslim power" against the "Foreigners", Christians, which to a degree corresponded with the struggle faced in Riau-Lingga.

The status of the [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh Sultanate]] as a vassal of the Ottomans, provided a vital precedent for the Riau-Lingga following the deteriorating relationship with the Dutch. The court discussed a possibility to receiving the same status and protection under the Ottomans with the Ottoman consulate-general in Batavia in 1897-1899 Muhammad Kamil Bey. A diplomatic mission embarked in October 1904 under Raja Ali Kelana with the necessary documents, letter and treaties. Nevertheless, in view of the weakening domestic situation in the Ottoman Empire, the Riau case failed to gain any interest by the Ottomans.

===Japan===
The meteoric rise of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] as a [[Superpower|global superpower]] in the 19th century was also viewed with awe and hope by the Riau people. Following the demise of the sultanate in 1911, the officials of Riau began to seek help for the restoration of the sultanate - this was part of the [[Pan-Asianism]] movement against the Europeans. In October 1912, a letter requesting an intervention from the [[Japanese Emperor]] was sent. The deposed Sultan Abdul Rahman sought to become a Japanese vassal state following restoration of the sultanate. Raja Khalid Hitam was then delegated to lead a diplomatic mission. Upon his arrival in Tokyo, he resided temporarily with Encik Ahmad, a Penyengat-born Malay academic who taught at the [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies|Tokyo School of Foreign Languages]]. However, after his arrival, the Dutch Consul-General in Tokyo left the country and travelled to Singapore, resulting in the failure of the mission.

A second diplomatic mission was sent in June 1914, but this also failed. The health of Raja Khalid Hitam was deteriorating, and he died after a brief hospitalisation in Japan.

==Society==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Riau op Sumatra TMnr 3728-852.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pulau Penyengat]] (Lit: Wasp island), lithography of an original watercolour by J.C. Rappard. ca. 1883–1889. Initially founded as a royal dowry for Engku Puteri Hamidah, by the late 19th century, it was known as Penyengat Inderasakti. The latter was derived from ''Indera'' (Royal) and ''Sakti'' (Divination) respectively.]] 
The opening of [[stannary]] towns in [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], [[Kundur Island|Kundur]] and [[Singkep]] by 1801 proved brought prosperity to the Riau Islands. During this time Pulau Penyengat was established as a royal settlement in 1804. It was initially founded as a royal [[dowry]] for Engku Puteri, a Johor-Riau aristocrat of Bugis lineage who returned to the island from the [[Mempawah Regency|Mempawah Sultanate]] in [[West Kalimantan|western Borneo]]. She became the fourth wife of Sultan Mahmud Syah and Queen Consort of the Johor-Riau Sultanate.

Penyengat was later developed as the seat for the Yang Dipertuan Muda. A palace, ''balai'' (audience hall), mosque and fortification were constructed on the island, presumably to resolve the dispute between the Malays and the Bugis. He expressly bequeathed the island to Raja Hamidah and the descendants of Raja Haji (her late father who previously won the war against the Dutch). The sultan then separated his kingdom into Malay and Bugis spheres. He decided that the Bugis Yang Dipertuan Muda would govern Riau (the islands of Bintan, Penyengat and their dependencies) while the Malay Sultan would administer Lingga and its dependencies, with each having no claim with the respective revenues of the other. Though the island personally belonged to Engku Puteri Hamidah, it was administered by her brother, Raja Jaafar (the Yang Dipertuan Muda) and later by his descendants. The effective division of the state by the sultan afforded an unprecedented opportunity for Raja Jaafar to develop Penyengat as the heart of the kingdom. Penyengat, situated in the middle of the maritime trade and commercial routes of the Malay World, soon become a key Malay literary and cultural centre in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klikweb.dbp.my/wordpress/?p=2262 |title=Raja Ali Haji Pencatat Sejarah Nusantara yang Pertama |publisher=[[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] |location= [[Kuala Lumpur]] |language= Malay|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbtanjungpinang/2014/06/06/sejarah-percetakan-dan-penerbitan-di-riau-abad-ke-19-20/ |title=Sejarah Percetakan dan Penerbitan di Riau Abad ke-19-20 |publisher=Balai Pelestarian Budaya Tanjung Pinang |location= [[Tanjung Pinang]] |language= Indonesian|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{see also|Malay Islamic identity}}
[[File:2 Mushaf-Kerejaan-Riau-Lingga-dengan-iluminasi-gata-Pantai-Timur-Semenanjun-koleksi-Museum-Linggam-Cahaya-Daik-Lingga.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Mus'haf]] of the [[Quran]] dating from the Riau-Lingga Sultanate period, with [[Peninsular Malaysia#East Coast and West Coast|East coast Malay Peninsular]] styled gloss finish.]]
Inspired to elevate the [[Islamic state|status]] of [[Islam]] to a greater height in Riau-Lingga, Raja Jaafar begun to invite religious clerics and scholars to the palace court. The [[Islamisation]] process begun to accelerate during the time of his successor, Raja Ali. Adhering to a stricter interpretation of the Quran, Raja Ali began to promulgate Islamic law and custom into the region. During his rule, the [[Naqshbandi]] order gained prominence in Penyengat, with all the princes and court officials required to study areligion, [[Sufism]] and improve their [[Quran reading|Quranic recitation]]. The Dutch described the Bugis Yang Dipertuan Mudas and his family as fanatical Muslims, narrowly focused on the Islamic studies.

Raja Ali adhered to the view of [[Al-Ghazali]] about the business of government, adopting the theory of the bond between a ruler and religion. Reforms were instituted and [[gambling]], [[cockfighting]], the mixing of [[single person|unmarried]] men and women and the wearing of gold or silk are all forbidden, and women are required to be [[Hijab|veil]]ed. Pirates and evildoers were severely punished and the miscreants exiled. The public were all required to perform the five [[Salat|obligatory prayers]], with a special dawn watch constituted to ensure the people rose for the ''subuh'' ([[fajr]]) prayer. This was continued during the rule of Raja Abdullah, who was equally a devoted member of the Sufi order.

The role of the [[imam]] in Riau-Lingga was regarded as authoritative concerning the matters of [[Islamic law]], as much as the respective roles of the Sultan and Yang Dipertuan Muda under the pledge of allegiance. The administration adhered to the separation of powers between the imam, the sultan and the [[ulema]], each acting within their own function to create an Islamic state.

Riau was hailed at the time as the ''Serambi Mekah'' (Gateway to Mecca) and the people of Riau would visit Penyengat before embarking on their Hajj pilgrimage to the Muslim holy land. The [[mosque]] was the centerpiece of the society, not solely as a religious centre, but also for scholarship, law and administration offices. The mosque, located opposite of the Dutch administrative centre of Tanjung Pinang, stood for the strength of the Yang Dipertuan Mudas through their devotion to Islam.

===Malayness===
{{see also|Malayisation}}
[[File:Gurindam 12.jpg|thumb|right|A manuscript of ''Gurindam 12'', a morale and religious guidance originally written in [[Jawi script]], completed in 1264[[Islamic calendar|AH]] (1847AD). ]]
By the mid 19th century, the Bugis Yang Dipertuan Mudas began to perceive themselves as guardians of a quintessential Malay culture, while at the same time the Bugis language and customs within the [[diaspora]] community in Riau-Lingga gradually declined after being largely [[Malayisation|Malayised]] over several generations. Several customary practices and did survive however, for instance the revered position of women in society and the close affinity of kinship based on their common Bugis ancestry and heritage.

A prominent advocate of the [[Malay culture]] in Riau-Lingga was Raja Ali Haji, of Bugis-Malay extraction himself. He stressed the responsibility to preserve the Malay culture in society while the customs of the [[European culture|west]] and the [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] were not to be duplicated. He further emphasised attention to the Malay language and how it should not be misappropriated by European use of the language.

Raja Ali believed that abandoning the Malay traditions would destroy of the world order and the ''Kerajaan'' ([[Monarchy|Kingdom]]), while adopting western and Chinese [[dress code]] would be tantamount to betrayal of [[Malayness]]. Raja Ali did not favour a forced compulsion of Malayness, but an appeal to maintain tradition in order to achieve harmony between man and man, man and ruler and man and [[Allah]]. The situation in Johor and Singapore differed to some extent from Riau-Lingga Sultanate, and many acts and habits of the rather ''[[westernised]]'' Malays there were frowned upon by officials in Riau.

===Roesidijah (Club) Riouw===
[[File:Ali Haji of Riau Lingga.jpg|thumb|left|Ali Haji (1808-1873) was credited to be the author of the first Malay [[dictionary]], this would later form the basis of the Indonesian language.]]
Cultural progress during the era was also attributed to an intellectual circle known as the Roesidijah (Club) Riouw or Rusydiah Klub Riau, formed in 1895. The club was inspired by the ''Jam’iyah al-Fathaniyyah'', founded by Malay intellectuals including Syekh Ahmad al-Fathani in [[Mecca]] in 1873. The association was earlier known as the ''Jam’iyah ar-Rusydiyah'', which later renamed itself as Rusydiah Klub Riau or Roesidijah (Club) Riouw.

The name was derived from the [[Arab language|Arabic word]] "Roesidijah", meaning intellectuals and "Club" from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] which literary translated as a gathering. The significance of the Arabic element in name of the organisation was the fact that the members of the group were mainly well-versed in Arabic, as Middle eastern countries were a preferred destination for Malays for furthering their studies during this time. The Dutch element in the name illustrated that the association was progressive, open to development and change.

The association was the first modern association in the Dutch East Indies. It played a major role in supporting intellectuals, artist, writers, poets and philosophers in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, aiming to facilitate the development of arts, theatre, live performance and literature. The organisation took part in the major religious celebrations in Riau-Lingga, [[Isra and Mi'raj]], [[Mawlid]], [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Muhammad's first revelation|Nuzul Quran]]. The association also organised Islamic debates and intellectual discourses, so unsurprisingly it developed into an anti-colonial movement later in its history. The development of the association was backed by several main sources - sponsorship by the sultanate, 'publishing houses such as 'Mathba‘at al Ahmadiah'' (for literature) and ''Mathba at al Riauwiyah'' (for government gazettes) and the establishment ''Kutub Kanah Marhum Ahmadi'' library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760/Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |title=Kebudayaan Melayu Riau|publisher=Pahlevi Annisa |location= [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rajaalihaji.com/id/article.php?a=Y2lIL3c%3D= |title=Naskah Kuno di Riau dan Cendekiawan Melayu|publisher=Balai Melayu |location= [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary culture of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate began to stall after 1913, when the Dutch dissolved the monarchy, resulting in an exodus of Malay elites and intellectuals to Singapore and Johor.

==Literature==
[[File:Raja-aisyah.jpg|thumb|left|Raja Aisyah Sulaiman completed her first work, ''Hikayat Syamsul Anwar'' in 1890. The [[hikayat]] was one of the earliest pieces of [[feminist literature]] published in the Malay world. (image was taken in 1911)]]
A prominent figure in [[Malay literature]] in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was [[Raja Ali Haji|Ali Haji of Riau]], born in [[Selangor]] and raised in the Royal Court in Penyengat. He was celebrated as a prolific author, poet, historian, legal jurist and linguist. Some of his works are considered the ''Magna opera'' of the Malay literature, including [[Tuhfat al-Nafis]] ("the Precious Gift"), ''Kitab Pengetahuan Bahasa'' ("Book of Language") — the first dictionary in Malay and ''[[Gurindam]] dua belas'' ("The Twelve Gurindams"). His works played a vital role in the development of the Malay language. He spent most of his life writing and researching the Malay language, history, culture and law.

The literary culture that flourished in Penyengat was acknowledged by the Johor delegation during their visit in 1868. 19th century Riau was marked by various publications of [[Romanticism#Romantic literature|romantic]] and [[Literary realism|realist]] modes of Malay [[hikayat]]s, [[pantun]]s, [[gurindam]]s, [[syair]]s, poetry, historical and literary works by a generation of male and female writers and poets, paving the way for the development of Malay literary culture. Literature was not solely regarded as a source of entertainment, but also a source of mental stimulation and religious solace.

Raja Aisyah's ''Hikayat Syamsul Anwar'', completed in 1890, was perhaps one earliest testaments of [[feminism]] to be found in Malay literature: it describes the secret life of ''Badrul Muin'', a heroine who [[Cross-dressing|disguises]] herself as a male. The story illustrates that a woman can achieve a same level with a man. While her subsequent work, ''Syair Khadamuddin'' depicting the grief of its heroine Sabariah after the death of her husband at the hands of the pirates, it was presumed that the work was a semi-autobiographical account, following the death of her husband Raja Khalid Hitam in Japan, with the pirates being a metaphor for a foreign land.

Raja Ali Kelana's works in Riau-Lingga included ''Pohon Perhimpunan Pada Menyatakan Peri Perjalanan'' (1899) (a narration of his trip to the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] between February and March 1896); Perhimpunan Plakat (1900) (a report on his journey to the Middle East) and ''Kitab Kumpulan Ringkas'' (1910) (a religious and psychological guide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2015/111827/bapak-jurnalistik-indonesia/ |title=Bapak Jurnalistik Indonesia|publisher=Tanjungpinangpos.id |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pulau Penyengat 4.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Masjid Raya'' (Grand Mosque), built in 1803, is part of the legacy of the sultanate that can be found in Penyengat Inderasakti. The mosque was a home for the Kutub Kanah Marhum Ahmadi, an Islamic library.]]
A major figure for the literary culture in Pulau Penyengat was Muhammad Yusof Ahmadi, the 10th Yang Dipertuan Muda of Riau. He was a member of the [[Naqshbandi]], a major [[sufi]] [[tariqa]]. He stressed the importance of religion and knowledge through literature. He considered that a Muslim must be equipped with theological wisdom before performing his or her Islamic obligations. Without knowledge, in his view, all the duties of a Muslim would be in vain. He further stressed that knowledge and literature are kin to one another, literature born of the thirst for knowledge, and knowledge transfused by literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunawanmalay.com/2014/05/kutub-khanah-marhum-ahmadi-pustaka.html |title=Kutub Khanah Marhum Ahmadi, Pustaka Islam Pertama di Asia Tenggara|publisher=Gunawan Malay |location= [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the ''Kutub Khanah Yamtuan Ahmadi'' in 1866, the first Islamic library of its kind in the Malay world. The library collection was bought by Muhammad Yusof from the [[India]], [[Cairo]], Mecca and [[Medina]] costing him 10,000 Ringgits (Spanish Coins). A major part of the collection was devoted to Islamic theological studies. The library was located at the Penyengat Grand Mosque, so the collections were readily accessible to the traders, visitors and devotees of the mosque. Following his death, the library was renamed ''Kutub Khanah Marhum Ahmadi''.

===Publishing Houses===
[[File:Al-Ahmadiah Press Singapore.jpg|thumb|left|The Al-Ahmadiah Press in Singapore, a legacy of its predecessor from Riau-Lingga. (1925)]]
The history of printing in Riau-Lingga began when the sultanate established the ''Rumah Cap Kerajaan'' publishing house in Lingga in around 1885. The printing house published its materials using the [[Lithography]] technique, printed mostly in [[Jawi script]] and occasionally in [[Rumi script]]. Several major works were printed in this house during that period, including ''Muqaddimah fi Intidzam'' (a critical examination of the duty of the leader to his subjects and religion) in 1886, ''Tsamarat al-muhimmah'' (on law, administration of justice and statecraft) in 1886, Undang-Undang Lima Pasal (Code of Laws), and Qanun Kerajaan Riau-Lingga (Code of Laws) all written by [[Raja Ali Haji]]. In addition to Raja Ali Haji, the publishing house also published the works of [[Munshi Abdullah]], the father of modern Malay literature.

In 1894, Raja Muhammad Yusuf al Ahmadi the 10th Yang Dipertuan Muda founded another publishing house in Penyengat. It used two distinctive imprints, Mathaba'at al Ahmadiah for non-government publications and Mathaba'at al Riauwiyah for official government-related publications. The Mathaba'at al Ahmadiah mainly engaged with [[general knowledge]], [[Islamic literature]] and [[translation]] works, including ''Makna Tahyat'' (Definition of the [[Tashahhud]]), ''Syair Perjalanan Sultan Lingga ke Johor'' (The journey of Sultan of Lingga to Johore) and ''Gema Mestika Alam'' (Echoes of the Universe). Among the works published by the Mathaba'at al Riauwiyah were Faruk Al-Makmur (the Laws of Riau) and Pohon Perhimpunan (The journey of Raja Ali Kelana to Tudjuh Archipelago).

All the publications of Al Ahmadiah and Riauwiyah were written in Jawi script, with the sole exception of ''Rumah Obat'' (a [[Public health journal|Medical Journal]]) by R.H Ahmad, a [[physician]]. The journal was written in Rumi in its title in 1894. This marked the increasing influence of Rumi script by the end of the 19th century. Nonetheless, Riau intellectuals during that period wanted the Jawi script preserved and maintained especially in matters of religion and culture.

Following the dissolution of the sultanate in 1911, Riau intellectuals headed north to Singapore and Johore. They re-established the Mathaba'at al Ahmadiah in Singapore to continue their printing activities, and they would distribute materials on general knowledge and Islamic literature for free to act against the Dutch occupation on their homeland. The publishing house was renamed the Al-Ahmadiah Press in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=siCbq4B4lP0C&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=Mathaba%27at+al+Ahmadiah+riau&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4yrVc8V-mI&amp;sig=xb5eNIH4Sv4Bm9hhFk8mGif4Tuc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eO0vVc_lD5SauQTUyICgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathaba'at%20al%20Ahmadiah%20riau&amp;f=false |title=Kemunculan Novel dalam Sastera Moden Indonesia dan Malaysia|publisher=A.

==Culture==
[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|right|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget|Joget Lambak]]. (taken in the late 19th century) ]]
As well as being celebrated for its literary contributions, the Riau-Lingga palace court was also known for the passion of its musical tradition. Musical performance was enjoyed as a form of entertainment by both the palace and commoners alike. With the coming of the Dutch, European influence on musical traditions slowly made their way into the court, as evidenced by the introduction of instruments such as the [[violin]] and [[tambur]] from the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Tanjungpinangpos.id"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/55923/muzik-cara-holanda-dan-istana-riau-lingga-1805-1911/ |title=Muzik cara holanda dan istana riau lingga 1805 1911|publisher=Tanjungpinangpos.id |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the Western instruments to the royal court can be traced to the arrival of Raja Jaafar, the Yang Dipertuan Muda of Riau-Lingga. Prior to his installation, he was a [[Klang (city)|Klang]]-based merchant from Selangor who gained prominence because of the tin trade. He came to Riau at the invitation of Mahmud III of Johor upon the demise of Raja Aji. After his installation, he constructed a palace and due to his love for music, he became a pioneer of western music in the kingdom. Adopting [[martial music]] as practised in the west, he sent several young men of Riau to [[Malacca]] to train with the Dutch on western instruments such as the violin, [[trumpet]] and [[flute]].

One of the earliest accounts of the musical tradition of the royal court was left by [[Johan van Angelbeek|C. Van Angelbeek]], a Dutch official.  During his visit to Daik, he observed that the ''Tarian Ronggeng'' ([[Ronggeng]] dance) was staged in the palace court, while the [[suling]] and [[rebab]] were the favourites among the locals. His report was published in Batavia in 1829.

===Gamelan Melayu===
Among other prominent ensembles of the palace court was the ''Tarian Gamelan'' ([[Malay Gamelan]] dance). The Malay Gamelan performance is believed to trace its origin to the Johor-Riau palace court as early as the 17th century. It was recorded that a Gamelan ensemble was invited from Pulau Penyengat to perform in Pahang in 1811 for the royal wedding of Tengku Hussein of Johor-Riau and Wan Esah, a [[Pahang]]ite aristocrat. The dance was performed for the first time in public during the royal wedding in [[Pekan District|Pekan]], Pahang. This marked the birth of Joget Pahang and the spread of Tarian Gamelan in the [[Malay Peninsula]].

===Mak Yong===
The history of [[Mak Yong]], a dance and theatrical performance, which gained prominence in the royal court of Riau-Lingga, began in 1780, when two men from Mantang, Encik Awang Keladi and Encik Awang Durte went to [[Kelantan]] for their marriage. They returned south and settled in [[Pulau Tekong]] (now in Singapore) after their weddings, telling the locals about their experience witnessing the Mak Yong performance in Kelantan. Enthused by their tale, the people of Pulau Tekong went to Kelantan to learn about the theater performance. Ten years later, the first Mak Yong performance was staged in Riau-Lingga.

The news was then received by Sultan Mahmud Shah III. Attracted by the story, he invited the performers to the palace court. It was not long before Mak Yong become a staple in the dance court of Johor-Riau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2011/15903/makyong-bernafas-di-ujung-tanduk/ |title=Makyong bernafas di hujung tanduk|publisher=Tanjungpinangpos.id |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from entertainment, the Mak Yong ritual also acted as a mystical healing performance. The main feature that set the Mak Yong in Riau apart from aside from that of Kelantan, was that in Riau the performance was enhanced by the use of a ceremonial mask, a feature unknown in Kelantan. The use of ritual masks closely resembles the Mak Yong performances staged in [[Pattani]] and [[Narathiwat]], both located in present-day southern [[Thailand]].

===Royal orchestra===
[[File:Nobat-baru-riau-lingga-1885-yang-kini-masih-dipakai-sebegai-nobat-kerajaan-Terengganu.jpg|thumb|The Nobat that was used for the coronation of Sultan Abdul Rahman II (taken in 1885). The assembly was inherited by the [[Terengganu|Terengganu Sultanate]] and became a vital part of the regalia of the royal house. It was last used during the [[Installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong|installation ceremony]] of [[Mizan Zainal Abidin]] as the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King of Malaysia) on 27 April 2007.]]
The earliest account of the ''Musik Nobat Diraja'' (Royal Orchestra) was in the [[Sulalatus Salatin]] (Malay Annals), which stated that orchestra performances began during the reign of the ancient female ruler of [[Bintan]], Wan Seri Bini, also known as Queen Sakidar Syah, who claimed to have traveled to ''Banua Syam'' (the [[Levant]]). The Nobat was used during the coronation of [[Sang Nila Utama]], the king of [[Kingdom of Singapura|ancient Singapore]]. The usage of the ''Nobat'' then spread to other Malay Royal Houses in the Malay Peninsular, [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Samudera Pasai]] and [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]].

Between 1722 and 1911, the Nobat played during the coronation ceremony of the sultan, and was an instrumental part of the royal regalia as well as a symbol of sovereignty. It could only play on the order of the sultan, in royal ceremonies, with a special troupe of performers, known as Orang Kalur or Orang Kalau.

A new Nobat was commissioned for the coronation of Abdul Rahman II in 1885. It was reported that the Dutch colonial officer succumbed to [[abdominal pain]] each time the old Nobat was playing.  This caused the coronation to be postponed several times, and the pains were widely believed to have been caused by [[supernatural]] forces.  Tengku Embung Fatimah (then [[Queen mother]]) ordered a new Nobat to be made. The new Nobat bore a crest in [[Jawi script]] saying ''Yang Dipertuan Riau dan'' (and) ''Lingga Sanah'', ''tahun'' (year) ''1303''([[Islamic year|AH]]) (1885AD). The new Nobat was used for the coronation of the sultan in 1885 and the old one was never used again. The old Nobat is now stored in Kadil Private Museum, in Tanjung Pinang, while the new one has been inherited by the Royal House of Terengganu.&lt;ref name="Tanjungpinangpos.id"/&gt;

===Royal Brass Band===
[[File:Brass-Band-Sultan-Lingga.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Brass Band with Heer Gunter, the instructor from [[Vienna]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. (c. 1880s, Penyengat Palace.)]]
Western music achieved its greatest popularity during the reign of Sultan Abdul Rahman II. The genre was better known as ''cara Hollandia'' ("the Dutch way"). The seeds of western music which dated from the arrival of Raja Jaafar in 1805 matured and became an integral part of the official ceremonies and [[military parade]] of the palace court by the end of the 19th century Riau.

During this time western composition and playing techniques were adopted, along with instruments such as the trumpet, [[trombone]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]] and European-made drums. Consisting entirely of Malay members, the court brass band was led by Raja Abdulrahman Kecik, the ''Bentara Kanan'' (vice-[[herald]]) of Riau-Lingga Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/56704/muzik-cara-holanda-dan-istana-riau-lingga-1805-1911-2/ |title=Muzik cara holanda dan istana riau lingga 1805 1911|publisher=Tanjungpinangpos.id |location=[[Tanjung Pinang]], [[Indonesia]] |language= Indonesian|date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music was performed during royal [[Ball (dance party)|balls]] or banquets for Dutch visits or visits from other European delegations, usually invitees from Singapore. The [[brass band]] began in the 1880s, not long after Abdul Rahman ascended the throne.  Its performance played a vital role in the celebrations of Crown Prince Yusof when he received the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] from Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] in 1889.

Due to their exclusive nature, being reserved to the nobility of the sultanate, the performances died out along with the band following the dissolution of the sultanate in 1911.

==Legacy==
The sultanate is widely credited in the development of the Malay and Indonesian language, as various books, literary works and dictionary was contributed in the sultanate. These works formed as the backbone of the modern Indonesian language. [[Raja Ali Haji]], was celebrated for his contribution on the language and honoured as the [[National Hero of Indonesia]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/encyclopedia/detail/195/raja-ali-haji|title=Raja Ali Haji |publisher=Balai Melayu|location= [[Yogyakarta]] |language= Indonesian|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Specimens of Bushman Folklore''''' is a book by the [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Wilhelm Bleek|Wilhelm H. I. Bleek]] and [[Lucy Lloyd|Lucy C. Lloyd]], which was published in 1911. The book records eighty-seven legends, myths and other [[folklore|traditional stories]] of the [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] [[San people|Bushmen]] in their [[ǀXam language|now-extinct language]]. The stories were [[folkloristics|collected]] through interviews with various narrators, chief among them ǀA!kunta, ǁKabbo, Diäǃkwain, ǃKweiten ta ǁken and ǀHanǂkasso.

These tales were written down and translated by Bleek and his sister-in-law Lloyd. Bleek died in 1875, but Lloyd continued transcribing ǀXam narratives after his death. It is thanks to her efforts that some of the narratives were eventually published in this book, which also includes sketches of [[rock art]] attributed to the Bushmen people and some [[!Kung language|ǃXun]] narratives.

''Specimens of Bushman Folklore'' has been considered the cornerstone of study of the Bushmen and their religious beliefs. [[Laurens van der Post]] describes the book (and [[Dorothea Bleek]]'s ''Mantis and His Friend'') as "a sort of [[Stone Age]] Bible" in the introduction to ''The Heart of the Hunter'' (1961), a follow-up to ''The Lost World of the Kalahari''.

''Specimens of Bushman Folklore'', as well as the situation of the Bushmen during their disappearance in South Africa and the lives of Bleek and Lloyd, have been covered in a Dutch documentary series called ''The Broken String''.

'''Tofalars''' (Тофалары, тофа (tofa) in [[Russian language|Russian]]; formerly known as карагасы, or Karagas), or the "Tofa people", are a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] people in the [[Irkutsk Oblast]] in [[Russia]]. Their origins, [[Tofa language]], and [[culture]] are close to those of the eastern [[Tuvans-Todzhins]]. Before the 1917 [[October Revolution]], the Tofalars used to be engaged in [[nomad]]ic, living in the [[taiga]]; they engaged in [[reindeer husbandry]] and [[hunting]]. The Tofalars were resettled by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government by 1932. Young Tofalars learned Russian at new Soviet-built schools, while cultural traditions such as hunting and [[shamanism]] were discouraged or prohibited. According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]], there were 762 Tofalars in Russia (2,828 in 1926, 476 in 1959, 570 in 1970, 576 in 1979, 722 in 1989 and 837 in 2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">The '''Transguinean Railways''' is a proposed set of heavy duty [[standard gauge]] railways in [[Guinea]] to support heavy duty haulage of primarily [[iron ore]] and [[bauxite]].

== Overview ==

Existing railways in Guinea are badly maintained and feeble, and would need to be rebuilt from the ground up to support a tenfold or hundredfold increase in tonneages.  The new lines would also avoid undesirable rises and falls though hilly terrain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://railwaysafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2005&amp;Itemid=35 Railways Africa - RADEBE AT UAR CONFERENCE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gauge ==

The new lines would be [[standard gauge]] (1435mm) so as to benefit most from [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off the shelf]] equipment, and to achieve the highest [[secondhand]] value of surplus equipment.  The existence of successful heavy duty narrow gauge lines in South Africa, Queensland and Brazil would not affect this choice.

== Borders ==

The new line tends to follow the southern border with [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].

{{Italic title prefixed|14}}
The '''World State''' is the primary setting of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. In the novel, the World State is a [[World government|unified government]] which administers the entire planet, with a few isolated exceptions. The motto of the World State is "Community, Identity, Stability". 

==History==
The citizens of the World State use a calendar which takes the year 1908 AD ("0 AF" – "After [[Henry Ford|Ford]]") as its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], as this was the first year in which the [[Model T]] automobile was produced by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. According to the novel, the "Nine Years' War" broke out in Year 141 AF (2049 AD of the [[Gregorian calendar]]). Very little is revealed of the Nine Years' War, but it can be inferred that the conflict broke out in Europe, affected most of the planet, and caused massive physical damage. It is repeatedly stated that chemical and biological weapons were heavily used during the war, particularly in mass air-raids against cities, similar to the portrayal of [[World War III]]. Following the war, which seems to have petered out rather than been ended by a decisive victory, the global economy collapsed and created an unprecedented worldwide economic crisis. To deal with the two catastrophes of the Nine Years' War and the Great Economic Collapse, the new world leaders tried to forcibly impose their new ideologies on Earth's populations. One example would be the conscription of consumption, forcing citizens to meet certain quotas of consumerism to stimulate the economy. This was met with widespread resistance, including large-scale riots at [[Golders Green]] and a massacre at the [[British Museum]], and the governments responded with violence and massacres of dissenters. As dissent continued, they realized that they could not force people to adopt the new lifestyle, and so the World Controllers instead united the planet into the One World State and began a peaceful campaign of change. This campaign included the closing of museums, the suppression of almost all literature published before 150 AF (2058 AD), and the destruction of the few historical world monuments that had survived the Nine Years' War. It also crucially includes ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopaedia, which stop dissent before it even starts through conditioning, as described in the novel. By the time the novel is set, the World State is fully established and almost all the people of Earth are citizens.

==Political geography==
At the time of the novel, the entire planet is united as the World State, governed by ten World Controllers, headquartered in various key cities. Prospective World Controllers are recruited from social outcasts who display unconventional thoughts. A few isolated areas have been left as "savage reservations", including parts of [[New Mexico]], [[Samoa]], and a small group of islands off the coast of [[New Guinea]]. Towards the end of the novel, a conversation between John and Western Europe's World Controller, [[Mustapha Mond]], reveals further details of the World State's political geography. Mond explains that certain areas which have very few resources or languish in unpleasant climates are not "civilised" by the government, as it would be uneconomical. Subsequently, these areas are left as reservations, and local life continues&amp;mdash;albeit under constant surveillance by the World State. Small islands across the planet, such as the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Iceland]], and the [[Marquesas Islands]], are reserved for citizens of the World State who do not wish to live in, or do not fit into the normal society.

==Population==
The citizens of the World State constitute a [[Eusociality|eusocial]] consumer society whose individuals are produced in hatcheries by application of  "Bokanovsky's"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/bnw/index.html Bokanovsky's Process"]&lt;/ref&gt; and other techniques to the hatchery line to produce the five classes or castes named after letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]: [[alpha]], [[beta]], [[gamma]], [[Delta (letter)|delta]], and [[epsilon]], respectively.  Society is controlled by Alphas and their subordinates, Betas. Below them, in descending order of intellectual and physical capacity, are Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons. Each caste is further subdivided into Plus and Minus (with Epsilons having the additional classifications of regular or semi-moron), and are distinguished by colour-coded work clothes. Epsilons are dressed in black, Deltas in khaki, Gammas in leaf green, Betas in mulberry, and Alphas in grey. At the very pinnacle of society sit Alpha Double-Plus, who serve as the future scientists and top administrators of the world. Citizens in the World State of all castes are not born to a mother, but instead created in laboratories through a process of artificial insemination. They are then grown to 'birth' in bottles, the bottles being treated in a manner similar to a [[production line]]. Fetuses are pre-determined to be born into specific castes, and 'lower' castes such as Deltas or Epsilons are interfered with during development in order to restrict their mental and physical development (for example by adding alcohol to their bottle). People in different castes are conditioned to be happy in their own way, within their caste and with the caste system; they do not feel resentment towards other castes, but rather feel a slight contempt for people in lower castes and a personal relief at not bearing the societal burdens of higher caste people. At the same time, however, all members of society are repeatedly taught that everyone is equally important to society.

Citizens of the World State enjoy racial, social and economic harmony across the planet. Although England is seen to be mostly populated with Caucasians, the population also contains substantial ethnic proportions, and across the planet, people of different racial heritage live alongside one another in harmony. When visiting an electrical products factory in London, [[John the Savage|John]] witnesses Caucasians and black Senegalese working together. The only "feely" (see below) in the novel features a black antagonist with a white heroine. An official at the Central London Hatchery explains that Negro fetuses are slightly easier to grow than Caucasians or Asians. Although all the World State hatcheries attempt to improve the yield of the various production processes, the Mombasa hatchery is a few hundred ahead of the others in the number of embryos produced from a single ovary (London: 16,012, Singapore: approx 16,500, Mombasa: approx 17,000).

In addition to racial harmony, [[gender roles]] appear to have been eliminated in the World State. Both men and women are equals in society. However, a third pseudo-sex has been engineered: [[freemartin]]s, a [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] group of humans who appear to have been grown as, and conditioned to live in society as females, but are sterile and exhibit some male characteristics, including the growth of [[facial hair]]. The purpose of their creation is to allow citizens to engage in sexual intercourse for pleasure without the constant need for contraception. Despite the existence of Freemartins, contraception is heavily emphasized among the baseline female population, through the deeply-conditioned habitual use of [[Malthusianism|Malthusian Belts]].

Aging is a thing of the past in the World State. [[Biological engineering]] has eliminated the impact of old age upon the human body; using [[blood transfusion]]s, chemical enhancements, and [[Hormone therapy|hormone replacement therapy]], as well as the standard devotion to physical sports, people maintain young, strong bodies for the duration of their lives, and do not present any physical indications of old age, even appearing young when they eventually expire from natural causes. Without these physical signs, it is virtually impossible to gauge a person's age based on appearance, and as a result, ageism is non-existent.

An unspecified number of persons live as "savages" and non-citizens in reservations which figure in sections of the novel, since as noted the creation of the World State was accomplished peacefully as a consolidation of a [[post-apocalypse]] consumer society carried to the limit of conscious production of an irreversible [[division of labor]].

==Economy==
The World State operates a [[command economy]], in which prices, production, and trade are all regulated by the state. Furthermore, the economy is based on the principles of [[mass production]] and mass [[consumerism]]. Citizens of the World State have access to a vast array of very high-quality foods, goods, and services, whilst the manufacture and provision of these goods and services creates jobs for all members of society. In order to enhance consumerism and so keep the economy strong, people are encouraged to throw away old or damaged possessions and buy new ones. In this way, every citizen of the World State is kept happy, with a plentiful supply of creature comforts and a permanent job. Later in the novel, World Controller [[Mustapha Mond]] explains that approximately one third of the global population is employed permanently in [[agricultural]] occupations, a surprisingly high proportion for such a high-tech, industrialised society, although this may have something to do with the fact that Huxley's world is limited in its mechanization and automation. This limitation is deliberately put in place in order to keep the populace busy working to produce new goods, with fears that increased free time and further technological advancements would lead to civil unrest and social instability. This was proven in an experiment in Ireland where all workers were placed on a 4-hour day, which led to unrest and increased consumption of soma.

==Culture==
Culture in the World State is homogenous and appears to be fairly similar across the entire planet. [[Music]] is very popular, and makes use of the latest gadgets to enhance listening pleasure by adding light shows and pleasant aromas. [[Television]] and "feelies" (see below) are widespread throughout the World State. Sport is a cornerstone of culture and is very popular, consisting of various bizarre games played using a bewildering array of high-tech gadgets, in order to keep factories busy. Games such as "Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy", "[[Riemann surface|Riemann Surface]] [[Tennis]]", "[[Escalator]] [[Squash (sport)|Squash]]", and "[[electromagnetism|Electro-Magnetic]] [[Golf]]" are major distractions for all levels of society, alongside more recognisable sports, including wrestling and swimming. Citizens of the World State enjoy many frequent holidays, and global travel allows people to journey across the planet for relaxation. Advertisements in [[Western Europe]] are seen promoting holidays to ''"the gorgeous [[Far East|East]]"''. One surprising holiday destination is a large (but apparently unimpressive) hotel complex at the [[North Pole]]. It is possible that holidays to the [[moon]] are available, but as such trips are only given vague and passing reference in the novel, lunar recreation can neither be confirmed as a physical reality or dismissed as yet another hallucinogenic "holiday" brought on by ''soma''.

==Technology==
Life in the World State in (After Ford) A.F. 632 is dominated by very advanced technology, which influences all aspects of life. Sport is a pillar of the World State, consisting of various games and activities which use very high-tech equipment. Another key aspect of entertainment are the "feelies" &amp;ndash;  the World State's high-tech version of the then-current "[[talkies]]". In the later part of the novel, Lenina takes John to a feely, where the concept is explained. Users rest their hands on metal knobs protruding from the arms of their chair, allowing them to feel the physical sensations of the actors on-screen (usually in sexually-themed films). Various other high-tech entertainment devices feature heavily in the book, including Synthetic Music Boxes, Scent Organs (musical instruments which combine music with pleasant aromas), Colour Organs (combining music with a dazzling light show), and [[television]]s.

Transport technology is also highly advanced. The main form of urban transport is the [[helicopter]], with variations including "taxicopters" and expensive, long-range "sporticopters". For the lower castes, high-speed [[monorail]]s are used to travel around the countryside. Global travel is conducted using rocket planes, which are colour-coded according to their destinations.

In the Hatcheries and Conditioning Centres, advanced technology is used in the creation of new embryos. In addition to high-tech laboratory equipment, the Hatcheries rely on machines to condition bottled embryos to heat, sudden motion, and disease, allowing the embryos to fulfill their predestined jobs in specific climates. Newly 'decanted' children in the Conditioning Centres are exposed to a variety of technologically advanced devices which help to mould them into their predetermined roles. In one early scene, Delta children are trained to hate the countryside and books through [[operant conditioning]] involving klaxons and electrocution. [[Sleep-learning|Hypnopædia]] is conducted using speakers built into the beds. The speakers themselves are fed by machines which convert printed material into softly spoken words. In spite of this, tasks such as [[elevator operator|elevator operation]], automatable in the present day, are still performed by humans.

Other aspects of life are greatly influenced by advanced technology. Most clothes are made from fine synthetic materials such as [[cellulose acetate|acetate]] and [[viscose]]. Architecture is dominated by "vitra-glass" and "[[reinforced concrete|ferroconcrete]]" [[skyscraper]]s. Men shave using [[electrology|electrolytic razors]] and consume sex-hormone [[chewing gum]]. Citizens can relax using "vibro-vac" [[massage]] machines and the ever-present ''soma'' (the novel reveals that although this is ingested in tablet form, it can also be vaporised to form an anaesthetic cloud).

The novel repeatedly explains that the reason for such advanced technology is to keep workers busy manufacturing products. However, the citizens of the World State could enjoy significantly better devices. In a conversation towards the end of the novel, World Controller [[Mustapha Mond]] explains to John that countless plans and designs for more advanced technologies already exist. The World State could, he explains, synthetically manufacture all of its food products and use highly efficient labour-saving machines. However, more advanced technology is not developed, as the World Controllers fear that high-tech machines would result in people having too much time on their hands. This, explains Mond, is not in the World State's best interests, following a previous experiment in [[Ireland]], which revealed that more advanced technology simply led to widespread boredom and increased use of [[soma (Brave New World)|soma]]. Although the citizens of [[Brave New World]] enjoy apparently very advanced gadgets, they are unaware that human technology has in fact been limited artificially.
