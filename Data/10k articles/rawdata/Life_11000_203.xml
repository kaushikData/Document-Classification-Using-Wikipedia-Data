'''Abdon''' ([[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]]: עַבְדּוֹן ''‘Aḇdōn'', "[[wiktionary:servile|servile]]" or "service"), was the son of [[List of minor biblical figures#Hillel|Hillel]], a Pirathonite, and was the twelfth '''JUDGE'''

Judge of [[Israelites|Israel]] mentioned in the [[Book of Judges]] (Judges 12:13-15). He was a member of the [[tribe of Ephraim]], and in the biblical account was credited with having forty sons and thirty grandsons. He is assumed to have been wealthy, since he provided donkeys for his 70 sons and grandsons.
He judged Israel for eight years. He was buried on Ephraimite land, in [[Pirathon]], in the hill-country of the [[Amalekites]]. [[Josephus]] also mentions that Abdon had a peaceful reign.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities (5.7.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''Association of American Cemetery Superintendents''' or '''AACS''' was an American organization formed in 1887 to share interests and to improve the fields of cemetery design, [[groundskeeping]], and [[horticulture]].

==Background==

The first movement to create an association for cemetery superintendents was started in 1886 by eighteen individuals,&lt;ref name="http://www.iccfa.com/about-iccfa"&gt;[http://www.iccfa.com/about-iccfa The origins of the AACS]&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization first met in October 1887 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] under the leadership of Charles Nichols. The foremost purpose of the AACS was educational, and the published works from each annual meeting became much sought-after by librarians and other institutions of learning. These published works were written by cemetery superintendents, illustrating points of importance they would like share with their fellow cemetery superintendents. The Association was devoted to the betterment of cemeteries and their maintenance.

The Association was successful in improving the state of cemeteries across the United States, and in encouraging cemetery superintendents to keep their graveyards well-maintained. One example of the Association’s effect on society would be its improvement of cemeteries in rural America. One of the AACS’s concerns was that of the upkeep of rural cemeteries, and how to improve and gather interest in them. In an instance mentioned in the 20th Annual Convention Proceedings, a member of the AACS described how he motivated a group of cemetery superintendents. This group of cemetery superintendents was composed entirely of women, and they were in charge of an extremely old country church's cemetery.&lt;ref name="http://www.iccfa.com/reading/1900-1919/our-birthday"&gt;[http://www.iccfa.com/reading/1900-1919/our-birthday AACS Proceedings of the 20th Annual Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; With the encouragement to improve their graveyard, the committee was motivated and driven to better their cemetery’s appearance and upkeep, resulting in a much more pleasant cemetery. This instance illustrates how the AACS was able to affect whole communities of cemetery superintendents, for this is but one example of the many concerns the AACS had for American cemeteries.

One of the three oldest societies devoted to conserving landscape and cemetery gardening,&lt;ref name="http://www.iccfa.com/reading/1900-1919/association-american-cemetery-superintendents"&gt;[http://www.iccfa.com/reading/1900-1919/association-american-cemetery-superintendents AACS Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; and rural art in the United States, the Association of American Cemetery Superintendents still exists today. In 1996, the AACS took a new name, the International Cemetery, Cremation and Funeral Association. &lt;ref name="http://www.iccfa.com/about-iccfa"/&gt;

'''Brodie's Law''' is an amendment to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[Crimes Act 1958]] which makes serious [[bullying]] an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. The law is named after Brodie Panlock, a 19-year-old who committed suicide after being bullied at work. Brodie's parents, Damien and Rae Panlock, successfully lobbied the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] to make the amendment.

==Brodie Panlock==

Brodie Rae Constance Panlock grew up in the outer eastern suburbs of [[Melbourne]] in the [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|state]] of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with her parents and two older brothers.{{R|"abcpushed"|"torment"}} In early 2005, at the age of 18, Brodie started working at Cafe Vamp in [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] an inner suburb of [[Melbourne]].{{R|"abcpushed"|"torment"}} In March 2006, shortly after her 19th birthday, Brodie moved to a small flat in Hawthorn to be closer to work. Cafe Vamp helped Brodie with references and lent her the bond money for the flat.{{R|"torment"|"pain"}} She worked 12 hours a day, 6 days a week{{R|"pain"|"ReBrief"|p2=5 &amp; 6}} and was described as a "loyal employee" and "buoyant, chirpy, compassionate, patient, giving girl" by co-workers.{{R|"torment"}} Panlock had plans to save enough money to travel overseas with her brother and his girlfriend before enrolling at [[Technical and further education |TAFE]] to study [[social work]].{{R|"torment"|"pain"}}

Shortly after 11:00pm on 20 September 2006 Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn and died from her injuries in [[The Alfred Hospital]] three days later.{{R|"torment"}}

===Bullying===

Panlock became involved in an intermittent intimate relationship with the cafe manager Nicholas Smallwood in the fifteen months leading up to her death.{{R|"torment"|"darkness"|"4men"}} Panlock became infatuated with Smallwood, but the attention was not returned.{{R|"darkness"}}

In the last few months Panlock's relationship with Smallwood became unhealthy, according to Coroner Peter White, who found that Smallwood and others "systematically bullied her, both physically and emotionally".{{R|"4men"}} Smallwood, fellow waiter Rhys MacAlpine and, to a lesser extent, chef Gabriel Toomey,{{R|"darkness"}} called her names, told her she was fat, ugly and a whore.{{R|"abcpushed"}} They kicked and spat on her, held her down and poured oil on her hair and clothes, covered her in chocolate sauce and filled her kit bag with fish oil. Other employees intervened without effect,{{R|"abcpushed"}} and the cafe owner Marcus Dela Cruz turned a blind eye to the behaviour.

In May 2006 after being kicked out of Smallwood's apartment, Panlock took rat poison and alcohol in a suicide attempt. Smallwood later taunted Panlock that she could not do it properly, and put rat poison in her handbag.{{R|"abcpushed"|"darkness"|"torment"|"fine"}}

===Final days===

On 20 September 2006, Smallwood left her flat after Panlock had begged him to stay. She called a former school friend Ashlea Cooper, who gave evidence to the inquest. Cooper recalled that Panlock "cried hysterically" and felt that she had made a fool of herself, saying: {{Quote|text=''How embarrassing ... I want to die. Ash, it is over. I have had enough. It's over.{{R|"torment"}}}}
Shortly after 11:00pm on 20 September 2006, Brodie jumped from the top of a multilevel carpark in Hawthorn; she died from her injuries in [[The Alfred Hospital]] three days later.{{R|"torment"}}

===Penalty===

Four men and MAP Foundation, the company that owned Cafe Vamp, were charged with offences under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 for their part in bullying Panlock. They pleaded guilty to the charges on 8 February 2010, at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court. They were ordered to pay $335,000 in fines as follows:{{R|"ReBrief"|"fine"}}
*MAP Foundation – $220,000
*Marcus Dela Cruz – $30,000
*Nicholas Smallwood – $45,000
*Rhys MacAlpine – $30,000
*Gabriel Toomey – $10,000

==Law Reform==

===Victoria===

Brodie Panlock's parents Damien and Rae Panlock successfully lobbied the Victorian Government to make changes to the law to include serious bullying as an offence punishable by imprisonment.{{R|"lobaust"|"probono"|"Leader"}}

On 4 November 2010 the [[Attorney-General of Victoria|Victorian Attorney-General]] asked the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Law Reform Commission]] to review the adequacy of Victoria's criminal laws in dealing with serious bullying. The request was made to ensure that perpetrators of serious bullying receive appropriate sanction under Victoria's criminal law.{{R|"VLRC1"}} On 5 April 2011, the Attorney-General introduced the Crimes Amendment (Bullying) Bill 2011 to Parliament, which amended the offence of stalking under section 21 of the Crimes Act 1958, to include serious bullying as a crime carrying a maximum penalty of ten years.{{R|"VLRC2"}} The Bill received [[royal assent]] on 7 June 2011,{{R|"bill"}} and commenced immediately; it is colloquially known as "Brodie's Law".{{R|"abcBL"|"edu"}}

In the five years since the law's proclamation on 16 June 2011, fifty-eight offenders were charged with 140 offences against Brodie's Law.{{R|"stats5"|"Woolies"|"CMail58"}}

===National===

The [[Attorney-General of Victoria|Victoria Attorney-General]] [[Robert Clark (Australian politician)|Robert Clark]] announced that Brodie's Law would be discussed at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in November 2011.{{R|"lobaust"}}

The response by the Victorian government was backed by the [[Treasurer of Australia |Federal Assistant Treasurer]], [[Bill Shorten]]. In September 2011 the New South Wales Government was examining the Victorian legislation.{{R|"lobaust"}}

Damien and Rae Panlock continued to lobby the federal government because they feared that the states would fail to agree on the matter. On 26 May 2012, they met with [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]], [[Julia Gillard]], and Bill Shorten, now [[Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations|Minister for Workplace Relations]], and made a joint announcement of a national parliamentary inquiry into bullying.{{R|"lobaust"|"pmtrscpt"}} The report was released on 25 November 2012, and "contained 23 recommendations including the adoption of a new national definition of 'workplace bullying', a workplace bullying 'hotline' and a legislative and regulatory framework."{{R|"probono"}} In response to the recommendations the Federal Parliament passed the Fair Work Amendment Act 2013 which gave the [[Fair Work Commission]] jurisdiction to hear and resolve ''"a workplace incidence of bullying"''.{{R|"ShortenPR"}}

==Brodie's Law Foundation==

In late 2012, Damien and Rae Panlock toured Victoria, using the first anniversary of the introduction of Brodie's Law to raise awareness about bullying.{{R|"BRat"}}

Damien and Rae Panlock continue to tour Australia and speak in workplaces and at public events, to campaign against bullying.{{R|"BRat"|"wsblf"|"SAWHS"|"CFMEU"|"Foundation"}} The foundation assists with education in workplaces, schools and sporting clubs, with speaking engagements and production of education packages for teachers, club members, employers, and employees.

In February 2017, Brodie's Law Foundation was formed and registered as a charity.{{R|"ASIC"|"ABN"}}

==Statistics==
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that approximately 4,400 deaths occur from suicide each year. There are about 100 attempts of suicide to every 1 successful suicide. A little over 14% of students in [[high school]] consider suicide and just about 7% of them attempt suicide. Students that are bullied are more likely to consider suicide. They are 2 to 9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victims.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-and-suicide.html |title=Bullying and Suicide |publisher=Bullying Statistics |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in Britain found that at least half of suicides among young people are related to bullying. 10 to 14 year old teen girls are most likely to commit suicide based on the study from Britain. According to ABC News, nearly 30% of students are either victims of bullies or bullies themselves and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because they are scared of being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/TheLaw/school-bullying-epidemic-turning-deadly/story?id=11880841|title=Bullying in America's Schools|last=News|first=A.

==Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) youth==
Suicide attempts are 2-4 times higher than heterosexual peers. Young adults of the LGBT community "must cope with developing sexual minority identity along with negative comments, jokes, and threats of violence. A research identified that 19 studies were linked to suicidal behavior in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students to bullying at school. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender students experience more bullying than heterosexual students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/migrate/library/Suicide_Bullying_Issue_Brief.pdf |format=PDF |title=Suicide and Bullying |website=Sprc.org |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may not be obvious that someone is considering suicide. In some cases a bad case of bullying may be the leading cause or trigger that leads to suicidal thoughts. In such cases where a victim of bullying has killed themselves, bullies tell the victim that they should kill him or herself and that the world would be better off without them. People that hear statements such as the one above should quickly stop and talk to the bully and let the victim know that the bully is wrong and the world would not be better off without them.

'''Sir Charles Blount''' (1568–1600) was an [[English people|English]] soldier during the Tudor period.

==Life==
Sir Charles was the son of Sir [[Michael Blount]] of [[Mapledurham House]] in [[Oxfordshire]] and his wife, Mary Moore. Charles and his cousin and namesake [[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devonshire|Lord Mountjoy]] (the latter already being Captain of the Town and Isle of [[Portsmouth]]) became [[Freedom of the city|Freemen]] of Portsmouth on 26 December 1593.

Lord Mountjoy was a kinsman of [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] both by blood and by marriage to his sister [[Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire|Penelope]]. This gained his cousin the Earl's patronage. Charles accompanied the Earl of Essex on a successful expedition to capture [[Cadiz]] in June 1596, after which he was knighted (probably one among the large number Essex knighted on board ship before returning to England - so many that the [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen]] complained), and to [[Ireland]] in 1599 (becoming [[Colonel|"Coronell Governor"]] of [[Cahir Castle]] in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]].

He died in 1600 on the trip back to England, and was buried in St Thomas's Church, Portsmouth, now [[Portsmouth Cathedral|the city's cathedral]], where his memorial may still be seen.

'''Claude's syndrome''' is a form of [[brainstem stroke syndrome]] characterized by the presence of an ipsilateral [[oculomotor nerve palsy]], contralateral [[hemiparesis]], contralateral [[ataxia]], and contralateral [[hemiplegia]] of the lower face, tongue, and shoulder.
Claude's syndrome affects [[oculomotor nerve]], [[red nucleus]] and [[brachium conjunctivum]]&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause and presentation==
[[File:Human brainstem blood supply description.JPG|thumb|Human brainstem blood supply description. [[Posterior cerebral artery]] is #6, and [[midbrain]] is behind it.]]
Claude's syndrome is caused by [[midbrain]] [[infarction]] as a result of occlusion of a branch of the [[posterior cerebral artery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite GPnotebook|691339295|Claude's syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lesion is usually a unilateral infarction of the [[red nucleus]] and [[cerebral peduncle]], affecting several structures in the midbrain including:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Structure damaged
! Effect
|-
| [[dentatorubral tract]] fibers
| contralateral ataxia
|-
| [[corticospinal tract]] fibers 
| contralateral hemiparesis
|-
| [[corticobulbar tract]] fibers 
| contralateral hemiplegia of lower facial muscles, tongue, and shoulder
|-
| [[oculomotor nerve]] fibers 
| [[ipsilateral]] [[oculomotor nerve palsy]] with a drooping eyelid and fixed wide pupil pointed down and out; probable [[diplopia]]
|}

It is very similar to [[Benedikt's syndrome]].

===Other causes===
It has been reported that posterior cerebral artery [[stenosis]] can also precipitate Claude's syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhanjal T, Walters M, MacMillan N |title=Claude's syndrome in association with posterior cerebral artery stenosis |journal=Scottish Medical Journal |year=2003 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=91–92 |url=http://www.smj.org.uk/0803/claude.htm |pmid=12968516 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612000524/http://www.smj.org.uk/0803/claude.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conquest of the Desert''' ({{lang-es|Conquista del desierto}}) was a military campaign directed mainly by General [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in the 1870s with the intent to establish [[Argentina|Argentine]] dominance over [[Patagonia]], which was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous peoples]]. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of [[Chile]]an expansion there.

Argentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. [[White people|Ethnic European]] settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a [[breadbasket]] that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"&gt;''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902,'' George V. Rauch, p. 47, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roca&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/13/argentinian-founding-father-genocide-row |title=Argentinian founding father recast as genocidal murderer |first=Rory |last=Carroll |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the [[Occupation of Araucanía]].

The Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists have described the Conquest as bringing civilisation, while revisionists have labelled it a [[genocide]].

==Background==
The arrival of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] on the shores of the [[Río de la Plata]] and the foundation of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the [[Spain|Spanish]] and the local Indian tribes, mainly the [[Querandí]] (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for [[cattle]] raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.

[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Mapuches during a [[malón]] raid]]
The [[frontier]] dividing the colonial farms and the Indian territories gradually moved outwards from Buenos Aires; at the end of the 18th century, the [[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|Salado River]] was the boundary between the civilizations. Many Indians were forced &lt;!--?Explain--&gt; to abandon their tribes to work on the farms. Some assimilated or intermarried with the white population. The group known as [[gaucho]]s developed from working on the ranches.

After Argentina achieved independence in 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled over how to organize. Once these were settled, the government wanted to quickly occupy the lands claimed by the young republic (in part to prevent Chile from encroaching on it). It also wanted to increase the national agricultural production and offer new lands to prospective immigrants.

In 1833 [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Buenos Aires Province and other military leaders in the [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]] region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time [[Chile]] had founded [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Magellan Strait]] in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in [[Patagonia]]. Later in 1861 Chile began the [[occupation of the Araucanía]], which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the [[Mapuche]] in their central region. This indigenous tribe had [[araucanization|strong language and cultural ties]] to the nomadic tribes on the east side of the [[Andes]], with whom they share the [[araucanization|same language]].

In 1872 the indigenous leader [[Cufulcurá|Calfucurá]] and his 6,000 followers attacked the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]] and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]]. They killed 300 settlers and drove off 200,000 head of cattle. These events were a catalyst for the government to mount the Conquest of the Desert.

The Indians drove the stolen cattle from the incursions (''[[malón|malones]]'') to Chile through the [[Camino de los chilenos|Rastrillada de los chilenos]] and traded them for goods. The historian George V. Rauch notes evidence that Chilean authorities knew about the origin of the cattle and consented to the trading in order to strengthen their influence over Patagonian territories. They expected eventually to occupy those lands in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch (1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alsina's campaign==
[[Image:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of  [[zanja de Alsina]]]]
In 1875 [[Adolfo Alsina]], Minister of War under [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Nicolás Avellaneda]], presented the government with a plan which he later described as having the goal "to populate the desert, and not to destroy the Indians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm "Reseña sobre la historia de Neuquén"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501154410/http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm |date=2006-05-01 }}, Government of the [[Neuquén Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step was to connect Buenos Aires and the ''Fortines'' (fortresses) with telegraph lines. The government signed a peace treaty with [[lonco|chieftain]] [[Juan José Catriel]]. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain ''[[Namuncurá]]'' and 3,500 warriors, he attacked [[Tres Arroyos]], [[Tandil]], [[Azul, Buenos Aires|Azul]], and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch )1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Alsina attacked the Indians, forcing them to fall back, and leaving ''fortines'' on his way south to protect the conquered territories. He also constructed the 374&amp;nbsp;km long trench named [[zanja de Alsina]] ("Alsina's trench"). It was supposed to be a fortified border to the unconquered territories.  Three metres wide and two metres deep, it served as an obstacle to cattle drives by the Indians.

The Indians continued taking cattle from farms in the Buenos Aires Province and the south of the [[Mendoza Province]], but found it difficult to escape as the animals slowed their march. They had to confront the patrolling units that followed them. As the war went on, some Indians eventually signed peace treaties and settled among the "Christians" behind the lines of forts. Some tribes allied with the Argentine government, standing neutral or, less often, fighting for the Argentine army. In return, they were granted periodical shipments of cattle and food. After Alsina died in 1877, Julio Argentino Roca was appointed Minister of War, and decided to change the strategy.

==Roca's campaign==

[[Julio Argentino Roca]], in contrast to Alsina, believed that the only solution against the Indian threat was to extinguish, subdue or expel them.

{{Quote|Our self-respect as a virile people obliges us to put down as soon as possible, by reason or by force, this handful of savages who destroy our wealth and prevent us from definitely occupying, in the name of law, progress and our own security, the richest and most fertile lands of the Republic.|Julio Argentino Roca|&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: Kenneth M. Roth. ''Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide''. University of California Press, 2002. Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of 1878 he started the first sweep to "clean" the area between the Alsina trench and the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Negro river]] by continuous and systematic attacks on the Indian settlements. On 6 December 1878, elements of the Puán Division under Colonel Teodoro García clashed with a war party at the Lihué Calel heights. In a brief but hard fought battle, 50 Indians were killed, 270 captured, and 33 settlers were freed.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 45, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous armed encounters would follow, until by December 1878, over 4,000 Indians had been captured and 400 killed, 150 settlers freed and 15,000 head of cattle recovered.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"/&gt;

With 6,000 soldiers armed with new [[Remington Rolling Block rifle|breech-loading Remington rifles]], in 1879 he began the second sweep reaching [[Choele Choel]] in two months, after killing 1,313 Indians and capturing over 15,000.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"/&gt; From other points, southbound companies made their way down to the Negro River and the [[Neuquén River]], a northern tributary of the Negro River. Together, both rivers marked the natural frontier from the [[Andes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm "Poblamiento Pampeano"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227080911/http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm |date=2005-12-27 }} – Ministry of Culture of the [[la Pampa Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack led to a large migration of Mapuches into the zone around [[Curarrehue]] and [[Pucón]], Chile.

Many settlements were built on the basin of these two rivers, as well as a number on the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado River]]. By sea, some settlements were erected on the southern basin of the [[Chubut River]] mainly by [[Welsh people|Welsh colonists]] in [[y Wladfa]].

==The final campaign==
Roca followed Nicolás Avellaneda as [[President of Argentina|president]]. He thought it was imperative to conquer the territory south of the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Negro River]] as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign under the control of Colonel [[Conrado Villegas]].

Within a year Villegas conquered the [[Neuquén Province]] (he reached the [[Limay River]]). The campaign continued to push the Indian resistance further south, to fight the last battle on October 18, 1884. The last rebel group of over 3,000 members under the command of chieftains Inacayal and Foyel surrendered two months later in present [[Chubut Province]].

==Border clashes==
To counteract the Argentine conquest of Patagonia, the Chileans supplied arms, ammunition and horses to their Indian Mapuche allies.&lt;ref&gt;5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1883, a 10-man section of a platoon of the Argentine Army in pursuit of a large Indian war party, ran into an ambush in the Pulmarí Valley set up by Chilean soldiers, and in the engagement that followed Captain Emilio Crouzeilles along with Lieutenant Nicolas Lazcano and several privates were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Historia de las misiones salesianas en La Pampa, República Argentina
, Volume 1, Lorenzo Massa, p. 169, Editorial Don Bosco, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 1883, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Díaz, at the head of a 16-man Argentine infantry detachment, was trailing a war party of 100 to 150 Indians. Upon reaching Pulmarí Valley, they were surrounded by the Indians and around 50 Chilean soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the Argentine soldiers skillfully outfought their attackers, including a bayonet charge mounted by the Chilean detachment.&lt;ref&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 49, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1883, according to Argentine Army Major Manuel Prado, 150-200 Indians armed with Winchesters and [[Martini–Henry]] rifles attacked an Argentine Army detachment operating on the Argentine-Chilean border, and in a four-hour engagement killed or wounded 22 Argentine soldiers at a cost of some 100 warriors.

==Historical controversy==
{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}
Historian Jens Andermann has noted that contemporary sources on the campaign indicate that the Conquest was intended by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government to exterminate the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Argentina|indigenous tribes]], and thus attempt genocide.&lt;ref name="genocide"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/llc/subjects/span_lat_amer/span_lat_amer_staff/ja Andermann, Jens].  [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ibamuseum/texts/Andermann02.htm ''Argentine Literature and the 'Conquest of the Desert', 1872-1896''], [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. Quote: "It is this sudden acceleration, this abrupt change from the discourse of 'defensive warfare' and 'merciful civilization' to that of 'offensive warfare' and of genocide, which is perhaps the most distinctive mark of the literature of the Argentine frontier."&lt;/ref&gt; First-hand accounts state that Argentine troops killed prisoners and committed "mass executions".&lt;ref name=genocide /&gt; The 15,000 Indians taken captive "became servants or prisoners and were prevented from having children."&lt;ref name=fifteenthousand /&gt;&lt;ref name=roca /&gt;

Apologists perceive the campaign as intending to conquer specifically those groups of Indians that refused to submit to Argentine law and frequently carried out brutal attacks on frontier civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''State Building and Political Movements in Argentina, 1860-1916''. Stanford University Press, 2002, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; In these attacks, Indians stole many horses and cattle, killed men defending their livestock and captured women and children to become the [[slaves]] and/or forced brides of Indian warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: Countries of the World,'' Erika Wittekind, p. 67, ABDO, 01/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Captive Women: Oblivion And Memory In Argentina,'' [[Susana Rotker]], p.32, University of Minnesota Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' alleged in 2011 that two education officials lost their jobs due to the controversy over the Conquest of the Desert: It alleged that Juan José Cresto was forced to resign as a director of the Argentine National Historical Museum because he "said the Indians were violent parasites who attacked farms and kidnapped women"&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; and Beatriz Horn, a history teacher in [[La Pampa Province]], was fired for "telling a radio station that Roca deserved praise for putting Indians to flight and opening Argentina's frontier to European settlers."&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; Argentine news sources, however, report Juan José Cresto lost his job for being abusive and violent towards employees&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/03/25/s-03201.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the firing of Beatriz Horn was primarily due to her praise for the military dictator [[Leopoldo Galtieri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/380889/argentina/Actualidad_nacional.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug development''' is the process of bringing a new [[pharmaceutical drug]] to the market once a [[lead compound]] has been identified through the process of [[drug discovery]].  It includes [[pre-clinical research]] on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] for an [[investigational new drug]] to initiate [[clinical trial]]s on humans, and may include the step of obtaining [[regulatory approval]] with a [[new drug application]] to market the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strovel|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Sittampalam|first2=Sitta|last3=Coussens|first3=Nathan P.|last4=Hughes|first4=Michael|last5=Inglese|first5=James|last6=Kurtz|first6=Andrew|last7=Andalibi|first7=Ali|last8=Patton|first8=Lavonne|last9=Austin|first9=Chris|last10=Baltezor|first10=Michael|last11=Beckloff|first11=Michael|last12=Weingarten|first12=Michael|last13=Weir|first13=Scott|title=Assay Guidance Manual|date=July 1, 2016|publisher=Eli Lilly &amp; Company and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/|chapter=Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: For Academic Researchers, Collaborators, and Start-up Companies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=David|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry and the Future of Drug Development|journal=Issues in Environmental Science and Technology|date=2015|pages=1–33|doi=10.1039/9781782622345-00001|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapterhtml/2015/bk9781782621898-00001?isbn=978-1-78262-189-8|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New chemical entity development==

Broadly, the process of drug development can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical work.

[[File:Drug Evaluation Process.jpg|thumbnail|center|900px|Timeline showing the various drug approval tracks and research phases{{fact|date=July 2018}}]]

===Pre-clinical===
{{Main|Pre-clinical development}}
[[New chemical entity|New chemical entities]] (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of [[drug discovery]]. These have promising activity against a particular biological target that is important in disease. However, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of this NCE in humans. It is the function of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial ("[[first-in-man study|first-in-man]]" [FIM] or First Human Dose [FHD]).

In addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale. They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).

Many aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities. These generally constitute a number of tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans. It is a legal requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new drug is to be delivered through the skin). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.

The information is gathered from this pre-clinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] application or IND. If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase.

===Clinical phase===
[[Clinical trials]] involve three or four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ciociola AA | date = May 2014 | title = How drugs are developed and approved by the FDA: current process and future directions | url = | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 620–3 | doi = 10.1038/ajg.2013.407 | pmid = 24796999 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.
* Phase II trials are used to get an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of patients having the disease targeted by the NCE.
* Phase III trials are large, pivotal trials to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of patients with the targeted disease. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage.
* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that are sometimes a condition attached by the FDA, also called post-market surveillance studies.

The process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE begins human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others). They must also test the compound for its potential to cause [[cancer]] ([[carcinogenicity]] testing).

If a compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the company can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it. In the United States, this process is called a "new drug application" or NDA.

Most NCEs fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not have the intended effect on the  targeted disease as shown in clinical trials.

A trend toward the collection of biomarker and genetic information from clinical trial participants, and increasing investment by companies in this area, led by 2018 to fully half of all drug trials collecting this information, the prevalence reaching above 80% among oncology trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 17, 2018|title=Gene Therapies Create Moral Dilemma For Clinical Researchers|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/gene-therapies-create-moral-dilemma-for-clinical-researchers-0001|journal=Clinical Leader|location=Pennsylvania, United States|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The full cost of bringing a new drug (i.e., [[new chemical entity]]) to market  – from discovery through clinical trials to approval – is complex and controversial. Typically, companies spend tens to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26908540|year=2016|author1=Sertkaya|first1=A|title=Key cost drivers of pharmaceutical clinical trials in the United States|journal=Clinical Trials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–26|last2=Wong|first2=H. H.|last3=Jessup|first3=A|last4=Beleche|first4=T|doi=10.1177/1740774515625964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One element of the complexity is that the much-publicized final numbers often not only include the out-of-pocket expenses for conducting a series of Phase I-III clinical trials, but also the ''capital costs'' of the long period (10 or more years) during which the company must cover out-of-pocket costs for preclinical drug discovery. Additionally, companies often do not report whether a given figure includes the capitalized cost or comprises only out-of-pocket expenses, or both.

Another element of complexity is that all estimates are based on confidential information controlled by drug companies, released by them voluntarily, leading to inability to verify costs. The numbers are controversial, as drug companies use them to justify the prices of their drugs and various advocates for lower drug prices have challenged them. The controversy is not only between "high" and "low", but also the high numbers may vary considerably for the manifold factors in drug development.

One study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about US$1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nrd3078|title=How to improve R&amp;D productivity: The pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|year=2010|last1=Paul|first1=Steven M.|last2=Mytelka|first2=Daniel S.|last3=Dunwiddie|first3=Christopher T.|last4=Persinger|first4=Charles C.|last5=Munos|first5=Bernard H.|last6=Lindborg|first6=Stacy R.|last7=Schacht|first7=Aaron L.|pmid=20168317|volume=9|pages=203–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of the drug development costs for 98 companies over a decade, the average cost per drug developed and approved by a single-drug company was $350 million.&lt;ref name=forbes13/&gt; But for companies that approved between eight and 13 drugs over 10 years, the cost per drug went as high as $5.5 billion, due mainly to geographic expansion for marketing and ongoing costs for Phase IV trials and continuous monitoring for safety.&lt;ref name="forbes13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/08/11/how-the-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs-is-shaping-the-future-of-medicine/#7753cc096bfc | title=The Cost Of Creating A New Drug Now $5 Billion, Pushing Big Pharma To Change | publisher=Forbes, Pharma &amp; Healthcare | date=11 August 2013 | accessdate=17 July 2016 | author=Herper, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to conventional drug development have the objective for universities, governments and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and optimize resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Busting the billion-dollar myth: how to slash the cost of drug development|journal=Nature|volume=536|pages=388–90|year=2016|author=Maxmen A|url=http://www.nature.com/news/busting-the-billion-dollar-myth-how-to-slash-the-cost-of-drug-development-1.20469|doi=10.1038/536388a|pmid=27558048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valuation ==

The nature of a drug development project is characterised by high [[attrition rate]]s, large capital expenditures, and long timelines. This makes the valuation of such projects and companies a challenging task. Not all valuation methods can cope with these particularities. The most commonly used valuation methods are [[rNPV|risk-adjusted net present value]] (rNPV), [[decision tree]]s, [[real options]], or [[comparables]].

The most important value drivers are the cost of capital or discount rate that is used, [[Phases of clinical research|phase]] attributes such as duration, success rates, and costs, and the forecasted sales, including cost of goods and marketing and sales expenses. Less objective aspects like quality of the management or novelty of the technology should be reflected in the [[cash flow]]s estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Bogdan and Ralph Villiger, "Valuation in Life Sciences. A Practical Guide", 2008, 2nd edition, Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Nicolaj Hoejer "Financial valuation methods for biotechnology", 2010. {{cite web|url=http://biostrat.dk/financial-valuation-methods-for-biotechnology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305213601/http://biostrat.dk/financial-valuation-methods-for-biotechnology.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate==
Candidates for a new drug to treat a disease might, theoretically, include from 5,000 to 10,000 chemical compounds. On average about 250 of these show sufficient promise for further evaluation using laboratory tests, mice and other test animals. Typically, about ten of these qualify for tests on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Dr. H.G. |last=Stratmann |date=September 2010 |title=Bad Medicine: When Medical Research Goes Wrong |journal=Analog Science Fiction and Fact|volume=CXXX |issue=9 |pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development]] covering the 1980s and 1990s found that only 21.5 percent of drugs that started Phase I trials were eventually approved for marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=R&amp;D costs are on the rise|journal=Medical Marketing and Media |date=June 1, 2003 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-102908512.html |volume=38 |issue=6 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time period of 2006 to 2015, the success rate was 9.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf | title = Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015 | date = June 2016| work =  BIO Industry Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as the "attrition rate" problem.  Careful decision making during drug development is essential to avoid costly failures.&lt;ref name="knowledge2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang Y. |title= Extracting Knowledge from Failed Development Programmes |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Extracting_Knowledge_from_Failed_Development.3.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=91–96 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/BF03256897}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, intelligent programme and clinical trial design can prevent false negative results. Well-designed, dose-finding studies and comparisons against both a placebo and a gold-standard treatment arm play a major role in achieving reliable data.&lt;ref name="portfolio2012"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herschel, M. |title=Portfolio Decisions in Early Development: Don't Throw Out the Baby with the Bathwater |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26020/Portfolio_Decisions_in_Early_Development__Don_t.1.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=77–84 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/BF03256895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novel initiatives to boost development==
Novel initiatives include partnering between governmental organizations and industry. The world's largest such initiative is the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] (IMI), and examples of major national initiatives are Top Institute Pharma in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Biopeople]] in [[Denmark]]. In 2004, the [[food and drug administration|FDA]] created the “Critical Path Initiative” to guide the new drug development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/default.htm | title=Critical Path Initiative | publisher=US Food and Drug Administration | date=23 October 2015 | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Aburrow senior''' (baptized at Hambledon, Hampshire 25 Jan 1714/1715,&lt;ref name="FamilySearch"&gt;FamilySearch [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NKGN-2ZY]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; buried at Slindon, Sussex 25 Apr 1763 &lt;ref name="SFHG"&gt;Sussex Family History Group indexes&lt;/ref&gt;) was a noted English [[cricket]]er of the mid-18th century.  He was a [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex]] man, who played for the famous village of [[Slindon]], where his son [[Edward "Curry" Aburrow]] was born.

Aburrow senior was reportedly a [[smuggler]] and operated under an ''alias'' of '''Cuddy''' to disguise himself.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512195847/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/biog.html From Lads to Lord's – biography of Edward Aburrow]&lt;/ref&gt;  This pseudonym has sometimes been used in cricket reports and scores.

Aburrow first appears in the records as a member of the [[Slindon Cricket Club]] team against [[London Cricket Club]] in the [[1744 English cricket season]].&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G B Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that season, he played for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] in the famous match at the [[Artillery Ground]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826)'', Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;  These two games have the earliest known scorecards.

Aburrow continued to play until at least the [[1751 English cricket season]].  He is frequently found in single wicket contests and seems to have been very popular with the gamblers who frequented that form of cricket.&lt;ref name=LL/&gt;

'''Edward Estes Holloway''' (June 12, 1908 – April 8, 1993) was a Philadelphia [[cardiologist]] who also served as the last elected city [[coroner]].

Holloway was born in 1908 in Philadelphia, the son of Daniel Holloway and Margaret Estes Holloway.{{sfn|Birth certificate 1908}} Daniel Holloway was a doctor, one of just a few African Americans practicing medicine at the time.{{sfn|Simmons|1993}} As a boy, Holloway often accompanied his father as he made housecalls on horseback in Southwest Philadelphia.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993}} After graduating from [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] and [[Howard University]], the son followed his father into the medical profession.{{sfn|Simmons|1993}} He interned at [[Howard University Hospital|Freedman's Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], before returning to his hometown in 1937 and starting his own practice in [[North Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Simmons|1993}}

He married Mildred Brazington in 1938, but they divorced in the early 1940s.{{sfn|Marriage certificate 1938}} In 1944, he married again, to Ruth Smart, a social worker.{{sfn|Marriage certificate 1944}} Holloway quickly became recognized as one of the top men in his field; despite a lack of formal post-graduate training, he was certified by the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] in 1946.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993}} In 1950, he became the second black doctor ever elected to the [[American College of Physicians]].{{sfn|Inquirer 1950}} In 1955, he was the first ever elected to the American Board of Cardiovascular Diseases.{{sfn|Simmons|1993}}

In 1953, Holloway married again, to Carmen Chisholm, with whom he later had two daughters, Michelle and Cheryl.{{sfn|Sims|2008}} That same year, he ran in [[Philadelphia municipal election, 1953|the local election]] for Philadelphia city coroner as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and won.{{sfn|Miller|1953}} He never took office, however, as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-majority [[Philadelphia City Council|City Council]] abolished several county offices, including coroner, and converted the jobs to civil service positions.{{sfn|Inquirer 1953}} Holloway and city treasurer [[Francis D. Pastorius]] filed suit to retain their offices, but were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Inquirer 1953}}

Meanwhile, Holloway's medical career progressed as he rose from an instructor at [[Medical College of Pennsylvania|Women's Medical College]] to a clinical associate professor of medicine.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993}} He also gained a reputation as an engaging speaker at medical conferences.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993}} He served as the final chief of staff at Frederick Douglass Memorial Hospital and the only chief of staff at its successor, Mercy-Douglass Hospital.{{sfn|Simmons|1993}}

Holloway and his wife divorced in 1977.{{sfn|Sims|2008}} He married for the last time soon thereafter to Agatha Lawson.{{sfn|Pray|1999}} He continued to practice medicine until 1991, when he retired.{{sfn|Nicholson|1993}} Two years later, Holloway died at the age of 84 at Philadelphia's [[Penn Medicine Rittenhouse|Graduate Hospital]] and was buried at Mount Lawn Cemetery in [[Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Simmons|1993}}

'''Elena Anatolievna Gremina''' (20 November 1956{{snd}}16 May 2018) was a Russian writer and playwright who was one of the founders of the factual theatre {{ill|Teatr.doc|ru|Театр.doc}}. 

==Early life==
Elena Grebnav was born on 20 November 1956 in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], to Georgian translator [[Galina Mindadze]] and [[playwright]] {{ill|Anatoly Grebnev|ru|Гребнев, Анатолий Борисович}}. At an early age, Elena would write protests in verse, such as an early piece about children being prevented from seeing a film. She later adopted the surname Gremina, a combination of her parent's surnames so as to be able to write without being compared to her them. Gremina studied at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] to become a playwright.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

==Career==
Grebnav's first production took place in 1983, but only came to prominence in the 1990s after her plays were performed at the [[Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre]] and she won awards from [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]. A favoured subject matter of Grebnav in this period was conflicted women of history. Grebnav married {{ill|Mikhail Ugarov|ru|Угаров, Михаил Юрьевич}} in 1993. Together with her husband and father, she created the television series, ''{{ill|St. Petersburg Secrets|ru|Петербургские тайны}}''.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

After being influenced by [[Elyse Dodgson]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London, Gremina and her husband founded {{ill|Teatr.doc|ru|Театр.doc}}. When they heard Dodgson talk about the use of verbatim techniques in theatre to present factual stories on the stage, they decided that it was a way to reconnect Russian theatre with the public in their home country.&lt;ref name="guardobit"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dugdale |first1=Sasha |title=Elena Gremina obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/24/elena-gremina-obituary |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo started Teatr.doc in 2002, and soon began to present performances based on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Senelick |first1=Lawrence |title=Historical Dictionary of Russian Theatre |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-1-44224-927-1 |page=464 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mx5lCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA485&amp;lpg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Elena+Gremina%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x-mSztUWr4&amp;sig=JUNRZhH5XOXKSlzN-i2CHnUiPWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJmdaEz7fbAhWnJcAKHRhEDqE4FBDoAQhRMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elena%20Gremina%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The performances became more political in nature, which resulted in Gremina and her husband being visited by the police and having equipment confiscated.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt; One such piece written by Gremina was on the death of [[Sergei Magnitsky]], an anticorruption [[lawyer]].&lt;ref name="npost"/&gt; After a police raid of Teatr.doc in 2015 that saw three members of the production temporarily arrested and sets destroyed, Gremina was summoned to the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Ministry of Culture]] where she was threatened with further raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruble |first1=Blair A. |title=Putin's Punitive Theatre of the Absurd |url=http://www.newsweek.com/putins-punitive-theater-absurd-298179 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=Newsweek |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ugarov died following a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in April 2018.&lt;ref name="npost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian playwright found dead after making play about anti-corruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky |url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/russian-playwright-found-dead-after-making-play-about-anti-corruption-lawyer-sergei-magnitsky |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=National Post |date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gremina died six weeks later, also from a heart attack.&lt;ref name="guardobit"/&gt;

Elidio Ramos Zárate was born in Mexico around 1971 or 1972.&lt;ref name=oaxacadiaadia /&gt;&lt;ref name=proceso /&gt; Police noted that Ramos was a relative of a known figure inside the underworld known as "El Fayo."&lt;ref name=proceso /&gt;

== Career ==
Elidio Ramos Zárate worked for ''El Sur'' for 10 years as a crime journalist before he was killed.&lt;ref name=rsf /&gt;  Ramos worked in a popular genre of sensationalist, tabloid style of crime journalism known in Mexico as [[nota roja]].&lt;ref name=oaxacadiaadia /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/killed/2016/elidio-ramos-zarate.php|title=Elidio Ramos Zárate - Journalists Killed|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to cover the protest by the CNTE, who were protesting the government.&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt; Although he was a known crime reporter in the region, Ramos was not, according to his editor, threatened before he covered the CNTE protests. His editor said, "As a journalist, in this area and in these situations, you are extra exposed. We're not safe from anyone.

No suspects have been charged with the murder but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref name=inserbia /&gt;

== Context ==
President [[Enrique Peña Nieto|Enrique Peña Nieto's]] government had recently charged two union leaders with embezzlement and was attempting to change the evaluation of teachers, while at the state level in Oaxaca over 4,000 teachers were on lay off. The protest was organized by the CNTE teachers union in response.&lt;ref name=inserbia /&gt; The battle over education reform in this southern state in Mexico has been ongoing for almost 10 years in Oaxaca and previous demonstrations had also led to violence.&lt;ref name=aljazeera /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnews /&gt;

== Reactions ==
Aurelio Nuño, Mexico's Secretary of Education, held a meeting after the shooting. He said future meetings will resolve around peace and nothing else.&lt;ref name=inserbia /&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]] said, "I condemn the killing of Elidio Ramos Zárate. Serving as the eyes and ears of society, journalists must be able to carry out their important work without fearing for their lives. It is therefore important that those responsible for this crime be brought to justice."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_condemns_killing_of_journalist_elidio_ramos/|title=Director-General condemns killing of journalist Elidio Ramos Zárate in Mexico|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesperson from [[Reporters Without Borders]] said, "We urge the authorities to conduct exhaustive investigations into these fatal shootings and under no circumstances to rule out the possibility that they were linked to the victims' work as a journalists."&lt;ref name=rsf /&gt;

Ivonne Flores, a reporter for ''El Sur,'' complained about the working conditions in the state of Oaxaca and stated that reporters are unable to do their work and cover material as it should be covered because of the dangers that come with their career.&lt;ref name=knightcenter /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7901">The '''ethics of belief''' refers to a cluster of related issues that focus on standards of rational belief, intellectual excellence, and conscientious belief-formation. Among the questions addressed in the field are:

* Are there standards of some sort ("epistemic norms") that ought to guide how we form beliefs and pursue intellectual aims, such as the pursuit of truth or the quest for understanding?
* If so, what kind of norms? Moral? Purely intellectual? Prudential?
* If there are such norms, how strong are they? Are they categorical (i.e., binding regardless of our desires and commitments) or merely hypothetical (applicable only ''if'' we have certain desires and goals?) Do they bind absolutely or only conditionally?
* Are beliefs within our voluntary control, or do we more or less automatically believe whatever we think is best supported by the evidence?
* What aims should we have as believers? Achieving significant truth? Avoiding significant error? Achieving knowledge? Pleasure? Peace of mind? Understanding? Wisdom?
* Must one always have sufficient evidence for one's beliefs (a view philosophers call "evidentialism"), or is it sometimes permissible to believe without sufficient evidence—or perhaps without any evidence at all?
* What sorts of "[[intellectual virtues]]" (admirable mental traits, skills, and habits) are necessary for intellectual excellence and high-quality [[critical thinking]]?

==Origins of the debate: Clifford vs. James==

Contemporary discussions of the ethics of belief stem largely from a famous nineteenth-century exchange between the British mathematician and philosopher [[W. K. Clifford]] and the American philosopher [[William James]]. In 1877 Clifford published an article titled "The Ethics of Belief" in a journal called ''Contemporary Review''. There Clifford argued for a strict form of evidentialism that he summed up in a famous dictum: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone to believe anything on insufficient evidence." As Clifford saw it, people have intellectual as well as moral duties, and both are extremely demanding. People who base their beliefs on wishful thinking, self-interest, blind faith, or other such unreliable grounds are not merely intellectually slovenly; they are immoral. Such bad intellectual habits harm both themselves and society. We sin grievously against our moral and intellectual duty when we form beliefs on insufficient evidence, or ignore or dismiss evidence that is relevant to our beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Chignell, "The Ethics of Belief," ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Section 1.1, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-belief/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford's article provoked a spirited reply from the Harvard philosopher and psychologist William James. In his 1896 essay "The Will to Believe," James argued that there are times when it is permissible, or even obligatory, to form a belief even though we lack sufficient evidence for it. One sort of example he cites is "precursive faith," when belief runs ahead of the evidence but is essential for success (e.g., borderline-excessive self-confidence in an athlete). James made clear that he was not endorsing wishful thinking. He set forth strict conditions for when it was OK to believe without intellectually adequate evidence. Specifically, James laid down that (1) there must be no compelling evidence one way or another (i.e., the issue is "intellectually undecidable"), (2) both options must be "live hypotheses" for the relevant chooser (i.e., the chooser could sincerely believe either option), (3) the choice must be "forced" in the sense that one of the two options must definitely be chosen, and refusing to choose is tantamount to making one of the two choices, and (4) the choice must be "momentous" (i.e., deeply important or significant to the chooser). Famously, James argued that for many people the decision whether or not to believe in God satisfies these four conditions. Such people, James claims, have both an intellectual and a moral right to believe in God, even though by their own admission they lack sufficient evidence to justify this choice.&lt;ref&gt;Chignell, "The Ethics of Belief," Section 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier work on the ethics of belief==

Many thinkers before Clifford and James had important things to say about the ethics of belief. In ancient Greece, [[Socrates]] stressed the importance of self-examination, the pursuit of wisdom, and admitting how little one knows. Ancient skeptics such as [[Pyrrho]], [[Arcesilaus]], and [[Sextus Empiricus]] argued that we should suspend judgment on most controversial matters because powerful and perhaps equally compelling arguments can always be given on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Hazlett, ''A Critical Introduction to Skepticism''. London: Bloomsbury, 2014, pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, [[René Descartes]] wrote extensively on norms of intellectual inquiry in his ''Discourse on Method'' (1637), as did [[John Locke]] in Book 4 of his ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1690). Three important thinkers--[[Blaise Pascal]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard]]—anticipated James in rejecting evidentialism and arguing that there are important matters on which, for practical or existential grounds, we should believe even if we lack sufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Chignell, "The Ethics of Belief," Section 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemic norms==

Rules or standards that properly govern responsible belief-formation and the pursuit of intellectual excellence are what philosophers call epistemic (or "doxastic") norms. Widely accepted epistemic norms include:

* Don't believe on insufficient evidence.
* Proportion your beliefs to the strength of the evidence.
* Don't ignore or dismiss relevant evidence.
* Be willing to revise your beliefs in light of new evidence.
* Avoid wishful thinking.
* Be open-minded and fair-minded.
* Be wary of beliefs that align with your self-interest.
* Admit how little you know.
* Be alert to egocentrism, prejudice, and other mental biases.
* Be careful to draw logical conclusions.
* Base your beliefs on credible, well-substantiated evidence.
* Be consistent.
* Be curious and passionate in the pursuit of knowledge.
* Think clearly and precisely.
* Carefully investigate claims that concern you.
* Actively seek out views that differ from your own.
* Be grateful for constructive criticisms.
* Question your assumptions.
* Think about the implications of your beliefs.
* Persevere through boring or difficult intellectual tasks.
* Be thorough in your intellectual work.
* Stick up for your beliefs, even in the face of peer pressure, ridicule, or intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Richard Paul and Linda Elder, ''Critical Thinking: Tools for Taking Charge of Your Learning and Your Life''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 2001, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
{{see also|1996 Mount Everest disaster}}

In May 1996, several commercial expeditions at base camp of [[Mount Everest]] prepare for a climb to the summit. [[Rob Hall]], who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads [[Adventure Consultants]]; [[Scott Fischer]] is chief guide for Rob's rival, [[Mountain Madness]]. Rob's clients include [[Beck Weathers]], an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran [[Yasuko Namba]], who hopes to complete her final [[Seven Summits]] ascent; and [[Outside (magazine)|''Outside'']] magazine journalist [[Jon Krakauer]]. Helen Wilton manages Rob's base camp.

A month earlier in [[New Zealand]], Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.

Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2:00 P.M., the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about overexertion.

Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the [[Hillary Step]] and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he won't get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit, Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from altitude sickness. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from [[high-altitude pulmonary edema]].

As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Doug's oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.

Scott's condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.

Guide Andy 'Harold' Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.

Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Beck's wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, witnesses Yasuko's corpse, and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten, and in desperate need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scott's guides, Anatoli, finds his body, and moves it off the trail.

Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah. Beck returns to his family, heavily bandaged. Closing titles reveal that he lost both hands and nose to severe frostbite, and that Rob's body remains on Everest.

Totino said, "It was very challenging because we had to re-create the sun, which at Everest is so incredibly sharp and crisp." The team used SoftSun lights for creating sun on the summit, Hillary Step and icefall. "They were 9 feet long and 3 ½ feet in diameter and 100,000 watts. They had to be moved around on cranes because they are very heavy," Totino said.&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; To photograph one scene during which expedition guide Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) is stuck on the mountain in the storm, Totino recalled: "We tented off a portion of the set with some very heavy plastic and brought in these giant refrigerating units, half the size of a semi truck, and we cooled that part of the stage down to about 26 to 28 degrees Fahrenheit [around -3°C] and brought in real snow. Baltasar really wanted the actor to feel like he was frozen. You really see and feel that."&lt;ref name="cinema"/&gt; The film was shot with [[Arri Alexa XT]] cameras, using the Arriraw format.&lt;ref name="cinema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/everest-cinematographer-recalls-very-difficult-818689|title='Everest' Cinematographer Recalls "Very Difficult Shoot"|first=Carolyn | last=Giardina|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Dario Marianelli]] composed the music for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dario Marianelli to Score 'Everest'|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/07/02/dario-marianelli-to-score-everest/|accessdate=13 July 2014|publisher=filmmusicreporter.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film uses the song "Yeh ladka hai Allah"&lt;ref name="Yeh Ladka Hai Allah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeh Ladka Hai Allah|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE8_rNJOQ-0|website=YouTube|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Bollywood film ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham]]'' (2001), when the climbing party first arrives in Nepal. The song plays in the bus when it passes through a busy Nepali bazaar. Another song in the film is "[[All I Wanna Do (Sheryl Crow song)|All I Wanna Do]]", performed by [[Sheryl Crow]], which is accurate to the timing of the film's events, in 1996.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 73%, based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Everest'' boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get out a movie about mountain climbers, even if it's content to tread less challenging narrative terrain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/everest_2015/ |title=Everest |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/everest |title=Everest |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Krakauer]], author of ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', denounced the movie, stating some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director [[Baltasar Kormákur]] responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film and alleging that Krakauer's version conflicted with actual events.&lt;ref name=krakauerNotFan&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGovern|first1=Joe|title=Into Thin Air author Jon Krakauer is not a fan of Everest|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/thin-air-author-jon-krakauer-not-fan-everest|accessdate=23 November 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Into Thin Air"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krakauer |first1=Jon |title=Into Thin Air |date=1997 |publisher=Villard Books |location=United States |isbn=978-0385494786 |page=300ff |pages=416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gt7EQgH8-b4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=into+thin+air&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGo63LnPXeAhWE61MKHRlOBy4Q6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=into%20thin%20air&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 November 2018 |ref=Into Thin Air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fibroblast growth factor 21''' is a [[protein]] that in mammals is encoded by the ''FGF21'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="pmid10858549"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishimura T, Nakatake Y, Konishi M, Itoh N | title = Identification of a novel FGF, FGF-21, preferentially expressed in the liver | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1492 | issue = 1 | pages = 203–6 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10858549 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0167-4781(00)00067-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10858549" /&gt;&lt;ref name="entrez_ 26291"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: FGF21 fibroblast growth factor 21| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=26291| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[protein]] encoded by this gene is a member of the [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) family and specifically a member of the endocrine subfamily which includes FGF23 and FGF15/19. FGF21 is the primary endogenous [[receptor agonist|agonist]] of the [[FGF21 receptor]], which is composed of the [[co-receptor]]s [[FGFR1|FGF receptor 1]] and [[β-Klotho]].&lt;ref name="pmid29727594"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = BonDurant LD, Potthoff MJ | title = Fibroblast Growth Factor 21: A Versatile Regulator of Metabolic Homeostasis. | journal = Annu Rev Nutr. | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29727594 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and are involved in a variety of biological processes including [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]], cell growth, [[morphogenesis]], tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion.&lt;ref name="entrez_ 26291"/&gt; FGFs act through a family of four FGF receptors. Binding is complicated and requires both interaction of the FGF molecule with an FGF receptor and binding to heparin through an heparin binding domain. Endocrine FGFs lack a heparin binding domain and thus can be released into the circulation.

FGF21 is a [[hepatokine]] – i.e., a [[hormone]] secreted by the [[liver]] – that regulates [[simple sugar]] intake and preferences for sweet foods via signaling through FGF21 receptors in the [[paraventricular nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]] and correlates with reduced [[dopamine]] [[neurotransmission]] within the [[nucleus accumbens]].&lt;ref name="pmid26724858"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = von Holstein-Rathlou S, BonDurant LD, Peltekian L, Naber MC, Yin TC, Claflin KE, Urizar AI, Madsen AN, Ratner C, Holst B, Karstoft K, Vandenbeuch A, Anderson CB, Cassell MD, Thompson AP, Solomon TP, Rahmouni K, Kinnamon SC, Pieper AA, Gillum MP, Potthoff MJ | title = FGF21 Mediates Endocrine Control of Simple Sugar Intake and Sweet Taste Preference by the Liver | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–43 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26724858 | pmc = 4756759 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.003 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FGF21 receptor expression in the brain"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Talukdar S, Owen BM, Song P, Hernandez G, Zhang Y, Zhou Y, Scott WT, Paratala B, Turner T, Smith A, Bernardo B, Müller CP, Tang H, Mangelsdorf DJ, Goodwin B, Kliewer SA | title = FGF21 Regulates Sweet and Alcohol Preference | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 344–9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26724861 | pmc = 4749404 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.008 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28467924"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Søberg S, Sandholt CH, Jespersen NZ, Toft U, Madsen AL, von Holstein-Rathlou S, Grevengoed TJ, Christensen KB, Bredie WL, Potthoff MJ, Solomon TP, Scheele C, Linneberg A, Jørgensen T, Pedersen O, Hansen T, Gillum MP, Grarup N | title = FGF21 Is a Sugar-Induced Hormone Associated with Sweet Intake and Preference in Humans | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1045–1053.e6 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28467924 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2017.04.009 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] of the FGF21 gene – the FGF21 rs838133 variant – has been identified as a genetic mechanism responsible for the '''sweet tooth''' [[behavioral phenotype]], a trait associated with cravings for sweets and high sugar consumption, in both humans and mice.&lt;ref name="pmid29641994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frayling TM, Beaumont RN, Jones SE, Yaghootkar H, Tuke MA, Ruth KS, Casanova F, West B, Locke J, Sharp S, Ji Y, Thompson W, Harrison J, Etheridge AS, Gallins PJ, Jima D, Wright F, Zhou Y, Innocenti F, Lindgren CM, Grarup N, Murray A, Freathy RM, Weedon MN, Tyrrell J, Wood AR | title = A Common Allele in FGF21 Associated with Sugar Intake Is Associated with Body Shape, Lower Total Body-Fat Percentage, and Higher Blood Pressure | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 327–336 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29641994 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.070 | url = http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30431-5 | layurl = http://neurosciencenews.com/sweet-tooth-gene-body-fat-8786/| laysource= Neuroscience News |laydate = 14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet tooth"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhill C | title = Liver: FGF21 - the cause of having a 'sweet tooth'? | journal = Nature Reviews.

==Regulation==

FGF21 is specifically induced by [[HMGCS2 (gene)|mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2]] (HMGCS2) activity. The oxidized form of ketone bodies (acetoacetate) in a cultured medium also induced FGF21, possibly via a [[SIRT1|sirtuin 1]] (SIRT1)-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilà-Brau A, De Sousa-Coelho AL, Mayordomo C, Haro D, Marrero PF | title = Human HMGCS2 regulates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and FGF21 expression in HepG2 cell line | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 23 | pages = 20423–30 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21502324 | pmc = 3121469 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.235044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HMGCS2 activity has also been shown to be increased by deacetylation of lysines 310, 447, and 473 via [[SIRT3]] in the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimazu T, Hirschey MD, Hua L, Dittenhafer-Reed KE, Schwer B, Lombard DB, Li Y, Bunkenborg J, Alt FW, Denu JM, Jacobson MP, Verdin E | title = SIRT3 deacetylates mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase 2 and regulates ketone body production | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 654–61 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21109197 | pmc = 3310379 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2010.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While FGF21 is expressed in numerous tissues, including liver, [[brown adipose tissue]], [[white adipose tissue]] (WAT) and pancreas, circulating levels of FGF21 are derived specifically from the liver in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Markan KR, Naber MC, Ameka MK, Anderegg MD, Mangelsdorf DJ, Kliewer SA, Mohammadi M, Potthoff MJ | title = Circulating FGF21 is liver derived and enhances glucose uptake during refeeding and overfeeding | journal = Diabetes | volume = 63 | issue = 12 | pages = 4057–63 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25008183 | pmc = 4238010 | doi = 10.2337/db14-0595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In liver FGF21 expression is regulated by [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPARα]] and levels rise substantially with both fasting and consumption of [[ketogenic diet]]s.

[[Liver X receptor]] (LXR) represses FGF21 in humans via an LXR response element located from -37 to -22 bp on the human FGF21 promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uebanso T, Taketani Y, Yamamoto H, Amo K, Tanaka S, Arai H, Takei Y, Masuda M, Yamanaka-Okumura H, Takeda E | title = Liver X receptor negatively regulates fibroblast growth factor 21 in the fatty liver induced by cholesterol-enriched diet | journal = The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 785–90 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 21889884 | doi = 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2011.03.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

FGF21 stimulates [[glucose]] uptake in [[adipocyte]]s but not in other cell types.&lt;ref name="pmid15902306"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kharitonenkov A, Shiyanova TL, Koester A, Ford AM, Micanovic R, Galbreath EJ, Sandusky GE, Hammond LJ, Moyers JS, Owens RA, Gromada J, Brozinick JT, Hawkins ED, Wroblewski VJ, Li DS, Mehrbod F, Jaskunas SR, Shanafelt AB | title = FGF-21 as a novel metabolic regulator | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 1627–35 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15902306 | pmc = 1088017 | doi = 10.1172/JCI23606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is additive to the activity of [[insulin]]. FGF21 treatment of adipocytes is associated with [[phosphorylation]] of [[FRS2]], a protein linking FGF receptors to the [[MAPK/ERK pathway|Ras/MAP kinase pathway]]. FGF21 injection in [[ob/ob mice]] results in an increase in [[Glut1]] in [[adipose]] tissue. FGF21 also protects animals from diet-induced [[obesity]] when overexpressed in [[transgenic]] mice and lowers blood glucose and [[triglyceride]] levels when administered to [[diabetes mellitus|diabetic]] rodents.&lt;ref name="pmid15902306"/&gt; Treatment of animals with FGF21 results in increased energy expenditure, fat utilization and lipid excretion.&lt;ref name="pmid18687777"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coskun T, Bina HA, Schneider MA, Dunbar JD, Hu CC, Chen Y, Moller DE, Kharitonenkov A | title = Fibroblast growth factor 21 corrects obesity in mice | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 149 | issue = 12 | pages = 6018–27 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18687777 | doi = 10.1210/en.2008-0816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beta Klotho ({{gene|KLB}}) functions as a cofactor essential for FGF21 activity.&lt;ref name="pmid17452648"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogawa Y, Kurosu H, Yamamoto M, Nandi A, Rosenblatt KP, Goetz R, Eliseenkova AV, Mohammadi M, Kuro-o M | title = BetaKlotho is required for metabolic activity of fibroblast growth factor 21 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 18 | pages = 7432–7 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17452648 | pmc = 1855074 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701600104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.7432O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cows plasma FGF21 was nearly undetectable in late pregnancy (LP), peaked at parturition, and then stabilized at lower, chronically elevated concentrations during early lactation (EL). Plasma FGF21 was similarly increased in the absence of parturition when an energy-deficit state was induced by feed restricting late-lactating dairy cows, implicating energy insufficiency as a cause of chronically elevated FGF21 in EL. The liver was the major source of plasma FGF21 in early lactation with little or no contribution by [[white adipose tissue|WAT]], skeletal muscle, and mammary gland. Meaningful expression of the FGF21 coreceptor β-Klotho was restricted to liver and WAT in a survey of 15 tissues that included the mammary gland. Expression of β-Klotho and its subset of interacting FGF receptors was modestly affected by the transition from LP to EL in liver but not in WAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoenberg KM, Giesy SL, Harvatine KJ, Waldron MR, Cheng C, Kharitonenkov A, Boisclair YR | title = Plasma FGF21 is elevated by the intense lipid mobilization of lactation | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 152 | issue = 12 | pages = 4652–61 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21990311 | doi = 10.1210/en.2011-1425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==

Serum FGF-21 levels were significantly increased in patients with [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]] (T2DM) which may indicate a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng X, Zhu B, Jiang F, Fan H | title = Serum FGF-21 levels in type 2 diabetic patients | journal = Endocrine Research | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 142–8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21973233 | doi = 10.3109/07435800.2011.558550 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevated levels also correlate with liver fat content in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan H, Xia M, Chang X, Xu Q, Bian H, Zeng M, Rao S, Yao X, Tu Y, Jia W, Gao X | title = Circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 levels are closely associated with hepatic fat content: a cross-sectional study | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e24895 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21949781 | pmc = 3174975 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024895 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624895Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; and positively correlate with BMI in humans suggesting obesity as a FGF21-resistant state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kralisch S, Fasshauer M | title = Fibroblast growth factor 21: effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in health and disease | journal = Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 354–9 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21505329 | doi = 10.1097/MCO.0b013e328346a326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) of the FGF21 gene – the FGF21 rs838133 variant – has been identified as a genetic mechanism responsible for the sweet tooth [[behavioral phenotype]], a trait associated with cravings for sweets and high sugar consumption, in both humans and mice.&lt;ref name="pmid29641994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweet tooth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26822924" /&gt;

==Animal studies==

Mice lacking FGF21 fail to fully induce [[PPARGC1A|PGC-1α]] expression in response to a prolonged fast and have impaired [[gluconeogenesis]] and [[ketogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Potthoff MJ, Inagaki T, Satapati S, Ding X, He T, Goetz R, Mohammadi M, Finck BN, Mangelsdorf DJ, Kliewer SA, Burgess SC | title = FGF21 induces PGC-1alpha and regulates carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism during the adaptive starvation response | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 26 | pages = 10853–8 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19541642 | pmc = 2705613 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0904187106 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..10610853P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGF21 stimulates phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 and [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK1/2]] in the liver. Acute FGF21 treatment induced hepatic expression of key regulators of gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, and ketogenesis including glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase type 1, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α. In addition, injection of FGF21 was associated with decreased circulating [[insulin]] and free fatty acid levels. FGF21 treatment induced mRNA and protein expression of PGC-1α, but in mice PGC-1α expression was not necessary for the effect of FGF21 on glucose metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher FM, Estall JL, Adams AC, Antonellis PJ, Bina HA, Flier JS, Kharitonenkov A, Spiegelman BM, Maratos-Flier E | title = Integrated regulation of hepatic metabolism by fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in vivo | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 152 | issue = 8 | pages = 2996–3004 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21712364 | pmc = 3138239 | doi = 10.1210/en.2011-0281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mice FGF21 is strongly induced in liver by prolonged fasting via [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPAR-alpha]] and in turn induces the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α and stimulates hepatic gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis. FGF21 also blocks somatic growth and sensitizes mice to a hibernation-like state of torpor, playing a key role in eliciting and coordinating the adaptive starvation response. FGF21 expression is also induced in white adipose tissue by [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPAR-gamma]], which may indicate it also regulates metabolism in the fed state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kliewer SA, Mangelsdorf DJ | title = Fibroblast growth factor 21: from pharmacology to physiology | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 91 | issue = 1 | pages = 254S-257S | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19906798 | pmc = 2793111 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.28449B }}&lt;/ref&gt; FGF21 is induced in both rodents and humans consuming a low protein diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laeger T, Henagan TM, Albarado DC, [[Leanne Redman|Redman LM]], Bray GA, Noland RC, Münzberg H, Hutson SM, Gettys TW, Schwartz MW, Morrison CD | title = FGF21 is an endocrine signal of protein restriction | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 124 | issue = 9 | pages = 3913–22 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25133427 | pmc = 4153701 | doi = 10.1172/JCI74915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27346343"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fontana L, Cummings NE, Arriola Apelo SI, Neuman JC, Kasza I, Schmidt BA, Cava E, Spelta F, Tosti V, Syed FA, Baar EL, Veronese N, Cottrell SE, Fenske RJ, Bertozzi B, Brar HK, Pietka T, Bullock AD, Figenshau RS, Andriole GL, Merrins MJ, Alexander CM, Kimple ME, Lamming DW | title = Decreased Consumption of Branched-Chain Amino Acids Improves Metabolic Health | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 520–530 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27346343 | pmc = 4947548 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.05.092  }}&lt;/ref&gt; FGF21 expression is also induced by diets with reduced levels of the essential dietary amino acid [[methionine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lees EK, Król E, Grant L, Shearer K, Wyse C, Moncur E, Bykowska AS, Mody N, Gettys TW, Delibegovic M | title = Methionine restriction restores a younger metabolic phenotype in adult mice with alterations in fibroblast growth factor 21 | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–27 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 24935677 | pmc = 4331744 | doi = 10.1111/acel.12238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu D, Yang SE, Miller BR, Wisinski JA, Sherman DS, Brinkman JA, Tomasiewicz JL, Cummings NE, Kimple ME, Cryns VL, Lamming DW | title = Short-term methionine deprivation improves metabolic health via sexually dimorphic, mTORC1-independent mechanisms | journal = FASEB Journal | pages = fj201701211R | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29401631 | doi = 10.1096/fj.201701211R }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with reduced levels of branched-chain amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings NE, Williams EM, Kasza I, Konon EN, Schaid MD, Schmidt BA, Poudel C, Sherman DS, Yu D, Arriola Apelo SI, Cottrell SE, Geiger G, Barnes ME, Wisinski JA, Fenske RJ, Matkowskyj KA, Kimple ME, Alexander CM, Merrins MJ, Lamming DW | title = Restoration of metabolic health by decreased consumption of branched-chain amino acids | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 596 | issue = 4 | pages = 623–645 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29266268 | doi = 10.1113/JP275075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activation of [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] and SIRT1 by FGF21 in adipocytes enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity as demonstrated by increases in oxygen consumption, citrate synthase activity, and induction of key metabolic genes. The effects of FGF21 on mitochondrial function require serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11/LKB1), which activates AMPK. Inhibition of AMPK, SIRT1, and PGC-1α activities attenuated the effects of FGF21 on oxygen consumption and gene expression, indicating that FGF21 regulates mitochondrial activity and enhances oxidative capacity through an LKB1-AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α-dependent mechanism in adipocytes, resulting in increased phosphorylation of AMPK, increased cellular NAD+ levels and activation of SIRT1 and deacetylation of SIRT1 targets PGC-1α and [[histone 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chau MD, Gao J, Yang Q, Wu Z, Gromada J | title = Fibroblast growth factor 21 regulates energy metabolism by activating the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 28 | pages = 12553–8 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20616029 | pmc = 2906565 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1006962107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712553C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acutely, the rise in FGF21 in response to alcohol consumption inhibits further drinking. Chronically, the rise in FGF21 expression in the liver may protect against liver damage.&lt;ref name="pmid29727594" /&gt;

The accumulation of [[lipid peroxides]] that results in the process of ferroptosis makes it peroxidation-driven, meaning it is driven by the oxidative degeneration of lipids.  This process of cell death occurs when free radical molecules take [[electron]]s from a lipid molecule to cause the degradation of the lipid molecule.  This degradation is the result of the lipid molecules being oxidized, meaning losing electrons, to the free radical molecules.  This process makes ferroptosis a regulatory form of cell death.  The reason the process of oxidative degradation of a lipid drives ferroptosis is because [[Glutathione peroxidase|glutathione peroxidase 4]] (GPX4), a lipid repair enzyme, undergoes a loss of activity.&lt;ref name="Yang &amp; Stockwell"/&gt;  Researchers have identified roles in which ferroptosis can contribute to the medical field such as in aiding in cancer treatments where this form of cell death can be induced in the human body.&lt;ref name="Lu, et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Bin|last2=Chen|first2=Xiao|last3=Ying|first3=Mei|last4=He|first4=Quiao|last5=Cao|first5=Ji|last6=Yang|first6=Bo|title=The Role of Ferroptosis in Cancer Development and Treatment Response|journal=PubMed Central|date=12 January 2018|doi=10.3389/fphar.2017.00992|pmid=29375387|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5770584/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferroptosis activation plays a regulatory role on growth of tumor cells in the human body.  However, the positive effects of ferroptosis could be potentially neutralized by its disruption of metabolic pathways and disruption of [[homeostasis]] in the human body.&lt;ref name="S. Hao, et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hao|first1=S|last2=Liang|first2=B|last3=Huang|first3=Q|last4=Dong|first4=S|last5=Wu|first5=Z|last6=He|first6=W|last7=Shi|first7=M|title=Metabolic Networks in Ferroptosis|journal=PubMed Central|date=15 February 2018|doi=10.3892/ol.2018.8066|pmid=29556292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death, some of the molecules that regulate ferroptosis are involved in metabolic pathways that regulate cysteine exploitation, glutathione state, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate function, lipid peroxidation and iron homeostasis.&lt;ref name="S. Hao, et. al."/&gt;

==Mechanism of ferroptosis==
Small molecules such as [[erastin]], [[sulfasalazine]], [[sorafenib]], [[altretamine]], RSL-3, ML-162 and ML-210 are known inhibitors of this tumor cell growth and induce ferroptosis. They do not trigger a response of change in apoptosis and therefore have no [[chromatin]] margination or cleave [[Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase|poly ADP-ribose polymerase]] (PARP). Instead, the phenotype of the mitochondria is changed using primarily erastin or RSL3. [[Iron]] is also a necessity for these activators. They therefore can be inhibited by iron [[chelation|chelators]]. Ultimately, cell death induced by erastin and RSL-3 in the phenotype is what makes up ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can also be induced by blocking the enzyme GPX4. Triggering ferroptosis is also caused by inhibiting GSH, which is necessary for the function of GPX4, and ultimately inducing a ferroptotic response in a cell.&lt;ref name="Cao &amp; Dixon"/&gt;

==Comparison to apoptosis in the nervous system==
Another form of cell death that occurs in the nervous system is [[apoptosis]]. Named after the Greek word meaning “to fall away from”, apoptosis results in cell breakage into small, apoptotic bodies taken up through [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=John|title=Mechanisms of Apoptosis|journal=The American Journal of Pathology|date=November 2000|volume=157|issue=5|pages=1415–1430|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64779-7|url=http://ajp.amjpathol.org/article/S0002-9440(10)64779-7/fulltext|pmc=1885741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs continuously within mammalian nervous system processes that begin at fetal development and continue through adult life.  Apoptotic death is crucial for the correct population size of neuronal and [[Neuroglia|glial]] cells. Similarly to ferroptosis, deficiencies in apoptotic processes can result in many health complications, including [[neurodegeneration]].
[[File:Cytochrome C Chemical Structure.jpeg|thumb|Cytochrome C Chemical Structure]]
Within the study of neuronal apoptosis, most research has been conducted on the neurons of the [[superior cervical ganglion]].&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristiansen|first1=M|last2=Ham|first2=J|title=Programmed cell death during neuronal development: the sympathetic neuron model|journal=PubMed Central|date=25 April 2014|doi=10.1038/cdd.2014.47|pmid=24769728|pmc=4207485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for these neurons to survive and innervate their target tissues, they must have [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF).&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt; Normally, NGF binds to a tyrosine kinase receptor, [[Tropomyosin receptor kinase A|TrkA]], which activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt ([[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K-Akt]]) and [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]] (Raf-MEK-ERK) signaling pathways. This occurs during normal development which promotes neuronal growth in the [[sympathetic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt;

During embryonic development, the absence of NGF activates apoptosis by decreasing the activity of the signaling pathways normally activated by NGF.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt;  this pathway of apoptosis has also been named the intrinsic pathway, as it is activated by intrinsic factors over external factors. Without NGF, the neurons of the sympathetic nervous system begin to atrophy, glucose uptake rates fall and the rates of protein synthesis and gene expression slow.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt; Apoptotic death from NGF withdrawal also requires [[caspase]] activity.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt; Upon NGF withdrawal, [[Caspase 3|caspase-3]] activation occurs through an in-vitro pathway beginning with the release of [[Cytochrome c]] from the mitochondria.&lt;ref name="Kristiansen &amp; Ham"/&gt; In a surviving sympathetic neuron, the overexpression of anti-apoptotic [[B-cell CLL/lymphoma|B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2]] (Bcl-2) proteins prevents NGF withdrawal-induced death. However, overexpression of a separate, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, Bax, stimulates the release of [[Cytochrome c|Cytochrome c2]]. Cytochrome c promotes the activation of [[caspase-9]] through the formation of the apoptosome. Once caspase-9 is activated, it can cleave and activate caspase-3 resulting in cell death. Notably, apoptosis does not release intracellular fluid as neurons that are degraded though ferroptosis do. During ferroptosis, neurons release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body. This is a key difference between ferroptosis and apoptosis.

==Ferroptosis in neurons==

[[File:Induction of Neurodegeneration by Ferroptosis.jpeg|thumb|Induction of Neurodegeneration by Ferroptosis]]

Neural connections are constantly changing within the nervous system. [[Synapse|Synaptic]] connections that are used more often are kept intact and promoted, while synaptic connections that are rarely used are subject to degradation. Elevated levels of synaptic connection loss and degradation of neurons are linked to neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;ref name="Hambright et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hambright|first1=WS|last2=Fonseca|first2=RS|last3=Chen|first3=L|last4=Na|first4=R|last5=Ran|first5=Q|title=Ablation of ferroptosis regulator glutathione peroxidase 4 in forebrain neurons promotes cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration|journal=PubMed Central|date=1 February 2017|doi=10.1016/j.redox.2017.01.021|pmid=28212525}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, ferroptosis has been linked to these neurodegenerative diseases. Two new studies show that ferroptosis contributes to neuronal death after intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="pmcid28405617"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Q, Han X, Lan X, Gao Y, Wan J, Durham F, Cheng T, Yang J, Wang Z, Jiang C, Ying M, Koehler RC, Stockwell BR, Wang J | title = Inhibition of neuronal ferroptosis protects hemorrhagic brain. | journal = JCI Insight. | volume = 2 | issue = 7 | pages = e90777 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 27143417 | pmc = 5374066 | doi = 10.1172/jci.insight.90777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmcid30065697"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Q, Weiland A, Chen X, et al. | title = Ultrastructural Characteristics of Neuronal Death and White Matter Injury in Mouse Brain Tissues After Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Coexistence of Ferroptosis, Autophagy, and Necrosis. | journal = Front Neurol| volume = 9 | pages = 581 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 30065697 | pmc = 6056664 | doi = 10.3389/fneur.2018.00581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons that are degraded through ferroptosis release lipid metabolites from inside the cell body. The lipid metabolites are harmful to surrounding neurons, causing inflammation in the brain. Inflammation is a pathological feature of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s disease]] and intracerebral hemorrhage.

In a study performed using mice it was found that absence of a certain enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 ([[GPX4|Gpx4]]), enhanced activity of ferroptosis. Foods high in [[Vitamin E]] promote Gpx4 activity, consequently inhibiting ferroptosis and preventing inflammation in brain regions. In the experimental group of mice that were manipulated to have decreased Gpx4 levels, mice were observed to have cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration of hippocampal neurons, again linking ferroptosis to neurodegenerative diseases.

Similarly, presence of transcription factors, specifically [[ATF4|ATF-4]], can determine how readily a neuron can undergo cell death. The presence of ATF-4 promotes resistance in cells against ferroptosis. However, this resistance can cause other diseases, such as cancer, to progress and become malignant. While ATF-4 provides resistance ferroptosis, an abundance of ATF-4 causes neurodegeneration.

==Role of ferroptosis in cancer treatment==

[[File:Initiation of Ferroptosis By Inhibition of Xc- System of Gpx4 Activity.jpeg|thumb|Initiation of Ferroptosis By Inhibition of Xc- System of Gpx4 Activity]]

Ferroptosis is a more controlled form of programmed cell death. With small molecules inducing ferroptosis, it inhibits tumor growth and increases drug resistance. It is still unknown the exact mechanism in which ferroptosis inhibits tumor growth, but based on early experiments, it could be used to treat tumor cells and ultimately cancer.
Based on the figure shown, initiating ferroptosis can be done by eliminating GPX4 activity through Xc- (erastin mediated). The inhibition or degradation of GPX4 by erastin or RSL3 has been noticed to be the primary mechanism that will trigger ferroptosis. Since ferroptosis is an iron dependent mechanism, an accumulation of lipid ROS kills the cells that have begun to undergo ferroptosis and eliminates them completely.

Ferroptosis can be used to treat several different types of cancer, each seemingly different forms of the disease. This method of cell death has been tested either in mice, or is in the early stages of research and has not yet been fully tested. This includes cancer types such as:

* [[Breast cancer|Breast]]
* [[Acute myeloid leukemia]]
* [[Pancreatic cancer|Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma]]
* [[Ovarian cancer|Ovarian]]
* [[B-cell lymphoma|B cell lymphoma]]
* [[Renal cell carcinoma]]s
* [[Lung cancer|Lung]]
* [[Glioblastoma]]

These forms of cancer have been hypothesized to be highly sensitive to ferroptosis, or react to erastin or Xc- in a way that minimizes the tumor cells or responds to this treatment with a result of cell death. An upregulation of iron levels has also been seen to induce ferroptosis in certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer.&lt;ref name="Lu, et. al."/&gt; Breast cancer cells have exhibited vulnerability to ferroptosis via a combination of siramesine and lapatinib.  These cells also exhibited an autophagic cycle independent of ferroptotic activity, indicating that the two different forms of cell death could be controlled to activate at specific times following treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, Shumei, Rebecca F. Dielschneider, Elizabeth S. Henson, Wenyan Xiao, Tricia R. Choquette, Anna R. Blankstein, Yongqiang Chen, and Spencer B. Gibson. “Ferroptosis and Autophagy Induced Cell Death Occur Independently after Siramesine and Lapatinib Treatment in Breast Cancer Cells.” PLOS ONE 12, no. 8 (August 21, 2017): e0182921. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Future Character of Conflict''' was a study produced by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]]'s [[Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre]] (DCDC).  It was undertaken alongside the Centre's [[Global Strategic Trends Programme]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The report details global trends that indicate increasing [[instability]] and growing opportunity for confrontation and group conflict.  [[State failure]], [[Extremism|extremists]], increased competition for resources and the changing global [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] will dictate why, where and how conflict occurs.  The study concludes that the character of conflict will continue to evolve.  Though it is impossible to accurately predict the exact character of the future conflict, in many future operations the armed forces are likely to face a range of simultaneous threats and adversaries in an anarchic and extended operating area.

'''''Gromia sphaerica''''' is a large spherical [[testate amoebae|testate amoeba]], a single-celled organism classed among the [[protist]]s and is the largest in the genus ''[[Gromia]]''. It was discovered in 2000, along the [[Oman margin]] of the [[Arabian sea]], at depths from {{convert|1163|to|1194|m|ft|sp=us}}. Specimens range in size from {{convert|4.7|to|38|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. The [[Test (biology)|test]] (organic shell) is usually spherical in shape and honeycombed with pores. There are filaments on the bottom of the organism, where it is in contact with the [[seafloor]], and it is mostly filled with [[stercomata]] (waste pellets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gooday |first1=Andrew J |last2=Bowser |first2=Samuel S |last3=Bett |first3=Brian J |last4=Smith |first4=Craig R |title=A large testate protist, Gromia sphaerica sp. nov.

'''Heather MacAllister''' (February 25, 1968 – February 13, 2007) was an [[Americans|American]] [[performer]] and [[activist]] for [[social justice]] in a number of areas Including [[anti-racism]] and [[LGBT rights]] but was particularly active in the [[fat acceptance movement]]. MacAllister was best known for her burlesque work, performing on stage as '''Reva Lucian''', a play on 'revolution', and '''Ms. Demeanor'''.

Suffering from [[ovarian cancer]], Heather MacAllister moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon in June 2006. Her partner, author and stand-up comedian Kelli Dunham, moved from the East Coast to care for her until her death by [[assisted suicide]] in February 2007.&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Wyatt|title=Heather MacAllister -- burlesque performer, activist|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Heather-MacAllister-burlesque-performer-2646581.php|accessdate=1 April 2018|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=February 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Palivos described her friend:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The spirit of Heather was really about three things: loving yourself and taking care of self and others; social justice in whatever form; and she was a performer and artist. She was glamorous, an extraordinary performer and stunningly beautiful.&lt;ref name=Buchanan/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biography==

During a lifetime of art and activism Heather MacAllister was involved in a range of [[social justice]] issues, particularly [[LGBT rights]], [[anti-racism]] and addressing [[anti-fat bias]]. Her tours as a fat burlesque performer challenged both those within and outside the [[fat acceptance movement]] on the notion of [[The Thin Ideal]] as a pre-requisquite for sexual attractiveness. Six years after her death, friend Stacy Bias recalls MacAllister's approach to activism: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Heather had an ability to perceive others in a powerful way - such that she could spend an hour chatting with someone and then deliver a simple sentence that had the ability to transform their lives in a small but memorable way. In the case of many, that transforming power was much larger... She had a passion for community and activism that, in some ways, transcended the individual (in ways that the individual sometimes found uncomfortable) in favor of the vision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bias|first=Stacy|title=Remembering Heather MacAllister|url=http://stacybias.net/2013/02/remembering_heather_macallister/|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fat activism===
Whilst she was living in Michigan, Heather MacAllister's fat activism included the 1992 founding of the Venus Group, a social and support network for large women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Michelle|title=Burlesque and the New Bump-n-Grind|year=2004|publisher=Speck Books|isbn=978-0972577625|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LkmhFPTc_W8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Heather+MacAllister+fat#v=onepage&amp;q=Heather%20MacAllister%20fat&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also contributed to Fat Girl zine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stinson|first=Susan|title=Heather MacAllister|url=http://susanstinson.livejournal.com/144398.html?thread=1167630|accessdate= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161105180907/http://susanstinson.livejournal.com/144398.html |archive-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 1990s and lobbied for the weight discrimination act that was passed in San Francisco in 2000. MacAllister was on the board of NoLose, an organization for fat lesbians.

MacAllister founded Big Burlesque and the Fat-Bottom Revue, the world's first all-fat burlesque performance group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heather MacAllister aka Reva Lucian|url=http://profileengine.com/groups/profile/439199708/heather-macallister-aka-reva-lucian#/groups/profile/439199708/heather-macallister-aka-reva-lucian?offset=30&amp;ajax_seq=1|publisher=Profile engine.com|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035415/http://profileengine.com/groups/profile/439199708/heather-macallister-aka-reva-lucian#/groups/profile/439199708/heather-macallister-aka-reva-lucian?offset=30&amp;ajax_seq=1|archive-date=2018-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of which she was also the artistic director. She argued that erotic performance allowed fat women to express a sexuality "which has been underaffirmed and made negative in the popular culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Elizabeth|title=Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity and the Commerce of Sex|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226044620|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Ua3jomuHVIC&amp;dq=Heather+MacAllister+fat}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Her stage names were Ms. Demeanor and Reva Lucian (a play on the word "revolution"). MacAllister toured both [[fat acceptance movement|size acceptance]] workshops and burlesque performances nationwide. Venues at which she appeared or conducted workshops included the True Spirit Conference in Washington, D.C., the National Women's Music Festival in Indiana, the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], [[Eastern Michigan University]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Michigan State University]], the Abundia Retreat in Illinois, the NoLose Conference in New Jersey, Fat Girl Speaks in Oregon, the Tease-o-Rama burlesque convention, and [[Burning Man]] in Nevada. Heather MacAllister described her belief in burlesque as activism: "Any time there is a fat person onstage as anything besides the butt of a joke, it’s political. Add physical movement, then dance, then sexuality and you have a revolutionary act." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Full Body by Leonard Nimmoy|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/Artist_Pages/Nimoy/pages/MaxBeaut.htm|publisher=R. Michelson Galleries|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Heather MacAllister received the Queer Cultural Activist Award from the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club.&lt;ref name=Buchanan/&gt;

MacAllister appeared posthumously in the art photography book ''The Full Body Project'' by photographer and actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] (of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fame). The book is a compilation of photographs including those taken of MacAllister and her troupe for a 2005 New York City art photography show called "Maximum Beauty" which opened at the Bonni Benrubi gallery on 57th street in New York City. The book was released in 2007 and dedicated to Heather MacAllister. Before her death she had requested that mourners made donations to her Fat Fashion Scholarship Fund. MacAllister also contributed a chapter to ''The Fat Studies Reader'' entitled 'Embodying Fat Liberation' that was posthumously published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacAllister|first=Heather|title=Embodying Fat Liberation in The Fat Studies Reader|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Fat_Studies_Reader.html?id=XtLWPWNO8gUC|isbn=9780814776407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activism===
In the late 1990s Heather MacAllister was the director of the [[LGBT]] resource center at the Eastern University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higbee|first=Mark|title=Heather MacAllister, EMU grad, dies at 38|url=http://emutalk.org/2007/02/heather-macallister-emu-grad-dies-at-38/|publisher=EMUtalk|accessdate=1 April 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110815162936/http://emutalk.org/2007/02/heather-macallister-emu-grad-dies-at-38/ |archive-date= 15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2002, MacAllister worked as a field organizer for the [[Triangle Foundation]], a [[gay rights]] group in Michigan. The organization, now known as [[Equality Michigan]], gives an award in Heather's honor to a community activist each year.&lt;ref name="btw"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=27211 | title=Triangle dinner a tribute to departing Montgomery | work=Between the Lines | date=10 April 2007 | accessdate=21 July 2013 | author=Michael, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacAllister worked to protect Muslim and Arab-American civil rights after [[9-11]] and served on the board of [[Al-Fatiha]], America's national organization for sexual minority Muslims. She also served on the board of Transgender Michigan, a group dedicated to protecting transgender individuals from harassment and discrimination.

'''''Hidden City''''' is a [[Political cinema|political thriller]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Poliakoff]]. It starred [[Charles Dance]], Cassie Stuart, [[Richard E. Grant]] and [[Bill Paterson (actor)|Bill Paterson]], and was Poliakoff's directorial debut.&lt;ref&gt;'''She's Been Away &amp; Hidden City'', Stephen Poliakoff, Methuen Drama, 1989, page page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a limited theatrical release in 1988, before being shown in [[Channel 4]]'s ''Film on Four'' strand on 9 May 1989 (postponed from 9 March 1989).&lt;ref&gt;''The Kaleidoscope British Independent Television Drama Research Guide'', [[Kaleidoscope Publishing]], 2010, page 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

Infuriated by receiving the wrong piece of film, statistician James Richards (Dance) arranges for the researcher who made the mistake, Sharon Newton (Stuart), to be sacked. When she realises that he is responsible, Sharon contacts James and demands his help. She has obtained a mysterious piece of film which, while superficially a collection of street scenes, seems to show the abduction of a woman. The film abruptly cuts off, instructing the viewer to see ''The Hedgerows of England''. As this film has been registered classified by the Ministry of Defence, Sharon, obsessed by the identity of the woman, needs James, with his official credentials, to help her find it.

James tracks down the location of the film, but a visit to an old tram depot and an archive beneath Oxford Street proves frustrating, as the film has now been moved. He and Sharon chase it to a landfill site, where they notice a police presence, and then to the incinerator at Edmonton, where they manage to rescue it before it is burned. But upon viewing the film, they find that it is very poor quality, revealing only a dark image of a woman in front of some kind of tribunal. A card at the end tells them that the next film to look for is called ''Hop-Picking in Kent''. James is not entirely unhappy to find his comfortable life disrupted by the search for the film, and wakes up, after a drunken evening spent at a video duplication service, at Sharon's house, where he discovers that she has a young daughter. Needing to go out to work, she leaves her daughter with James.

Taking the baby out to meet his ex-wife, James is cornered by two officials, who beat him up and demand to know the whereabouts of something he has found. Shaken, he goes to see his City friend Anthony (Paterson), who advises him to go home and forget about it. But Anthony also drops a hint that he too has been questioned, and James realises that he is in serious danger. Returning to his house, he finds it has been searched and realises that the officials want some medical records which he idly picked up from the landfill site. After an unexpected encounter with them, James manages to escape and is reunited with a distressed Sharon, who has been worried about her daughter.

Meanwhile, a friend of Sharon's does some illicit searching for her in the archives and discovers the film ''Hop-Picking In Kent''. Within the bland information film is a full version of the mysterious film, featuring a different woman along with a man. Some kind of emergency has occurred and left the participants dead. Moving forward in time, the film documents the birth of an abruptly aborted government project named Magnificat. The women from the original film then reappears, sitting in a location which James recognises: an official building which has re-opened as a café. The film ends with the woman reunited with a horribly scarred man and confronting the cameraman, asking why he is filming. James suggests that this was the result of an accident with nuclear power which has been hushed up and that the café was once a secure convalescent unit. He also wonders why the film was made in the first place. James and Sharon decide to keep the film secret and he throws the offending medical records into a bin. Meanwhile, somewhere in London, a cleaner has her break in an isolated room where the remnants of Project Magnificat are still stored.

The '''hippogriff''', or sometimes spelled '''hippogryph''' ({{lang-el|Ιππόγρυπας}}), is a [[legendary creature]] which has the front half of an [[eagle]] and the hind half of a [[horse]].

The first recorded mention of the hippogriff was made by the Latin poet [[Virgil]] in his ''[[Eclogues]]''. Though sometimes depicted during the Classical Era and during the rule of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], it was used by [[Ludovico Ariosto]] in his ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', at the beginning of the 16th century.  Within the poem, the hippogriff is a steed born of a [[mare]] and a [[griffin]]—it is extremely fast and is presented as being able to fly around the world and to the Moon.  It is ridden by [[Magic (paranormal)|magicians]] and the wandering knight [[Ruggiero (character)|Ruggiero]], who, from the creature’s back, frees the beautiful [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]].

Sometimes depicted on coats of arms, the hippogriff became a subject of visual art in the 19th century, when it was often drawn by [[Gustave Doré]].

The word ''hippogriff'', also spelled ''hippogryph'',&lt;ref name="Complement du Dictionnaire de l'Académie française"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nks_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA478 |title=Complément du Diction sire de l'Académie française|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Needs source - obviously the Greek is closer to our spelling, and has the all-important "h" in it; also, we used Latin and Greek in the 16th century, not Italian'': is an Anglicisation of the Italian ''ippogrifo'', which was used by [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]] in 1516. This name --&gt; is derived from the {{lang-grc|ἵππος}} {{grc-transl|ἵππος}}, meaning "horse", and the Italian ''grifo'' meaning "[[griffin]]" (from Latin ''gryp'' or ''gryphus''), which denotes another mythical creature, with the head of an eagle and body of a lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff.&lt;ref name="Larousse"&gt;{{harvsp|Sevestre|Rosier|1983|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner124"&gt;{{harvsp|Wagner|2006|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''hippogriff'' was adopted into English shortly before 1615.&lt;ref name="Websteren"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/hippogriff?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=hippogriff&amp;sa=Search#906|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228193149/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Hippogriff?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Hippogriff&amp;sa=Search#906|archivedate=2011-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{primary sources|section|date=May 2015}}
The hippogriff is a symbol of the Greek god [[Apollo]], either through his connection to [[the Muses]] or as god of the sun.&lt;ref name="Lieber1831"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lieber|first=Francis|title=Encuclopaedia Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0e0IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA339|accessdate=31 May 2015|year=1831|pages=339–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buonarotti is stated to have believed that the worship of Apollo, and with him the symbol of the hippogriff, came to the Greeks from cultures to the east.&lt;ref name="Lieber1831"/&gt;

Of the heraldic representations of the hippogriff, [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] states that hybrid fantastical creatures' depictions are "ugly, inartistic, and unnecessary. Their representation leaves one with a disappointed feeling of crudity of draughtsmanship."&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox-Davies|first=Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSeEWjQCTIAC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=31 May 2015|year=2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=9781602390010|pages=232–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Vinycomb]] states that the hippogriff is not used in the British heraldic tradition.&lt;ref name="Vinycomb1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinycomb|first=John|title=Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art With Special Reference to Their Use in British Heraldry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T8jTz8spvjoC&amp;pg=PT123|accessdate=31 May 2015|year=1969|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=9781465552556|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Orlando Furioso 9.jpg|thumb|300px|Hippogriff, illustration by [[Gustave Doré]] for ''Orlando furioso''.]]
[[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s poem, ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) contains description (canto IV):

::::XVIII
:no fiction wrought magic lore,
:But natural was the steed the wizard pressed;
:For him a filly to griffin bore;
:Hight hippogryph. In wings and beak and crest,
:Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;
:But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest.
:Such on Riphaean hills, though rarely found,
:Are bred, beyond the frozen ocean's bound.

::::XIX
:Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,
:The wizard thought but how to tame the foal;
:And, in a month, instructed him to bear
:Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;
:And execute on earth or in mid air,
:All shifts of manege, course and caracole;
:He with such labour wrought.  This only real,
:Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.

According to [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''Legends of Charlemagne'':
{{cquote|Like a griffin, it has the head of an eagle, claws armed with talons, and wings covered with feathers, the rest of its body being that of a horse. This strange animal is called a Hippogriff. The hippogriff is said to be an evil spirit resting and possessing its soul in that of a horse and griffon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Bulfinch]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4927 ''Legends of Charlemagne''], 1863.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Beliefs and symbolism==

According to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed to live near Céret, in the [[County of Roussillon]] of modern-day France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near Mas Carol.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{harvsp|Bo i Montégut|1978|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the existence of the hippogriff, such as [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]] describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on religion in 1862, which argues that such an animal can neither be a divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite clearly details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture.  The Sphinx is the most well known such hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to support its weight, the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible, which proves—without question—that it does not exist.&lt;ref name =Poulin/&gt;

In some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are natural enemies.&lt;ref name =Poulin&gt;{{cite book|first1=Paulin|last1=Poulin|authorlink=|title=Qu'est-ce que l'homme ?

'''Ivan Hristov Bashev''' ({{lang-bg|Иван Христов Башев}}) (February 11, 1916 &amp;ndash; December 13, 1971) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[diplomat]] and Foreign Minister of Bulgaria from 1962 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rulers.org/fm1.html Bulgaria, List of Foreign Ministers by country and by year]&lt;/ref&gt; Bashev headed the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] until his death on December 13, 1971 and is considered one of "most remarkable foreign ministers of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b-info.com/places/Bulgaria/news/96-02/feb13.bta 6. Three generations of Bulgarian diplomats pay tribute to former Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivan Mashev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235325/http://www.b-info.com/places/Bulgaria/news/96-02/feb13.bta |date=2007-09-26 }}, Embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria - Washington D.C., [[Bulgarian Telegraph Agency]], 13 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bashev was born February 11, 1916 in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. A [[lawyer]] by education, he was [[editor-in-chief]] of the national daily [[Narodna Mladezh]] from 1944 to 1946. He joined the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] in late 1946 and was elected to the party's central committee in 1962.

In 1956, Bashev was appointed [[Government of Bulgaria|Deputy Minister of Education]] followed by an appointment as [[Government of Bulgaria|Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. In 1962, he became [[Foreign Minister]] for the new government that was formed by [[Todor Zhivkov]] after the fall of the [[Anton Yugov]] government and the defeat of the [[Stalinist]] and pro-Chinese party faction headed by [[Vulko Chervenkov]]. In 1966, Zhivkov reorganized his government, yet Bashev was allowed to retain his post. When the [[Stanko Todorov]] cabinet was formed in July 1971, he again was allowed to keep his post. 

Bashev was instrumental in reestablishing relations between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Denmark]]. On April 7, 1968 he became the first  [[Eastern Bloc]] Foreign Minister to visit [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. His visits were instrumental in the elimination of the [[visa regime]] between Bulgaria and Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. (''an ironic sidenote: In 1989, just after the establishment of a real [[parliamentary democracy]] in [[Bulgaria]], those agreements were denounced and the visa regime was restored'').

On December 13, 1971 Bashev was found frozen to death. According to a [[Foreign Ministry]] statement, he had been caught in a sudden snowstorm while skiing alone on mount [[Vitosha]] near [[Sofia]]. He had apparently fallen, been injured, and died of [[hypothermia]] and exhaustion before being found by the mountain rescue service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rulers.org/indexb1.html#bashe Bashev, Ivan (Hristov)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Loudon was born in [[Cambuslang]], [[Lanarkshire]], Scotland to a respectable farmer. Therefore, as he was growing up, he developed a practical knowledge of plants and farming. As a young man, Loudon studied [[biology]], botany and agriculture at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. When working on the layout of farms in South Scotland, he described himself as a [[landscape planning|landscape planner]]. This was a time when open field land was being converted from [[run rig]] with 'ferm touns' to the landscape of [[enclosure]], which now dominates British agriculture.

Loudon developed a limp as a young man, and later became crippled with [[arthritis]]. He undertook a second Grand Tour of Europe and also visited the Near East.&lt;ref name="LW 2007"/&gt; In 1826, crippled by rheumatism and arthritis, he had to endure an amputation at his right shoulder after a botched operation to correct a broken arm. He learnt to write and draw with his left arm and hired a draughtsman to prepare his plans.&lt;ref name=Obituary1844&gt;{{cite journal|last1="The Britiannia"|title=Obituary J C Loudon, Esq., F.L.S.|journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History|date=1844|volume=13|pages=78–80|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2286679#page/94/mode/1up|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he cured himself of an [[opium]] habit that had been keeping the pain at bay.

Design of the municipal cemetery at Southampton was Loudon's final project. Despite advanced lung cancer, he corrected the final proofs for his latest encyclopaedia. He travelled to Bath to inspect the site for another cemetery; and then to Oxford to see a client. On his return to London, his doctor told him that he was dying; he died, penniless, in the arms of his wife in December 1843. He is buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Skempton (2002) ''A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers in Great Britain''. p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage ==
In 1830, when Loudon was 47 years old, he asked a friend to invite the author of ''[[The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century]]''  to lunch. He had recently reviewed and admired the inventions in this novel in an article published in his ''Gardener's Magazine''. Set in 2126 AD, it is an early example of [[science fiction]]. England has become an absolute monarchy and it features an early Internet, espresso machines, and air-conditioning. The author was [[Jane C. Loudon|Jane Webb]] who, having been left penniless at 17 by the death of her father, had turned to writing as a profession. She had published the book anonymously. They married seven months later and had a daughter, Agnes.

Loudon loved the fantastical and his wife's expression of it. Their marriage not only symbolized a mutual admiration of one another's minds, but a number of innovations in the world of gardening. Throughout their marriage, Jane Loudon encountered her husband's work and decided to create her own guides to make gardening more accessible to young women. The Loudons were considered the leading horticulturalists of their day, and their circle of friends included [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]].

== Work ==

===Horticultural work===
[[File:Greenhouse John Claudius Loudon 1818.png|thumb|240px|Design greenhouse for [[Royal Horticultural Society]], 1818.]] 
Around 1803, Loudon published an article entitled ''Observations on Laying out the Public Spaces in London''. It recommended the introduction of lighter trees rather than those with dense [[foliage|canopies]]. Loudon was attacked by [[rheumatic fever]] in 1806 which left him crippled, but this illness did not affect his writing. As his condition deteriorated over time, Loudon was forced to use the services of a [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] and other aids.

Beginning in 1808, Loudon was employed by [[George Frederick Stratton]] to landscape and farm his property, [[Tew Park]], where he was able to set up a school for young men to be instructed in theory of farming and modes of [[Tillage|cultivating]] the soil. Loudon's design was a model of efficiency and convenience reflected in elegance and refinement. In conjunction with the goals of diffusing agricultural knowledge, Loudon published a pamphlet entitled ''The Utility of Agricultural Knowledge to the Sons of the Landed Proprietors of Great Britain, &amp;c., by a Scotch Farmer and Land-Agent.''

After travelling through Europe from 1813 to 1814, Loudon began to focus on the improvement of the construction of [[greenhouse]]s and other agricultural systems. He ultimately developed a design for hinged surfaces that could be adjusted depending on the angle of the sun. Loudon also developed plans for industrial worker housing and [[Passive solar|solar heat]]ing systems. In 1815, he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Loudon established himself as a [[Urban planning|city planner]], decades before [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and others began to work. His vision for the possibility of long term planning for London's green spaces was illustrated within his work, ''Hints for Breathing Places for Metropolis'' published in 1829. He envisioned city growth being carefully shaped and circulation influenced by the inclusion of [[green belt]]s.

In 1832, Loudon established the design theory entitled ''[[Gardenesque]]''. In this style, attention was given to the individual plant and placement in the best conditions for them to grow to their potential. 19th century thought was punctuated by the belief that gardens should not mimic nature, so ''Gardenesque'' offered a solution by introducing exotics into gardens and basing layouts on abstract shapes.

Loudon was instrumental in the adoption of the term ''[[landscape architecture]]'' by the modern profession. He took up the term from [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.

===Publications===
[[File:An Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture.djvu|page=7|thumb|upright|''An Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture'', 1836]]
Loudon was a prolific horticultural and [[landscape design]] writer. Through his publications, he hoped to spread his ideals of the creation of common space and the improvement of city planning and develop an awareness and interest in agriculture and horticulture. Through his magazines and works, he was able to communicate with lay folk as well as other professionals.

He wrote ''An Encyclopædia of Gardening'' in 1822. After its success Loudon published ''The Encyclopedia of Agriculture'' in 1825. He founded the ''Gardener's Magazine'', the first periodical devoted solely to horticulture, in 1826. A short time later, he commenced the ''[[Magazine of Natural History]]'' in 1828.

Perhaps the most significant of these, certainly the most time-consuming and costly, was ''Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum''. This work was published in three formats: with the plates entirely uncoloured, with botanical details hand-coloured, and fully hand-coloured. Work began in 1830 and it was first issued in sixty-three monthly parts from January 1835 to July 1838. It presented: an exhaustive account of all the trees and shrubs growing in Great Britain and their history; notes on remarkable examples growing in individual gardens; drawings of leaves, twigs, fruits, and the shapes of leafless trees; and entire portraits of trees in their young and mature state. All were drawn from life, many being from the parkland grounds of [[Syon House]], one of the homes of the Duke of Northumberland to whom the work was dedicated, or from [[Loddiges]]' arboretum. "It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J. C. Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work" W. J. Bean notes, in ''Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles''. The publication also ruined him financially, as he ended up with many unsold copies of the eight-volume work and went deep into debt.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

[[File:St John the Baptist, Pinner, September 2015 15.jpg|thumb|The Loudon memorial in Pinner churchyard]]
His work on cemeteries also was significant. Churchyards were becoming full, especially in urban areas, and new cemeteries were being opened by private enterprises. Loudon designed only three cemeteries ([[Bath Abbey Cemetery]], [[Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge]], and [[Southampton Old Cemetery]] where the design was rejected)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An unusual creation by Loudon is the memorial to his parents, which stands in the grounds of [[St John the Baptist, Pinner|St John the Baptist]], [[Pinner]]'s parish church. It is in the form of a stone wedge, with a fake stone sarcophagus within.

Loudon thought that public improvements should be undertaken in a democratic fashion and in a comprehensive and reasonable manner, not sporadically by the benevolence of the wealthy. In 1839, he was commissioned to design the [[Arboretum]] at [[Derby]]. In his commissions, Loudon displayed the principles that he advocated in his writings; he took into account the general public, aiming to create a space where the classes could mingle easily as well as creating community pride. Plantings were labelled extensively. Loudon's design for the [[Derby Arboretum]] paralleled the [[Loddiges]] arboretum at [[Abney Park Cemetery|Abney Park]] and served as inspiration for the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew]].

'''Key person insurance''', also commonly called '''keyman insurance''' and '''key man insurance''' or 'key employee insurance', is an important form of [[business insurance]]. There is no legal definition of "key person insurance". In general, it can be described as an [[insurance policy]] taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, key person insurance is a standard life insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key person’s usefulness to the business. Key person policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity.  Key person insurance does not [[Indemnity|indemnify]] the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified in the insurance policy.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/insurance/how-would-your-business-cope-if-a-key-person-fell-ill-1870065.html|title=How would your business cope if a key person fell ill?|date=17 January 2010|publisher=[[The Independent]]|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses have a key person who is responsible for the majority of profits or has a unique and hard to replace skill set such as Intellectual Property that is vital to the organisation. An employer may take out a key person insurance policy on the life or health of any employee whose knowledge, work, or overall contribution is considered uniquely valuable to the company.  The employer does this to offset the costs (such as hiring temporary help or recruiting a successor) and losses (such as a decreased ability to transact business until successors are trained) which the employer is likely to suffer in the event of the loss of a key person.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson, Jack E. &amp; Corbett|first=Richard B.|date=January 1987|title=Key Man Insurance and Market Reaction: A Comment|journal=The Journal of Insurance Issues and Practices|publisher=Western Risk and Insurance Association|volume=10|issue=1|pages=53–61|jstor=41943220|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurable losses==
There are four categories of loss for which key person insurance can provide compensation:

#Losses related to the extended period when a key person is unable to work, to provide temporary personnel and, if necessary to finance the recruitment and training of a replacement.
#Insurance to protect profits. For example, offsetting lost income from lost sales, losses resulting from the delay or cancellation of any business project that the key person was involved in, loss of opportunity to expand, loss of specialised skills or knowledge.
#Insurance to protect [[shareholders]] or [[partnership]] interests. Typically this is insurance to enable shareholdings or partnership interests to be purchased by existing shareholders or partners.
#Insurance for anyone involved in guaranteeing business loans or banking facilities. The value of insurance coverage is arranged to equal the value of the guarantee.

==Key person definition==
Key people are individuals whose skills, knowledge, experience or leadership are important to a business’ continued financial success. Should something happen to one of these individuals it is likely that their loss will have a detrimental impact on the profitability of the business and will cause financial strain. Examples of a key individual include, but are not limited to: company directors, sales directors, IT specialist, managing directors and heads of product development.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Worth attribution==
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Deciding on the sum of money to ensure the key person is dependent on the company and the reason for insuring that individual. It can be to cover a loan or investment amount, or it can be dependent on working out the worth of the person to the company. It is recommended that you think about potential loss of profits, the cost of replacement and any debts that would need to be covered to keep the company running without that person.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Loss of profits can be caused as a result of the loss of company reputation, the loss of clients or a decline in sales. For example, if a key sales manager had built up a relationship with key clients, they may no longer want to work with the business if that key person were no longer around. This can cause them to go elsewhere and cause a dip in sales figures. In addition to this, the cost of training, recruitment and temporary cover to find a replacement can be high. This also needs to be factored into the amount of cover that is taken out. The company would need to consider how they would be impacted as a result of a loss of a key person in different ways to determine how much that individual is worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance|url=https://businesscoverexpert.com/key-man-insurance/|website=businesscoverexpert.com/|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy ownership==
Key person insurance policies can be owned in a number of ways depending on the needs of the business. It is common for a business to own the policy with claim proceeds being paid directly to the business. There is no legislative or insurable requirement for a policy to be owned by a specific party or entity and there may be circumstances be it for taxation or policy continuation purposes where policies may be owned and paid for by the insured person directly or owned by another individual.

==Advantages==
# In case of death of a keyman the company is paid money to cope up with the loss.
# In the USA, any business concern buying keyman insurance for its employee can claim a deduction for the premium paid for the policy as a business expense under Section 37(1) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}} Tax deductions may also apply in other countries. 
# This policy can be used as either an extra superannuation benefit or an ex-gratia payment to the key employee during the service period. If the company receives the proceeds on maturity, then they may be taxable. (With recent changes in rules, only Term Plan is available under Key  Man Insurance. Hence, there will not be any maturity benefit)
# No need of giving advanced intimation to the income tax authorities.
# The company can also raise loans on the policy from LIC. (On Term Plan,  no loan is available)
# For the executives earning high salaries, this policy can be given as a hike in salary and saves income tax.
# It becomes a great help to the business for their [[tax planning]].
# The directors can also safeguard their immediate family from getting affected by the vagaries of the industry and the various business cycles that the business has to encounter.
# Key person insurance policy helps to improve the retention of key human resources of the business.

==Disadvantages==
# The amount on claim or maturity under a key person insurance policy is not exempt under Section 10 (10D) of the [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|Income Tax Act]] if the company is paying the premiums unless the policy is assigned to the key person who himself/herself pay the premium.
# If the policy is surrendered then the amount endorsed is taxable in the hands of key man as profit in lieu of salary.

==Taxation==
The tax treatment for premiums paid for key person insurance and the treatment of monies received from a claim vary among countries.

Premiums are generally not tax deductible in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Sec264"&gt;{{cite book |title=IRC Sec. 264(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the COLI Best Practices Act within the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006]], key person insurance proceeds for policies owned by employers can be taxable if certain conditions are not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Taxation of Key Man Insurance|url=https://www.keypersoninsurance.com/taxation/|website=KeyPersonInsurance.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Key person insurance policies are generally not deductible unless used specifically for business revenue protection purposes. Claim proceeds in Australia if used for revenue purposes may be taxable and depending on the ownership of the policy, may trigger a [[Capital Gains Taxation Event]]. In the UK the main principles of key person insurance taxation were outlined by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1944, [[Sir John Anderson]]. The "Andersen Rules" state "Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines."&lt;ref name="taxation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxation.co.uk/Articles/2011/05/11/24242/key-people|title=Key people|last=Durrant-Walker|first=Rob|date=11 May 2011|publisher=taxation.co.uk|language=English|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK taxation for key man insurance is normally taken from the guidance set out by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944. In answer to a parliamentary question Sir John Anderson made the following statement:
“Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon the facts of the particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short-term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Man Insurance Taxation How It Works|url=https://www.mykeymaninsurance.com/key-man-insurance-taxation/|website=MyKeyManInsurance.com|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK tax office, HMRC, has the view that key man insurance is tax-efficient if it is taken out 'solely for the purposes of the business'. Specifically, if the company takes out a key man insurance policy to protect the business from any loss of profits that have stemmed from the loss of the employee, then the premiums are not taxable. If a key employee has a substantial number of shares, then the key man insurance could potentially be seen as being taken out for their own interests, instead of the business. This is particularly the case if critical illness cover is added to the policy. Essentially, key man insurance can be tax-efficient, but it is always best to check with a financial advisor or the local tax office before making assumptions.

'''Lee Shapiro''' (1949–1987) was an American [[documentary film]]maker. His one feature-length film, ''Nicaragua Was Our Home'', was released in 1986. It was filmed in [[Nicaragua]] among the [[Miskito people|Miskito Indian]]s who were then fighting against Nicaraguan government forces.  It features interviews with Miskito Indian people and some non-Miskito clergy who lived among them concerning actions of the government against them, including bombing of villages, shootings, and forced removal of people from their homes.&lt;ref name=NYT72986&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5D9173BF93AA15754C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print ON 13, SANDINISTAS VS.

In 1987, Shapiro and fellow filmmaker Jim Lindelof were killed in [[Afghanistan]] during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_n2132_v88/ai_6536321/pg_29 Afghanistan: eight years of Soviet occupation], [[United States Department of State]], March 1988, The campaign to target foreign journalists had more tragic results. Two American filmmakers, Lee Shapiro and Jim Lindelof, were apparently killed by a regime attack while traveling with the mujahidin. In 1986, Lindelof had been named paramedic of the year for his efforts training Afghan medical workers. In response to protests, Kabul stated it could not "guarantee the security of foreign subjects" who enter illegally, whose presence it views as "evidence" of "external interference."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=glp&amp;search=lee%20shapiro%20afghanistan&amp;img=\\na0041\6800035\56050638_clean.html 2 Americans killed in ambush], ''Pacific Stars and Stripes'', October 29, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin|armed group]] they were traveling with reported that they had been ambushed by military forces of the [[Soviet Union]] or the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]]. However, the details have been questioned, partly because of the poor reputation of the group's leader, [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/1028/oed.html Two US journalists reported killed in Afghanistan; details murky], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', October 28, 1987 "Two American journalists are believed dead in northwest Afghanistan, diplomatic and resistance forces say here. Filmmaker Lee Shapiro and his soundman, Jim Lindalos, both of New York, were killed Oct. 11, reportedly in a Soviet or Afghan government ambush, according to United States consular officials. However, the resistance group that accompanied the film team has a poor reputation among most informed observers, and doubts have arisen over whether the two Americans did indeed die in an Afghan government or Soviet attack."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert, ''Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan'', New York: Vintage Departures, 2001, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro was a member of the [[Unification Church]] and a graduate of its [[Unification Theological Seminary]], as well as the [[London Film School]] and the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. He also attended medical school at the [[University of Oklahoma]]. His filmmaking was supported by [[CAUSA International]], a church-related anticommunist organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40717F738590C7B8EDDA90994DF484D81 2 Americans Reported Killed In an Ambush in Afghanistan] ''[[New York Times]]'', 1987-10-28&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the documentary film ''Shadow of Afghanistan'', by Suzanne Bauman and Jim Burroughs, was released. It incorporated footage originally shot by Shapiro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/348220/Shadow-of-Afghanistan/overview Shadow of Afghanistan], ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paige-donner/in-honor-of-the-annapolis_b_75142.html In Honor of The Annapolis, Md.

Lee Shapiro began shooting in 1986 and the film has some of the most startling yet intimate footage ever seen of a country at war. Shapiro and his soundman Jim Lindelof disappeared while filming. The footage was obtained by another filmmaking team who saw it to completion by a skeleton crew's labor of love, not least of whom is editor Mary Ann Skweres' contribution to the entire film cut.

'''Li Jishen''' ({{zh|s=李济深|t=李濟深|p=Lǐ Jìshēn|w=Li Chi-shen}}; 5 November 1885 &amp;ndash; 9 October 1959) was a [[China|Chinese]] military commander and statesman.  He served as commander of the [[Fourth Army (National Revolutionary Army)|Fourth Army]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], governor of [[Guangdong]], military affairs commissioner, and acting president of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]].  After opposing [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and being expelled from the [[Kuomintang]] in 1947, he became one of the six [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China]] with that government's founding on October 1, 1949.

==Early life==
Li was born into a scholar-gentry family in [[Cangwu County]], [[Wuzhou]], [[Guangxi]] in 1886. His mother died when he was four years old. In 1903, Li enrolled at Wuzhou Middle School, where he studied under the right wing Kuomintang leader [[Hu Hanmin]]. In 1904, he transferred to the Liangguang Military Middle School in Guangdong, and three years later was selected for advanced study at the Officers Military Academy in [[Beijing]]. He interrupted his studies after the Wuchang revolt of October 1911 to serve as chief of staff of the 22nd division of the revolutionary army in [[Jiangsu]]. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Li completed his education and remained at the academy, now called the Military Staff College.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

==Career==
Li returned to Guangdong in 1921 at the invitation of Guangdong Army chief of staff [[Deng Keng]]. Deng was assassinated in March 1922, and [[Chen Jiongming]] staged a coup in June of that year, which Li helped to put down. For this, he received command of the army's 1st Division.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

In 1924, after serving briefly as commissioner of reconstruction of the West River-Wuzhou area and as Wuzhou garrison commandor, Li became deputy dean of the newly established Whampoa Military Academy under Chiang Kai-shek. After [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s death in March 1925, the Guangdong government was reorganized as the National Government, and Li was appointed commander of the Fourth Army, which had formerly been the Guangdong Army. He spent the next year destroying Chen Jiongming's remaining power.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

When the [[Northern Expedition]] began in July 1926, Li's Fourth Army joined the push northward. During this time, Li also served as governor of Guangdong, military affairs commissioner, and acting president of the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1927, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. In November 1927, Li left Guangdong with [[Wang Jingwei]] to attend a plenary session of the Committee in [[Shanghai]] on the subject of restoring party unity. In his absence, [[Zhang Fakui]] staged a coup. Forces loyal to Li forced Zhang to surrender, and Li returned to Guangdong on 4 January 1928.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt; 

On 7 February 1928, Li was made a member of the standing committee of the Military Affairs Commission. He was also made commander in chief of the newly established [[Eighth Route Army]]. On 1 March, Li became chairman of the Guangdong branch political council of the Kuomintang, and on 30 March he was made chief of the general staff of the Northern Expedition. During the remainder of the year, Li attended meetings in Beijing, and briefly served as acting commander in chief of the Nationalist forces when Chiang Kai-shek left Beijing for [[Nanjing]]. He was appointed to the State Council on 8 October and resigned as governor of Guangdong in November.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

===Sino-Japanese war and the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang===
In 1929, Li traveled to Nanjing to attend the Third National Congress and mediate a dispute that had arisen between the Nationalist government and the [[New Guangxi clique]]. However, talks broke down in March, the members of the clique were expelled from the Kuomintang, and Li was placed in detention. He was not freed until after the Japanese attack on [[Mukden]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

Li did not have significant political power until 1933, when he joined with [[Chen Mingshu]] to launch a revolt in [[Fujian]]. Li was made chairman of the people's revolutionary government at [[Fuzhou]], but the revolt was quickly suppressed, and Li was forced to flee to [[Hong Kong]] in January 1934.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt; 

In 1935, Li joined with associates to found the Chinese People's Revolutionary League, which advocated resistance against Japan and overthrow of the Nationalist government. In 1936, Li participated in a joint Guangdong-Guangxi revolt against the government, but after it collapsed, Li returned to Hong Kong. The order for his arrest was rescinded.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

In 1938, Li was restored to membership in the Kuomintang, and again became a member of the Military Affairs Commission and the State Council. During the Sino-Japanese War, Li served in several military posts. In 1944, he was appointed president of the Military Advisory Council, but instead worked to consolidate resistance against Japan in southern Guangxi. At the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in May 1945, Li was elected to the Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang, and served as a delegate to the National Assembly the following year.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

On 8 March 1947, Li issued a statement calling for reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. For this, he was again expelled from the Kuomintang for making unwarranted statements and inciting the people to riot. Li began working to unite current and former Kuomintang members who opposed National government policies. This led to the formation of the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]] in 1948, with Li as its first chairman.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

===People's Republic of China===

Li left Hong Kong in early 1949 and traveled north to Beiping, where he assisted in the preparatory work for the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]]. After the inauguration of the new government, Li became one of its six vice-chairmen, as well as Vice-President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In January 1953, Li became a member of the committee assigned to draft the first constitution of the People's Republic. He served as a delegate to the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) in 1954. The new constitution reduced the number of vice-chairmen from six to two, so Li gave up his post and became a vice [[Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress|Vice Chair]] of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|NPC Standing Committee]]. Li continued to hold posts in the government until his death on 9 October 1959 in Beijing due to [[stomach cancer]] and a [[cerebral thrombosis]].&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Li married several times and had many children. One of his sons became dean of the agricultural college of [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]] during the 1940s. Another son, [[Li Peiyao]], became Chairman of the National Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang in the 1990s. Three of his daughters were students at [[Yenching University]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="Boorman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76290">This is a list of players of [[American football]] who died while still on a team roster. Included are players in the NFL, arena football, and college who have died as a result of team bus and plane accidents, players who committed suicide, and players who were victims of homicides, accidents, and drownings. Also included are players that died from various illnesses as well as players that died from injuries sustained in a game. Players who died following the conclusion of their career or players that were a free agent at the time of their death are not included, with the only exception being players who ended their careers to join the military. Each NFL player is listed with the team for which he last played before his death, rather than the team with which he spent most of his career.

==Players who ended their careers to join the military==
This table is only for players who ended their NFL career to join the military in a time of war, including players who were drafted into the military, and were killed in action.

==Events with disputed fatality counts==

===Chernobyl disaster===
[[File:View of Chernobyl taken from Pripyat.JPG|thumb|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]] with the Chernobyl plant in the distance.]]

Estimates of the total number of deaths potentially resulting from the Chernobyl disaster vary enormously: A [[UNSCEAR]] report proposes 45 total confirmed deaths from the accident {{as of|2008|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR 2008 Vol1"&gt;{{cite report|author=UNSCEAR|year=2008|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, Volume 1|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/2008_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number includes 2 non-radiation related fatalities from the accident itself, 28 fatalities from radiation doses in the immediate following months and 15 fatalities due to thyroid cancer likely caused by iodine-131 contamination; it does not include 19 additional individuals initially diagnosed with [[acute radiation syndrome]] who had also died {{as of|2006|lc=y}}, but who are not believed to have died due to radiation doses.&lt;ref name="UNSCEAR 2008 Vol2"&gt;{{cite report|author=UNSCEAR|year=2008|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation, Volume 2|pages=58, 64–65|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/2008_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) suggested in 2006 that cancer deaths could reach 4,000 among the 600,000 most heavily exposed people, a group which includes emergency workers, nearby residents, and evacuees, but excludes residents of low-contaminated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chernobyl: the true scale of the accident|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/index.html|work=Chernobyl's Legacy: Health, Environmental and Socio-Economic Impacts|accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[TORCH report|report]], commissioned by [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]] and sponsored by the Altner Combecher Foundation, predicted 30,000 to 60,000 cancer deaths as a result of worldwide Chernobyl fallout by assuming a [[linear no-threshold model]] for very low doses.&lt;ref name=torch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chernobylreport.org/?p=summary |title=Torch: The Other Report On Chernobyl- executive summary|accessdate=2011-08-20|publisher=[[European Greens]] and UK scientists [[Ian Fairlie]] PhD and David Sumner - Chernobylreport.org|date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Greenpeace]] report puts this figure at 200,000 or more.&lt;ref name="TheChernobyl2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2006/4/chernobylhealthreport.pdf|title=The Chernobyl Catastrophe – Consequences on Human Health |accessdate=15 December 2008|publisher=Greenpeace|date=18 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A disputed Russian publication, [[Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment|''Chernobyl'']], concludes that 985,000 premature deaths occurred worldwide between 1986 and 2004 as a result of radioactive contamination from Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="Alexey2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Alexey V. Yablokov |author2=Vassily B. Nesterenko |author3=Alexey V.

===Kyshtym disaster===
The [[Kyshtym disaster]], which occurred at [[Mayak]] in [[Russia]] on 29 September 1957, was rated as a level 6 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]], the third most severe incident after Chernobyl and Fukushima. Because of the intense secrecy surrounding Mayak, it is difficult to estimate the death toll of Kyshtym. One book claims that "in 1992, a study conducted by the Institute of Biophysics at the former Soviet Health Ministry in Chelyabinsk found that 8,015 people had died within the preceding 32 years as a result of the accident."&lt;ref name=whenTechFail&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlager |first=Neil |title=[[When Technology Fails]] |year=1994 |publisher=[[Gale Research]] |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8103-8908-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, only 6,000 death certificates have been found for residents of the Tech riverside between 1950 and 1982 from all causes of death,&lt;ref name=Standring /&gt; though perhaps the Soviet study considered a larger geographic area affected by the airborne plume. The most commonly quoted estimate is 200 deaths due to cancer, but the origin of this number is not clear. More recent epidemiological studies suggest that around 49 to 55 cancer deaths among riverside residents can be associated to radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="Standring"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Standring|first=William J.F. |author2=Dowdall, Mark |author3=Strand, Per|title=Overview of Dose Assessment Developments and the Health of Riverside Residents Close to the "Mayak" PA Facilities, Russia|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|year=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=174–199|doi=10.3390/ijerph6010174|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/6/1/174/pdf|accessdate=11 June 2012|issn=1660-4601|pmid=19440276|pmc=2672329}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include the effects of all radioactive releases into the river, 98% of which happened long before the 1957 accident, but it would not include the effects of the airborne plume that was carried north-east.&lt;ref name="kellerer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Southern Urals radiation studies: A reappraisal of the current status|journal=Journal of Radiation and Environmental Biophysics |volume=41 |year=2002 |url=http://www.houseoffoust.com/SimplyDocuments/Studies/Nancy04_southernUrals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area closest to the accident produced 66 diagnosed cases of [[chronic radiation syndrome]], providing the bulk of the data about this condition.&lt;ref name="Guskova2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gusev|first1=Igor A. |last2=Gusʹkova|first2=Angelina Konstantinovna |last3=Mettler|first3=Fred Albert |title=Medical Management of Radiation Accidents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6b4qDorN4wC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=28 March 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-7004-5|pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windscale fire===
At least 33 cancer fatalities (estimated by UK government)&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961337,00.html|title=Perhaps the Worst, Not the First|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=12 May 1986|publisher=TIME magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=windscale&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sovacool|first=Benjamin K.|date=August 2010|title=A Critical Evaluation of Nuclear Power and Renewable Electricity in Asia|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=40|issue=3|pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Windscale]], United Kingdom, on October 8, 1957. The [[Windscale fire]] resulted when [[metal fire|uranium metal fuel ignited]] inside plutonium production piles; surrounding dairy farms were contaminated.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=windscale/&gt;

===Fukushima disaster===
{{main|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster casualties}}
In a 2013 report, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) stated the overall health risks from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] to be far lower than those of Chernobyl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=UNSCEAR|year=2014|title=Sources, Effects and Risks of Ionizing Radiation|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/2013_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been no observed or expected deterministic effects.  In pregnancies, there has been no expected increase in spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, perinatal mortality, birth defects, or cognitive impairment.  Finally, there was no expected discernible increase in heritable disease or discernible radiation-related increases in any cancers, with the possible exception of thyroid cancer.  However, the high detection rates of thyroid nodules, cysts, and cancer may be a consequence of intensive screening.  In a 2015 white paper, UNSCEAR stated its findings from 2013 remain valid and largely unaffected by new information, and the new information further supports the statement that high thyroid detection is likely due to more intensive screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/fukushima.html|title=Fukushima|author=jaya.mohan|publisher=|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have died from acute radiation poisoning,&lt;ref name="UN News Centre" /&gt;  though six workers died due to various reasons, including cardiovascular disease, during the containment efforts or work to stabilize the earthquake and tsunami damage to the site.&lt;ref name="UN News Centre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42074|title=No visible effects detected on workers in Japan nuclear plant, UN assessment finds|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=23 May 2012|website=UN News Centre|publisher=United Nations|access-date=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, an opinion piece in the [[Wall Street Journal]] cites a 2013 Japanese study, which concluded that mortality due to "evacuation stress" from the area around Fukushima had reached more than 1600. This includes deaths from suicide and lack of access to critical health care, but not from radiation, increased cancer, or any other direct result of the nuclear accident. The author also states these deaths occurred among people who had been evacuated from areas where the radiation posed little or no risk to their health, areas where they would experience less exposure than the normal amount received by residents in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://jp.wsj.com/articles/SB12270577396625053624104581398672256005558 (Japanese), https://issuu.com/johna.shanahan/docs/151201_nuclear_paradigm_shift__holm (English version), https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-nuclear-paradigm-shift-1449014295 (Original WSJ publication in English, paywall)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a class action lawsuit brought by sailors on the USS Reagan against Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) who are allegedly suffering severe radiation induced illnesses. The USS Reagan was part of the operation "Tomodachi" to deliver essential supplies to devastated communities in the wake of the Tsunami on March 11, 2011. The wind was blowing out to sea from the Fukushima accident. If it had been blowing west instead of east, the sailors might not have been affected.&lt;ref&gt;http://enenews.com/spike-number-sailors-dying-after-fukushima-radiation-exposure-400-veterans-suffering-serious-illnesses-former-japan-prime-minister-breaks-down-crying-be-ignored-longer-number-sick-people-increas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2014/03/10/issues/stakes-high-as-ailing-u-s-navy-sailors-take-on-tepco-over-fukushima-fallout/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Junko Furuta''' ({{lang|ja|古田 順子}} ''Furuta Junko'') was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] high-school student who was abducted, [[torture]]d, [[rape]]d, and [[murder]]ed in the late 1980s. Her murder case was named {{Nihongo|"'''Concrete-encased high school girl murder case'''"|女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件|''Joshikōsei konkurīto-zume satsujin-jiken''}}, due to her body being discovered in a concrete drum. The murder was mainly perpetrated by four teenage boys, Hiroshi Miyano (now Hiroshi Yokoyama), Jō Ogura (now Jō Kamisaku), Shinji Minato, and Yasushi Watanabe.

Approximately 100 people knew about Junko Furuta's captivity, but either did nothing about it or themselves participated in the torture and murder. Most of the participants were friends of the teenage boys, who were low-ranking members of the [[Yakuza]].

== Background ==
Junko Furuta was born in [[Misato, Saitama (city)|Misato, Saitama Prefecture.]] As a teenager, she attended Yashio-Minami High School and worked as a part-time employee during after school hours. She was known to be popular and good looking, which made some of her classmates envious. However, she was looked down upon by the "gangster-like" teenagers since she refrained from smoking, drinking alcohol and drug usage. Hiroshi Miyano (now Hiroshi Yokoyama), a known school [[Bullying|bully]] with connections to the Yakuza, had a crush on Furuta but she turned him down since she was not looking for a relationship. With the exception of Furuta, nobody dared to oppose Miyano due to his Yakuza connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://japaninsides.com/44-days-of-hell-the-murder-story-of-junko-furuta/|title=44 Days Of Hell – The murder story of Junko Furuta|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime ==
On 25 November 1988, Miyano and his friend Nobuharu Minato (now Shinji Minato) wandered around Misato, with the intention of robbing and raping local women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At 8:30 pm, they spotted Furuta cycling home after she finished her part-time job. Under Miyano's orders, Minato kicked Furuta off her bicycle and immediately fled the scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Miyano, pretending to be an innocent bystander, approached Furuta and offered to walk her home safely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gaining her trust, Furuta was unaware that Miyano was leading her to a nearby warehouse, where he revealed his Yakuza connections. Miyano threatened to kill her as he raped her in the warehouse and once again in a nearby hotel. From the hotel, Miyano called Minato and his other friends, Jō Ogura (now Jō Kamisaku) and Yasushi Watanabe, and bragged to them about the rape. Ogura reportedly asked Miyano to keep her, so that they could all have a turn. The group had a history of [[gang rape]], and had recently kidnapped and raped another girl, although she was released afterward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Around 3:00 am, Miyano took Furuta to a nearby park, where Minato, Ogura, and Watanabe were waiting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They told her that they knew where she lived (from a notebook in her backpack) and that the Yakuza would kill her family if she attempted to escape. She was easily overpowered by the four boys, and taken to a house in the Ayase district of [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]], where she was gang-raped.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The house was owned by Minato's parents, which soon became their regular gang hangout.&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2004 attack"&gt;Wijers-Hasegawa, Yumi, [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20040729a3.html "Man who killed as child back in court"], ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 29 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November, Furuta's parents contacted the police about their daughter's disappearance. In order to forestall the manhunt, the kidnappers coerced her into calling her mother. She was forced to say that she had run away, but was safe and staying with a friend.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hawkins, Kristal. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130222041410/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/blog/article/japanese-horror-story-the-torture-of-junko-furuta/index.html Japanese Horror Story: The Torture of Junko Furuta]." ''[[Crime Library]]''. Retrieved on 7 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also forced to ask her mother to stop the police investigation into her disappearance. When Minato's parents were around, Furuta was forced to pose as the girlfriend of one of the kidnappers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They later dropped this pretext when it became clear that the Minatos would not report them to the police.&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2004 attack" /&gt; The Minatos stated that they did not intervene because they were aware of Miyano's Yakuza connections and feared retaliation and because their own son was increasingly violent towards them.&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2004 attack" /&gt; Minato's brother was also aware of the situation, but also did nothing to prevent it.

Furuta was held captive in the Minato residence for forty days, where she was abused, raped and tortured. They also invited and encouraged their other friends from the Yakuza, to torment Furuta. According to their trial statements, the four of them raped her over 400 times, beat her, starved her, hung her from the ceiling and used her as a "punching bag", dropped [[barbell]]s onto her stomach, forced her to eat live cockroaches and drink her own urine, and forced her to masturbate in front of them. They inserted foreign objects into her vagina and anus, including a lit light bulb into her vagina and fireworks. They burned her vagina and clitoris with cigarettes and lighters, and her eyelids with hot wax. They also tore off her left nipple with pliers and pierced her breasts with sewing needles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courts.go.jp/app/files/hanrei_jp/261/020261_hanrei.pdf|title=Junko Furata Murder Case|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2004 attack" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the torturers' friends have been officially identified, including Tetsuo Nakamura (now Tetsuo Yamada), and Koichi Ihara, who were charged with rape after their DNA was found on and in the victim's body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Koichi Ihara was allegedly bullied into raping Furuta. After he left the Minato household, he told his brother about the incident. His brother subsequently told their parents, who contacted police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two police officers were dispatched to the Minato house; however, they were informed that there was no girl inside.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The police officers declined an invitation to look around the house, believing the invitation was sufficient proof that there was no girl in the Minato house.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both officers faced considerable backlash from the community. Had they done their due diligence, Furuta's ordeal would have only lasted sixteen days and she may well have recovered from her injuries. The two officers were fired for failing to follow procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the beginning of December, Furuta attempted to call the police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, she was discovered by Hiroshi before she could say anything. When the police phoned back, Miyano informed them that it was a mistake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As punishment, they doused her legs and feet in lighter fluid and set them on fire. They also pushed a large bottle into her anus, causing severe bleeding. She reportedly went into convulsions. During their trial, they stated that they thought she was faking a seizure, so they set her on fire again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She survived these injuries and continued to be raped and tortured. Furuta is reported to have asked her captors on multiple occasions to "kill her and get it over with", but they refused. Instead, they forced her to sleep outside on the balcony (it was winter at that time) and locked her in a freezer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the kidnappers told the court that her hands and legs were so badly damaged that it took her over an hour to drag herself downstairs to use the washroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the severity of the torture, she eventually lost bladder and bowel control and was beaten for soiling the carpets. She was also unable to drink water or consume food and would vomit after each attempt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was also severely beaten for this.

The brutality of the attacks drastically altered Furuta's appearance. Her face was so swollen that it was difficult to make out her features. Her body was also severely crippled, giving off a [[Anaerobic infection|rotting smell]] that caused the four boys to lose sexual interest in her. As a result, the boys kidnapped and gang-raped a 19-year-old woman who, like Furuta, was on her way home from work.

On 4 January 1989, the four boys challenged Furuta to a game of [[Mahjong]], which she is said to have won.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of frustration, the boys beat her with an iron barbell, kicked and punched her, and placed two short candles on her eyelids, burning them with the hot wax.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They made her stand, and struck her feet with a swinging stick. At this point, she fell onto a stereo and collapsed into a fit of convulsions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since she was bleeding profusely, and pus was emerging from her infected burns, the four boys covered their hands in plastic bags taped at the wrists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They continued to beat her and dropped an iron exercise ball onto her stomach several times. They poured lighter fluid onto her thighs, arms, face, and stomach and once again set her on fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furuta allegedly made attempts to put out the fire, but gradually became unresponsive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The attack reportedly lasted two hours. Furuta eventually succumbed to her wounds and died that day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Less than twenty-four hours after her death, Nobuharu Minato's brother called to tell him that Furuta appeared to be dead. Afraid of being caught for murder, they wrapped her body in blankets and shoved it into a travel bag. They then put her body in a 55-gallon (208 liters) drum and filled it with wet concrete. Around 8:00 pm, they loaded and eventually disposed the drum into a cement truck in [[Kōtō, Tokyo|Kōtō]], Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Sentenced"&gt;"Rapist, Murderer Given 20-Year Sentence". ''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]''. Sunday 13 July 1991. Page 2. Retrieved from ''[[LexisNexis]]'' on 29 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1989, Hiroshi Miyano and Jō Ogura were arrested for the gang-rape of the 19-year-old woman they had kidnapped in December. On 29 March, two police officers came to interrogate them, as women's underwear had been found at their addresses. During the interrogation, one of the officers led Miyano into thinking he knew of Furuta's murder. Thinking that Jō Ogura had confessed to the crime, Miyano told the police where to find Furuta's body. The police were initially puzzled by the confession, as they had been talking about the murder of another woman and her seven-year-old son that had occurred nine days prior to Furuta's abduction. That case remains unsolved to this day.

The police found the drum containing Furuta's body the following day. She was identified via fingerprints. On 1 April 1989 Jō Ogura was arrested for another sexual assault, and subsequently re-arrested for murder. The arrest of Yasushi Watanabe, Nobuharu Minato, and Minato's brother followed.

==Prosecution==
{{One source section|date=December 2015}}
Despite the shocking brutality of their crime, the identities of the boys were sealed by the court since they were all considered to be juveniles at the time of the crime. Journalists from the ''Shūkan Bunshun'' magazine discovered their identities, however, and published them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They stated that, given the severity of the crime, the accused did not deserve to have their right to anonymity upheld. All four boys pled guilty to "committing bodily injury that resulted in death", rather than murder.

In July 1990, a lower court sentenced Hiroshi Miyano, the alleged leader of the crime, to 17 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He appealed his sentence, but [[Tokyo High Court]] judge Ryūji Yanase sentenced him to an additional three years in prison. The 20-year sentence is the second highest sentence after [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was 18 at the time of the murder. Miyano's mother reportedly sent Furuta's parents 50 million yen (USD 425,000), after selling their family home.
In 2004 he tried to get parole, but due to an incident, it was denied.
In January 2013, Miyano was re-arrested for fraud. Due to insufficient evidence, he was released without charge on the 31st of that month.

Nobuharu Minato, who originally received a four- to six-year sentence, was re-sentenced to five-to-nine years by Judge Ryūji Yanase upon appeal.&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was 16 at the time of the murder. Nobuharu's parents and brother were not charged. Furuta's parents were dismayed by the sentences received by their daughter's killers and won a civil suit against the parents of Nobuharu Minato, in whose home the crimes were committed. After his release, Minato moved in with his mother. He has not worked since.

Yasushi Watanabe, who was originally sentenced to three-to-four years in prison, received an upgraded sentence of five-to-seven years.&lt;ref name="Sentenced" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was 17 at the time of the murder. After his release, he married a Romanian woman.

For his participation in the crime, Jō Ogura served eight years in a juvenile prison before he was released in August 1999. He was 17 at the time of the murder. After his release, he is said to have boasted about his role in the kidnapping, rape and torture of Furuta.&lt;ref name="Japan Times 2004 attack" /&gt; In July 2004, he was arrested for assaulting Takatoshi Isono, an acquaintance he thought his girlfriend may have been involved with. Jō tracked Isono down, beat him and shoved him into his truck. He drove him from [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]] to his mother's bar in [[Misato, Saitama (city)|Misato]], where he allegedly beat Isono for four hours. During that time, Ogura repeatedly threatened to kill the man, telling him that he'd killed before and knew how to get away with it. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for the assault and has since been released. Ogura's mother allegedly vandalized Furuta's grave, stating that she had ruined her son's life. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} It has also been reported that Ogura has run through his father's savings (money which was originally meant for Furuta's family), buying and consuming a number of luxury goods.

The sentences were largely regarded as being far too light for the crimes committed, all four individuals were protected by special provisions applied to individuals 18 years old and younger.

During sentencing, the judge commented that "exceptionally grave and atrocious violence" had been inflicted upon the victim, and that Junko Furuta had been "murdered so brutally at the young age of 17, [that her] soul must be wandering in torment". Hearing the details of the brutal rape and torture, a spectator in the gallery fainted. Furuta's mother also reportedly had a mental breakdown, which required psychiatric treatment.

==Aftermath==
Junko Furuta's funeral was held on 2 April 1989. One of her friends' memorial address stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jun-chan, welcome back.  I have never dreamed that we would see you again in this way.  You must have been in so much pain&amp;nbsp;... so much suffering&amp;nbsp;... The [[happi]] we all made for the school festival looked really good on you.  We will never forget you.  I have heard that the headmaster has presented you with a graduation certificate.  So we graduated together&amp;nbsp;– all of us.  Jun-chan, there is no more pain, no more suffering.  Please rest in peace...''{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furuta's part-time employer, whom she worked for prior to her kidnapping and murder, presented her parents with the uniform she would need to wear as a full-time employee. The uniform was placed in her coffin. The location near where Furuta's body was discovered has been developed since and is now Wakasu park.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==In popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
&lt;!-- All of these need *third-party* references to show that the pop culture reference to the Furuta murder was sufficiently significant to have been noted by someone *other than* the person or group making the reference, and *other than* a Wikipedia editor; no Original Research, please. --&gt;
At least three Japanese-language books have been written about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;渥美饒兒『十七歳、悪の履歴書-女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件』作品社、2003年。{{ISBN|4878935723}}.&lt;br&gt;

An [[exploitation film]], ''Joshikōsei konkurīto-zume satsujin-jiken'' ({{Nihongo2|女子高生コンクリート詰め殺人事件}}, ''Concrete-Encased High School Girl Murder Case''), was made about the incident by [[Katsuya Matsumura]] in 1995. Yujin Kitagawa (later a member of the music duo [[Yuzu (band)|Yuzu]]) played the role of the principal culprit.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0451781|Joshikôsei konkuriito-dume satsujin-jiken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofdb.de/view.php?page=liste&amp;Name=Yujin+Kitagawa|title=Filme mit Beteiligung von Yujin Kitagawa|language=German|accessdate=2008-03-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611030341/http://www.ofdb.de/view.php?page=liste&amp;Name=Yujin+Kitagawa|archivedate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seiji Fujii wrote a novel about the case, ''17-sai'' ("Seventeen years old"), which was turned into a manga by Yōji Kamata. Contrary to what had really happened, the novel shows a happy ending for the girl, who survives and her kidnappers are sentenced to jail for many years.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Waita Uziga (author of ''[[Mai-chan's Daily Life]]'') also made a controversial manga, ''Shin Gendai Ryōkiden'', about the case, with much more violent and crude content.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The song "Junko Furuta" by Indonesian musician [[Danilla Riyadi]] is a tribute to her.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Song "44 Days" by musician Mr. Kitty is about the incident. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mr.Kitty Official|title=Mr.Kitty - 44 Days|date=2014-02-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qGcOZVAgBU|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oreste Sindici.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Portrait of Oreste Sindici by Demetrio Paredes ([[Circa|ca.]]1870).]]
'''Oreste Sindici''' (May 31, 1828 – January 12, 1904) was an Italian-born Colombian musician and composer. He composed the music for the [[Colombian national anthem]] in 1887.

He was born in [[Ceccano]] ([[Province of Frosinone]]) and studied in the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] at Rome.

'''''Petz Rescue: Ocean Patrol''''' is a game for the [[Nintendo DS]] developer by French studio Magic Pockets. It is published by [[Ubisoft]]. It game takes place on a tropical island and the player goes on rescue missions to save marine life. It is the sequel to wild petz dolphinz.

== Game experience ==
When the player first turns on the game you will have only two [[dolphins]],  then the user given a schedule where you are given a job (i.e. feed  dolphins). Then, the user can go on a rescue mission to save an animal.  The game starts each day by send the user on a new animal rescue  mission. When you save animal for the first time ever you have to make a lagoon for it and clean garbage out of it. When you don't receive an animal in danger signal, it most likely means that an animal will have a baby.

Canavier |title=Phase response curve |journal=Scholarpedia |volume=1 |issue=12 |page=1332 |date=2006 |url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Phase_response_curve |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase dynamics==
Consider the dynamical system of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator state variable, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the vector field. We assume that the system has an [[exponentially stable]] [[periodic orbit]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; with period &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;; that is, &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t+T_0) = \gamma(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is exponentially stable periodic orbit, then it will attract an open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Such a set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[basin of attraction]] of the orbit &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
We can now introduce the phase &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as a coordinate along the limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such that it grows monotonically in the direction of the motion and gains &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; during each rotation. Moreover, we demand that the phase grows uniformly in time so that it obeys the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\phi}{dt}=\omega,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[natural frequency]] of the oscillations. By the chain rule we then have
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\phi}{dt}=\nabla\phi(\gamma)\cdot f(\gamma),
&lt;/math&gt;
where the gradient is evaluated along the limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be obtained from any nonuniformly rotating &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;-periodic angle variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the cycle through the transformation  
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi =\omega\int_{0}^{\theta}\left[\frac{d\theta}{dt}\right]^{-1}d\theta.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Isochrons==
The phase variable could be defined in such a way that it rotates uniformly not only on the cycle but also in its neighborhood. To do this, we need to define the so-called isochrons, which were first introduced by Winfree(1967) and then by Guckenheimer(1975) and Kuramoto(1984).  The construction of these curves in the vicinity of the limit cycle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

==In circadian rhythms==
[[Image:PRC-Light+Mel.png|thumb|right|Phase response curves for light and for melatonin administration]]
In humans and animals, there is a regulatory system that governs the phase relationship of an organism's internal [[circadian clock]] to a regular periodicity in the external environment (usually governed by the solar day). In most organisms, a stable phase relationship is desired, though in some cases the desired phase will vary by season, especially among mammals with seasonal mating habits.

In [[circadian rhythm]] research, a PRC illustrates the relationship between a [[chronobiotic]]'s time of administration (relative to the internal circadian clock) and the magnitude of the treatment's effect on circadian phase. Specifically, a PRC is a graph showing, by convention, time of the subject's endogenous day along the ''x''-axis and the amount of the phase shift (in hours) along the ''y''-axis. The curve has one peak and one [[nadir]] in each 24-hour cycle. Relative circadian time is plotted vs. phase shift magnitude. The treatment is usually narrowly specified as a set intensity and colour and duration of light exposure to the retina and skin, or a set dose and formulation of melatonin.

These curves are often consulted in the therapeutic setting. Normally, the body's various physiological rhythms will be synchronized within an individual organism (human or animal), usually with respect to a master biological clock. Of particular importance is the sleep–wake cycle. Various sleep disorders and externals stresses (such as [[jet lag]]) can interfere with this. People with [[non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder]] often experience an inability to maintain a consistent internal clock. Extreme [[chronotype]]s usually maintain a consistent clock, but find that their natural clock does not align with the expectations of their social environment. PRC curves provide a starting point for therapeutic intervention. The two common treatments used to shift the timing of sleep are [[light therapy]], directed at the eyes, and administration of the hormone [[melatonin]], usually taken orally. Either or both can be used daily. The phase adjustment is generally cumulative with consecutive daily administrations, and—at least partially—additive with concurrent administrations of distinct treatments. If the underlying disturbance is stable in nature, ongoing daily intervention is usually required. For jet lag, the intervention serves mainly to accelerate natural alignment, and ceases once desired alignment is achieved.

Note that PRC curves from the experimental setting are usually aggregates of the test population, that there can be mild or significant variation within the test population, that individuals with sleep disorders often respond atypically, and that the formulation of the chronobiotic might be specific to the experimental setting and not generally available in clinical practice (e.g. for melatonin, one sustained-release formulation might differ in its release rate as compared to another); also, while the magnitude is dose-dependent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burgess HJ, Revell VL, Eastman CI |title=A three pulse phase response curve to three milligrams of melatonin in humans |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=586 |issue=2 |pages=639–647 |date=January 2008 |pmid= 18006583 |pmc=2375577 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2007.143180 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18006583}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all PRC graphs cover a range of doses. The discussions below are restricted to the PRCs for the light and melatonin in humans.

===Light===
[[Image:Human PRC.png|A typical Human Light PRC|thumb|right|400px|The time shown on the ''x''-axis is vague: dawn – mid-day – dusk – night – dawn. These times do not refer to actual sun-up etc. nor to specific clock times. Each individual has her/his own circadian "clock" and chronotype, and dawn in the illustration refers to a person's time of spontaneous awakening when well-rested and sleeping regularly. The PRC shows when a stimulus, in this case light to the eyes, will effect a change, an advance or a delay. The curve's highest point coincides with the subject's lowest body temperature.]]

Starting about two hours before an individual's regular bedtime, exposure of the eyes to light will delay the circadian phase, causing later wake-up time and later sleep onset. The delaying effect gets stronger as evening progresses; it is also dependent on the wavelength and [[illuminance]] ("brightness") of the light. The effect is small in dim indoor lighting.

About five hours after usual bedtime, coinciding with the body temperature [[nadir]] (the lowest point of the core body temperature during sleep) the PRC peaks and the effect changes abruptly from phase delay to phase advance. Immediately after this peak, light exposure has its greatest phase-advancing effect, causing earlier wake-up and sleep onset. Again, illuminance greatly affects results; indoor light may be less than 500&amp;nbsp;lux while [[light therapy]] uses up to 10,000&amp;nbsp;lux. The effect diminishes until about two hours after spontaneous wake-up time, when it reaches approximately zero.

During the period between two hours after usual wake-up time and two hours before usual bedtime, light exposure has little or no effect on circadian phase (slight effects generally cancelling each other out).

Another image of the PRC for light is [http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2001/01/bringing-therapy-to-light/ here (Figure 1)]. Within that image, the explanatory text is 
*''Delay region: evening light shifts sleepiness later'' and 
*''Advance region: morning light shifts sleepiness earlier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kripke|first1=DF|last2=Loving|first2=RT|title=Bringing Therapy to Light|journal=Sleep Review|date=2001|issue=1|url=http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2001/01/bringing-therapy-to-light/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light therapy, typically with a light box producing 10,000&amp;nbsp;lux at a prescribed distance, can be used in the evening to delay or in the morning to advance a person's sleep timing. Because losing sleep to obtain bright light exposure is considered undesirable by most people, and because it is very difficult to estimate exactly when the greatest effect (the PRC peak) will occur in an individual, the treatment is usually applied daily just prior to bedtime (to achieve phase delay), or just after spontaneous awakening (to achieve phase advance).

In addition to its use in the adjustment of circadian rhythms, light therapy is used as treatment for several [[Mood disorder|affective disorders]], especially [[seasonal affective disorder]] (SAD) but also nonseasonal unipolar depression and bipolar depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=JM|last2=Atkinson|first2=LA|last3=Corlett|first3=SA|last4=Lall|first4=GS|date=2014|title=An insight into light as a chronobiological therapy|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266673182|journal=ChronoPhysiology and Therapy|volume=4|pages=79–85|doi=10.2147/CPT.S56589|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penders|first=Thomas M.|last2=Stanciu|first2=Cornel N.|last3=Schoemann|first3=Alexander M.|last4=Ninan|first4=Philip T.|last5=Bloch|first5=Richard|last6=Saeed|first6=Sy A.|date=2016-10-20|title=Bright Light Therapy as Augmentation of Pharmacotherapy for Treatment of Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27835725|journal=The primary care companion for CNS disorders|volume=18|issue=5|doi=10.4088/PCC.15r01906|issn=2155-7780|pmid=27835725}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kripke|first=D.

In 2002 [[Brown University]] researchers led by David Berson announced the discovery of special cells in the [[human eye]], ipRGCs ([[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2004-05/04-076.html Brown Scientists Uncover Inner Workings of Rare Eye Cells]&lt;/ref&gt; which many researchers now believe control the light entrainment effect of the phase response curve. In the human eye, the ipRGCs have the greatest response to light in the 460–480&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) range. In one experiment, 400&amp;nbsp;lux of blue light produced the same effects as 10,000&amp;nbsp;lux of white light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glickman G, Byrne B, Pineda C, Hauck WW, Brainard GC |title=Light therapy for seasonal affective disorder with blue narrow-band light-emitting diodes (LEDs) |journal=Biol.

Lett. |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=493–8 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16264413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melatonin===

The phase response curve for melatonin is roughly twelve hours out of phase with the phase response curve for light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewy|first1=Alfred J|last2=Bauer|first2=Vance K|last3=Ahmed|first3=Saeeduddin|last4=Thomas|first4=Katherine H|last5=Cutler|first5=Neil L|last6=Singer|first6=Clifford M|last7=Moffitt|first7=Mary T|last8=Sack|first8=Robert L|title=Melatonin shifts human circadian rhythms according to a phase-response curve|journal=Chronobiology International|date=1992|volume=9|issue=5|pages=380–392|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07420529808998671|accessdate=23 June 2015|doi=10.3109/07420529209064550|pmid=1394610}}&lt;/ref&gt; At spontaneous wake-up time, [[exogenous]] (externally administered) melatonin has a slight phase-delaying effect. The amount of phase-delay increases until about eight hours after wake-up time, when the effect swings abruptly from strong phase delay to strong phase advance. The phase-advance effect diminishes as the day goes on until it reaches zero about bedtime. From usual bedtime until wake-up time, exogenous melatonin has no effect on circadian phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgess|first1=Helen J.|last2=Revell|first2=Victoria L.|last3=Eastman|first3=Charmane I.|title=A three pulse phase response curve to three milligrams of melatonin in humans|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=15 January 2008|volume=586|issue=2|pages=639–647|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2007.143180|pmid=18006583|pmc=2375577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewy |first1=A |title=Clinical implications of the melatonin phase response curve. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism |date=July 2010 |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=3158–60 |doi=10.1210/jc.2010-1031 |pmid=20610608|pmc=2928905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human body produces its own ([[endogenous]]) melatonin starting about two hours before bedtime, provided the lighting is dim. This is known as ''dim-light melatonin onset'', DLMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sletten|first1=Tracey L.|last2=Vincenzi|first2=Simon|last3=Redman|first3=Jennifer R.|last4=Lockley|first4=Steven W.|last5=Rajaratnam|first5=Shantha M. W.|title=Timing of Sleep and Its Relationship with the Endogenous Melatonin Rhythm|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|date=2010|volume=1|pages=137|doi=10.3389/fneur.2010.00137|pmid=21188265|pmc=3008942}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stimulates the phase-advance portion of the PRC and helps keep the body on a regular sleep-wake schedule. It also helps prepare the body for sleep.

Administration of melatonin at any time may have a mild [[hypnotic]] (sleep-inducing) effect. The expected effect on sleep phase timing, if any, is predicted by the PRC.

===Additive effects===
In a 2006 study Victoria L. Revell ''et al.'' showed that a combination of morning bright light and afternoon melatonin, both timed to phase advance according to the respective PRCs, produce a larger phase advance shift than bright light alone, for a total of up to 2{{frac|1|2}} hours. All times are approximate and vary from one person to another. In particular, there is no convenient way to accurately determine the times of the peaks and zero-crossings of these curves in an individual. Administration of light or melatonin close to the time at which the effect is expected to change sense abruptly may, if the changeover time is not accurately known, produce an opposite effect to that desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Revell VL, Burgess HJ, Gazda CJ, Smith MR, Fogg LF, Eastman CI |title=Advancing human circadian rhythms with afternoon melatonin and morning intermittent bright light |journal=J. Clin. Endocrinol.

===Origin===
The first published usage of the term "phase response curve" was in 1960 by Patricia DeCoursey. The "daily" activity rhythms of her [[flying squirrel]]s, kept in constant darkness, responded to pulses of light exposure. The response varied according to the time of day—that is, the animals' subjective "day"—when light was administered. When DeCoursey plotted all her data relating the quantity and direction (advance or delay) of phase-shift on a single curve, she created the PRC. It has since been a standard tool in the study of biological rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clock Tutorial #3c - Darwin On Time |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/clock_tutorial_3c_darwin_on_ti.php |accessdate=2007-11-03 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora |year=2007 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs LLC |archiveurl= http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/01/wwdd2-darwin-on-time.html |archivedate=2005-01-06 |quote=[The PRC is] the single most important methodological tool in the study of all biological rhythms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In neurons==
{{further|Phase precession}}
Phase response curve analysis can be used to understand the intrinsic properties and oscillatory behavior of regular-[[spiking neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gutkin BS, Ermentrout GB, Reyes AD |title=Phase-response curves give the responses of neurons to transient inputs |journal=J.

Importantly, the PRC type exhibited by a neuron is indicative of its input–output function (excitability) as well as synchronization behavior: networks of PRC type II neurons can synchronize their activity via mutual excitatory connections, but those of PRC type I can not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B |title=Type I membranes, phase resetting curves, and synchrony |journal=Neural Comput |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=979–1001 |date=July 1996 |pmid=8697231 |doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.5.979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental estimation of PRC in living, regular-spiking neurons involves measuring the changes in inter-spike interval in response to a small perturbation, such as a transient pulse of current.

{{Religious text primary|date=September 2015}}
'''Punishment of the Grave''' ({{lang-ar|عذاب القبر}} ''ʿAdhāb al-Qabr'', also translated '''torment of the grave''')  is an [[Islam|Islamic]] concept whereby in the time between [[Islamic view of death|death]] and  resurrection on the [[Day of Judgement]],  the souls of the unrighteous are punished in the [[Barzakh|grave]] and those of the righteous find the grave "peaceful and blessed".&lt;ref name=JACBMM2014:46&gt;[[#JACBMM2014|J.A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad'', 2014]]: p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], those in the grave "may be punished for their ignorance of Allah, their ignoring His commands and their disobedience towards Him".&lt;ref name="Reasons"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=45325: Reasons for the punishment in the grave |url=https://islamqa.info/en/45325 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most Islamic theological principles the punishment of the grave is not mentioned in the Quran "in any obvious way", but found in a [[hadith]] compiled by scholars such as [[Ibn Hanbal]].&lt;ref name=JACBMM2014:46/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quransmessage.com/articles/grave%20punishment%20FM3.htm|title=PUNISHMENT OF THE GRAVE (AZAB-E-QABR)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
According to Ibn Al-Qayyim, animals are able to hear the Punishment of the Grave while human beings cannot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Soul's Journey After Death'', An Abridgement of Ibn Al-Qayyim's ''Kitabar-Ruh'', Commentary by Layla Mabrouk. p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Muslims also believe that the living can intercede for the dead who are undergoing punishment, to at least temporarily halt their suffering.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Muhammad said: "After he has died, the believer only gets the benefit of the following actions and good deeds: knowledge which he has taught and passed on, a righteous son or daughter he leaves behind, a copy of the Quran which he has bequeathed, a mosque he has built, a house he has built for the traveler, a water channel he has dug, or an act of charity which he spent out of his property when he was alive and in good health and which comes to him after his death."&lt;ref&gt;''The Soul's Journey After Death'', An Abridgement of Ibn Al-Qayyim's ''Kitabar-Ruh'', Commentary by Layla Mabrouk. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Examples in Hadith==
The [[hadith]] tradition contains numerous reports of descriptions of the punishment of the grave, its victims, their sins. This includes [[Hadith terminology#Sahih]] ("authentic") hadith by [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]]. (However, many ''[[Hadith]]'' are considered by some Islamic sects such as the [[Muʿtazila]] to be non-authenticated, due to them having a single-chain of transmission i.e. ''Ahad Hadith'').

*Narrated [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn 'Abbas]]: Allah's Apostle passed by two graves and said, "Both of them (persons in the grave) are being tortured, and they are not being tortured for a major sin. This one used not to save himself from being soiled with his urine, and the other used to go about with calumnies (among the people to rouse hostilities, e.g., one goes to a person and tells him that so-and-so says about him such-and-such evil things). The Prophet then asked for a green leaf of a date-palm tree, split it into two pieces and planted one on each grave and said, "It is hoped that their punishment may be abated till those two pieces of the leaf get dried."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muflihun.com/bukhari/73/78 Sahih al-Bukhari Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 78]&lt;/ref&gt;
*From [[Abu Hurayrah]] who said: The Prophet said, “When one of you finishes the last tashahhud (testimony of faith in prayer), he should seek refuge in Allah from four things: From the Punishment of Hell, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the Maseehud-Dajjaal (Anti-Christ).”&lt;ref&gt;Related by [[Sahih Muslim]] (2/93), Abu Daawood (no. 983), and others from Abu Hurayrah&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anas reported Mohammed as saying: If you were not (to abandon) the burying of the dead (in the grave), I would have certainly supplicated to Allah that He should make you listen to the torment of the grave.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Book 40, Hadith 6860: The Book Pertaining to Paradise, Its Description, Its Bounties and Its Intimates&lt;/ref&gt;
*Narrated [[Anas ibn Malik]]: The Prophet said, "When a human being is laid in his grave and his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two angels come to him and make him sit and ask him: What did you use to say about this man, Muhammad ? He will say: I testify that he is Allah's servant and His Apostle. Then it will be said to him, 'Look at your place in the Hell-Fire. Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead of it. “The Prophet added, "The dead person will see both his places. But a non-believer or a hypocrite will say to the angels, 'I do not know, but I used to say what the people used to say! It will be said to him, 'Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by reciting the Quran).' Then he will be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will cry and that cry will be heard by whatever approaches him except human beings and jinns."&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Book 2, Volume 23, Hadith 422: Funerals&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya|Umm Salama]] reported: The Messenger of Allah came to Abu Salama (as he died). His eyes were fixedly open. He closed them, and then said: When the soul is taken away the sight follows it. Some of the people of his family wept and wailed. So he said: Do not supplicate for yourselves anything but good, for angels say "Amen" to what you say. He then said: O Allah, forgive Abu Salama, raise his degree among those who are rightly guided, grant him a successor in his descendants who remain. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the Universe, and make his grave spacious, and grant him light in it.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Book 4, Hadith 2003: The Book of Prayers&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richie Mepranum''' (born May 5, 1987 in [[Maasim, Sarangani|Maasim]], [[Sarangani]], [[Philippines]]) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]] and current WBO Oriental flyweight champion.

==Fighting style==
A fine boxer and a skilled counter-puncher, Mepranum is considered one of the Philippines' best kept secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://uk.asiancorrespondent.com/edwin-espejo/richie%e2%80%99s-chances-are-good | title =Richie Mepranum primed for title shot  | last =Espejo | first =Edwin | work = | publisher =US-AsianCorrespondent.com | date =June 11, 2010 | accessdate =June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Flyweight===
Mepranum made his professional debut on August 31, 2005, defeating fellow Filipino boxer Leovimil Florentino by KO in Magpet, Cotabato (del Norte), Philippines.

The Filipino boxer won the WBO Oriental flyweight title on June 14, 2006 against previously unbeaten Joma Funda. The bout was held at the Maasim Gym in Maasim, Sarangani, Philippines; Mepranum won the bout by unanimous decision with the scores of 119-109, 119-109 and 120-108.

Mepranum suffered his first loss on September 14, 2007, against [[Thailand|Thai]] boxer [[Denkaosan Kaovichit]] at the Potawattana Saenee School, Ratchaburi, Thailand. Kaovichit won by unanimous decision with the scores of 116-112, 115-113, 116-112. Kaovichit became a world champion a year later, in a bout against [[Japan]]'s [[Takefumi Sakata]] for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[List of WBA world champions#Flyweight|World Flyweight]] title.  He bounced back by defeating [[Rocky Fuentes]] by [[split decision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philboxing.com/news/story-19372.html |title=Rocky Fuentes Victorious In Bantayan |publisher=Philboxing.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2010, Mepranum fought against Mexico's unbeaten [[Hernan Marquez|Hernan "Tyson" Marquez]] (27-0; 20 KO) at the Gaylord Hotel in Grapevine, Texas, United States. The Filipino boxer defeated Marquez with an impressive unanimous decision, with the scores of 99-91, 96-94, 98-92.

In June 2010, Mepranum fought for the vacant WBO Flyweight title relinquished by Argentina's [[Omar Andrés Narváez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mepranum was defeated by TKO in round 5 and Miranda was crowned WBO flyweight champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=28495 | title =Julio Cesar Miranda Stops Richie Mepranum in Five | last = | first = | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =June 13, 2010 | accessdate =June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bout did not start well for Miranda. The Mexican, however, took the pace in the next round, sending Mepranum down twice to the canvas, once in the 4th round and once in the fifth. The referee stopped the fight after the second knockdown, to avoid any more punishment.

Mepranum's next fight was held on November 13, 2010, on the undercard of the [[Pacquiao vs. Margarito]] boxing match. His opponent was Anthony Villareal, who lost to [[Milan Melindo]] in January 2010. The Sarangani native won the bout by split decision.

'''Robert Houghwout Jackson''' (February 13, 1892&amp;nbsp;– October 9, 1954) was an American attorney and judge who served as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. He had previously served as [[United States Solicitor General]], and [[United States Attorney General]], and is the only person to have held all three of those offices. Jackson was also notable for his work as the Chief United States Prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] of Nazi war criminals following [[World War II]].

Jackson was admitted to the bar through a combination of [[reading law]] with an established attorney and attending law school. He is the most recent justice without a law degree to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Jackson is well known for his advice that, "Any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect, in no uncertain terms, to make no statement to the police under any circumstances",&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=338&amp;invol=49 Watts v. Indiana]'', 338 U.S. 49, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and for his aphorism describing the Supreme Court, "We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=344&amp;invol=443 Brown v. Allen]'', 344 U.S. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson developed a reputation as one of the best writers on the Supreme Court and one of the most committed to enforcing due process as protection from overreaching federal agencies.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on a family farm in [[Spring Creek Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania]] on February 13, 1892, and was raised in [[Frewsburg, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Downs |first=John Phillips |date=1921 |title=History of Chautauqua County New York and its People |volume=III |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLQHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA357 |location=Boston, MA |publisher=American Historical Society |page=357 |ref={{sfnRef|''History of Chautauqua County New York and its People''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of William Eldred Jackson and Angelina Houghwout, he graduated from Frewsburg High School in 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=1297|title=Author biographies|last=|first=|date=|website=Pennsylvania Center For the Book|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the next year as a post-graduate student attending [[Jamestown High School (New York)|Jamestown High School]], where he worked to hone his writing skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|jstor=1226289|title=Robert H. Jackson, 1892-1954|last=Halpern|first=Philip|date=|work=Stanford Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson decided on a legal career; since attendance at college or law school wasn't a requirement if a student learned under the tutelage of an established attorney, at age 18 he began to [[reading law|study law]] with the [[Jamestown, New York]] firm in which his uncle, Frank Mott, was a partner.{{sfn|''History of Chautauqua County New York and its People''}} His uncle soon introduced him to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who was then serving as a member of the [[New York State Senate]].

Roosevelt regarded Jackson as a possible successor to the Presidency in 1940, and worked with his staff on an effort to raise Jackson's public profile.{{sfn|''That Man: An Insider's Portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt''|pages=xv-xvi}} Their plan was to mention Jackson favorably in Presidential remarks as often as possible, and to have Jackson take part frequently in Roosevelt's public appearances.{{sfn|''That Man: An Insider's Portrait of Franklin D.

Roosevelt''|pages=xv-xvi}}

==U.S. Attorney General, 1940–1941==
Jackson was then appointed to be the 57th Attorney General of the United States by Roosevelt, on January 4, 1940, replacing [[Frank Murphy]]. As Attorney General, Jackson supported a bill introduced by [[Sam Hobbs]], that would have legalized [[wiretapping]] by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), or any other government agency, if it was suspected that a [[felony]] was occurring.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. House Subcommittee no. 1 of the Committee on the Judiciary, To Authorize Wire Tapping. Hearings on H.R. 2266, H.R. 3099, 77th Cong., 1st sess., 1941, 1, 257&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) chairman [[James Lawrence Fly]], and it did not pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=House Committee Approval Likely on Wire-Tapping|last=Childs|first=Marquis W.|date=March 18, 1941|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|pages=3}} Section A.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jackson was Attorney General, he helped President Roosevelt organize the [[Lend-Lease]] agreement, which allowed the United States' to supply materials to help with the war effort to the other Allied forces, before formally entering World War II.

==U.S. Supreme Court, 1941–1954==
When [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] replaced the retiring [[Charles Evans Hughes]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] in 1941, Roosevelt appointed Jackson to the resulting vacant Associate's seat. The nomination was sent to Congress on June 12, 1941, and Jackson was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on July 7, 1941, receiving his commission on July 11, 1941. Robert H. Jackson was the 82nd [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], where he was known for his eloquent writing style and championing of individual liberties.

In 1943, Jackson wrote the majority opinion in ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'', which overturned a public school regulation making it mandatory to salute the flag, and imposing penalties of expulsion and prosecution upon students who failed to comply. Jackson's stirring language in ''Barnette'' concerning individual rights is widely quoted. Jackson's concurring opinion in 1952's ''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (forbidding President [[Harry Truman]]'s seizure of steel mills during the [[Korean War]] to avert a strike), in which Jackson formulated a three-tier test for evaluating claims of Presidential power, remains one of the most widely cited opinions in Supreme Court history. (It was quoted repeatedly by Supreme Court nominees [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], during their confirmation hearings.)

===Feud with Hugo Black===
Justices Jackson and [[Hugo Black]] had profound professional and personal disagreements dating back to October 1941, the first term during which they served together on the Supreme Court. According to [[Dennis J. Hutchinson|Dennis Hutchinson]], editor of ''[[The Supreme Court Review]]'', Jackson objected to Black's practice of importing his personal preferences into his jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Hutchison, ''The Black-Jackson Feud'', 1988 Sup.Ct.Rev. 203 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson quotes Jackson as having remarked, "With few exceptions, we all knew which side of a case Black would vote on when he read the names of the parties."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 230.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hutchinson points out that Jackson objected to Black's style of jurisprudence in such cases as ''[[Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis|Minersville v. Gobitis]]'' (1940) and ''United States v. Bethlehem Steel'' (1942), Black's involvement in the Jewell Ridge case struck Jackson as especially injudicious.

In ''[[Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers]]'' (1945), the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether to grant the coal company's petition for a rehearing, on the grounds that the victorious miners were, in a previous matter, represented by Crampton P. Harris, who was Justice Black's former law partner and personal lawyer. Despite this apparent conflict of interest, Black lobbied the Court for a [[per curiam]] denial of the petition. Justice Jackson objected, with the result that Jackson filed a concurrence disassociating himself from the ruling and, by implication, criticizing Black for not addressing the conflict of interest. Jackson also strongly objected to Black's judicial conduct in ''Jewell Ridge'' for another reason. As Jackson later alleged, while Justice Murphy was preparing his opinion, Black urged that the court hand down its decision without waiting for the opinion and dissent. In Jackson's eyes, the "...only apparent reason behind this proposal was to announce the decision in time to influence the contract negotiations during the coal strike" between the coal company and the miners, which were taking place at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson probably regarded Black's conduct as unbecoming of a Supreme Court Justice in another related matter. On April 3, 1945, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare held a dinner, at which it honored Justice Black as the 1945 recipient of the Thomas Jefferson Award. [[Fred M. Vinson]] spoke at the dinner. While Jackson declined an invitation to the event, citing a conflict arising out of the fact that a number of leading sponsors of the dinner were then litigants before the Supreme Court, Black attended the dinner and received his award. Crampton Harris, counsel in two pending cases, ''Jewell Ridge'' and ''CIO v. McAdory'' (1945), was one of the sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 236–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson later took these grievances public in two public cables from Nuremberg. Jackson had informally been promised the Chief Justiceship by Roosevelt; however, the seat came open while Jackson was in Germany, and Roosevelt was dead. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was faced with two factions, one recommending Jackson for the seat, and the other advocating for [[Hugo Black]]. In an attempt to avoid controversy, Truman appointed Vinson. Jackson blamed machinations by Black for his being passed over for the seat, and publicly exposed some of Black's controversial behavior and feuding within the Court. The controversy was heavily covered in the press, and cast the [[New Deal]] Court in a negative light, and had the effect of tarnishing Jackson's reputation in the years that followed.

On June 8, 1946, Jackson sent a cable to President Truman. Jackson's cable to Truman began with an insincere offer of congratulations to the President for his appointment of Vinson. However, the cable then quickly addressed the rumor, which Jackson had gotten wind of in Nuremberg, according to which Truman had appointed Fred Vinson, in part, to avert a resignation on the part of Justice Black. Rumors had been circulating in Washington that Black would resign in the event that Truman chose Jackson as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] Stone's successor. "I would be loathe to believe that you would concede to any man a veto over court appointments."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson closed his cable by stating that he could not continue his service as an Associate Justice under Vinson if an associate "had something on [him]", which would disqualify him from serving, or if he, Truman, regarded Jackson's opinion in the ''Jewell Ridge'' case as a "gratuitous insult" to Justice Black.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dennis v. United States''&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving a response from Truman in which he denied having given consideration to, or having even heard of, the rumor of Black's threatened resignation, Jackson rashly fired off a second cable to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on June 10. This cable stated Jackson's reasons for his belief that Justice Black faced a conflict of interest in ''Jewell Ridge'', from which he wrongfully, at least, in Jackson's eyes, did not [[Judicial disqualification|recuse himself]], and ended with Jackson's threat that if such a practice "is ever repeated while I am on the bench, I will make my ''Jewell Ridge'' opinion look like a letter of recommendation, by comparison."&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson and ''Dennis v. United States''===

====The [[Clear and present danger|"clear and present danger" test]]====
In 1919, the Supreme Court decided ''[[Schenck v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; In Schenck, the petitioners, members of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] were convicted of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], for printing and distributing circulars asserting that American citizens had a right to oppose the draft during [[World War I]] because, among other things, it violated the United States Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Schenck at 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The Schenck decision promulgated the "clear and present danger test," which provided the standard for sustaining a conviction when speech is relied upon as evidence that an offense has been committed.&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'', 341 U.S. 494, 505–507. see also, ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Holmes]], writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the decision of the lower court positing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We admit that, in many places and in ordinary times, the defendants, in saying all that was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights. But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done. . . The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances, and are of such a nature as to create a "clear and present danger" that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.&lt;ref&gt;249 U.S. 47, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Dennis v. United States''====

=====Background=====
In 1951, the Supreme Court decided ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Dennis, the petitioners were zealous [[Communism|Communists]] who organized for the purpose of teaching the "Marxist-Leninist Doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' p. 582 (Douglas, J. Dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; The principal texts used to teach the doctrine were: ''History of the Communist Party of the [[Soviet Union]]''; ''Foundations of Leninism'' by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]; ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]; and ''[[State and Revolution]]'' by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Petitioners were convicted for violating clause 2 and clause 3 of the Smith Act which, among other things, made it unlawful to conspire to organize a group which advocates the overthrow of the United States government, by force or violence.&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 495; see also, 54 Stat. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue before the Supreme Court was "[w]hether either §2 or §3 of the [[Smith Act]], inherently, or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights..."&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 495–496.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jackson's concurrence=====
In Dennis, Jackson concluded that the "clear and present danger test" should not be applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Jackson analyzed: the effect Communism had outside the United States; the nature of Communists; and the problems with applying the test. Jackson's analysis can be summarized as follows:

On the effect that Communists historically had on foreign countries, Jackson analyzed their effect on [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 565–566.&lt;/ref&gt; In Czechoslovakia, a Communist organization disguised as a competing political faction secretly established its roots in key control positions "of police and information services".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During a period of national crisis, a clandestine Communist organization appeared, and overthrew the Czechoslovakian government. Establishing control of mass communication and industry, the Communist organization's rule was one of "oppression and terror". Ironically, as Jackson points out, the Communist organization suppressed the very freedoms which made its conspiracy possible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On the nature of Communists, Jackson characterizes them as an extraordinarily dedicated and highly selective group, disciplined and indoctrinated by Communist policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 564.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Party members is to secretly infiltrate key positions of government, industry, and unions, and to leverage their power once in such positions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Jackson goes on to say that, although "Communist[s] have no scruples against sabotage, terrorism, assassination, or mob disorder", they "advocate force only when prudent", which "may never be necessary, because infiltration and deception may be enough".&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 564–565.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the problems with applying the clear and present danger test in Dennis, Jackson deems significant that the test was authored "before the era of World War II revealed the subtlety and efficacy of modernized revolutionary technique used by totalitarian parties."&lt;ref name="Id. at 568"&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 568.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson believed that the application of the test should be limited to cases bearing strong enough likeness to those for which it was originally crafted – i.e., "...criminality of hot-headed speech on a street corner, or parading by some zealots behind a red flag, or refusal of a handful of Jehovah Witness school children to salute our flag".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Expressing strong concern that the expansive construction the Court had recently given the test in ''Bridges v. State of California'',&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 568 n.12 (1951) (distinguishing ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' 274 U.S. 357, 376 (1927) from ''Bridges v. State of California'', 314 U.S. 252, 263 (1941)).&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson asserted that the test provided Communists with "unprecedented immunities", while the "Government is captive in a judge-made verbal trap."&lt;ref name="Id. at 568"/&gt; Jackson goes on to describe the application of the test to Communists, when determining the constitutionality of the Smith Act facially, or as applied as one of "...apprais[ing] imponderables, including international and national phenomena, which baffle the best informed foreign offices and our most experienced politicians."&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson concludes his First Amendment analysis in Dennis by asserting that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The authors of the "clear and present danger test" never applied it to a case like this, nor would I. If applied as it is proposed here, it means that the Communist plotting is protected during its period of incubation; its preliminary stages of organization and preparation are immune from the law; the Government can move only after imminent action is manifest, when it would, of course, be too late.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Conclusion=====
In the end, the Court applied its own version of the "clear and present danger test" in Dennis,&lt;ref&gt;''Dennis v. United States'' at 510–511.&lt;/ref&gt; essentially disregarding the analytical elements of probability and temporality which had previously appeared to be requirements of the doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Chemrensky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies, 961, 962 (Aspen 2ed. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson, however, as one commentator put it, expressed in Dennis (at least with regards to Communists) that, "when used as part of a conspiracy to act illegally, speech loses its First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;Martin H. Redish, Unlawful Advocacy and Free Speech Theory: Rethinking the Lessons of The McCarthy Era, 73 UCINLR 9, 51 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's hardened stance on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in Dennis may be attributed to strong anti-Communist sentiment, which had a grip on Americans during the time of the decision.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;see generally, William M. Wiecek, The Legal Foundation of Domestic Anticommunism: The Background of Dennis v. United States, T 2001 Sup. Ct. Rev. 375, 429, 434 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In William Wiecek's article discussing the history of anti-communism in the United States, he asserts that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he manufactured image of the domestic Communist, cultivated and propagated by [[J. Edgar Hoover|[J. Edgar] Hoover]], the Catholic Church, the [[American Legion]], and political opportunists, made of Communists something less than full humans, full citizens, fully rights-endowed. Even sophisticated jurists like ... Robert Jackson were captives of that image, anesthetizing [his] sensitivity to [the] deprivation of [their] rights. In Dennis and other Communist cases between 1950 and 1956, the Supreme Court overcame the problem of facts not supporting the results [that] it was determined to reach, by accepting a generic 'proof' of Communism's seditious nature. Disregarding all evidence of both the Party's and individual members' renunciation of violence, the Court substituted literary evidence from outdated classics of Marxism-Leninism, most written by Europeans of an earlier era, and refused to consider whether the living people before them actually subscribed to those doctrines..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Justice Jackson and ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]''===

====Background====

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, there was great suspicion surrounding Japanese-Americans, particularly those residing on the West Coast of the United States. Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 9066]] on February 19, 1942, giving the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] permission to declare some zones "military zones", in which they could prohibit certain people from accessing prescribed areas. With this executive order, the War Department was able to declare that all United States citizens of Japanese ancestry were prohibited from areas in California that were deemed unsafe for Japanese-American habitation for national security purposes, and it forced them into internment camps.

[[Fred Korematsu]], a United States citizen, born on American soil, believed that this was an unconstitutional infringement on an individual's civil liberty. The question that came before the Supreme Court of the United States, was whether the Executive and Legislative branches went beyond their war powers by depriving citizens of rights with no criminal basis.

====Jackson's dissent====

The Supreme Court decided that the President and Congress did not stretch their war powers too far by choosing national security over an individual's rights in a time of war. Justice Hugo Black wrote the majority opinion for this case, and Justice Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion. The opening paragraph of Jackson's dissent illustrated his view of the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Korematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a citizen of the United States by nativity, and a citizen of California by residence. No claim is made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here, he is not law-abiding and well- disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.&lt;ref name="BanksSmolla2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdQkk9J-P4oC&amp;pg=PT463|title=Constitutional Law: Structure and Rights in Our Federal System|date=6 May 2010|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-0-327-17509-4|pages=462–465|author1=William C. Banks|author2=Rodney Smolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Jackson warned of the danger that this great allowance of executive power presented, through the War Department's ability to deprive individual rights in favor of national security, in time of war:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But if we cannot confine military expedients by the Constitution, neither would I distort the Constitution to approve all that the military may deem expedient. That is what the Court appears to be doing, whether consciously or not. I cannot say, from any evidence 	before me, that the orders of General DeWitt were not reasonably expedient military precautions, nor could I say that they were. But even if they were permissible military 	procedures, I deny that it follows that they are constitutional. If, as the Court holds, it does follow, then we may as well say that any military order will be constitutional, and have done with it.&lt;ref name="BarnettKatz2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06nfDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT706|title=Constitutional Law: Cases in Context|date=9 December 2014|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=978-1-4548-2920-1|pages=705–707|author1=Randy E. Barnett|author2=Howard E. Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Conclusion====

Robert H. Jackson was not concerned in evaluating the validity of General DeWitt's claim that the internment of Japanese citizens on the West Coast was necessary for national security purposes, but whether this would set a precedent of war-time racial discrimination that would be used to strip individual liberties.

&lt;blockquote&gt; But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time has validated the principles of racial discrimination in criminal procedure, and of transplanting American citizens. The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking, and expands it to new purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JCjZWrQjA4C&amp;pg=PA229|title=Encyclopedia of Supreme Court Quotations|publisher=M.E.

===Justice Jackson and ''Brown v. Board of Education''===
One of Jackson's [[law clerk]]s during 1952 – 53, [[William H. Rehnquist]], was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1971, and became Chief Justice in 1986. In December 1971, after Rehnquist's nomination had been approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] and was pending before the full Senate, a 1952 [[Bench memorandum|memorandum]] came to light that he had written as Jackson's law clerk in connection with the landmark case, ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]],'' that argued in favor of affirming the separate-but-equal doctrine of ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''. Rehnquist wrote a brief letter attributing the views to Jackson, and was confirmed. In his 1986 hearing, he was questioned about the matter. His explanation of the memorandum was disputed in both 1971 and 1986 by Jackson's former secretary, and scholars have questioned its plausibility. However, the papers of Justices Douglas and Frankfurter indicate that Justice Jackson voted for ''Brown'' in 1954 only after changing his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote: "In the original conference there were only four who voted that segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional. Those four were Black, Burton, Minton, and myself." See Bernard Schwartz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5cUCl4hSWUC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;ots=5UtEFgR-B5&amp;dq=%22May+17,+1954%22+and+%22memorandum+for+the+file%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=JrgkG7MAPIwfCPRBYYtwY9XULP4 Decision: How the Supreme Court Decides Cases]'', page 96 (Oxford 1996). Likewise, Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] wrote: "I have no doubt that if the segregation cases had reached decision last term, there would have been four dissenters – Vinson, Reed, Jackson, and Clark."  Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of Justice Jackson about ''Brown'' can be found in his 1954 unpublished draft concurrence.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{Cite journal

Jackson's draft concurrence in ''Brown'', divided into four parts, shows how he struggled with how to write an effective opinion to strike down segregation. In Part 1 of Jackson's draft concurrence in ''Brown'', he wrote that he went to school where, "Negro pupils were very few" and that he was "predisposed to the conclusion that segregation elsewhere has outlived whatever justification it may have had." Despite his own opinions regarding desegregation, Jackson acknowledged the inability of the Court to "eradicate" the "fears, prides and prejudices" that made segregation an important social practice in the South. Jackson thus concluded that the Northerners on the court should be sensitive to the conditions that brought segregation to the South.

In Part 2 of the draft [[Bench memorandum|memorandum]], Justice Jackson described the legal framework for forbidding segregation in "Does Existing Law Condemn Segregation?". Jackson notes that it was difficult for the Court, which expected "not to make new law, but only to declare existing law," to overturn a decision of such longevity as ''Plessy''. Looking at the doctrine of [[original intent]] with regard to the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv Fourteenth Amendment], Justice Jackson found no evidence that segregation was prohibited, particularly since states that had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment had segregated schools at the time. Jackson concluded, "I simply cannot find in the conventional material of constitutional interpretation any justification for saying" that segregated schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

Part 3 of the draft memorandum titled "Enforcement Power Limits", describes enforcement by Congress of the Fourteenth Amendment. Jackson addressed the possibility of leaving enforcement to Congress, particularly because the "courts have no power to enforce general declarations of law." Jackson noted that while segregation was already fading in some states, it would be difficult to overcome in those states where segregation was firmly established. While Jackson recognized the difficulties in the Supreme Court enforcing its judgment, he did not want the task to be left to the lower courts, as suggested by the Government. Jackson concluded that the court must act because "our representative system has failed", and even though this "premise is not a sound basis for judicial action."

Finally, in Part 4 of the draft memorandum "Changed Conditions", Jackson began by stating that prior to ''Brown'', segregation was legal. According to Jackson, the premise for overruling ''Plessy'' was the now erroneous "factual assumption" that "there were differences between the Negro and the white races, viewed as a whole." The draft asserted that the "spectacular" progress of African-Americans, under adverse circumstances, "enabled [them] to outgrow the system and to overcome the presumptions on which it was based." Jackson emphasized that the changed conditions, along with the importance of a public education, required the court to strike down the concept of "separate but equal" in public education. While Jackson could not justify the decision in ''Brown'' in law, he did so on the basis of a political and social imperative. It is unknown if Jackson ever intended to publish this concurrence.

Justice Jackson was in the hospital from March 30 to May 17, 1954. It is reported that Chief Justice Warren visited Jackson in the hospital several times, and discussed both Jackson's draft opinion and Warren's drafts. One suggestion that Warren took from Jackson was adding the following sentence: "Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences, as well as in the business and professional world."&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt; This quote is tied to the arguments in Part 4 of Jackson's draft opinion. On May 17, 1954, Jackson went to the Court from the hospital, so that he could be there the day that the ''Brown'' decision was handed down. When the ''Brown'' decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H. Jackson died on October 9, 1954, and so there was not enough time between ''Brown'' and the death of Jackson to fully explore his views on desegregation.

===Justice Jackson and procedural due process===

Justice Jackson was a staunch defender (along with Justice [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]]) of [[procedural due process]], for the [[rule of law]] that protects members of the public from overreaching by government agencies. One of his hymns to due process is often quoted:&lt;ref&gt;''Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel Mezei'', 345 U.S. 206, 224–25 (1953) (Jackson, J., dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Procedural fairness, if not all that originally was meant by due process of law, is at least what it most uncompromisingly requires. Procedural due process is more elemental and less flexible than substantive due process. It yields less to the times, varies less with conditions, and defers much less to legislative judgment. Insofar as it is technical law, it must be a specialized responsibility within the competence of the judiciary on which they do not bend before political branches of the Government, as they should on matters of policy which compromise substantive law.

If it be conceded that in some way [the agency could take the action it did], does it matter what the procedure is? Only the untaught layman or the charlatan lawyer can answer that procedure matters not. Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable essence of liberty. Severe substantive laws can be endured if they are fairly and impartially applied. Indeed, if put to the choice, one might well prefer to live under Soviet substantive law applied in good faith by our common-law procedures, than under our substantive law enforced by Soviet procedural practices. Let it not be overlooked that due process of law is not for the sole benefit of an accused. It is the best insurance for the Government itself against those blunders which leave lasting stains on a system of justice but which are bound to occur on ''ex parte'' consideration.}}

In 1945, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appointed Jackson (who took a leave of absence from the Supreme Court), as U.S. Chief of Counsel for the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. He helped draft the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]], which created the legal basis for the Nuremberg Trials. He then served in [[Nuremberg|Nuremberg, Germany]], as United States Chief Prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials|International Military Tribunal]]. Jackson pursued his prosecutorial role with a great deal of vigor. His opening and closing arguments before the Nuremberg court were widely celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Menand |first=Louis |date=18 September 2017 |title=Drop Your Weapons |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |quote=The chief U.S. prosecutor, Robert Jackson, characterized German aggression in his celebrated opening statement...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of defendant [[Albert Speer]]:

However, some believe that his cross-examination skills were generally weak, and it was British prosecutor [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]] who got the better of [[Hermann Göring]] in cross-examination, rather than Jackson, who was rebuked by the Tribunal for losing his temper and being repeatedly baited by Göring during the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Tusa and John Tusa, ''The Nuremberg Trial" (London, Macmillan, 1983), pp 269-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==

On March 30, 1954, Jackson had suffered a massive heart attack. He was confined to the hospital until May 17, when he returned to the court. He remained functioning in his position as Justice until October 4, 1954. On Saturday, October 9, 1954, Jackson suffered a [[myocardial infarction]]. At 11:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. he died at 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Greatest Supreme Court Justices|last=Feldman|first=Noah|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group]]|year=October 2010|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=403–405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funeral services were held in Washington's National Cathedral,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1954/10/13/page/25A/article/1-000-at-rites-for-jackson-in-washington|title=1,000 AT RITES FOR JACKSON IN WASHINGTON (October 13, 1954)|last=|first=|date=|website=Chicago Tribune|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301063757/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1954/10/13/page/25A/article/1%2D000%2Dat%2Drites%2Dfor%2Djackson%2Din%2Dwashington|archive-date=2018-03-01|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Jamestown's St. Luke's Church.

'''''Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG)''''', [1993] 3 SCR 519 is a landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision where the prohibition of [[assisted suicide]] was challenged as contrary to the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' ("''Charter''") by a terminally ill woman, [[Sue Rodriguez]]. In a 5–4 decision, the Court upheld the provision in the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]''.

==Background==
Sue Rodriguez was a 42-year-old mother whose illness [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS or "Lou Gehrig's disease") was diagnosed in 1992. By 1993, it was found that she would not live more than a year, and so she began a crusade to strike down section 241(b) of the ''Criminal Code'', which made assisted suicide illegal, to the extent it would be illegal for a terminally ill person to commit "physician-assisted" suicide.

She applied to the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] to have section 241(b) of ''Criminal Code'' struck down because it allegedly violated [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 7]] (the right to "life, liberty, and security of the person), [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|12]] (protection against "cruel and unusual treatment or punishment&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1993/1993canlii75/1993canlii75.html&lt;/ref&gt;") and [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|15(1)]] of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (equality).

==Reasons of the court==
Sopinka J, writing for the majority, found there was no violation of section 7. He first considered whether the prohibition on ending one's life engaged the right to [[security of person]]. He found the prohibition had sufficient connection with the justice system by its impact on an individual's autonomy and right to life by causing physical and psychological pain.

However, Sopinka J found the provision did not violate any principles of fundamental justice. He examined the long history of the prohibition of suicide and concludes that it reflects part of the fundamental values of society and so could not be in violation of fundamental justice.

He also rejected the claim that the provision violated the section 12 right against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as a mere prohibition did not fall within the meaning of treatment.

Lastly, he considered the section 15 equality challenge. He noted the issue is best not resolved under this right, but in assuming it did violate section 15, he found it was clearly saved under section 1. He found the objective was pressing and substantial, rational and that there was no lesser means to achieve the goal.

In dissent, Lamer CJ held that the ''Criminal Code'' section 241(b) had infringed on section 15, but he did not consider sections 7 and 12.

Cory J ruled that the right to die is as much a protected freedom under section 7 of the ''Charter'' as any other part of life.

McLachlin J's judgment was that ''Criminal Code'' section 241(b) violated the section 7 right to security of the person and that the violation was not saved under section 1.

==Overturned==
The Supreme Court's ruling in ''Rodriguez'' was overturned 22 years later in the 2015 decision in ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2015 SCC 5.&lt;/ref&gt; which found that denying assisted suicide in some cases violated Section 7 of the ''Charter''.

'''Sarah C. Acheson''' (February 20, 1844 – January 16, 1899) was an American temperance activist, born in [[Washington, Pennsylvania]], on 20 February, 1844.

==Biography==
Sarah Cooke Acheson was born in [[Washington, Pennsylvania]], on February 20, 1844.&lt;ref name="tshaonline.org" /&gt; She was descended on the paternal side from English and Dutch families that settled in Virginia in 1600, and on the maternal side from Col. [[George Morgan (merchant)|George Morgan]], who had charge of Indian affairs under Washington, with headquarters at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], and of whom Jefferson, in a letter she possessed said, "He first gave me notice of the mad project of that day," meaning the [[Aaron Burr]] treason.  Among her ancestors were Col. [[William-Duane]], of Philadelphia, editor of the Philadelphia ''Aurora'' during the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Brooks|1896|p=150}}

She married, in 1863, Capt. Acheson, of Washington, Pennsylvania, then on Gen. Miles's staff, the marriage taking place while the Captain was on furlough with a gunshot wound in the face. He left for the front ten days after, encouraged by his young wife.

Dr and Mrs. Acheson moved to Texas in 1872. During their residence in Texas Acheson was active in charitable and temperance work throughout the State.  When a cyclone struck the village of [[Savoy, Texas|Savoy]], many of its inhabitants were badly wounded, some were killed, others made homeless.  Mrs. Acheson reached them as speedily as a train could take her, doing duty as nurse and special provider for the suffering.  She gave three years of active service to the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.  She was state president at a time when a strong leader was greatly needed, guiding them into  financial safety.  Acheson was well read in all the thought of the day including social, scientific and religious reform.  She lived in [[Denison, Texas|Denison]], Texas. She died in Denison, January 16, 1899, and was buried in Fairview Cemetery.&lt;ref name="tshaonline.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=ACHESON, SARAH C. |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fac05 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">'''Solomon ben Abraham Abigdor''' (also rendered as Solomon ben Abraham Avigdor), born in [[Provence]] in 1384, was a Hebrew translator, physician, and mystic.

Assisted by his father, [[Abraham Bonet ben Meshullam]], he, at the early age of fifteen years, translated [[Arnauld de Villeneuve]]'s work, "De Judiciis Astronomiæ," from Latin into Hebrew under the title "Panim ba-Mishpaṭ" (Methods of Judgment). This translation still exists in manuscript. In 1399 he also translated [[Sacrobosco]]'s "Sphæra Mundi" (On the Astronomy of the Spheres), under the title "Mareh ha-Ofanim" (The Indicator of the Spheres). The last-mentioned work was printed in [[Abraham bar Ḥiyya]]'s "Ẓurat ha-Areẓ" (Offenbach, 1720), with notes by [[Mattathiah Delacrut]], [[Manoah Hendel]], and others.

[[File:PlanetaSH(3).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Artist's impression of one possible appearance of a superhabitable planet. The reddish hue is vegetation.&lt;ref name="Plnts" /&gt;]]

A '''superhabitable planet''' is a hypothetical type of [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] that may be better suited than [[Earth]] for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence]] and [[evolution]] of  [[life]]. The concept was introduced in 2014 by René Heller and John Armstrong,{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} who have criticized the language used in the search for [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]], so they propose clarifications because a [[circumstellar habitable zone]] (HZ) is not enough to define a planet's habitability.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=51|ps=}} Heller and  Armstrong state that it is not clear why Earth should offer the most suitable physicochemical parameters to living organisms, because "planets could be non-Earth-like, yet offer more suitable conditions for the emergence and evolution of life than Earth did or does."  While still assuming that life requires water, they hypothesize that Earth may not represent the optimal [[planetary habitability]] conditions for maximum [[biodiversity]]; in other words, they define a superhabitable world as a [[Rocky planet|terrestrial planet]] or moon that could support more diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]] than there are on Earth, as it would empirically show that its [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] is more hospitable to life.

Heller and Armstrong also point out that not all [[rocky planet]]s in a [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] (HZ) may be habitable, and that [[tidal heating]] can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ, such as in [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'s internal ocean.&lt;ref name="HZ"&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Reynolds, R.T. |author2=McKay, C.P. |author3=Kasting, J.F. |title=Europa, tidally heated oceans, and habitable zones around giant planets |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273117787903644 |journal=Advances in Space Research |pages=125–132 |issue=7 |year=1987 | doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(87)90364-4|bibcode = 1987AdSpR...7..125R }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The habitable zone (HZ) is a region present around each star where a terrestrial planet or moon that has an atmospheric pressure and a suitable combination of gases, could maintain liquid water on its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Mendez |first=Abel |date=10 August 2011 |title=Habitable Zone Distance (HZD): A habitability metric for exoplanets |journal=PHL |url=http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/habitablezonesdistancehzdahabitabilitymetricforexoplanets |access-date=22 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=17 July 2015 |publisher=PHL de la [[University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo|UPRA]] |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, planets in the HZ may not be habitable, as tidal heating during the planet's orbit can be an additional heat source that causes a planet to enter a runaway greenhouse state.|group=n.}}  The authors propose that in order to identify a habitable—or superhabitable—planet, a characterization concept is required that is biocentric rather than geo- or [[anthropocentric]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}} Heller and Armstrong proposed to establish a profile for exoplanets according to stellar type, mass and location in their [[planetary system]], among other features. According to these authors, such superhabitable worlds would likely be larger, warmer, and older than Earth, and orbiting [[K-type main-sequence star]]s.

== General characteristics ==
Heller and Armstrong proposed that a series of basic characteristics are required to classify an [[exoplanet]] or [[exomoon]] as superhabitable;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/super-habitable-world-may-exist-near-earth/ |title=Super-Habitable World May Exist Near Earth |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=March 14, 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=50|ps=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Williams, D.M. |author2=Kasting, J.F. |title=Habitable Planets with High Obliquities |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103597957596 |journal=Icarus |pages=254–267 |issue=1 | date=September 1997 |doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5759 |bibcode=1997Icar..129..254W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Rushby, A.J. |author2=Claire, M.W. |author3=Osborn, H. |author4=Watson, A.J. |title=Habitable Zone Lifetimes of Exoplanets around Main Sequence |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2012.0938 |journal=Astrobiology |pages=833–849 |issue=13 |date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} for size, it is required to be about 2 [[mass of the Earth|Earth masses]], and 1.3 [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] will provide an optimal size for [[plate tectonics]].{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55|ps=}} In addition, it would have a greater [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] that would increase retention of gases during the planet's formation.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} It is therefore likely that they have a denser [[atmosphere]] that will offer greater concentration of [[oxygen]] and [[greenhouse gas]]es, which in turn raise the average temperature to optimum levels for plant life to about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}&lt;ref name="ScAm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/superhabitable-planets/ |title=Faraway Planets May Be Far Better for Life |access-date=20 April 2015 |last=Moyer |first=Michael |date=31 January 2014 |journal=Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt; A denser atmosphere may also influence the surface relief, making it more regular and decreasing the size of the [[ocean basin]]s, which would improve diversity of marine life in shallow waters.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-56|ps=}}

Other factors to consider are the [[Stellar classification|type of star]] in the system. [[K-type star]]s are less massive than the Sun, and are stable on the main sequence for a very long time (15 to 30 billion years, compared to 10 billion for the Sun, a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-class star]]),{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}} giving more time for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]] and [[evolution]]. A superhabitable world would also require to be located near the center of the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of its star system for a long time.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56|ps=}}{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}

Experts have not reached a consensus about what is the optimal rotation speed for an exoplanet, but it should not be too fast nor too slow. The latter case can cause some problems similar to those observed in Venus, which completes one rotation every 243 Earth days and as a result, cannot generate an Earth-like [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |title=Planet Venus Facts: A Hot, Hellish &amp; Volcanic Planet |url=http://www.space.com/44-venus-second-planet-from-the-sun-brightest-planet-in-solar-system.html |journal=Space.com |date=4 November 2014 |access-date=2 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57-58|ps=}}

=== Atmosphere ===
There are no solid arguments to explain if Earth's atmosphere has the optimal composition to host life.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} On Earth, during the period when [[coal]] was first formed, atmospheric oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}) levels were up to 35%, and  coincided with the periods of greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Falcon-Lang, H. J.| title=Fire ecology of a Late Carboniferous floodplain, Joggins, Nova Scotia| year=1999| publisher=Journal of the Geological Society| location=London| chapter=156| pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, assuming that the presence of a significant amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is essential for exoplanets to develop complex life forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author1=Harrison, J.F. |author2=Kaiser, A. |author3=VandenBrooks, J.M. |title=Atmospheric oxygen level and the evolution of insect body size |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1690/1937 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |pages=1937–1946 |volume=277 |date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} the percentage of oxygen relative to the total atmosphere appears to limit the maximum size of the planet for optimum superhabitability and ample biodiversity{{Clarify|date=October 2016}}.

Also, the atmospheric density should be higher in more massive planets, which reinforces the hypothesis that [[super-Earths]] can provide superhabitable conditions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}}

=== Age ===
[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|280px|thumb|right|The first stars that formed in the universe were [[metallicity|metal-free stars]], which probably prevented planet formation.]]
In a biological context, older planets than Earth may have greater biodiversity, since native species have had more time to [[Biological evolution|evolve]], adapt and stabilize the environmental conditions to sustain a suitable environment for life that can benefit their descendants.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=56-57|ps=}}

However, for many years it was thought that since older star systems have lower [[metallicity]], they should display low planet formation, and thus such old planets may have been scant in the beginning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Ray |last=Sanders |title=When Stellar Metallicity Sparks Planet Formation |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/when-stellar-metallicity-sparks-planet-formation/ |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |date=9 April 2012 |access-date=7 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the number of ''[[Metallicity|metallic]]'' items in the universe must have grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref name="AgP"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/17441-universe-heavy-metals-planet-formation.html |title=When Did the Universe Have the Right Stuff for Planets? |access-date=24 April 2015 |journal=Space.com |last=Cooper |first=Keith |date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first exoplanetary discoveries, mostly gas giants orbiting very close to their stars, known as ''[[Hot Jupiters]]'', suggest that planets were rare in systems with low metallicity, which invited suspicion of a time limit on the appearance of the first objects landmass.{{Sfn|Perryman|2011|p=188-189|ps=}} Later, in 2012, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler telescope]]'s observations allowed experts to find out that this relationship is much more restrictive in systems with [[Hot Jupiters]], and that terrestrial planets could form in stars of much lower metallicity, to some extent.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt;  It is now thought that the first Earth-mass objects should appear sometime between 7 and 12 billion years.&lt;ref name="AgP" /&gt; Given the greater stability of the orange dwarfs (K-type) compared to the Sun (G-type) and longer life expectancy, it is possible that superhabitable exoplanets belonging to K-type stars, orbiting within its habitable zone, could provide a longer, steadier, and better environment for life than Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=57|ps=}}

Despite the scarcity of information available, the hypotheses presented above on superhabitable planets can be summarized as a preliminary profile, even if there is no scientific consensus.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} 
* Mass: approximately 2M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Radius: to maintain a similar Earth density, its radius should be between 1.2 and 1.3R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Oceans: percentage of surface area covered by oceans should be Earth-like but more distributed, without large continuous land masses. The oceans should be shallow; the light then will penetrate easier through the water and will reach the fauna and flora, stimulating an abundance of life down in the ocean.
* Distance: shorter distance from the center of the habitable zone of the system than Earth.
* Temperature: average surface temperature of about {{convert|25|C|F}}.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}} 
* Star and age: belonging to an intermediate [[K-type star]] with an older age than the Sun (4.5 billion years) but younger than 7 billion years.
* Atmosphere: somewhat denser than Earth's and with a higher concentration of oxygen. That will make life larger and more abundant.

There is no confirmed exoplanet that meets all these requirements. After updating the database of exoplanets on 23 July 2015, the one that comes closest is [[Kepler-442b]], belonging to an orange dwarf star, with a radius of 1.34R&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; and a mass of 2.34M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;, but with an estimated surface temperature of {{convert|-2.65|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=Kepler-442+b| title=NASA Exoplanet Archive |access-date=8 January 2015 |first=[[NASA]] |work=NASA Exoplanet Science Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data|title=Planetary Habitability Laboratory |access-date=7 January 2015 |first=[[PHL]] |work=PHL University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===

The appearance of a superhabitable planet should be, in general, very similar to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}} The main differences, in compliance with the profile seen previously, would be derived from its mass. Its denser atmosphere probably prevent the formation of ice sheets as a result of lower thermal difference between different regions of the planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Also, it has a higher concentration of clouds, and abundant rainfall.

Probably the vegetation is very different due to the increased air density, precipitation, temperature, and stellar flux. For the type of light emitted from the [[K-type star]]s, plants may take other colors than green.&lt;ref name="Plnts"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| author=Nancy Y.

In general, the climate of a superhabitable planet would be warmer, moist, homogeneous and have stable land, allowing life to extend across the surface without presenting large population differences, in contrast to Earth that has inhospitable areas such as glaciers, deserts and tropical regions.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-56|ps=}} If the atmosphere contains enough molecular oxygen, the conditions of these planets may be bearable to humans even without the protection of a [[space suit]], provided that the atmosphere does not contain excessive toxic gases, but would require some adaptation to the increased gravity, such as an increase in muscles and  in bone density, etc.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-59|ps=}}&lt;ref name="WW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/20728-new-alien-planets-oceans-life.html |title=What Might Alien Life Look Like on New 'Water World' Planets? |access-date=23 April 2015 |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=18 April 2013 |publisher=Space.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abundance ==
[[File:SH Planet comp.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Set and subsets of terrestrial worlds.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}]]
Heller and Armstrong speculate that the number of superhabitable planets can far exceed that of [[Earth analog]]s:{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}} less massive stars in the [[main sequence]] are more abundant than the larger and brighter stars, so there are more orange dwarfs than solar analogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=LeDrew |first=Glenn |year=2001 |title=The Real Starry Sky |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |volume=95 |issue=686 |pages=32–33 |issn=0035-872X |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2001JRASC..95...32L&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=16 July 2015 |bibcode=2001JRASC..95...32L}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that about 9% of stars in the Milky Way are [[K-type star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Croswell |first=Ken |title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60sPD6yjbVAC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=percentage+%22orange+dwarfs%22+milky+way&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zit9UpfGA-&amp;sig=o1ASitJqAFJH7NqnlVOyRS-DLsU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMI0_Ki-cjgxgIVxVoUCh3AYACT#v=onepage&amp;q=percentage%20%22orange%20dwarfs%22%20milky%20way&amp;f=false |access-date=17 July 2015 |edition=1 |year=1997 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0684832526 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another point favoring the predominance of superhabitable planets in regard to Earth analogs is that, unlike the latter, most of the requirements of a superhabitable world can occur spontaneously and jointly simply by having a higher mass.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=54-58|ps=}} A planetary body close to 2 or 3M&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt; should have longer-lasting plate tectonics and also will have a larger surface area in comparison to Earth.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=59|ps=}} Similarly, it is likely that its oceans are shallower by the effect of gravity on the planet's crust, its gravitational field more intense and, a denser atmosphere.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=55-58|ps=}}

By contrast, Earth-mass planets may have a wider range of conditions. For example, some may sustain active tectonics for a shorter time period and will therefore end up with lower air density than Earth, increasing the probability of developing global ice coverage, or even a permanent [[Snowball Earth]] scenario.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Another negative effect of lower atmospheric density can be manifested in the form of thermal oscillations, which can lead to high variability in the global climate and increase the chance for  catastrophic events. In addition, by having a weaker [[magnetosphere]], such planets may lose their atmospheric hydrogen by [[hydrodynamic escape]] easier and become a desert planet.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=58|ps=}} Any of these examples could prevent the emergence of life on a planet's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star/#.VMlrZi4XeOU |title=NASA's Kepler Discovers First Earth-Size Planet In The 'Habitable Zone' of Another Star |access-date=4 August 2015 |last1=Johnson |first1=Michele |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |date=17 April 2014 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the multitude of scenarios that can turn an Earth-mass planet located in the habitable zone of a solar analogue into an inhospitable place are less likely on a planet that meets the basic features of a superhabitable world, so that the latter should be more common.{{Sfn|Heller|Armstrong|2014|p=61|ps=}}

'''The Seven Pillars of Life''' are the essential principles of [[life]] described by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel E. Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaginal anomalies''' are [[Birth defect#Terminology|abnormal structures]] that are formed (or not formed) during the prenatal development of the female reproductive system and are rare congenital defects that result in an abnormal or absent vagina.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/congenital-renal-and-genitourinary-anomalies/vaginal-anomalies|title=Vaginal Anomalies - Pediatrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When present, they are often found with uterine, skeletal and urinary abnormalities.&lt;ref name= emed2&gt;{{cite journal|date=2016-06-01|title=Mullerian Duct Anomalies: Overview, Incidence and Prevalence, Embryology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273534-overview#a4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/congenital-renal-and-genitourinary-anomalies/vaginal-anomalies|title=Vaginal Anomalies - Pediatrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because these structures, like the vagina, are most susceptible to disruption during crucial times of organ-genesis. Many of these defects are classified under the broader term [[Mullerian anomalies|Mullerian duct anomalies]].&lt;ref name="emed2"/&gt;&lt;!--there are two emed references that are very similar but not equivalent, bpage--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/congenital-renal-and-genitourinary-anomalies/vaginal-anomalies|title=Vaginal Anomalies-Pediatrics-Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2018-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullerian duct anomalies are caused by a disturbance during the embryonic time of genitourinary development.&lt;ref name="emed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273534-overview|title=Mullerian Duct Anomalies: Overview, Incidence and Prevalence, Embryology|date=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other isolated incidents of vaginal anomalies can occur with no apparent cause. Oftentimes vaginal anomalies are part of a cluster of defects or syndromes. In addition, [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|inheritance]] can play a part as can prenatal exposure to some [[teratogens]].&lt;ref name="emed2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most notable teratogen that is strongly associated with vaginal anomalies is the synthetic hormone [[Diethylstilbestrol]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The inheritance patterns of some vaginal anomalies can be [[autosomal dominant]], [[autosomal recessive]], and [[X-linked disorders]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = emed3&gt;{{cite web|date=2017-05-04|title=Imperforate Hymen: Background, Problem, Epidemiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/269050-overview#a8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many vaginal anomalies are not detected at birth because the external genitalia appear to be normal.&lt;ref name="emed2" /&gt; Other organs of the [[reproductive system]] may not be affected by an abnormality of the vagina. The uterus, [[fallopian tube]]s and ovaries can be functional despite the presence of a defect of the vagina and external genitalia.&lt;ref name=emed2/&gt; A vaginal anomaly may not affect fertility. Though it depends on the extent of the vaginal defect, it is possible for [[fertilisation|conception]] to occur. In instances where a functional ovary exists, [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]] may be successful. Functioning ovaries in a woman with a vaginal defect allows the implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterus of an unaffected gestational carrier. A successful conception and can occur.&lt;ref name = "Altchek_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altchek A, Paciuc J | title = Successful pregnancy following surgery in the obstructed uterus in a uterus didelphys with unilateral distal vaginal agenesis and ipsilateral renal agenesis: case report and literature review | journal = Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = e159-62 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19576808 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpag.2009.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emed2" /&gt; Vaginal length varies from 6.5 to 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm.

== Signs and symptoms ==

===Isolated anomalies===
Some anomalies are found upon examination shortly after birth or when the development of sexual characteristics does not progress as expected. Defects that prevent menstrual flow become obvious when amenorrhea occurs.

=== Syndromes ===
Syndromes may take longer to identify since they are rare and often involve errors in metabolism. Many syndromes share the same signs and symptoms.

== Cause ==
The cause of isolated cases of vaginal anomalies can not always be identified, though disruption of the embryonic development of the vagina likely plays a significant role.

== Diagnosis ==
Imaging studies are usually the most useful in diagnosing vaginal anomalies including retrograde contrast studies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An [[anomaly scan]] can be helpful, especially detecting the presence of a urogenital syndrome. Genetic and metabolic defects require further testing to support a diagnosis.

== Treatment ==

The most common vaginal anomaly is an [[imperforate hymen]]. This anomaly occurs often enough that it can be detected by some pediatricians shortly after birth. Correction of an imperforate hymen may delayed until puberty. The hymen can be unusually thick or partially obstructed by the presence of fibrous bands of [[connective tissue|tissue]]. An imperforate hymen can also present with other abnormalities such as septa. An imperforate hymen can be displaced and its location may not be where it is expected.

Prenatal exposure to some [[hormone]]s can cause vaginal anomalies as can the lack of necessary hormones needed for normal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachelot A, Grouthier V, Courtillot C, Dulon J, Touraine P | title = MANAGEMENT OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: update on the management of adult patients and prenatal treatment | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 176 | issue = 4 | pages = R167-R181 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28115464 | doi = 10.1530/eje-16-0888 | url = http://www.eje-online.org/content/176/4/R167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diethylstilbestrol]] (DES), also known formerly (and inappropriately) as [[stilboestrol]], is a [[Synthetic compound|synthetic]] [[nonsteroidal estrogen]] and teratogen that can cause vaginal abnormalities in the developing embryo.&lt;ref name="Mueller_2016" /&gt;

== Associated uterine defects ==
Uterine defects can accompany vaginal abnormalities:
* '''[[Müllerian agenesis]]''' (absent uterus).Uterus is not present, vagina only rudimentary or absent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aittomäki_2001" /&gt;
* '''[[Uterus didelphys]]''', also '''uterus didelphis''' (double uterus). transverse vaginal septum
* '''[[Septated uterus]]''' (uterine septum or partition). With a complete vaginal septum.
* '''Rudimentary uterus''' is a uterine remnant not connected to cervix and vagina.
Women with uterine abnormalities may have associated renal abnormalities including unilateral renal agenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li S, Qayyum A, Coakley FV, Hricak H | title = Association of renal agenesis and mullerian duct anomalies | journal = Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 829–34 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11105695 | doi = 10.1097/00004728-200011000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
The occurrence of vaginal defects varies widely and some are only known from case studies. The prevalence of an imperforate hymen is 1 in 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Hippocrates treatment for prolapse.png|thumb|The ancient Greek method for treating a prolapsed uterus that has extended through and beyond the vaginal introitus.]]
Notable is the mention of vaginal anomalies and pelvic organ prolapse in older cultures and locations.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt; In 1500 B.C. Egyptians wrote about the "falling of the womb". In 400 B.C. a Greek physician documented his observations and treatments:

"After the patient had been tied to a ladder-like frame, she was tipped upward so that her head was toward the bottom of the frame. The frame was then moved upward and downward more or less rapidly for approximately 3–5 min. As the patient was in an inverted position, it was thought that the prolapsing organs of the genital tract would be returned to their normal position by the force of gravity and the shaking motion."&lt;ref name="lens"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lensen EJ, Withagen MI, Kluivers KB, Milani AL, Vierhout ME | title = Surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse: a historical review with emphasis on the anterior compartment | journal = International Urogynecology Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1593–602 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23494056 | doi = 10.1007/s00192-013-2074-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hippocrates]] also described the prolapse of other organs out through the vagina.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt; In 1521, [[Jacopo Berengario da Carpi|Berengario da Carpi]] performed the first surgical treatment for prolapse. This was to tie a rope around the prolapse, tighten it for two days until it was no longer viable and cut it off. Wine, aloe, and honey were then applied to the stump.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

References regarding the existence of vaginal anomalies related to müllerian defects have been traced back to 300 BC when a historian described a case of vaginal agenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-06-01|title=Mullerian Duct Anomalies: Overview, Incidence and Prevalence, Embryology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273534-overview#a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, other physicians proposed that vaginoplasy may provide treatment for pelvic organ prolapse. In 1830, the first dissection of the vagina was performed on a living woman. Other vaginal repairs were described in 1834 and treament sometimes  the suturing the edges of a vaginal defect. In 1859 a solution to vaginal elongation was to remove the cervix.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt; In 1866, methods that resembled those used today came into practice. Surgery on the anterior vaginal wall at this time did not have to involve full-thickness repairs to be successful. Sim subsequently developed another procedure that did not require the full-thickness dissection of the vaginal wall. Shortly after this time it was proposed that reattaching the vagina to support structures was more successful and resulted in less recurrence. This same proposal was proposed again in 1976 but further studies indicated that the recurrence rate was not better. Further advances in 1961 began when surgeons started to reattach of the anterior vaginal wall to Cooper's ligament.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

In 1955, surgical mesh began to be used to strengthen pelvic tissue. In 1970, tissue from pigs began to be used to strengthen the anterior vaginal wall in surgery. Beginning in 1976, improvement in suturing began along with the surgical removal of the vagina being used to treat prolapse of the bladder. In 1991, assumptions about the detailed anatomy of the pelvic support structures began to be questioned regarding the existence of some pelvic structures and the non-existence of others. More recently, the use of stem cells, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery are being used during vaginectomy and vaginoplasty.&lt;ref name="lens" /&gt;

[[File:William Preston Taulbee (ca. 1890).jpg|thumb|William Preston Taulbee circa 1890]]

'''William Preston Taulbee''' (October 22, 1851 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1890) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Kentucky]].

Taulbee was a son of William Harrison Taulbee (1824–1905) and his wife, Mary Ann Wilson (1831–1916). Born near Mount Sterling, in [[Morgan County, Kentucky]], Taulbee attended the common schools and was tutored by his father.
He was ordained for the ministry and admitted to the Kentucky conference of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]].

Taulbee was elected clerk of the [[Magoffin County, Kentucky|Magoffin County]] Court in 1878 and reelected in 1882.
He studied law.

Taulbee was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[49th United States Congress|Forty-ninth]] and [[50th United States Congress|Fiftieth]] Congresses (March 4, 1885 &amp;ndash; March 3, 1889).
He was not a candidate for renomination.

He was shot by Charles E. Kincaid, a newspaper correspondent, on the east staircase of the House wing of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[Washington, D.C.]], February 28, 1890, and died from the effects of the wounds at Providence Hospital, in that city, March 11, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35553 The death of Congressman William Taulbee on the steps of the U.S. Capitol]. [[Office of the Historian]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was interred in the family burying ground near [[Mount Sterling, Kentucky]]. Blood stains from his wounds are still visible on the staircase in the Capitol Building where he was shot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7447550 A Historic Killing in the Capitol Building], [[NPR]], February 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
