The '''Accademia Fiorentina''' was a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[literature|literary]] [[academy]] in [[Florence]], Italy during the [[Renaissance]].

==History==
The Accademia Fiorentina was founded in Florence on 1 November 1540 as the Accademia degli Umidi,&lt;ref name=nosow/&gt; or "academy of the wet ones", in contrast to or parody of the name of the recently founded [[Accademia degli Infiammati]], or "academy of the burning ones", of [[Padova]]. The twelve founding members were Baccio Baccelli, Bartolomeo Benci, Pier Fabbrini, Paolo de Gei, [[Antonfrancesco Grazzini]], Gismondo Martelli, Niccolò Martelli, Giovanni Mazzuoli, Cynthio d'Amelia Romano, Filippo Salvetti, Michelangelo Vivaldi and Simon della Volta.&lt;ref name=nosow/&gt; Within 15 months of its foundation, on 25 February 1541 more fiorentino (i.e. 25 February 1542),&lt;ref name=nosow/&gt; the academy changed its name to Accademia Fiorentina, in accordance with the wishes of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]].&lt;ref name=sher/&gt;

In 1783, by order of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo]], the Accademia Fiorentina was merged, together with the [[Accademia degli Apatisti]] and the [[Accademia della Crusca]], into the new [[Accademia Fiorentina Seconda]].&lt;ref name=anna/&gt;

==Activities==
The principal topic of discussion of the academy was the question of what should constitute the basis for the [[Italian language]], which until about this time was not so called; rather, it was referred to as ''volgare'', roughly "the common tongue". While the Infiammati supported the suggestions of [[Pietro Bembo]] and [[Giovan Giorgio Trissino]] that the language of [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]] should serve as a model for literary Italian, the Umidi believed it should be based on contemporary Florentine usage and on the language of [[Dante]]. Three of them, Giovambattista Gelli (1498–1563), Pierfrancesco Giambullari (1495–1555)&lt;ref name=giam/&gt; and Carlo Lenzoni (1501–51),&lt;ref name=lenz/&gt; wrote treatises in support of this position.&lt;ref name=sher/&gt;

The '''Biomedical Primate Research Centre''' ('''BPRC''') is Europe's largest [[animal testing on non-human primates|primate animal testing]] research centre.  It is a scientific research institute that performs research that contributes to the identification and development of new medicines against deadly diseases.  It is located in [[Rijswijk]], ([[Zuid-Holland]]) and employs about 110 people.

The BPRC is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.  Before it became an independent foundation on December 7, 1994, it was part of the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].

The main research areas are Immunobiology, Parasitology, Virology, Ethology and Alternatives for Animal Research.  The BPRC houses rhesus macaques and marmosets to be used in biomedical research involving [[AIDS]], [[malaria]], [[hepatitis]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[auto-immune]] diseases.

In 2002 the Dutch government forbade any further testing on [[chimpanzee]]s, though it allowed trials already in progress to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lab chimps face housing crisis: Experiments on apes end, but problems remain|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5761824/|newspaper=Associated Press|date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, BPRC was reported to use about 200 [[monkey]]s a year for experiments. Protestors gather regularly in front of the BPRC gates and there are calls in the Dutch parliament to close the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.vice.com/video/experimenting-on-animals-inside-the-monkey-lab Experimenting on animals inside the monkey lab], [[Vice News]] 8 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, undercover images showed animal abuse at this center leading to questions in the Dutch Parlement: https://www.edev.nl/undercoverbeelden-rijswijks-apencentrum-bprc-tonen-wangedrag-en-disrespect-dierproefnemers/

'''The Centre for the Mind''' is the brainchild of Professor [[Allan Snyder]] FRS, and was launched at the historic [[Museum of Sydney]] on 4 August 1997. Dr [[Oliver Sacks]], renowned author and neurobiologist, delivered the Foundation Lecture on "Creativity and the Mind" at the gala public opening on 5 August 1997. This event was held at the [[Australian Academy of Science]] where Dr Sacks received the Foundation Medal from the President of the Academy, Sir [[Gustav Nossal]].

The Inaugural Centre for the Mind board members were:
*Professor [[Allan Snyder]] FRS (150th Anniversary Chair of Science and the Mind, University of Sydney)
*Professor [[Gavin Brown (academic)|Gavin Brown]] (Vice Chancellor, University of Sydney)
*Professor [[Peter Karmel]] (Vice Chancellor, Australian National University)
*[[Lachlan Murdoch]] (Executive Chairman, News Limited)
*[[Baz Luhrmann]] (Film Director)

Distinguished Medal recipients:
* Professor [[Daniel Dennett]] (Philosopher and Author)
* Professor [[Horace Barlow]] (Trinity College, Cambridge)
* Professor [[Vilayanur Ramachandran]] (University of California)
* Sir [[Richard Branson]] (Virgin Enterprises)

==What they do==
"We explore what it is to be uniquely human. We do this by investing in challenging research, by orchestrating spectacular intellectual events, and by acting as a global nexus for great minds. Our mind laboratories focus on scientific ways to enhance creativity and to instill the [[champion mindset]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centreforthemind.com/whoweare/index.cfm Centre for the Mind; Who We Are]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties:&lt;ref&gt;[[Dov Gabbay|Gabbay, Dov]], (1994). 'Classical vs non-classical logic'. In D.M. Gabbay, C.J. Hogger, and J.A. Robinson, (Eds), ''Handbook of Logic in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming'', volume 2, chapter 2.6. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Law of excluded middle]] and [[double negative elimination]]
# [[Law of noncontradiction]], and the [[principle of explosion]]
# [[Monotonicity of entailment]] and [[idempotency of entailment]]
# [[Commutativity of conjunction]]
# [[De Morgan duality]]: every [[logical operator]] is dual to another

While not entailed by the preceding conditions, contemporary discussions of classical logic normally only include [[propositional calculus|propositional]] and [[first-order logic|first-order]] logics.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Stewart (2000). Classical Logic. In Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [Web]. Stanford: The Metaphysics Research Lab. Retrieved October 28, 2006, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haack"&gt;[[Susan Haack|Haack, Susan]], (1996). ''Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic: Beyond the Formalism''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other more obscure variations of classical logic.

Most semantics of classical logic are [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]], meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorised as either true or false.

== Examples of classical logics ==
* [[Aristotle]]'s [[Organon]] introduces his theory of [[syllogism]]s, which is a logic with a restricted form of judgments: assertions take one of four forms, ''All Ps are Q'', ''Some Ps are Q'', ''No Ps are Q'', and ''Some Ps are not Q''. These judgments find themselves if two pairs of two dual operators, and each operator is the negation of another, relationships that Aristotle summarised with his [[square of opposition]]s.  Aristotle explicitly formulated the law of the excluded middle and law of non-contradiction in justifying his system, although these laws cannot be expressed as judgments within the syllogistic framework.
* [[George Boole]]'s algebraic reformulation of logic, his system of [[Boolean logic]];
* The first-order logic found in [[Gottlob Frege]]'s [[Begriffsschrift]].

==Generalized semantics==

With the advent of [[algebraic logic]] it became apparent that classical [[propositional calculus]] admits other [[semantics]]. In [[Boolean-valued semantics]] (for classical [[propositional logic]]), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]; "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, and "false" corresponds to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false".  The principle of bivalence holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the [[two-element Boolean algebra|two-element algebra]], which has no intermediate elements.

== Non-classical logics ==
{{Main|Non-classical logic}}
&lt;!--When editing this section, please also update the matching section in the Non-classical logic article--&gt;
* [[Computability logic]] is a semantically constructed formal theory of computability—as opposed to classical logic, which is a formal theory of truth—integrates and extends classical, linear and intuitionistic logics.
*[[Many-valued logic]] rejects bivalence, allowing for [[truth value]]s other than true and false. The most popular forms are [[three-valued logic]], as initially developed by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], and infinitely-valued logics such as [[fuzzy logic]], which permits any real number between 0 and 1 as a truth value.
*[[Intuitionistic logic]] rejects the [[law of the excluded middle]], [[double negation elimination]], and part of [[De Morgan's laws]];

* [[Linear logic]] rejects [[idempotency]] of [[Logical consequence|entailment]] as well;
* [[Modal logic]] extends classical logic with [[Truth function|non-truth-functional]] ("modal") operators.
*[[Paraconsistent logic]] (e.g., [[relevance logic]]) rejects the [[principle of explosion]], and has a close relation to [[dialetheism]];

* [[Quantum logic]]
* [[Relevance logic]], [[linear logic]], and [[non-monotonic logic]] reject monotonicity of entailment;
*[[Reflexive relation|Non-reflexive]] logic (also known as "Schrödinger logics") rejects or restricts the [[law of identity]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Schrödinger logics|first=Newton|last=da Costa|publisher=Studia Logica|year=1994|page=533|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01057649}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic: Beyond the Formalism'', [[Susan Haack]] divided non-classical logics into [[Deviant logic|deviant]], quasi-deviant, and extended logics.&lt;ref name="haack" /&gt;

'''Common descent''' describes how, in [[evolutionary biology]], a group of [[organism]]s share a [[most recent common ancestor]].

Common ancestry between organisms of different [[species]] arises during [[speciation]], in which new species are established from a single ancestral population.

Universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process was first proposed by the English [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] in the concluding sentence of his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref name="origin_490"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

In the 1740s, the French [[mathematician]] [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] made the first known suggestion that all organisms had a common ancestor, and had diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Crombie |Hoskin |1970 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Maupertuis+%22for+the+first+time%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Maupertuis%20%22for%20the%20first%20time%22&amp;f=false 62–63]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Treasure |1985 |p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Essai de cosmologie'' (1750), Maupertuis noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May we not say that, in the fortuitous combination of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures ''could'' survive in whose organizations a certain degree of adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Harris |1981 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkqg3TIkBJwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Essai+de+Cosmologie+%22blind+destiny%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Essai%20de%20Cosmologie%20%22blind%20destiny%22&amp;f=false 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in ''Kritik der Urteilskraft'' (''[[Critique of Judgement]]'') that the similarity{{efn|Now called [[Homology (biology)|homology]].}} of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kant |1987 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y5wQD-ioaUUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Critique+of+Judgment+%22original+mother%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 304]}}: "Despite all the variety among these forms, they seem to have been produced according to a common archetype, and this analogy among them reinforces our suspicion that they are actually akin, produced by a common original mother."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], asked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which {{Smallcaps |the great First Cause}} endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1818 |p=397 [§&amp;nbsp;39.4.8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]]'s views about common descent, as expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', were that it was probable that there was only one progenitor for all life forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1859 |p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Common descent was widely accepted amongst the [[scientific community]] after Darwin's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh, David. (2005). ''Biology: A Guide to the Natural World''. Pearson/Prentice Hall. p. 323. {{ISBN|978-0321946768}} "Descent with modification was accepted by most scientists not long after publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'' in 1859. Scientists accepted it because it explained so many facets of the living world."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon Kellogg]] commented that "practically no naturalists of position and recognized attainment doubt the theory of descent."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Kellogg, Vernon L]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismtodaydi00kell#page/3/mode/2up ''Darwinism To-Day'']. Henry Holt and Company. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No reliable observation has ever been found to contradict the general notion of common descent. It should come as no surprise, then, that the scientific community at large has accepted evolutionary descent as a historical reality since Darwin’s time and considers it among the most reliably established and fundamentally important facts in all of science.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, T. Ryan. (2008). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z ''Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path'']. ''Evolution: Education and Outreach'' 1 (1): 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

===Common biochemistry===

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into [[RNA]], through the effect of [[protein]]- and RNA-[[enzyme]]s, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) [[ribosome]]s, with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] and others as energy sources. Analysis of small sequence differences in widely shared substances such as [[cytochrome c]] further supports universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=Robin |last2=Freeland |first2=Stephen J. |last3=Landweber |first3=Laura F. |date=January 2001 |title=Rewiring the keyboard: evolvability of the genetic code |journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |doi=10.1038/35047500 |pmid=11253070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 23 proteins are found in all organisms, serving as [[enzyme]]s carrying out core functions like DNA replication.

The [[genetic code]] (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is translated into [[amino acid]]s, and hence proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] to [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;

The way that [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) are mapped to [[amino acid]]s seems to be strongly optimised. Richard Egel argues that in particular the [[hydrophobic]] (non-polar) side-chains are well organised, suggesting that these enabled the earliest organisms to create [[peptide]]s with water-repelling regions able to support the essential electron exchange ([[redox]]) reactions for energy transfer.&lt;ref name=Egel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egel |first1=Richard |title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life |journal=Life |date=March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=170–212 |doi=10.3390/life2010170 |pmc=4187143 |pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selectively neutral similarities===

Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by [[convergent evolution]], and therefore they provide compelling support for universal common descent. Such evidence has come from two areas: [[amino acid]] sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code redundantly for the same amino acid. Since many species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for their sharing a recent common ancestor. Had the amino acid sequences come from different ancestors, they would have been coded for by any of the redundant codons, and since the correct amino acids would already have been in place, [[natural selection]] would not have driven any change in the codons, however much time was available. [[Genetic drift]] could change the codons, but it would be extremely unlikely to make all the redundant codons in a whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages. Similarly, shared nucleotide sequences, especially where these are apparently neutral such as the positioning of [[intron]]s and [[pseudogene]]s, provide strong evidence of common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Sharma2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=N. S. |title=Continuity And Evolution Of Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7Q47fvCfLIC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2005 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-8293-018-6 |pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other similarities===

Biologists often{{quantify|date=March 2018}} point to the universality of many aspects of cellular life as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|left-handed]]. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the [[Laws of science|laws of physics and chemistry]] - rather than through universal common descent - and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of [[ATPase#Transmembrane ATP synthases|Transmembrane ATPases]] throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeable and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phylogenetic trees===
{{PhylomapB|size=300px|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on [[ribosomal RNA]] genes implies a single origin for all life.}}
{{Main |Phylogenetic tree}}
{{See also |Tree of life (biology)}}

Another important piece of evidence is from detailed phylogenetic trees (i.e., "genealogic trees" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010, Douglas L. Theobald published a statistical analysis of available genetic data,&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; mapping them to phylogenetic trees, that gave "strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life."&lt;ref name="steel" /&gt;

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence |title=Prediction 1.3: Consilience of independent phylogenies |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |version=Version 2.89 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive|The TalkOrigins Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential objections==

[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|2005 [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] shows many [[horizontal gene transfer]]s, implying multiple possible origins.]]

===Gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysis===
{{further|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Theobald noted that substantial [[horizontal gene transfer]] could have occurred during early evolution. Bacteria today remain capable of gene exchange between distantly-related lineages. This weakens the basic assumption of phylogenetic analysis, that similarity of genomes implies common ancestry, because sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages to share much of their genome whether or not they [[monophyly|shared an ancestor (monophyly)]]. This has led to questions about the single ancestry of life.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; However, biologists consider it very unlikely that completely unrelated proto-organisms could have exchanged genes, as their different coding mechanisms would have resulted only in garble rather than functioning systems. Later, however, many organisms all derived from a single ancestor could readily have shared genes that all worked in the same way, and it appears that they have.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt;

===Convergent evolution===
{{further|Convergent evolution}}

If early organisms had been driven by the same environmental conditions to [[Convergent evolution|evolve similar biochemistry convergently]], they might independently have acquired similar genetic sequences. Theobald's "formal test" was accordingly criticised by Takahiro Yonezawa and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonezawa |first1=Takahiro |last2=Hasegawa |first2=Masami |title=Was the universal common ancestry proved? |date=16 December 2010 |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E9 |doi=10.1038/nature09482 |pmid=21164432|bibcode=2010Natur.468E...9Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; for not including consideration of convergence. They argued that Theobald's test was insufficient to distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Theobald has defended his method against this claim, arguing that his tests distinguish between phylogenetic structure and mere sequence similarity. Therefore, Theobald argued, his results show that "real universally [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] proteins are [[sequence homology|homologous]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=16 December 2010 |title=Theobald reply |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E10 |doi=10.1038/nature09483|bibcode=2010Natur.468E..10T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=24 November 2011 |title=On universal common ancestry, sequence similarity, and phylogenetic structure: The sins of P-values and the virtues of Bayesian evidence |journal=Biology Direct |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=60 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-60 |pmc=3314578 |pmid=22114984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2532">'''Complex equality''' is a theory of [[justice]] outlined by [[Michael Walzer]] in his 1983 work ''[[Spheres of Justice]]''. The theory posits that inequalities in the several spheres of society should not invade one another.{{sfn|Browning|1997|p=142}} Walzer's definition of complex equality is: "In formal terms, complex equality means that no citizen's standing in one sphere or with regard to one social good can be undercut by his standing in some other sphere, with regard to some other good."{{sfn|Walzer|1983|p=19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

'''Francesco Fiorentino''' (Sambiase, 1 May 1834&lt;ref name="Diz_Biografico"&gt;The historian L. Lo Bianco indicates his birth date as 10th May 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Naples]], 22 December 1884) was an Italian philosopher and historiographer.

== Biography ==
He was born in Sambiase (now [[Lamezia Terme]]) on May 1, 1834.&lt;ref name="Diz_Biografico"/&gt; His father was Gennaro Fiorentino,  a [[chemist]] and a [[pharmacist]], and his mother was Saveria Sinopoli. He was educated by Giorgio and Bruno Sinopoli, the uncle and the brother of his mother, respectively. He studied [[literature]] and [[theology]], but he quit in 1851. After two years spent in Sambiase studying theology, he moved to [[Catanzaro]] where he studied [[jurisprudence]], but he couldn't graduate because he was just 19.

Even if he was [[Myopia|short-sighted]] and he never shot a gun before, Fiorentino attempted to take part in the [[Expedition of the thousand|Expedition of the Thousand]], but he failed. When he met  [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in [[Maida, Calabria|Maida]], Fiorentino's quoted to have said to him "Viva l'annessione, vogliamo l'annessione!", which in English is "Horray for the annexation, we want the annexation!".

After the [[Italian unification]] he became a teacher of philosophy in a Liceo in [[Spoleto]], [[Umbria]].

== Works and thoughts ==
In 1861 he moved from [[Spoleto]] to [[Maddaloni]], near [[Naples]], where he published: ''Il Panteismo di Giordano Bruno'' (''The Pantheism of [[Giordano Bruno]]''). Fiorentino used to compare himself to [[Giordano Bruno]] for their similar character and to [[Vincenzo Gioberti]] for their similar political views. Thanks to this book he became a teacher at the [[University of Bologna]] in 1862. He stayed there for nine years, and here he wrote many books, like ''Pietro Pomponazzi ''or ''Scritti varii''.

In 1871 he moved to Naples to teach [[philosophy of history]]. He lived there with Restituta Trebbe, a woman that he loved intensely. They had four sons. In 1875 Fiorentino started to teach [[theoretical philosophy]] at the [[University of Pisa]]. There he wrote ''Elementi di filosofia ad uso dei Licei'', an important schoolbook used for decades for the teaching of philosophy in the liceo.

In 1880 he came back to Naples to teach philosophy at the university again. He founded the ''Giornale Napoletano'' in 1883. After being elected two times as a Deputy in the [[Italian parliament|Italian Parliament]] (the first in 1870 and the second in 1874) he tried to be elected again in 1882, but he failed.

He died in Naples on 22 December 1884 of a heart attack, at age 51. In 1887 his remains were transferred to [[Catanzaro]], where a memorial for him was built. Another memorial was built in 1909 in his hometown, Sambiase.

Despite the fact that he taught in public school for twenty-four years, his family didn't receive any pension because of six missing months of teaching.

'''Gihwa''' ({{korean|hangul=기화|hanja=己和}}, 1376–1433), also known as '''Hamheo Teuktong''' was a  [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] of [[Korean Seon]] and leading Buddhist figure during the late [[Goryeo]] to early [[Joseon]] eras. He was originally a [[Confucianism|Confucian scholar]] of high reputation, but converted to Buddhism at the age of 21 upon the death of a close friend. He wandered among the Korean mountain monasteries, until he had the fortune of becoming the disciple of the last Korean national teacher, [[Muhak]].

Gihwa's writings showed a distinctive mixture between iconoclastic and [[subitism|subitist]] Seon language, and a strong appreciation for the scriptural tradition. Thus, he took up from [[Jinul]] the tradition of unification of Seon and Gyo Buddhism. Among his writings, there are four works in particular that made a deep impact on the subsequent Seon tradition in Korea. These are:
# A commentary on the ''[[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]]'', the ''Weongak gyeong hae seorui''.
# A redaction and subcommentary to five famous earlier commentaries on the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', the ''Geumgang banyabaramilgyeong ogahae seorui''.
# A subcommentary and redaction of the ''[[Collection of Yongjia]]'', the ''Yonggajip gwaju seorui''
# The ''[[Hyeonjeong non]]''

As a result of his fourth major work, the ''Hyeonjeong non'', Gihwa distinguished himself as the primary Buddhist respondent to the rising [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] polemic of his period, as he responded with vigor to the Neo-Confucian criticisms of Buddhism.

Gihwa died while residing at [[Jeongsusa]], at the southern tip of [[Ganghwado]], where his tomb can still be visited. Gihwa's commentary on the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]] was translated by [[A. Charles Muller]], in 1999.

[[Essence-Function]] is a key concept in [[East Asian Buddhism]] and particularly that of [[Korean Buddhism]]. Essence-Function takes a particular form in the philosophy and writings of Kihwa.&lt;ref&gt;Muller, A. Charles (1995).

'''Gilles Deleuze''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|l|uː|z}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒil dəløz|lang}}; 18 January 1925&amp;nbsp;– 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1960s until his death in 1995, wrote on [[philosophy]], [[literature]], [[film]], and [[fine art]]. His most popular works were the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'': ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]].  His metaphysical treatise ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 February 2011}} See also: "''Difference and Repetition'' is definitely the most important work published by Deleuze." (Edouard Morot-Sir, from the back cover of the first edition of the English translation), or James Williams' judgment: "It is nothing less than a revolution in philosophy and stands out as one of the great philosophical works of the twentieth century" (James Williams, ''Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Critical Introduction and Guide'' [Edinburgh UP, 2003], p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], citing [[Bernard Williams]]'s criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the "greatest philosophers".&lt;ref name="Moore" &gt;[[A. W. Moore (philosopher)|A. W. Moore]], [https://books.google.it/books?id=vo-ZLmfwe_oC&amp;pg=PA543  ''The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics: Making Sense of Things''], Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 543: 'intellectual power and depth; a grasp of the sciences; a sense of the political, and of human destructiveness as well as creativity; a broad range and a fertile imagination; an unwillingness to settle for the superficially reassuring; and, in an unusually lucky case, the gifts of a great writer.'&lt;/ref&gt; His work has influenced a variety of disciplines across philosophy and art, including [[literary theory]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name="See 1991"&gt;See, for example, [[Steven Best]] and [[Douglas Kellner]], ''Postmodern Theory'' (Guilford Press, 1991), which devotes a chapter to Deleuze and Guattari.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in [[Paris]] and lived there for most of his life. His initial schooling was undertaken during [[World War II]], during which time he attended the [[Lycée Carnot]]. He also spent a year in [[khâgne]] at the [[Lycée Henri IV]]. During the [[Nazi occupation of France]], Deleuze's older brother, Georges, was arrested for his participation in the [[French Resistance]], and died while in transit to a concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[François Dosse]], ''Gilles Deleuze and [[Felix Guattari]]: Intersecting Lives'', trans. Deborah Glassman (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Deleuze went to study at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy, such as [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Jean Hyppolite]], [[Ferdinand Alquié]], and [[Maurice de Gandillac]], and Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers. In addition, Deleuze found the work of non-academic writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] attractive.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogues'', p. 12: "At the Liberation we were still strangely stuck in the history of philosophy. We simply plunged into [[Hegel]], [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]]; we threw ourselves like puppies into a scholasticism worse than that of the [[Medieval France|Middle Ages]]. Fortunately there was [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. Sartre was our Outside, he was really the breath of fresh air from the backyard."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
Deleuze passed the [[agrégation]] in philosophy in 1948, and taught at various [[Secondary education in France|lycées]] (Amiens, Orléans, [[Lycée Louis le Grand|Louis le Grand]]) until 1957, when he took up a position at the University of Paris. In 1953, he published his first monograph, ''Empiricism and Subjectivity'', on [[David Hume]]. This monograph was based on his DES thesis (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) which was conducted under the direction of Hyppolite and Canguilhem.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Voss, ''Conditions of Thought: Deleuze and Transcendental Ideas'', Edinburgh University Press, 2013, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1960 to 1964 he held a position at the [[French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]]. During this time he published the seminal ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'' (1962) and befriended [[Michel Foucault]]. From 1964 to 1969 he was a professor at the [[University of Lyon]]. In 1968 he published his two dissertations, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (supervised by Gandillac) and ''Expressionism in Philosophy: Spinoza'' (supervised by Alquié).

In 1969 he was appointed to the [[University of Paris VIII]] at Vincennes/St. Denis, an experimental school organized to implement educational reform. This new university drew a number of talented scholars, including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst [[Félix Guattari]]. Deleuze taught at [[Vincennes]] until his retirement in 1987.

===Personal life===
He married Denise Paul "Fanny" Grandjouan in 1956. When once asked to talk about his life, he replied: "Academics' lives are seldom interesting."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deleuze concludes his reply to this critic thus:

{{quote|What do you know about me, given that I believe in secrecy?&amp;nbsp;... If I stick where I am, if I don't travel around, like anyone else I make my inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions, and express very obliquely and circuitously in what I write.&amp;nbsp;... Arguments from one's own privileged experience are bad and reactionary arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deleuze was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;"Deleuze's atheist philosophy of immanence is an artistic (or creative) power at work on theology" [https://books.google.com.br/books?id=956CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=deleuze%27s+atheist+philosophy+of+immanence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fXDwkQ-z3V&amp;sig=j8A99nA23pNlyiCKa70npO5LfGg&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMI4pWNtab5xgIVg0OQCh25_ws7#v=onepage&amp;q=deleuze's%20atheist%20philosophy%20of%20immanence&amp;f=false Deleuze and Religion]. Mary Bryden (2002). Routledge, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Deleuze's atheist critique is powerful (...)"

===Death===
Deleuze, who had suffered from respiratory ailments from a young age,&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Deleuze and Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', trans D. Glassman, CUP 2010, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; developed [[tuberculosis]] in 1968 and underwent a [[thoracoplasty]] (lung removal).&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Deleuze and Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', trans D. Glassman, CUP 2010, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ammppu.org/litterature/deleuze.htm#(4) Gilles Deleuze et les médecins]&lt;/ref&gt; In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required laborious effort. On November 4, 1995, he committed suicide, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/156476/Gilles-Deleuze|title=Gilles Deleuze|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his death, Deleuze had announced his intention to write a book entitled ''La Grandeur de Marx'' (''The Greatness of Marx''), and left behind two chapters of an unfinished project entitled ''Ensembles and Multiplicities'' (these chapters have been published as the essays "Immanence: A Life" and "The Actual and the Virtual").&lt;ref&gt;François Dosse, ''Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari: Intersecting Lives'', pp. 454–455.  "Immanence: A Life" has been translated and published in ''Pure Immanence'' and ''Two Regimes of Madness'', while "The Actual and Virtual" has been translated and published as an appendix to the second edition of ''Dialogues''.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the cemetery of the village of [[Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccnoblat.fr/otsi_v2/images/publications/guides/Saint%20Leonard%20de%20Noblat.pdf Communauté de Communes de Noblat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018104643/http://www.ccnoblat.fr/otsi_v2/images/publications/guides/Saint%20Leonard%20de%20Noblat.pdf |date=October 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Deleuze's works fall into two groups: on one hand, monographs interpreting the work of other philosophers ([[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Michel Foucault]]) and artists ([[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]); on the other, eclectic philosophical tomes organized by concept (e.g., difference, sense, events, schizophrenia, cinema, philosophy).

=== Metaphysics&lt;!--'Transcendental empiricism' and 'Transcendental Empiricism' redirect here--&gt; ===
Deleuze's main philosophical project in the works he wrote prior to his collaborations with Guattari can be baldly summarized as an inversion of the traditional [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] relationship between [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and [[Difference (poststructuralism)|difference]]. Traditionally, difference is seen as derivative from identity: e.g., to say that "X is different from Y" assumes some X and Y with at least relatively stable identities (as in Plato's forms). To the contrary, Deleuze claims that all identities are effects of difference. Identities are neither logically nor metaphysically prior to difference, Deleuze argues, "given that there exist differences of nature between things of the same genus."&lt;ref&gt;"Bergson's Conception of Difference", in ''Desert Islands'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, not only are no two things ever the same, the categories we use to identify individuals in the first place derive from differences. Apparent identities such as "X" are composed of endless series of differences, where "X" = "the difference between x and x'", and "x'" = "the difference between...", and so forth. Difference, in other words, goes all the way down. To confront reality honestly, Deleuze argues, we must grasp beings exactly as they are, and concepts of identity (forms, categories, resemblances, unities of apperception, predicates, etc.) fail to attain what he calls "difference in itself." "If philosophy has a positive and direct relation to things, it is only insofar as philosophy claims to grasp the thing itself, according to what it is, in its difference from everything it is not, in other words, in its ''internal difference''."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kant, Deleuze considers traditional notions of space and time as unifying forms imposed by the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]. He therefore concludes that pure difference is non-spatio-temporal; it is an idea, what Deleuze calls "the virtual". (The coinage refers to Proust's definition of what is constant in both the past and the present: "real without being actual, ideal without being abstract.")&lt;ref&gt;Proust, ''Le Temps Retrouvé'', ch. III.&lt;/ref&gt; While Deleuze's virtual ideas superficially resemble [[Plato]]'s forms and Kant's ideas of pure reason, they are not originals or models, nor do they transcend possible experience; instead they are the conditions of actual experience, the internal difference in itself. "The concept they [the conditions] form is identical to its object."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; A Deleuzean idea or concept of difference is therefore not a wraith-like abstraction of an experienced thing, it is a real system of differential relations that creates actual spaces, times, and sensations.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Method of Dramatization" in ''Desert Islands'', and "Actual and Virtual" in ''Dialogues II''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Deleuze at times refers to his philosophy as a '''transcendental empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{lang|fr|empirisme transcendantal}}), alluding to Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', Continuum, 2004[1968], pp. 56 and 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Parr (ed.), ''The Deleuze Dictionary (Revised Edition)'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, p. 289: "Unlike Kant, Deleuze does not conceive of [...] unthought conditions as abstract or necessary philosophical entities, but as contingent tendencies beyond the reach of empirical consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], experience only makes sense when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of the world as it exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see ''[[#Epistemology|Epistemology]]'').

Simultaneously, Deleuze claims that [[univocity of being|being is univocal]], i.e., that all of its senses are affirmed in one voice. Deleuze borrows the doctrine of ''[[ontological]] [[univocity]]'' from the medieval philosopher [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]]. In medieval disputes over the nature of God, many eminent theologians and philosophers (such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]) held that when one says that "God is good", God's goodness is only analogous to human goodness. Scotus argued to the contrary that when one says that "God is good", the goodness in question is exactly the same sort of goodness that is meant when one says "Jane is good". That is, God only differs from us in degree, and properties such as [[good and evil|goodness]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[reason]], and so forth are univocally applied, regardless of whether one is talking about God, a person, or a flea.

Deleuze adapts the doctrine of univocity to claim that being is, univocally, difference. "With univocity, however, it is not the differences which are and must be: it is being which is Difference, in the sense that it is said of difference. Moreover, it is not we who are univocal in a Being which is not; it is we and our individuality which remains equivocal in and for a univocal Being."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Deleuze at once echoes and inverts Spinoza, who maintained that everything that exists is a modification of the one [[substance theory|substance]], [[God]] or [[Nature]]. For Deleuze, there is no one substance, only an always-differentiating [[process philosophy|process]], an origami cosmos, always folding, unfolding, refolding. Deleuze summarizes this ontology in the paradoxical formula "[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] = [[monism]]".&lt;ref&gt;''A Thousand Plateaus'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) is Deleuze's most sustained and systematic attempt to work out the details of such a metaphysics, but his other works develop similar ideas. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'' (1962), for example, reality is a play of forces; in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), a "[[body without organs]]"; in ''[[What is Philosophy? (Deleuze and Guattari)|What is Philosophy?]]'' (1991), a "[[plane of immanence]]" or "chaosmos".

=== Epistemology ===
Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails an equally atypical [[epistemology]], or what he calls a transformation of "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Edmund Husserl]], misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]], but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: everything about it is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift."&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze's peculiar readings of the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. "Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, rather than seeing philosophy as a timeless pursuit of truth, reason, or universals, Deleuze defines philosophy as the creation of [[concept]]s. For Deleuze, concepts are not identity conditions or propositions, but metaphysical constructions that define a range of thinking, such as Plato's [[theory of forms|ideas]], Descartes's ''[[cogito ergo sum|cogito]]'', or Kant's doctrine of the faculties. A philosophical concept "posits itself and its object at the same time as it is created."&lt;ref&gt;''What Is Philosophy?'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Deleuze's view, then, philosophy more closely resembles practical or artistic production than it does an adjunct to a definitive scientific description of a pre-existing world (as in the tradition of [[John Locke]] or [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).

In his later work (from roughly 1981 onward), Deleuze sharply distinguishes art, philosophy, and science as three distinct disciplines, each analyzing reality in different ways. While philosophy creates concepts, the arts create novel qualitative combinations of sensation and feeling (what Deleuze calls "[[percept]]s" and "[[Affect (philosophy)|affects]]"), and the sciences create quantitative theories based on fixed points of reference such as the [[speed of light]] or [[absolute zero]] (which Deleuze calls "functives"). According to Deleuze, none of these disciplines enjoy primacy over the others:&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; they are different ways of organizing the metaphysical flux, "separate melodic lines in constant interplay with one another."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 125. Cf. Spinoza's claim that the mind and the body are different modes expressing the same substance.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Deleuze does not treat cinema as an art representing an external reality, but as an ontological practice that creates different ways of organizing movement and time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy, science, and art are equally, and essentially, creative and practical. Hence, instead of asking traditional questions of identity such as "is it true?" or "what is it?", Deleuze proposes that inquiries should be functional or practical: "what does it do?" or "how does it work?"&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 21: "We're strict functionalists: what we're interested in is how something works".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Values&lt;!--'Society of control', 'Societies of control' and 'Socius (philosophy)' redirect here--&gt; ===
In ethics and politics, Deleuze again echoes Spinoza, albeit in a sharply Nietzschean key. In a [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] model of society, morality begins from individuals, who bear abstract [[natural rights]] or duties set by themselves or a God. Following his rejection of any metaphysics based on identity, Deleuze criticizes the notion of an individual as an arresting or halting of differentiation (as the etymology of the word "individual" suggests). Guided by the [[Ethical naturalism|naturalistic ethics]] of Spinoza and Nietzsche, Deleuze instead seeks to understand individuals and their moralities as products of the organization of pre-individual desires and powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69-79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the two volumes of ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980)), Deleuze and Guattari describe history as a congealing and regimentation of "[[desiring-production]]" (a concept combining features of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] drives and [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Labour economics|labor]]) into the modern individual (typically neurotic and repressed), the nation-state (a society of continuous control), and [[capitalism]] (an anarchy domesticated into infantilizing commodification). Deleuze, following [[Karl Marx]], welcomes capitalism's destruction of traditional social hierarchies as liberating, but inveighs against its homogenization of all values to the aims of the market.  

The first part of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' undertakes a [[universal history]] and posits the existence of a separate '''socius'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the social body that takes credit for [[Production (economics)|production]]) for each [[mode of production]]: the earth for the [[tribe]], the body of the [[Despotism|despot]] for the [[empire]], and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] for [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilles Deleuze|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 July 2018}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Smith, Henry Somers-Hall (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Deleuze'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 essay "Postscript on the Societies of Control" ("Post-scriptum sur les sociétés de contrôle"), Deleuze builds on [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s notion of the society of discipline to argue that society is undergoing a shift in structure and control. Where societies of discipline were characterized by discrete physical enclosures (such as schools, factories, prisons, office buildings, etc.), institutions and technologies introduced since World War II have dissolved the boundaries between these enclosures. As a result, social coercion and discipline have moved into the lives of individuals considered as "masses, samples, data, markets, or 'banks'." The mechanisms of modern '''societies of control'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; are described as continuous, following and tracking individuals throughout their existence via transaction records, mobile location tracking, and other [[personally identifiable information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deleuze|first1=Gilles|title=Postscript on the Societies of Control|journal=MIT Press|date=October 1992|volume=59|pages=3–7|jstor=778828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But how does Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that standards of value are internal or [[Immanence|immanent]]: to live well is to fully express one's power, to go to the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. "Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?"&lt;ref&gt;''Essays Critical and Clinical'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deleuze's interpretations ===
Deleuze's studies of individual philosophers and artists are purposely heterodox. In ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', for example, Deleuze claims that Nietzsche's ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887) is an attempt to rewrite Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781),&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; even though Nietzsche nowhere mentions the First Critique in the ''Genealogy'', and the ''Genealogy'''s moral topics are far removed from the epistemological focus of Kant's book. Likewise, Deleuze claims that univocity is the organizing principle of Spinoza's philosophy, despite the total absence of the term from any of Spinoza's works. Deleuze once famously described his method of interpreting philosophers as "[[buggery]] (''enculage'')", as sneaking behind an author and producing an offspring which is recognizably his, yet also monstrous and different.&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 6. See also: Daniel W. Smith, "The Inverse Side of the Structure: Zizek on Deleuze on Lacan", ''Criticism'' (2004): "Deleuze's all-too-well-known image of philosophical "buggery," which makes thinkers produce their own "monstrous" children"; Robert Sinnerbrink (in "Nomadology or Ideology? Zizek’s Critique of Deleuze", ''Parrhesia'' 1 (2006): 62–87) describes the "popular topic" of Deleuze's "notorious remarks"; Donald Callen (in "The Difficult Middle", ''Rhizomes'' 10 (Spring 2005)) describes "intellectual buggery" as "what Deleuze himself famously said about his encounters with the works of other philosophers." Deleuze's buggery analogy is also cited by, among many others, Brian Massumi, ''A User's Guide to Capitalism and Schizophrenia'' (MIT Press, 1992), p. 2; Slavoj Žižek, ''Organs without Bodies'' (Routledge, 2004), p. 48; Ian Buchanan, ''A Deleuzian Century?'' (Duke UP, 1999), p. 8; Jean-Jacques Lecercle, ''Deleuze and Language'' (Macmillan, 2002), p. 37; [[Gregg Lambert]], ''The Non-Philosophy of Gilles Deleuze'' (Continuum, 2002), p. x; Claire Colebrook, ''Understanding Deleuze'' (Allen &amp; Unwin, 2003), p. 73; and Charles Stivale, ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'' (McGill-Queen's, 2005), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various monographs thus are not attempts to present what Nietzsche or Spinoza strictly intended, but re-stagings of their ideas in different and unexpected ways. Deleuze's peculiar readings aim to enact the creativity he believes is the acme of philosophical practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Desert Islands'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel in painting Deleuze points to is Francis Bacon's ''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|Study after Velázquez]]''—it is quite beside the point to say that Bacon "gets Velasquez wrong".&lt;ref&gt;''Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation'', pp. 46f: "[Bacon] let loose ... presences" already in Velázquez's painting. Cf. the passage cited above, from ''Negotiations'', p. 136: "The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say what he must have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say."&lt;/ref&gt; Similar considerations apply, in Deleuze's view, to his own uses of mathematical and scientific terms, ''pace'' critics such as [[Alan Sokal]]: "I'm not saying that [[Alain Resnais|Resnais]] and [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]], or [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] and [[René Thom|Thom]], are doing the same thing. I'm pointing out, rather, that there are remarkable similarities between scientific creators of functions and cinematic creators of images. And the same goes for philosophical concepts, since there are distinct concepts of these spaces."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the 1960s, Deleuze's portrayal of Nietzsche as a metaphysician of difference rather than a reactionary mystic contributed greatly to the plausibility and popularity of "left-wing Nietzscheanism" as an intellectual stance.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the approving reference to Deleuze's Nietzsche study in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay "''Différance''", or [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s monograph ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle'', dedicated to Deleuze. More generally, see D. Allison (ed.), ''The New Nietzsche'' (MIT Press, 1985), and L. Ferry and A. Renaut (eds.), ''Why We Are Not Nietzscheans'' (University of Chicago Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  His books ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'' (1969) led [[Michel Foucault]] to declare that "one day, perhaps, this century will be called Deleuzian."&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, "Theatrum Philosophicum", ''Critique'' 282, p. 885.&lt;/ref&gt; (Deleuze, for his part, said Foucault's comment was "a joke meant to make people who like us laugh, and make everyone else livid."&lt;ref&gt;''Negotiations'', p. 4. However, in a later interview, Deleuze commented: "I don't know what Foucault meant, I never asked him" (''Negotiations'', p. 88).&lt;/ref&gt;)  In the 1970s, the ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', written in a style by turns vulgar and esoteric,&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes in the same sentence: "one is thus traversed, broken, fucked by the [[Socius (philosophy)|socius]]" (''Anti-Oedipus'', p. 347).&lt;/ref&gt; offering a sweeping analysis of the family, language, capitalism, and history via eclectic borrowings from Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, and dozens of other writers, was received as a theoretical embodiment of the anarchic spirit of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]].  In 1994 and 1995, ''[[L'Abécédaire de Gilles Deleuze]]'', an eight-hour series of interviews between Deleuze and [[Claire Parnet]], aired on France's [[Arte]] Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.langlab.wayne.edu/CStivale/D-G/ABC1.html An English language summary can be found here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, almost all of Deleuze's books were translated into English.  Deleuze's work is frequently cited in English-speaking academia (in 2007, e.g., he was the 11th most frequently cited author in English-speaking publications in the humanities, between Freud and Kant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like his contemporaries Foucault, [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], Deleuze's influence has been most strongly felt in North American humanities departments, particularly in [[literary theory]], where ''Anti-Oedipus'' and ''A Thousand Plateaus'' are oft regarded as major statements of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]],&lt;ref name="See 1991"/&gt; though neither Deleuze nor Guattari described their work in those terms. Likewise in the English-speaking academy, Deleuze's work is typically classified as [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Simon Glendinning, ''The Idea of Continental Philosophy'' (Edinburgh University Press, 2006), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze has attracted critics as well. The following list is not exhaustive, and gives only the briefest of summaries.

Among French philosophers, [[Vincent Descombes]] argues that Deleuze's account of a difference that is not derived from identity (in ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'') is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in ''Anti-Oedipus'' is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descombes|first=Vincent|title=Modern French Philosophy|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-29672-2|pages=155–6, 175–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Pascal Engel]], Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach makes it impossible to reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: "When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should just sit back and admire it. You should not question it."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Smith (ed.), ''European Philosophy and the American Academy'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alain Badiou]] claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom [[monism|monist]]. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic [[fatalism]] akin to ancient [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Badiou|first=Alain|title=Deleuze: the clamor of being|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=0-8166-3139-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European philosophers have criticized Deleuze's theory of subjectivity.  For example, [[Manfred Frank]] claims that Deleuze's theory of [[individuation]] as a process of bottomless differentiation fails to explain the unity of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frank|first=Manfred|title=What Is Neostructuralism?|year=1989|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|page=385|isbn=978-0816616022}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slavoj Žižek]] claims that Deleuze's [[ontology]] oscillates between [[materialism]] and [[idealism]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''Organs without Bodies'', 2004, pp. 19–32, esp. p. 21: "Is this opposition not, yet again, that of materialism versus idealism? In Deleuze, this means ''The Logic of Sense'' versus ''Anti-Oedipus''." See also p. 28 for "Deleuze's oscillation between the two models" of becoming.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Deleuze of ''Anti-Oedipus'' ("arguably Deleuze's worst book"),&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; the "political" Deleuze under the "'bad' influence" of Guattari, ends up, despite protestations to the contrary, as "the ideologist of late capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, pp. 32, 20, and 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Žižek also calls Deleuze to task for allegedly reducing the subject to "just another" substance and thereby failing to grasp the [[nothingness]] that, according to Lacan and Žižek, defines [[subjectivity]]. What remains worthwhile in Deleuze's oeuvre, Žižek finds, are precisely those concepts closest to Žižek's own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek 2004, p. 68: "This brings us to the topic of the ''subject'' that, according to Lacan, emerges in the interstice of the 'minimal difference,' in the minimal gap between two signifiers. In this sense, the subject is 'a nothingness, a void, which exists.' ... This, then, is what Deleuze seems to get wrong in his reduction of the subject to (just another) substance. Far from belonging to the level of actualization, of distinct entities in the order of constituted reality, the dimension of the 'subject' designates the ''reemergence of the virtual within the order of actuality''. 'Subject' names the unique space of the explosion of virtuality within constituted reality."&lt;/ref&gt;

English-speaking philosophers have also criticized aspects of Deleuze's work. [[Stanley Rosen]] objects to Deleuze's interpretation of Nietzsche's [[eternal return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Stanley|title=The Mask of Enlightenment|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-49546-6|pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Todd May]] argues that Deleuze's claim that difference is ontologically primary ultimately contradicts his embrace of immanence, i.e., his monism. However, May believes that Deleuze can discard the primacy-of-difference thesis, and accept a [[Wittgenstein]]ian [[holism]] without significantly altering his practical philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Pennsylvania State Univ Pr| isbn = 978-0-271-01657-3| last = May| first = Todd| title = Reconsidering Difference: Nancy, Derrida, Levinas, and Deleuze| date = 1997-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Peter Hallward]] argues that Deleuze's insistence that being is necessarily creative and always-differentiating entails that his philosophy can offer no insight into, and is supremely indifferent to, the material, actual conditions of existence. Thus Hallward claims that Deleuze's thought is literally other-worldly, aiming only at a passive contemplation of the dissolution of all identity into the [[theophany|theophanic]] self-creation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hallward|first=Peter|title=Out of This World|year=2006|publisher=Verso|location=New York|isbn=978-1844675555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (1997), physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] accuse Deleuze of abusing mathematical and scientific terms, particularly by sliding between accepted technical meanings and his own idiosyncratic use of those terms in his works. Sokal and Bricmont state that they don't object to metaphorical reasoning, including with mathematical concepts, but mathematical and scientific terms are useful only insofar as they are precise. They give examples of mathematical concepts being "abused" by taking them out of their intended meaning, rendering the idea into normal language reduces it to truism or nonsense. In their opinion, Deleuze used mathematical concepts about which the typical reader might be not knowledgeable, and thus served to display erudition rather than enlightening the reader. Sokal and Bricmont state that they only deal with the "abuse" of mathematical and scientific concepts and explicitly suspend judgment about Deleuze's wider contributions.&lt;ref name="SokalBricmont1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Sokal|author2=Jean Bricmont|title=Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM8zAd3z3ugC|date=29 October 1999|publisher=St Martins Press (ny)|isbn=978-0-312-20407-5|pages=22–25, 154–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Han Learning''' ({{zh|s=汉学|t=漢學|p=Hànxué}}), or the [[Han dynasty|Han]] school of classical [[philology]], was an intellectual movement that reached its height in the middle of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) in [[China]].

==Nature and origins==

Han learning began with the "[[Kaozheng|evidential scholarship]]" ({{zh|s=考证|t=考證|p=kǎozhèng}}) movement of the late [[Ming dynasty]], which was a reaction against the so-called "Song Learning", or [[Neo-Confucianism]], which had arisen during the [[Song dynasty]] (12th century). Neo-Confucianism had incorporated [[Buddhist]] and [[Daoist]] influences into the Confucianist tradition, introducing a new cosmology emphasising the moral nature of the cosmos. Neo-Confucianism was adopted as Confucian orthodoxy under the Song dynasty and formed the basis of the [[imperial examination]] until nearly the end of the Qing dynasty. 

Evidential scholars reacted to the innovations of Neo-Confucianism by turning back to the original classics, employing philological techniques to try to authenticate the real words of Confucius. This involved the comparison of different texts in great detail. This school of learning came to be called “Han Learning” because it sought out [[Han dynasty]] commentaries as being closer to the original texts.

==Growth of influence==

The fall of the Ming dynasty and the rise of the Qing dynasty was a watershed in the development of this trend of philological thought.  Scholars in the evidential scholarship tradition attacked the heterodox and subjective ideals of "Song learning" as having betrayed the true teachings of Confucius, resulting in decadence, individualism, and factionalism in the Ming court. This was blamed for bringing about the fall of the Ming dynasty.

The Han Learning scholars played an important role in many intellectual works sponsored by the Qing court. They were involved in the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'', a monumental encyclopaedic project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] which involved the collection of the entire Chinese canon of studies on the mind, nature, government and humanity. While this work was firmly grounded in Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, the philological expertise of evidential scholars was drawn on to ensure the authenticity of the canon. Han Learning played a major role in providing annotations and evidential scholarship on regulations and edicts, together with works of philosophers. 

By the mid-eighteenth century, Han learning ([[Yan Ruoqu]], [[Hui Dong]]) had proved that various parts of the sacred classics were in fact later forgeries of the Han dynasty.

While it may appear to be concerned with philological minutiae, the debate between the Neo-Confucianists and the adherents of Han learning had considerable repercussions, weakening the cosmological underpinnings of the imperial state, although not its political dominance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/8787/Confucianism-Neo-Confucianism.html Confucianism-Neo-Confucianism]&lt;/ref&gt; Han Learning and Song Learning were eventually blended into a new school of thought during the late Qing.

Scholars involved included [[Wang Fuzhi]], [[Gu Yanwu]], [[Yan Yuan (Qing dynasty)|Yan Yuan]], [[Li Gong (scholar)|Li Gong]], [[Dai Zhen]], [[Duan Yucai]], [[Ji Yun]], [[Zhang Xuecheng]], [[Ruan Yuan]], and [[Liao Ping]]. In the late Qing period, Han Learning appealed to many reformers and revolutionaries such as [[Kang Youwei]], who eventually became a monarchist; [[Tan Sitong]] a fervent anti-Manchu polemicist; and [[Liu Shipei]] a devout nationalist who was first an revolutionary and an [[Anarchism in China|anarchist]] then a supporter of [[Yuan Shikai]]. [[Cui Shu (Qing)|Cui Shu]] went further and rejected Han learning in an attempt to recover pre-Han Confucianism.

== Political activity ==
According to B. Elman, many Han Learning proponents were involved in opposition to [[Heshen]]'s clique (1746-99), thus suggesting that typical portrayal of this group as apolitical should be reconsidered.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''Classicism, politics, and kingship: the Chang-chou school of New Text Confucianism in late imperial China''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990:283-4. [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6g5006xv/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sundries ==
* A remarkable parallel to the revival of Han learning in the late imperial period is provided by development of the [[Han medicine]] ([[Kampo]] in Japan). Same as Han learning stood in the opposition to the intellectual trend of the three previous dynasties, Han medicine was a reaction against the standard of Song-Ming medicine (the so-called "neo-Confucianization of the body").

[[File:Henry More.jpg|thumb|Henry More]]
'''Henry More''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr}}; 12 October 1614 – 1 September 1687) was an English philosopher of the [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonist school]].

==Biography==
Henry was born in [[Grantham|Grantham, Lincolnshire]] on 12 October 1614.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/henry-more/|title=Henry More|last=Henry|first=John|date=2012-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the seventh son of Alexander More, mayor of Grantham, and Anne More (née Lacy).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both his parents were [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] but he himself "could never swallow that hard doctrine."{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

He was schooled at [[The King's School, Grantham]] and at [[Eton College]]. In 1631 he entered [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], at about the time [[John Milton]] was leaving it. He took his BA in 1635, his MA in 1639, and immediately afterwards became a fellow of his college, turning down all other positions that were offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MR631H2|name=More, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would not accept the mastership of his college, to which, it is understood, he would have been preferred in 1654, when [[Ralph Cudworth]] was appointed.  In 1675, he finally accepted a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[Gloucester Cathedral]], but only to resign it in favour of his friend [[Edward Fowler]], afterwards [[bishop of Gloucester]].

More taught many notable pupils, including Anne Finch, sister of [[Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Heneage Finch]], subsequently Earl of Nottingham. She later became [[Lady Anne Finch Conway|Lady Conway]], and at her country seat at [[Ragley Hall|Ragley]] in Warwickshire, More would spend "a considerable part of his time." She and her husband both appreciated him, and amidst the woods of this retreat he wrote several of his books. The spiritual enthusiasm of Lady Conway was a considerable factor in some of More's speculations, even though she at length joined the [[Quakers]]. She became the friend not only of More and [[William Penn]], but of [[Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont]] (1614–1699) and [[Valentine Greatrakes]], mystical [[thaumaturgist]]s of the 17th-century. Ragley became a centre of devotion and [[spiritualism]].

==Views==
More was a rationalist theologian. He attempted to use the details of 17th-century [[mechanical philosophy]]—as developed by [[René Descartes]]—to establish the existence of immaterial substance.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/henry-more/ "Henry More"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.''&lt;/ref&gt;

More (1712) rejected [[Cartesian dualism]] on the following grounds: "It would be easier for me to attribute matter and extension to the soul, than to attribute to an immaterial thing the capacity to move and be moved by the body.' His difficulties with Cartesian Dualism arose, not from an inability to understand how material and immaterial substances could interact, but from an unwillingness to accept any unextended entity as any kind of real entity.  More continues "...it is plain that if a thing  be at all it must be extended." So for More 'spirit' too must be extended. This led him to the idea of a 'fourth dimension" in which the spirit is extended (to which he gave the curious name of "essential spissitude")&lt;ref&gt;More, H. The Immortality of the Soul. London (4th edition). 1712. For further comments on this idea see Burtt, E.A. The Metaphysical Foundations of Science. London. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. 1932 and Smythies, J. The Walls of Plato's Cave. Aldershot, Avebury. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and to an original solution to the mind-body problem.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeir, K. (2008) ‘Imagination between Physick and Philosophy. On the Central Role of the Imagination in the Work of Henry More (1614–1687).’ in Intellectual History Review, 18 (1), 119–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
More appears to be the origin of the still-popular slur against medieval [[Scholasticism]] that it engaged in useless speculative debates, such as how many angels might dance on the head of a pin (or "on a needles [sic] point," as he puts it), in the second chapter of ''The Immortality of the Soul''.

A quotation from More is used as the epigraph of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s "[[Over-soul|The Over-soul]]."

[[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], quoted More and gave an exposition of his ideas in chapter VII of "[[Isis Unveiled]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0sV5SIgE75sC|title=Isis Unveiled: A Master-key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology|last=Blavatsky|first=Helena|publisher=J. W. Bouton|year=1877|isbn=|volume=1|location=New York|pages=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:More - Opere, 1679 - 1383101.jpg |thumb|''Works'' (''Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Omnia''), 1679]]

More was a prolific writer of verse and prose. The ''Divine Dialogues'' (1688) condenses his general view of philosophy and religion. Like many others he began as a poet and ended as a prose writer. His first work, published in 1642, but written two years earlier, was ''Psychodoia Platonica: or, a Platonicall Song of the Soul, consisting of foure severall Poems.'' It was followed in 1647 by his full collection of ''Philosophicall Poems'', which includes ''The Song of the Soul'', enlarged, and is dedicated to his father. A second edition was published in the same year, and it was included by [[A. B. Grosart]] in his Chertsey Worthies Library (1878).&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography''; [[:s:More, Henry (1614-1687) (DNB00)|More, Henry (1614–1687)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

More's prose works are:

*''Observations upon Anthroposophia Theomagica and Anima Magica Abscondita'', by Alazonomastix Philalethes (pseudonym, see [[-mastix]]), 1650; in answer to [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]], who replied in ''The Man-mouse taken in a Trape''.
*''The Second Lash of Alazonomastix'', a rejoinder to Vaughan, 1651.
*''An Antidote against Atheism, or an Appeal to the Naturall Faculties of the Minde of Man, whether there be not a God,'' 1653 : 2nd edit. corrected and enlarged, with an Appendix, 1655.
*''Conjectura Cabbalistica ... or a Conjectural Essay of Interpreting the Minde of Moses, according to a Threefold Cabbala: viz. Literal, Philosophical, Mystical, or Divinely Moral'', 1653; dedicated to [[Ralph Cudworth]].
*''Enthusiasmus Triumphatus, or a Discourse of the Nature, Causes, Kinds, and Cure of Enthusiasme; written by Philophilus Parrasiastes, and prefixed to Alazonomastix his Observations and Reply'', 1656.
*''The Immortality of the Soul, so farre forth as it is demonstrable from the Knowledge of Nature and the Light of Reason'', 1659; dedicated to [[Edward Conway, 3rd Viscount Conway and Killultagh|Viscount Conway]].
*''An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness; or a True and Faithful Representation of the Everlasting Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ'', 1660.
*''A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity'', and an ''Apologie'', 1664.
*''Enchiridion Ethicum, praecipua Moralis Philosophiae Rudimenta complectens, illustrata ut plurimum Veterum Monumentis, et ad Probitatem Vitae perpetuo accommodate'', 1667, 1668, 1669, 1695, 1696, and 1711.
*''Divine Dialogues, containing sundry Disquisitions and Instructions concerning the Attributes of God and His Providence in the World'', 1668. The most authentic edition appeared in 1713.
*''An Exposition of the Seven Epistles to the Seven Churches; Together with a Brief Discourse of Idolatry, with application to the Church of Rome.'' The title of the latter in the volume itself is ''An Antidote against Idolatry'', and it elicited from More in reply to attacks ''A brief Reply to a late Answer to Dr. Henry More his antidote against Idolatry'', 1672, and ''An Appendix to the late Antidote against Idolatry'', 1673.
*''Enchiridion Metaphysicum: sive, de rebus incorporeis succincta et luculenta dissertati; pars prima'', 1671, an attack on [[Cartesian philosophy]], which he had in earlier life admired.
*''Remarks upon two late ingenious Discourses [by [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]]]; the one, an Essay, touching the Gravitation and non-Gravitation of Fluid Bodies; the other, touching the Torricellian Experiment, so far forth as they may concern any passages in his "Enchiridion Metaphysicum,"'' 1676.
*''Apocalypsis Apocalypseos; or the Revelation of St. John the Divine unveiled: an exposition from chapter to chapter and from verse to verse of the whole Book of the Apocalypse'', 1680.
*''A Plain and continued Exposition of the several Prophecies or Divine Visions of the Prophet Daniel, which have or may concern the People of God, whether Jew or Christian'', 1681.
*''A Brief Discourse of the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist; wherein the Witty Artifices of the Bishop of Meaux [Bossuet] and of Monsieur Maimbourg are obviated, whereby they would draw in the Protestants to imbrace the doctrine of Transubstantiation'', 1681.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

More is also believed to have written ''Philosophiae Teutonicae Censura'', 1670, a criticism of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] of [[Jacob Boehme]]; and to have edited [[Joseph Glanvill]]'s ''[[Saducismus Triumphatus]]'', 1681. He certainly contributed largely to the volume, and also wrote many of the annotations to Glanvill's ''Lux Orientalis'', 1682. More agreed with Glanvill on belief in [[witchcraft]] and apparitions. Several letters from More to [[John Worthington (academic)|John Worthington]] are printed in Worthington's ''Diary'', and some ''Letters Philosophical and Moral'' between [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]] and Henry More are added to Norris's ''Theory and Regulation of Love'', 1688. ''A Collection of several Philosophical Writings of Dr. Henry More'' was first published in 1662 and includes his ''Antidote against Atheism'', with the Appendix, ''Enthusiasmus Triumphatus'', ''Letters to Des Cartes'', &amp;c., ''Immortality of the Soul'', and ''Conjectura Cabbalistica''. A fourth edition, corrected and much enlarged, was published in 1712, with notes.'&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

More issued complete editions of his works, his ''Opera theologica'' in 1675, and his ''Opera philosophica'' in 1678. Between 1672 and 1675 he was principally engaged in translating his English works into Latin. In 1675 appeared ''Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Theologica, Anglice quidem primitius scripta, mine vero per autorem Latine reddita. Hisce novus praefixus est De Synchronismis Apocalypticis Tractatulus.'' It was followed in 1679 by a larger work in two volumes, ''Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Omnia, tum quae Latine tum quae Anglice scripta sunt; nunc vero Latinitate donata instigatu et impensis generosissimi juvenis Johannis Cockshutt nobilis Angli''. John Cockshutt of the [[Inner Temple]] had left a legacy of £300 to More to have three of his principal pieces translated into Latin; and More complied with the terms of the legacy by translating into Latin many more of his English works. In 1692 were published ''Discourses on Several Texts of Scripture'', with a preface signed "John Worthington"; and in 1694 ''Letters on Several Subjects'', published by [[Edmund Elys]]. Abridgments of and extracts from the works of More were numerous; and in 1708 a volume was published for charitable libraries, ''The Theological Works of the most Pious and Learned Henry More''. The work is in English, but "according to the author's Improvements in his Latin edition".&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

The main authorities for More's life are [[Richard Ward (biographer)|Richard Ward's]] ''Life'' (1710); the ''prefatio generalissima'' prefixed to his ''Opera omnia'' (1679); and also an account of his writings in an ''Apology'' published in 1664. His ''Philosophical Poems'' appeared  (1647), with his Echief speculations and experiences". Analysis of his life and works is given in [[John Tulloch]]'s ''Rational Theology'', vol. ii. (1874); see also [[Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann]], ''Henry More und die vierte Dimension des Raums'' (Vienna, 1881); ''Henry More: Tercentenary Studies'', ed. by Sarah Hutton (Dordrecht, 1990).

'''Ingetraut Dahlberg''' (20 February 1927 – 24 October 2017) was a German [[Information science|information scientist]] and [[philosopher]] who developed the universal [[Information Coding Classification]] covering some 6,500 [[Discipline (academia)|subject fields]]. Her career spanned various roles in [[research]], [[Education|teaching]], [[editing]], and [[publishing]].  Dahlberg founded the journal ''International Classification'' (now ''[[Knowledge Organization (journal)|Knowledge Organization]]'') as well as both the scientific [[Society for Classification]] ([[:de:Gesellschaft für Klassifikation|de]]) and [[International Society for Knowledge Organization]].

== Professional career ==

=== Early years ===
The interest of Ingetraut Dahlberg in Documentation started when – at an age of 10 years – she received a camera from her father at Christmas. She started to document everything she regarded as important.&lt;ref name="Romen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://infoscileaders.libsci.sc.edu/asis/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Dahlberg-Transcript.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162839/http://infoscileaders.libsci.sc.edu/asis/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Dahlberg-Transcript.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-02 |title=Dr. Ingetraut Dahlberg Oral history information |at=protokoll of a video interview [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58BBB6A18772DE47 Videointerviews], her nephew  ''Gerhard Romen'' made with Ingetraut Dahlberg in July 2012 |publisher=University of South Carolina School of Library and Information Science (USC SLIS) |access-date=2014-10-16 |language=en |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingetraut Dahlberg lived most of her time in [[Frankfurt]]/Main. She studied [[Philosophy]], [[History]], [[English studies|Anglistics]], [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Theology]], and [[Biology]] at the universities of [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf]] with one college year in the [[United States]] in between.&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Wolfgang Dahlberg | editor=[[International Society for Knowledge Organization|ISKO]] | title=Contributions by Ingetraut Dahlberg to the Field of Knowledge Organization | periodical=ISKO News | volume=27 | publisher=Ergon-Verlag | publication-place=Würzburg | year=1997 | ISSN=0943-7444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="R"&gt;[[Mary Manse College]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional start ===
In 1959 she started a position at the ''Gmelin Institute'' headed by Prof. Dr. Erich Pietsch.&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuhh.de/b/hapke/ispg/pietsch.htm |title=Erich Pietsch |author=Thomas Hapke |publisher=University Library of TU Hamburg Harburg |work=Pioneers of Information Science in Germany |date=2002-09-25 |access-date=2014-10-16 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her job was to create bibliographical publications within the Documentation Center for [[Nuclear power]].&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hapke"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuhh.de/b/hapke/ispg/dahlberg.htm |title=Ingetraut Dahlberg |author=Thomas Hapke |publisher=University Library of TU Hamburg Harburg |work=Pioneers of Information Science in Germany |date=2002-09-25 |access-date=2014-10-16 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 she changed to abstracting work on economical topics in the “Rationalisierungs-Kuratorium der Deutschen Wirtschaft” (Board of Rationalisation and Innovation for the German Economy).

In the years 1962-63 she took part in a one-year course to become a Scientific [[Documentalist]].&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt; This course was organized by the “German Documentation Society” at the [[Leopold Gmelin|Gmelin Institute]].

=== Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation (DGD) (German Documentation Society) ===

Together with Jean Perreault she worked on problems of categories and relations in classification.&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Self" /&gt;

After her return to Frankfurt, she was appointed director of the “DGD-Library and Documentation Center”.&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt; She also was asked to establish a Committee for [[Thesaurus]] Research and Classification&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt; to be chaired by ''Prof. Martin Scheele'' with Ingetraut Dahlberg acting as secretary. During this time she established also a descriptor system for information sciences.

During this period the president of the DGD, ''Prof. Helmut Arntz'' sent her also to The Hague for cooperation with a FID-UDC-Revision Committee for [[Universal Decimal Classification|UDC]] numbers 03/04 out of which she developed a classification system of document types and their special aspect-oriented concepts covering more than 1,000 concepts (1968).

In the years 1967-1974 she also collaborated in the work of the German Standardization Institute on [[terminology]], concerning DIN 2330 “Concepts and Terms, General Principles”&lt;ref name="DIN2330" group="R"&gt;DIN 2330: Begriffe und Benennungen; Allgemeine Grundsätze (“Concepts and Terms, General Principles”)&lt;/ref&gt; and DIN 2331 “Concept Systems and their Presentation”&lt;ref name="DIN2331" group="R"&gt;DIN 2331: Begriffssysteme und ihre Darstellung (“Concept systems and their representation”)&lt;/ref&gt; Here she met Prof. Eugen Wüster, who had some influence on her further work.

In 1970, she was also delegated to cooperate in a Committee for Classification and Indexing in the context of the [[UNISIST model|UNISIST-Program]]&lt;ref group="R" name="UNISIST"&gt;UNISIST = ''UNESCO United Nations International Scientific Information System''&lt;/ref&gt; of UNESCO, headed by [[Douglas John Foskett]].

=== Taking a doctor's degree ===
In 1971, she left the DGD in order to take up a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate study]] in Philosophy with ''Prof. Alwin Diemer'' in [[University of Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf]] on further subjects such as [[Theoretical linguistics|General Linguistics]] and [[History of science]] (1971-1973). Her [[doctoral advisor]] suggested the scope and title: ''A Universal Classification System of Knowledge: its ontological, science-theoretical and information-theoretical foundations''&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt; (English translation). Dahlberg obtained her degree in 1973; the thesis was published in 1974 by [[K. G. Saur Verlag|Verlag Dokumentation K. Saur]] as: ''Foundations for a universal organization of knowledge'' (Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Ingetraut Dahlberg | editor=Dt. Ges. f. Dokumentation e. V.

=== Free lance work ===
During the work for her doctoral thesis she continued as a free lance for projects additional to her work for her M.D. (doctor degree).

* 1971-1972 she was appointed to the consulting group ''Database-system for the Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (Federal Republic of Germany) of the German [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]. She edited two of its resulting three volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor=Ingetraut Dahlberg | title=Literatur zu den Informations-Wissenschaften. Information Sciences Literature. Annotated Bibliography 1960–1971 (Monograph, Bibliography | volume=3. | publisher=C. Heymanns Verlag | publication-place=Köln | year=1972 | isbn=978-3-452-17423-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1972-1973 Collection of terms denoting subject fields, a project financed by the DGD.
* 1972-74 Collaboration with the FID/CR Group “Subject-Field Reference Code”&lt;ref group="R" name="FID_CR"&gt;FID=Fédération Internationale de Documentation, CR=Classification Research&lt;/ref&gt; in order to establish a Broad System of Ordering as proposed by the [[UNISIST model|UNISIST Program]]).&lt;ref name="Hapke" /&gt;&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/fatks/bso/about.htm |title=BSO – BROAD SYSTEM OF ORDERING | editor=University College London.

* 1975-1976 appointed by the ''Deutscher Hochschulverband''&lt;ref group="R"&gt;Association of professors&lt;/ref&gt; to revise their classification system of university courses.
* 1976-1979 elaboration of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]]-Project “Logstruktur”.&lt;ref group="R"&gt;The project name ''Logstruktur'' stands for ''logical structure'', this is to say in respect of content relationships not unfolding from the name of a field of knowledge, but where background knowledge is required to see the interrelations. Parallel to this project the project „Semstruktur" was established, under the direction of [[Gerhard Wahrig]]. This dealt with the ''semantic structure'', hence with the structure unfolding from the name of a field of knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the seventies the collection of subject fields had grown to embrace 12,500 terms. The project was meant to collect and explore their definitions. This led to track numerous synonyms and resulted in a manageable reduction of the number of subject fields.
* 1978-1979 “Pilot Study DB-Thesaurus”.  As an assignment of the [[German National Library|Deutsche Nationalbibliothek]] (German National Library) she had to examine their subject headings regarding their thesaurus pertinence and propose a relative recommendation.
* 1979-1992 Collaboration in the committee on ''Conceptual and Terminological Analysis in the Social Sciences'' (COCTA),&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infoscileaders.libsci.sc.edu/asis/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Dahlberg-CV.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130137/http://infoscileaders.libsci.sc.edu/asis/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Dahlberg-CV.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2015-06-26 | title=Ingetraut Dahlberg – Personal Information | accessdate=2014-11-02 | language=en | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by UNESCO and founded by Prof. [[Fred W. Riggs]]. She organized conferences in [[Bielefeld University|Bielefeld]] and [[Hattersheim am Main|Hattersheim]] and collaborated in the organization of its conference in [[Budapest]].

=== Founding the Journal “International Classification” ===

In 1974, she founded the Journal ''International Classification'' (IC).&lt;ref group="R"&gt;The journal was published by ''Verlag Dokumentation K.G. Saur'' until 1980, afterwards by ''INDEKS-Verlag'' and since 1997 by ''Ergon-Verlag''&lt;/ref&gt; Her coeditors were ''Alwin Diemer'', [[Eugen Wüster]], ''Jean Perreault'' and ''A. Neelameghan''.&lt;ref name="Romen" /&gt;&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isko.org/neelameghan.html |title=In memoriam A. Neelameghan | editor=ISKO | date=2014-08-05 | accessdate=2015-03-11 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first issue contained Dahlberg’s article “Zur Theorie des Begriffs”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ingetraut Dahlberg|Periodical=International Classification|Title=Zur Theorie des Begriffs |Volume=1|Publisher=Verlag Dokumentation K.G. Saur|PublicationPlace=Frankfurt/M.|Year=1974|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;12-19|Date=  1974|language=German|AccessDate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (On concept theory), in which she published her new concept theory for the first time. She referred to this article quite often in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;Beside others in: {{Citation | author=Ingetraut Dahlberg |editor1=Bernhard Ganter |editor2=[[Rudolf Wille]] |editor3=Karl Erich Wolf | title=Die gegenstandsbezogene, analytische Begriffstheorie und ihre Definitionsarten | work=Beiträge zur Begriffsanalyse – Vorträge der Arbeitstagung Begriffsanalyse, Darmstadt 1986 | publisher=BI Wissenschaftsverlag | publication-place=Mannheim | year=1987 | pages=10–22 | isbn=978-3-411-03157-3 | language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her concept was considerably influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]].
Since its very beginning the journal contained – next to scientific articles – also a section on news, book reviews, and a continuing bibliography of current classification literature.
In 1992, the journal changed its name into [[Knowledge Organization (journal)|Knowledge Organization]] (see chapter [[#Founding_of_INDEKS_Company|Founding of INDEKS Company]]). It has been published under this name up to today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isko.org/ko.html |title=Knowledge Organization Journal | editor=International Society for Knowledge Organization | accessdate=2015-03-11 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance of the Information Coding Classification ===

In 1977, the universal classification system of subject fields was ready and named [[Information Coding Classification]] (ICC). It is based on nine ''Levels of being'' and structured by nine [[Faceted classification|facets]]. Its first presentation took place in [[Bangalore]], India, during a seminar at [[S. R. Ranganathan]]’s [[Documentation Research and Training Centre]] (the DRTC). It was a full success. The seminar proceedings were published under the title “Ontical Structures and Universal Classification”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Ingetraut Dahlberg | editor=Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science | title=Ontical Structures and Universal Classification | series=Sarada Ranganathan Endowment for Library Science series | publication-place=Bangalore | year=1978 | LCCN=79903750 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before and after this seminar week, Ms. Dahlberg lectured at several universities in India.&lt;ref group="R"&gt;[[University of Delhi|New-Delhi]], [[University of Kerala|Trivandrum]], [[University of Madras|Madras]], [[Varanasi]] (Prof. Kaula) and [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding of INDEKS Company ===

In 1979, Ingetraut Dahlberg and her son Wolfgang set up a firm under the name of INDEKS purporting to establish indexes and classification systems. In 1980, she continued the firm without her son called from then on INDEKS Verlag.

=== Founding “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation (GfKl) Data Science Society” ===

For a meeting on 12 February 1977, Dahlberg invited representatives from libraries and documentation centres, commodity cataloguers,  physics, chemistry and mathematics  to come to Frankfurt in order to found the [http://www.gfkl.org “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V. Data Science Society” (GfKl)] . Already on June 4, 1977 she organized the first annual conference in [[Münster]]/Westfalen. She was elected chairperson of the society and acted also as its secretary until 1989. She organized the annual conferences until 1986 and published the proceedings volumes.

=== The FID Committee for Classification Research ===

Dahlberg was also chair of this Committee 1981 – 1987. During this time she organized its conferences in [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isw.rwth-aachen.de/bock/ifcshistory.pdf |title=A history of the International Federation of Classification Societies | author=Hans-Hermann Bock | editor=RWTH Aachen University | accessdate=2014-11-02 |language=en | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice she took the opportunity as head of GfKl and FID/CR to combine their conferences in 1979 ([[Königstein im Taunus|Bad Königstein]]) and 1982 ([[Augsburg]]).

=== International Classification and Indexing Bibliography (ICIB) ===

With a financial contribution from the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]] she managed in 1980-1982 the collection, printing and indexing of a bibliography of internationally available literature on Classification and Indexing. Three of the five planned volumes could be published in the years 1982-1985. They covered the publications of the years 1952-1982 and contained more than 11,000 titles, all of them classed according to ICC and also according to the special Classification System of Classification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isko.org/scheme.php | title=Classification System for Knowledge Organization Literature | author=First Edition 1974: Ingetraut Dahlberg, 1993 extended | editor=[[International Society for Knowledge Organization|ISKO]] | date=1974 | accessdate=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; established for bibliographical data in the journal ''International Classification''. Vol.1 contains a list of all universal and special classification systems and thesauri. Also the upper three hierarchical levels of ICC were published there.

=== Founding “International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) ===

Owing to an increasing reponderance of mathematic-oriented members, the ''Gesellschaft für Klassifikation'' split in 1989 on the initiative of its concept-oriented members, who founded the “International Society for Knowledge Organization e.V.” (ISKO). Ingetraut Dahlberg was elected president,&lt;ref name="Hapke" /&gt; Robert Fugmannn&lt;ref group="R" name="Fugmann"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuhh.de/b/hapke/ispg/fugmann.htm |title=Robert Fugmann |work=Pioneers of Information Science in Germany | author=Thomas Hapke | editor=Universitätsbibliothek der TU Hamburg Harburg |date=2014-10-29 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; vice-president&lt;ref group="R"&gt;Fugmann had been vice-president of the ''Gesellschaft für Klassifikation'' beforehand.&lt;/ref&gt; ISKO obtained also  the care of the journal “International Classification”, founded by Dahlberg. The new term&lt;ref name="Hapke" /&gt; “Knowledge Organization” instead of ''classification'' soon became common usage and also the journal was renamed (1992) accordingly.
Next to managing ISKO's head-organization Dahlberg also assisted in the creation of ISKO’s national chapters.&lt;ref group="R"&gt;[[Bulgaria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[France]], [[India]], [[China]]&lt;/ref&gt; She took an active part in the organization of international conferences evry other year and also in the German conferences in the intermediate years. She helped editing and published respective proceedings volumes (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/iskobroc.html | title=ISKO '97 in Berlin | editor=International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) | accessdate=2015-03-23 | language=en | format=text/html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032501/http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/iskobroc.html | archivedate=2015-09-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Retracting from official positions ===

At the age of 70 and because of health problems, Ingetraut Dahlberg retired from her official positions in 1997. In 1998 she left Frankfurt for [[Bad König]], a spa town in the eastern [[Odenwald]] mountain area, 75&amp;nbsp;km south of Frankfurt.
She transferred her INDEKS publishing house to the Ergon Verlag in Würzburg. Charles Gilreath from Texas A&amp;M University became the new editor-in-chief for Knowledge Organization and Hanne Albrechtsen&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ku-dk.academia.edu/HanneAlbrechtsen |title=Hanne Albrechtsen | editor=University of Copenhagen  | accessdate=2014-10-29 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Denmark became the new ISKO president for the rest of Dahlberg's elected time. Her special library of classification, terminology and information science literature went to the [[Maastricht]] [[Marshall McLuhan|McLuhan Institute]] for Digital Culture and Knowledge Organization, directed by Prof. Dr. [[Kim H. Veltman]].&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sumscorp.com/cv |title=cv: Dr. Kim H. Veltman | editor=Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute (VMMI) | accessdate=2014-10-29 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she remained engaged with her main occupational concern via by contacts, publications, and lectures.

=== More recent Work ===

After an encounter with ''Walter Koch'', Graz,&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenGruppe=3&amp;pPersonenId=7F0F3C990ED2C91A |title=Koch, Walter, Ao. Univ.-Prof. i. R. Dr. | editor=Universität Graz | accessdate=2014-11-02 | language=German | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a conference in Karlsruhe in 2010. Ms. Dahlberg started to digitize some 3,500 of the 6,500 concepts of knowledge fields with their definitions in a table sheet file and also many concepts of the so-called “general concepts” from the zero-level of ICC (still unfinished). These work could serve as starting base for a linkage e.g. with WordNet, as it has been demonstrated in a paper by Ernesto DeLuca, Potsdam&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fh-potsdam.de/person/person-action/ernesto-william-de-luca/show/Person/ |title=Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ernesto William De Luca  | editor=Fachhochschule Potsdam | accessdate=2014-10-29 | language=German | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the international ISKO Congress in [[Kraków]], in May 2014. Her recent book, published 2014, on “Knowledge Organization, Development, Task, Application, Future”&lt;ref name="WO"&gt;{{Citation | author=Ingetraut Dahlberg | editor=Deutsche Sektion der Internationalen Gesellschaft für Wissensorganisation e.V. ([[International Society for Knowledge Organization|ISKO]]) | title=Wissensorganisation – Entwicklung, Aufgabe, Anwendung, Zukunft | series=Textbooks for Knowledge Organization | volume=3 | publisher=Ergon Verlag| publication-place=Würzburg | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-95650-065-7 | ISSN=0944-8152| language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in German) also details some of the activities mentioned. It addresses particularly computer scientists, in order to convey to them a humanistic view on the content related treatment of their data, but turns also to readers wishing to access the topic principally. It also covers the theoretical basis of ICC and shows its many-fold potential for applications. She emphasizes her conception – next to subject-related aspects – of an innovating approach to science-policy issues. She strongly recommends Knowledge Organization to be anchored in universities as a discipline of its own under “Science of Science”. Already in 1974 she had provided in her ICC a position for ''Knowledge Organization'' under the subject group “81” (Science of Science). She considers indeed this field to be explored within an institute or an academy since there is such a huge amount of work to be accomplished under the fruitful auspices of the whole array of insights gained so far.

=== Activities ===

Ingetraut Dahlberg was active in the area of classification, thesauri, terminology  and knowledge organization. On these topics she has written far more than 300 publications. Apart from her own scientific work, she considerably contributed to furthering these topics also by the founding the journal “International Classification” in 1974 under its later name Knowledge Organization. She also directed a number of groups and institutions concerned with these scientific branches by organizing conferences and editing and publishing the proceedings volumes of these conferences. She also collaborated in the elaboration of standards (DIN 2330&lt;ref group="R" name="DIN2330" /&gt; and 2331&lt;ref group="R" name="DIN2331" /&gt;) as well as DIN 32705, later on also for ISO/TC37 (“Terminology and other language and content resources”&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee.html%3Fcommid%3D48104 |title=ISO/TC 37: Terminology and other language and content resources | editor=[[Internationale Organisation für Normung]] | accessdate=2015-03-17 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as ISO/TC 46 “Information and Documentation”&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee?commid=48750 |title=ISO/TC 46: Information and documentation | editor=Internationale Organisation für Normung | accessdate=2015-03-17 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For 23 years she was editor-in-chief of her journal and founded the “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V.” (1977) and the “International Society for Knowledge Organization e.V.” (1989). She also organized altogether 20 conferences for these two organizations and for FID/CR and COCTA.

=== Teaching Appointments ===

Starting 1976 she received teaching appointments at the [[University of Mainz]] (1976-1978) ([[Gerhard Wahrig]]). The project “Logstruktur” was connected with this appointment. It meant to explore the structure of definitions of the collected terms of ca. 6,500 knowledge fields and to systematize them. With this, the preliminary work was ready for an encyclopaedia of knowledge fields. Further teaching appointments were at the [[Saarland University|University of Saarbrücken]] (1984-1985), [[Hochschule Hannover]] (1985-87) and [[Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences]] (1988-1989). In addition, Dahlberg was often requested to lecture at many universities and gave seminars in India and Brazil.

=== Publications ===

Ms. Dahlberg wrote far more than 300 publications&lt;ref name="cv" /&gt; among which also encyclopaedic entries on classification and knowledge organization.&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{Citation | editor=H.-J. Schneider | title=div. Beiträge zum Thema "Klassifikation" | work=Lexikon der Informatik und Datenverarbeitung | publisher=Oldenbourg-Verlag | publication-place=München | edition=1 | year=1983 | language=de | isbn=978-3-486-22875-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{Citation | author=Ingetraut Dahlberg |editor1=K.

=== Mission ===

Ingetraut Dahlberg deplores the dispersion of knowledge in our times and finds the reason for this development in the diversity of thesauri and also of subject-oriented ontologies. As a practical-sensed philosopher, she would promote a sort of order reaching beyond a single subject-orientation (she uses the concept “universal order of knowledge” as a foundation for an interdisciplinary approach.
	
{{Quote | text=Above all,  the book's purpose is to direct attention to the enormous significance of a universal order of knowledge embracing all necessary aspect of interdisciplinarity in present-day research which precisely is totally neglected by the multitude of existent ontologies and their reductive effect. A really global survey of our knowledge is feasible under ICC, which fits with its first two hierarchical levels in matrix form onto a screen and thus offers the insight into and the rediscovery of the lost unity of our knowledge. | sign=Ingetraut Dahlberg | source=from the introduction of her book „Wissensorganisation“&lt;ref name="WO" /&gt;}}

She presents this vista of view energetically and defends it against other aspects of knowledge organization

{{quote | text=The motivation for writing this small book was first of all my recognizing – at the last international conference of ISKO in Krakow 2014 – that many young participants apparently were not clear about how knowledge organization was meant to be understood. On the other hand it happened that I had just written a book review on the “Handbook on Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies”&lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{Citation | author=Miguel-Angel Sicilia | title=Handbook on Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies | publisher=World Scientific Pub Co | year=2014 | isbn=978-981-283-629-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of  M.-A. Sicilia &lt;ref group="R"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cc.uah.es/msicilia |title=Miguel-Angel Sicilia |publisher=Universidad de Alcalá, Departamento de Ciencias Computación |language=en |access-date=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and realized, that computer-science colleagues seem to lack the knowledge which after all had already been developed for hundreds of years in the field of classification. Although they understand very well, that their data relate to contents and they therefore resort to classification systems and thesauri developed by information scientists, yet they lack their foundations. | sign=Ingetraut Dahlberg | source=from the introduction to the book “Knowledge Organization”&lt;ref name="WO" /&gt;}}

Above all, she is interested in seeing her Information Coding Classification system (ICC) being further developed and completed.

'''Ion of Chios''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἴων ὁ Χῖος}}; c. 490/480 – c. 420 BC) was a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] writer, dramatist, lyric poet and philosopher. He was a contemporary of [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]] and [[Sophocles]]. Of his many plays and poems only a few titles and fragments have survived. He also wrote some prose works, including a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] text, the ''Triagmos'', of which a few fragments survive.

==Life==
He was the son of Orthomenes, and was surnamed the son of Xuthus: probably a nickname alluding to [[Xuthus]], the father of the mythical [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholium ''ad Aristoph. Pac.'' 830; Suda, Eudocia, Harpocr., ''Ion''&lt;/ref&gt; When very young he went to [[Athens]], where he enjoyed the society of [[Cimon]], of whom he left laudatory notices in some of his works which are quoted by [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Cimon'', 5, 9, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch informs us that Ion severely criticised [[Pericles]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Pericles'' 5, 28&lt;/ref&gt; who is said to have been his rival in love.&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, x. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Ion was familiarly acquainted with [[Aeschylus]], if we may believe an anecdote related by Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''De Profect. in Virt.'' 8&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not come forward as a tragedian till after Aeschylus' death. We also learn from Ion himself&lt;ref&gt;ap. Athenaeus, xiii. 603&lt;/ref&gt; that he met [[Sophocles]] at Chios, when the latter was commander of the expedition against [[Samos]], 440 BC.

His first tragedy was brought out in the 82nd [[Olympiad]] (452 BC); he is mentioned as third in competition with [[Euripides]] and [[Iophon]], in Olympiad 87.4 (429-8 BC); and he died before 421 BC, as appears from the ''Peace'' of [[Aristophanes]],&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''Peace'', 830&lt;/ref&gt; which was brought out in that year. Only one victory of Ion's is mentioned, on which occasion, it is said, having gained the [[dithyrambic]] and [[tragic]] prizes at the same time, he presented every Athenian with a pitcher of Chian wine.&lt;ref&gt;Scholium ''ad Aristoph. Pac.'' 830;  Suda, ''Athenaios''; Athenaeus, i. 3; Eustath. ''ad Hom.'' p. 1454, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it would seem that he was a man of considerable wealth. He is mentioned by [[Strabo]] among the celebrated men of Chios.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The number of his tragedies is variously stated at 12, 30, and 40. We have the titles and a few fragments of eleven plays, namely, ''Agamemnon''; ''Alcmene''; ''Argeioi''; ''Eurytidai''; ''Laertes''; ''Mega Drama''; ''Omphale''; ''Phoinix or Kaineus''; ''Phoinix Deuteros (The Second Phoenix)''; ''Phrouroi''; and ''Teucer''. The ''Omphale'' was a satyric drama. [[Longinus (literature)|Pseudo-Longinus]] describes the style of Ion's tragedies as marked by petty refinements and want of boldness,&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Longinus, 33&lt;/ref&gt; and he adds an expression that no one in his senses would compare the value of the ''Oedipus'' with that of all the tragedies of Ion taken together. Nevertheless, he was greatly admired, chiefly, it would seem, for a sort of elegant wit. There are some beautiful passages in the extant fragments of his tragedies. Commentaries were written upon him by [[Arcesilaus]], [[Baton of Sinope]], [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]], [[Epigenes of Byzantium|Epigenes]], and even by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, iv. 31; Athenaeus, x. 436, xi. 468, xiv. 634&lt;/ref&gt; Besides his tragedies, we are told by the [[scholiast]] on Aristophanes, that Ion also wrote lyric poems, [[comedy|comedies]], [[epigram]]s, [[paean]]s, [[hymn]]s, [[scholium|scholia]], and [[elegy|elegies]]. Some remnants of his elegies are in the [[Greek Anthology]].

His prose works, mentioned by the scholiast on Aristophanes, are one called ''Presbeutikon'' (Πρεσβευτικόν), which some thought spurious; ''Ktisis'' (Κτίσις); ''Kosmologikos'' (Κοσμολογικός); ''Hypomnemata'' (Ὑπομνήματα); and some others, which are not specified. The nature of the first of these works is not known. The full title of the ''Ktisis'' was ''Chiou Ktisis'' (Χίου Κτίσις): it was a historical work, in the Ionic dialect, and apparently in imitation of [[Herodotus]]: it was probably the same as the ''Syngraphe'' (Συγγραφή), which is quoted by Pausanias.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, vii. 4. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kosmologikos'' is probably the same as the philosophical work, entitled ''Triagmos'' (Τριαγμός) or ''Triagmoi'' (Τριαγμοί), which seems to have been a treatise on the constitution of things according to the theory of triads; the few surviving fragments suggesting it had [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] leanings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diels–Kranz]] 36&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hypomnemata'' are by some writers identified with the ''Epidemiai'' (Ἐπιδημίαι) or ''Ekdemetikos'' (Ἐκδημητικός),&lt;ref&gt;Julius Pollux, ii. 88&lt;/ref&gt; which contained either an account of his own travels, or of the visits of famous people to Chios.

'''John Jamieson Carswell''' "'''Jack'''" '''Smart''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]] (16 September 1920 – 6 October 2012&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;) was an Australian philosopher and academic, and was appointed as an Emeritus Professor by the [[Australian National University]]. He worked in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[political philosophy]]. He wrote multiple entries for the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born in [[Cambridge]], England of Scottish parents, Smart began his education locally, attending [[The Leys School]], a leading independent boarding school. His younger brothers also became professors: Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at Nottingham University; [[Ninian Smart|Ninian]] was a professor of [[Religious Studies]] and a pioneer in that field. Their father, [[William Marshall Smart]], was John Couch Adams Astronomer at [[Cambridge University]] and later [[Regius Professor of Astronomy, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Astronomy]] at [[Glasgow]]. In 1950, W. M. Smart was President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. In 1946, Jack Smart graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]], followed by a BPhil from [[Oxford University]] in 1948. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] for two years.

He arrived in Australia in August 1950 to take up the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Adelaide]], which he occupied from 1950 until 1972. After twenty-two years in Adelaide, he moved to [[La Trobe University]] where he was Reader in Philosophy from 1972–76. He then moved to the [[Australian National University]] where he was Professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1976 until his retirement in 1985, and where the annual Jack Smart Lecture is held in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/smart-lecture.php ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his retirement he was [[Emeritus]] Professor at [[Monash University]].

Smart was a Foundation Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] at its establishment in 1969. In 1990 he was awarded the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia.&lt;ref name="monash1"&gt;[http://arts.monash.edu.au/philosophy/staff/jsmart.php Monash University Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321185415/http://arts.monash.edu.au/philosophy/staff/jsmart.php |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 he was elected to become an honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, [[Oxford|Oxford University]] and in 2010, elected to become an honorary Fellow of [[Queen's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="monash1"/&gt;

At first Smart was a [[Behaviorism#Behaviorism in philosophy|behaviourist]] before becoming an early proponent of [[Type physicalism|Type Identity Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/#His The Identity Theory of Mind (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
Smart's main contribution to metaphysics is in the area of [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]].  He has been an influential defender of the [[B-Theory of time]], and of [[perdurantism]].

His most important original arguments in this area concern the passage of time, which he claimed is an illusion.  He argued that if time really passed, then it would make sense to ask at what rate it passes, but this requires some second time-dimension with respect to which passage of normal time can be measured. This in turn faces the same problems, and so there must be a third time-dimension, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Smart |title=Essays in Conceptual Analysis |editor=Anthony Kenny |chapter=River of Time |pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the [[rate of passage argument]].

Smart has changed his mind about the nature and causes of the illusion of the passage of time.  In the 1950s, he held that it was due to people's use of [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] temporal language.  He later came to abandon this linguistic explanation of the illusion in favour of a psychological explanation in terms of the passage of memories from [[Short-term memory|short-term]] to [[long-term memory]].

==Philosophy of mind==
Regarding the [[philosophy of mind]], Smart was a [[Physicalism|physicalist]]. In the 1950s, he was also one of the originators, with [[Ullin Place]], of the [[mind–brain identity theory]], which claims that particular states of mind are identical with particular states of the brain. Initially, this view was dubbed "[[Australian materialism]]" by its detractors, in reference to the stereotype of Australians as down-to-earth and unsophisticated.

Smart's identity theory dealt with some extremely long-standing objections to physicalism by comparing the mind–brain identity thesis to other identity theses well-known from science, such as the thesis that lightning is an electrical discharge, or that the morning star is the evening star.  Although these identity theses give rise to puzzles such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s [[Reference#Reference and meaning|puzzle of the Morning Star and Evening Star]], in the scientific cases, some claim that it would be absurd to reject the identity theses on this ground.  Since the puzzles facing physicalism are strictly analogous to the scientific identity theses, it would then also be absurd to reject physicalism on the grounds that it gives rise to these puzzles.

==Ethics==
In ethics, Smart was a defender of [[utilitarianism]]. Specifically, he defended "extreme", or [[act utilitarianism]], as opposed to "restricted", or [[rule utilitarianism]]. The distinction between these two types of ethical theory is explained in his essay ''Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism''.&lt;ref&gt;J.J.C. Smart, "[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8094(195610)6%3A25%3C344%3AEARU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism]", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Oct. 1956, pages 344–354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955.  Smart later stated that he made mistakes in this essay (for example, that probably maximizing benefit is not the same thing as maximizing probable benefit).  However, perhaps because of this very fact, that is, perhaps because Smart did not fall prey to what might be called the "philosopher's disease" of attempting to be obsessively precise, this essay lays out a good clear, readable presentation of act utilitarianism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart gave two arguments against rule utilitarianism.  According to the first, rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because there is no adequate criterion on what can count as a "rule".  According to the second, even if there were such a criterion, the rule utilitarian would be committed to the untenable position of preferring to follow a rule, even if it would be better if the rule were broken, which Smart called "superstitious rule worship".&lt;ref&gt;J.J.C. Smart, "[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8094(195610)6%3A25%3C344%3AEARU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism]", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Oct. 1956, pages 344–354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955.  Smart's views on rule utilitarianism have been challenged, for example by [[Alan Gibbard]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of Smart's ethical theory is his acceptance of a preference theory of well-being, which contrasts with the [[hedonism]] associated with "classical" utilitarians such as [[Jeremy Bentham]].  Smart's combination of the preference theory with [[consequentialism]] is sometimes called "[[preference utilitarianism]]".

Smart's arguments against rule utilitarianism have been very influential, contributing to a steady decline in its popularity among ethicists during the late 20th century. Worldwide, his defence of act utilitarianism and preference theory has been less prominent but has influenced philosophers who have worked or been educated in Australia, such as [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], [[Philip Pettit]], and [[Peter Singer]].

One of Smart's two entries in the [[Philosophical Lexicon]] refers to his approach to the consequences of act utilitarianism: to "outsmart" an opponent is "to embrace the conclusion of one's opponent's [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument."  This move is more commonly called "biting the bullet".

{{Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a [[creator deity]]. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents—soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion—have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Jain text claims that the universe consists of ''[[Jīva (Jainism)|jiva]]'' (life force or souls) and ''[[ajiva]]'' (lifeless objects). The [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its [[Karma in Jainism|''karmas]] and desires achieves liberation ([[nirvana (Jainism)|''nirvana'']]). A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soni |first=Jayandra |editor=E. Craig |title=Jain Philosophy |journal=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1998 |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705164341/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/F005SECT3 |archivedate= 5 July 2008 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jaina conception of the Universe==
[[File:Lokapurusha Cosmic man.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Representation of Universe in Jain cosmology in form of a lokapurusa or cosmic man.]]
{{see also|Jain cosmology}}
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Structure of Universe as per the Jain Scriptures.]]
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of universe. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including Heavenly beings/Devas. These Heavenly beings are not viewed as creators, they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die. If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one's soul from karmas and the attainment of enlightenment/Nirvana and a God as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed Gods/Tirthankara. Thus, Mahavira was God/Tirthankara.

According to Jains, this ''loka'' or universe is an entity, always existing in varying forms with no beginning or end. Jain texts describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arms resting on his waist. Thus, the universe is narrow at top, widens above the middle, narrows towards the middle, and once again becomes broad at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Gopani (1989), Gāthā 4.103-6&lt;/ref&gt; {{Ref label|B|b|none}}

===Wheel of time===
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Jain Cosmic Wheel of Time]]
According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The cosmic wheel of time rotates ceaselessly.&lt;ref name="Schubring, Walther 1995 pp. 204–246"&gt;Schubring, Walther (1995), pp. 204–246&lt;/ref&gt; This cyclic nature eliminates the need for a creator, destroyer or external deity to maintain the universe.

The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, ''Utsarpiṇī'' or ascending time cycle and ''Avasarpiṇī'', the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. ''Utsarpiṇī'' is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness where the time spans and ages are at an increasing scale, while ''Avsarpiṇī'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept of reality===
This universe is made up of what Jainas call the six ''dravyas'' or substances classified as follows –
*'''''Jīva''''' - '''The living substances'''

:Jains believe that [[soul]]s (Jīva) exist as a reality, with a separate existence from the body that houses it. It is characterised by ''cetana'' (consciousness) and ''upayoga'' (knowledge and perception).&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005a), Gāthā 16&lt;/ref&gt; Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearance of one state of soul and appearance of another, both merely various modes of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar(2005a), Gāthā 18&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Ajīva''''' - '''Non-Living Substances'''
**'''''Pudgala''''' or '''[[Matter]]''' - Matter is solid, liquid, gas, energy, fine karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. ''Paramānu'' or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter. One quality of ''paramānu'' and ''pudgala'' is permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.
**'''''Dharma-tattva''''' or '''Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]''' and '''''Adharma-tattva''''' or '''Medium of Rest''' - Also known as ''Dharmāstikāya'' and ''Adharmāstikāya'', they are distinct to Jain thought depicting motion and rest. They pervade the entire universe. Dharma-tattva and Adharma-tattva are by itself not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without ''dharmāstikāya'' motion is impossible and without ''adharmāstikāya'' rest is impossible in the Universe.
**'''''Ākāśa''''' or '''Space''' - [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates living souls, matter, the principles of motion and rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points.
**'''''Kāla''''' or '''Time''' - [[Time]] is a real entity according to Jainism and all activities, changes or modifications are achieved only in time. Time is like a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending: half with six stages of immense durations, each estimated at billions of "ocean years" (sagaropama).&lt;ref&gt;James (1969) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; In each descending stage, sorrow increases and at each ascending stage, happiness and bliss increase.

These uncreated constituents of the universe impart dynamics upon the universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to natural laws without interference from external entities. ''Dharma'' or true religion according to Jainism is ''vatthu sahāvo dhammo'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma." {{Ref label|C|c|none}}

===Material cause and effect===

According to Jainism, [[cause]]s are of two types – ''Upādanā kārana'' (substantial or material cause) and ''Nimitta kārana'' (instrumental cause). ''Upādanā kārana'' is always identical with its effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.107&lt;/ref&gt; For example, out of clay, you can only produce a clay pot; hence the clay is the ''upādanā kārana'' or material cause and clay pot its effect. Wherever the effect is present, the cause is present and vice versa. The effect is always present in latent form in the material cause. For transforming the clay to pot, the potter, the wheel, the stick and other operating agents are required that are merely nimitta or instrumental cause or catalysts in transformation. The material cause always remains the clay. Hence the cause and effect are always entirely identical in nature. {{Ref label|G|g|none}}  Potter cannot be the material cause of pot. If this were the case, then Potter might as well prepare the pot without any clay. But this is not so. Thus a clay pot can only be made from clay; gold ornaments can be made only from gold. Similarly the different modes of existence of a soul are a result of activities of soul itself. There cannot be any contradiction or exceptions.

In such a scenario, Jains argue that the material cause of a living soul with ''cetana'' ([[conscious]] entity) is always the soul itself and cause of dead inert matter (non-cetana i.e. without any consciousness) is always the matter itself.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 189, Gāthā 10.308-9&lt;/ref&gt; If God is indeed the creator, then this is an impossible predication as the same cause will be responsible for two contradictory effects of ''cetana'' (life) and ''acetana'' (matter).&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 73, Gāthā 2.85&lt;/ref&gt; This logically precludes an immaterial God (a conscious entity) from creating this Universe, which is made up of material substances.

===The soul===

According to Jainism, Soul is the master of its own [[destiny]]. One of the qualities of the soul is complete lordship of its own destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005a), Gatha 27&lt;/ref&gt; The soul alone chooses its actions and soul alone reaps its consequences. No God or prophet or angel can interfere in the actions or the destiny of the soul. Furthermore, it is the soul alone who makes the necessary efforts to achieve liberation without any [[divine grace]].&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005a), Gāthā 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ācārya Amrtacandra Sūri, Laghutattvasphota, Sūtra 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains frequently assert that “we are alone” in this world. {{Ref label|H|h|none}}Amongst the [[Twelve Contemplations]] ([[anupreksa]]s) of Jains, one of them is the loneliness of one's soul and nature of the universe and transmigration. Hence only by cleansing our soul by our own actions can we help ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Vallely (1980), p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Jainism thus lays a strong emphasis on the efforts and the [[freewill]] of the soul to achieve the desired goal of liberation.

==Jaina conception of divinity==
{{Main|God in Jainism}}
[[File:Siddha idol.jpg|thumb|200px| Image of a ''Siddha'': the soul who attains Moksa; although the ''Siddhas'' (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the Jain temples often depict the ''Siddhas''.]]
According to Jainism, gods can be categorized into ''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankaras]], [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]s'' or ordinary ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]]'' and ''[[Siddha]]s''. Jainism considers the ''Devīs'' and ''Devas'' to be celestial beings who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives.

===Arhats===
'''Arihants''', also known as Kevalins, are "Gods" (supreme souls) in embodied states who ultimately become Siddhas, or liberated souls, at the time of their ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]''. An Arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence has destroyed the four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]'' and attain ''[[kevala Jñāna]]'', or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Aghatiya karmas|aghātiyā karmas]]''. An ''Arhata'', at the end of his lifespan, destroys his remaining ''aghātiyā karma'' and becomes a ''Siddha''.

===Tīrthankaras===
'''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankaras]]''' (also known as "Jinas") are Arihants who are teachers and revivers of the Jain philosophy. There are 24 Tīrthankaras in each time cycle; [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] was the 24th and last Tīrthankara of the current time cycle. Tīrthankaras are literally the ford makers who have shown the way to cross the ocean of rebirth and transmigration and hence have become a focus of reverence and worship amongst Jains. However it would be a mistake to regard the Tīrthankaras as gods analogous to the gods of [[Hindu]] pantheon despite the superficial resemblances in Jain and Hindu way of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thrower (1980), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tīrthankaras'' like ''Arhatas'' ultimately become ''Siddhas'' on liberation. ''Tīrthankaras'', being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are not the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

===Siddhas===
[[File:Siddha Shila.svg|450px|thumb|right|[[Siddhashila]] as per the [[Jain cosmology]]]]
Ultimately all Arihants and Tīrthankaras become Siddhas. A Siddha is a soul who is permanently liberated from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the Karmas and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in [[Siddhashila]] (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy. Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls.

Jains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favours or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the ''karmas'' and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term – ''vandetadgunalabhdhaye'' i.e. we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes” {{Ref label|F|f|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavenly beings – Demi-gods and demi-goddesses===
{{Main|God in Jainism#Heavenly Beings}}
Jainism describes existence of ''śāsanadevatās'' and ''śāsanadevīs'', the attendant Gods and Goddesses of ''Tīrthankaras'', who create the [[samavasarana]] or the divine preaching assembly of a ''Tīrthankara''.
{{cquote|&lt;cite&gt; These Gods tainted with attachment and passion;	
having women and weapons by their side, favour some and disfavour some;
such Gods should not be worshipped by those who desire emancipation”&lt;ref&gt;Gopani (1989), emended&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;}}
Worship of such gods is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas. However, many Jains are known to worship to such gods for material gains.

==Nature of Karmas==
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
According to [[Robert Zydendos]], [[karma in Jainism]] can be considered a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand and then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no moral judgment involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.&lt;ref name="robert"&gt;Zydenbos (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence in accordance with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the [[cosmos]], self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with moral and ethical principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.&lt;ref name="robert" /&gt;

Karmas are often wrongly interpreted as a method for reward and punishment of a soul for its good and bad deeds. In Jainism, there is no question of there being any reward or punishment, as each soul is the master of its own destiny. The karmas can be said to represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires of a soul. They enable the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name="kuhn"&gt;Kuhn (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; They ultimately mature when the necessary supportive conditions required for maturity are fulfilled.&lt;ref name="tat"&gt;Acharya Umasvati, Tattvartha Sutra, Ch VIII, Sutra 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karmas that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the fruits.

Hence whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing now is on account of choices that it has made in past. That is why Jainism stresses pure thinking and moral behavior. Apart from [[Buddhism]], perhaps Jainism is the only religion that does not invoke the fear of God as a reason for moral behavior.

The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. [[Tirthankara]]s are not attributed "absolute godhood" under Jainism. Thus, even the Tirthankaras themselves have to go through the stages of emanicipation, for attaining that state. While Buddhism does give a similar and to some extent a matching account for Shri [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Hinduism]] maintains a totally different theory where "divine grace" is needed for emanicipation.

The following quote in ''Bhagavatī Ārādhanā'' (1616) sums up the predominance of karmas in Jain doctrine:-
{{cquote|&lt;cite&gt; There is nothing mightier in the world than karma;
karma tramples down all powers, as an elephant a clump of lotuses. &lt;/cite&gt;}}
Thus it is not the so-called all embracing omnipotent God, but the law of karma that is the all governing force responsible for the manifest differences in the status, attainments and happiness of all life forms. It operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them.

==Jain opposition to creationism==
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of universe. 12th century Ācārya Hemacandra puts forth the Jain view of universe in the [[Yogaśāstra]] as thus {{Ref label|I|i|none}} –

{{cquote|&lt;cite&gt; This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone;
It is self sustaining, without any base or support   &lt;/cite&gt;}}
Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|vedics]], [[samkhya|sāmkhyas]], mimimsas, Buddhists and other school of thoughts were analysed, debated and repudiated by the various Jain Ācāryas. However the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by Ācārya [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]] as thus {{Ref label|J|j|none}} –

{{cquote|&lt;cite&gt; Some foolish men declare that creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected.
If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now?

How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.

If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy, For the whole universe might thus have been its own creator, and have arisen quite naturally.

If God created the world by an act of his own will, without any raw material, then it is just his will and nothing else — and who will believe this silly nonsense?

If he is ever perfect and complete, how could the will to create have arisen in him? If, on the other hand, he is not perfect, he could no more create the universe than a potter could.

If he is form-less, action-less and all-embracing, how could he have created the world? Such a soul, devoid of all modality, would have no desire to create anything.

If he is perfect, he does not strive for the three aims of man, so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe?

If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so, then God is pointless. If he created in some kind of sport, it was the sport of a foolish child, leading to trouble.

If he created because of the karma of embodied beings [acquired in a previous creation] He is not the Almighty Lord, but subordinate to something else

If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world, why did he not make creation wholly blissful free from misfortune?

If he were transcendent he would not create, for he would be free: Nor if involved in transmigration, for then he would not be almighty.
Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all,

And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created. If you say that he slays only to destroy evil beings, why did he create such beings in the first place?

Good men should combat the believer in divine creation, maddened by an evil doctrine.
Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning or end, and is based on the principles, life and rest.
Uncreated and indestructible, it endures under the compulsion of its own nature. &lt;/cite&gt;}}

==Criticisms of Jain non-creationist theory==

[[Jainism]] along with [[Buddhism]] has been categorized as [[atheist]] philosophy i.e. ''Nāstika darśana'' by the followers of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. However, the word Nāstika corresponds more to [[heterodox]] rather than atheism. Accordingly, those who did not believe in Vedas and rejected [[Brahma]] as the creator of Universe were labeled as Nāstika.

Mrs. Sinclair Stevenson, an Irish [[missionary]], declared that “the heart of Jainism is empty” since it does not depend on beseeching an omnipotent God for salvation. While fervently appealing to accept [[Christianity]], she says Jains believe strongly in forgiving others, and yet have no hope of forgiveness by a higher power. Jains believe that liberation is by personal effort not an appeal for divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson (1999) (Original 1915) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; “The Heart of Jainism” was written from her missionary point of view without respecting Jain sensibilities.

If atheism is defined as disbelief in existence of a God, then Jainism cannot be labeled as atheistic, as it not only believes in existence of gods but also of the soul which can attain godhood. As [[Paul Dundas]] puts it – “while Jainism is, as we have seen, atheist in a limited sense of rejection of both the existence of a creator God and the possibility of intervention of such a being in human affairs, it nonetheless must be regarded as a theist religion in the more profound sense that it accepts the existence of divine principle, the paramātmā i.e. God, existing in potential state within all beings”.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002) p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaina position on God and religion from a perspective of a non-Jain can be summed up in the words of Anne Vallely. {{cquote|&lt;cite&gt; Jainism is the most difficult religion. We get no help from any gods, or from anyone. We just have to cleanse our souls. In fact other religions are easy, but they are not very ambitious. In all other religions when you are in difficulty, you can pray to God for help and maybe, God comes down to help. But Jainism is not a religion of coming down. In Jainism it is we who must go up. We only have to help ourselves. In Jainism we have to become God. That is the only thing.&lt;ref&gt;Vallely, Anne (1980).  In: ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnology of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto Press: Toronto .p.182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;}}

== Technical details ==
Kune is programmed using the [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[Google Web Toolkit|GWT]] in the client-side, integrating [[Apache Wave]] (formerly [[Google Wave]]) and using mainly the open protocols [[XMPP]] and [[Wave Federation Protocol]]. GWT Java sources on the client side generates [[Code obfuscation|obfuscated]] and deeply optimized [[JavaScript]] conforming a [[single page application]]. Wave extensions (gadgets, bots) run on top of Kune (as in [[Facebook apps]]) and can be programmed in Java+GWT, JavaScript or Python.

The current version has been under development since 2007,&lt;ref name="video2008"&gt;{{cite video |people= |date= 26 January 2008|title= Video: Status of Kune development (Jan 2008)|url=http://kune.ourproject.org/2008/01/status-jan08/|format= AVI |medium= |trans_title= |publisher= |location= |accessdate=28 August 2011|time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a constant, stable growth and an established codebase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kune project in Ohloh|url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/kune|author=[[Ohloh]]|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the code is hosted in the GIT of [[Gitorious]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Kune is 100% free software and was built only using free software. Its software is licensed under the [[Affero GPL]] license while the art is under a [[Creative Commons]] BY-SA.

== Philosophy ==

Kune was born in order to face a growing concern from the community behind it. Nowadays, groups (a group of friends, activists, a NGO, a small start-up) that need to work together typically will use multiple [[Free like beer|free (like beer)]] commercial centralized for-profit services (e.g. [[Google Docs]], [[Google Groups]], [[Facebook]], [[Wordpress.com]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Flickr]], [[eBay]] ...) in order to communicate and collaborate online. However, "If you're not paying for it, you're the product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If You’re Not Paying for It; You’re the Product|url=http://lifehacker.com/5697167/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-youre-the-product|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Lifehacker|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid that, such groups of users may ask a technical expert to build them mailing lists, a webpage and maybe to set up an [[etherpad]]. However, technicians are needed for any new list (as they cannot configure e.g. [[GNU Mailman]]), configuration change, etc., creating a strong dependency and ultimately a bottle-neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kune 0.0.9 published (codename "15M")|url=http://kune.ourproject.org/2011/08/kune-0-0-9-published-codename-15m/|accessdate=12 April 2012|publisher = Kune Blog|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kune aims to cover all those needs of groups to communicate and collaborate, in an usable way and thus without depending on technical experts
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Software libre, hardware libre, ¿servicios libres?|url=http://libertonia.escomposlinux.org/story/2009/5/27/12014/3120|accessdate=3 February 2011|newspaper=Libertonia News|date=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to be a free/libre web service (and thus in [[Internet|the cloud]]), but decentralized as email so a user can choose the server they want and still interoperate transparently with the rest.

Opposite to most distributed social networks, this software focuses on collaboration and building, not only on communication and sharing. Thus, Kune does not aim to ultimately replace Facebook, but also all the above-mentioned commercial services. Kune has a strong focus on the construction of [[Free culture movement|Free Culture]] and eventually facilitate [[Commons-based peer production]].&lt;ref&gt;

The origin of Kune relies on the community behind [[Ourproject.org]]. Ourproject&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There's Life after Microsoft - Free Software Advocates|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22073|accessdate=3 February 2011|newspaper=Inter Press Service News Agency|date=24 January 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907021149/http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=22073|archivedate=7 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to provide for [[Free culture movement|Free Culture]] (social/cultural projects) what [[Sourceforge]] and other [[software forge]]s meant for [[free software]]: a collection of communication and collaboration tools that would boost the emergence of community-driven free projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Ourproject was relatively successful, it was far from the original aims. The analysis of the situation in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
 | title = Towards a new manager of free projects (Hacia un nuevo gestor de proyectos libres)
 | publisher = [[Ourproject.org]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that only the groups that had a [[geek|techie]] among them (who would manage [[GNU Mailman|Mailman]] or install a [[Content Management System|CMS]]) were able to move forward, while the rest would abandon the service. Thus, new free collaborative tools were needed, more usable and suitable for anyone, as the available free tools required a high degree of technical expertise. This is why Kune, whose name means "together" in [[Esperanto]], was developed.

The first prototypes of Kune were developed using [[Ruby on Rails]] and Pyjamas (later known as [[Pyjs]]). However, with the [[Java (software platform)#Licensing|release of Java]] and the [[Google Web Toolkit]] as free software, the community embraced these technologies since 2007.&lt;ref name="video2008" /&gt; In 2009, with a stable codebase and about to release a major version of Kune,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=¡Colabora con Kune!

Wave was using the same technologies of Kune (Java + GWT, Guice, XMPP protocol) so it would be easy to integrate after its release. Besides, Wave was offering an open federated protocol, easy extensibility (through gadgets), easy control versioning, and very good real-time edition of documents. Thus, the community decided to halt the development of Kune, and wait for its release... in the meanwhile developing gadgets that would be integrated in Kune later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In November 2010, the free [[Apache Wave]] (previously Wave-in-a-Box) was released, under the umbrella of the [[Apache Foundation]]. Since then, the community began integrating its source code within the Kune previous codebase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Rev. Kyōki Roberts''' (OPW) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[Sōtō Zen]] priest. The single [[Dharma heir]] of [[Nonin Chowaney]]-[[Rōshi|roshi]], Roberts received [[Dharma transmission]] in June 2001 and was a founding member of an organization of Sōtō priests known as the Order of the Prairie Wind (OPW), which is now defunct. Having studied Zen in [[Japan]] at the Zuiō-ji (瑞応寺) and Shōgo-ji (聖護寺) monasteries and in the United States at [[Minnesota Zen Center]], [[San Francisco Zen Center]], and [[Green Gulch Farm]], Roberts was certified by the Sōtō School of Japan.

Roberts blended her practice of Zen Buddhism with art during the 2003 exhibition ''Gestures: An Exhibition of Small Site-Specific Works'' at [[Mattress Factory|The Mattress Factory Museum]] in Pittsburgh. Her installation exhibit, ''No where to go; nothing to do: Just Sitting'', invited visitors to experience aspects of [[Zazen]] (seated meditation)."[http://www.mattress.org/index.cfm?event=ShowArtist&amp;eid=34&amp;id=154&amp;c=Past]

In March 2006, Roberts served as a member of the ''Plenary Panel of Venerable Women: Women Living the Dharma in the 21st Century'' during the first Buddhist Women's Conference held at [[DePaul University]] and sponsored by the [http://www.buddhistcouncilmidwest.org/ Buddhist Council of the Midwest]. During the conference, she blended her Zen training and her 10 years of experience as a mediator for the State of Nebraska to present a workshop on ''Difficult Conversations as Practice''."[http://www.dharmawomen.org/BWC_web01.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">In politics and law, '''liberal legalism''' is a belief that politics should be constrained by legal [[constitution]]al boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;For the influence of this concept on the application of Public Interest Law see Paula O'Brien, 'Changing Public Interest Law: Overcoming the law's barriers to social change lawyering' (2011) 32 AltLJ 80. [http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/15-changing-public-interest-law-overcoming-the-laws-barriers-to-social-change-lawyering]&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal legalism has also been called legal [[constitutionalism]], such as is found in [[United States]] and [[Germany]], with political constitutionalism, which is more typical of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], by British constitutional scholar [[Adam Tomkins]]. He argues in his book ''Our Republican Constitution'' that the British system of governance, in which Parliament controls government ministers, provides a better check on executive power than a system like that of the United States, where courts and laws are used to check executive power.&lt;ref name=tws23oct77/&gt;

Loughlin argues that the aim of legal-liberalism is to "confine politics to the straight-jacket of law."&lt;ref&gt;In Defence of the Political Constitution, Tomkins, Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol 22, No 1 (2002), p162&lt;/ref&gt; Tomkins argues that courts and constitutions are a poor check on executive or legislative authority since they must wait for court decisions to bubble up from lesser courts before they can act; since this process can take years, even decades, to happen, the court is usually slow to act.&lt;ref name=tws23oct77/&gt; Tomkins prefers a parliamentary system like Britain's as being "more suitable and more effective" at restraining governments, and sees flaws in the American system of having courts check executive power.&lt;ref name=tws23oct77&gt;{{cite news

Opponents of liberal legalism often cite examples of executives ignoring or overcoming legal restrictions for political gain, such as presidents [[George W.

'''Lighthouse Center''' is a retreat center for spiritual development where [[Selfless Service]] or Seva is practiced in addition to meditation on the Sound Current (''[[Shabd]]'').  Lighthouse Center is largely synonymous with ''Manav Kendra''. 

==Description==
Manav Kendra (literally "Man-making Center") was the term coined by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]], Lighthouse Center was the term used by [[Sant Thakar Singh]] for the Manav Kendras he set up in the West. 

There are many of these centers in [[India]], and one Manav Kender in [[Mexico]]. There are four Lighthouse Centers in the United States: a {{Convert|330|acre|km2|sing=on}} parcel near [[Umpqua, Oregon]]; a much smaller center in [[Kinderhook, New York]] (also called ECC or East Coast Center), one in [[Florida]], called "The Farm", one in Poland, near the German and Czech borders (Pobiedna), one in Woodville, New Zealand and one in Korea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28065">This is a '''list of language interpreters in fiction'''. [[Language interpretation#Modes|Conference interpretation]] is often depicted in works of fiction, be it in films or in novels. [[Sydney Pollack]]’s ''[[The Interpreter]]'' and [[Javier Marias]]’ ''[[A Heart So White]]'' are amongst the most well known examples. Several books, symposia&lt;ref&gt;[http://transfiction.univie.ac.at/home/ First International Conference on Fictional Translators in Literature and Film, Vienna, September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; or websites tackle the issue at hand. Below is a list of works of fiction in which interpreters appear.

== Interpreters in films ==

=== 1956 to 1989 ===
* 1956: ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' - Directed by [[Walter Lang]]. The interpreter refuses to translate what [[Anna Leonowens]] tells the kralahome (the king’s minister); it then appears that the kralahome understands English. This scene shows that an interpreter has to fear being associated with the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049408/ ''The King and I'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1961: ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' – Directed by [[Stanley Kramer]].

* 1964: ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]'' – Directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. "There would be phalanxes of interpreters listening in, to insure against even the tiniest mistranslation... Simultaneous translation is a good dramatic device, because it avoids the distraction of subtitles or the absurdity of a Russian leader speaking fluent English".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058083/reviews ''Fail-Safe'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: ''[[Gendarme in New York]]'' (''Le Gendarme à New York'') – Directed by [[Jean Girault]]. French policemen travel to New York. The welcome speech is interpreted in several languages.

* 1970: ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' - Directed by [[Franklin J. Schaffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPNdlqrhww Excerpt from ''Patton'' on youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages channels are not linked to particular delegations and are not located in the booths either.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/ ''Live and Let Die'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973: ''[[Le Magnifique]]'' – Directed by [[Philippe de Broca]]. A dying Albanian has something important to reveal.

* 1977 to 2008: ''[[Star Wars]]'' – Directed by [[George Lucas]]. The robot [[C-3PO]] speaks 6 million galactic languages fluently. "Don’t blame me! I’m an interpreter! I’m not supposed to know the difference between a power socket and a computer terminal. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000048/quotes Quotes by C-3PO on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; EV-9D9: "How many languages do you speak?"

'''Margaret Elizabeth Egan''' (March 14, 1905 – January 26, 1959) was an American librarian and communication scholar who is best known for “Foundations of a Theory in Bibliography,” published in ''Library Quarterly'' in 1952 and co-authored with [[Jesse Shera|Jesse Hauk Shera]]. This article marked the first appearance of the term "[[social epistemology]]" in connection with library science.

==Biography==
Margaret Egan was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1905. She obtained a B.A. at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1939 and completed graduate work at both [[Yale University]] (1940–41) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1941–43). She worked at the [[Cincinnati Public Library]] from 1933 to 1940; in 1943 Egan joined the Industrial Relations Center of the [[University of Chicago]] as librarian and began teaching in the [[Graduate Library School]] (GLS). She was appointed as an assistant professor in the GLS in 1946 and was an associate editor of ''Library Quarterly'' from 1952 to 1955. She left Chicago in 1955 and joined [[Jesse Shera]] at the [[School of Library Science]] at [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where she first served as a research associate at the newly formed Center for Documentation and Communication Research. In 1956 she was appointed as an associate professor.

Egan died of a heart attack in 1959 at the age of 53.

==Social Epistemology==
[[Social epistemology]], “the production, distribution, and utilization of intellectual products” (Egan and Shera 1952), correlates the production and consumption of information to that of material goods. Shera later wrote that social [[epistemology]] “is the study of knowledge in society,” distinct from previous investigations of individual knowledge.

Furner (2004) lists the following contributions made in “Foundations of a Theory of Bibliography”:
* Establishing “informed social action” as the goal of library service.
* Establishing the extent to which librarianship contributes to attaining this goal as “the primary criterion by which [bibliographic services] may be evaluated.”
* Providing “a theoretical framework … for the study of [[information-seeking]] behavior, knowledge organization, and bibliometrics,” which is then treated as “a theoretical foundation for library and information science.”
* Using the term “[[social epistemology]]” in this context for the first time.

==Errors of Attribution==
Although Egan was the first author on “Foundations of a Theory of Bibliography,” her untimely death (and Shera’s prolific publishing that followed) have led to frequent omissions of her name when citing the work. In 1978, Shera wrote that "both the term and the concept [of social epistemology] were hers, but because I have given it wide currency, despite frequent disclaimers, it has generally been attributed to me.”&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Shera, "Egan, Margaret Elizabeth (1905–1959)", in B. S. Wynar, ed., ''Dictionary of American Library Biography'' (Littleton, Colorado: Libraries Unlimited, 1978), p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
'''''Meno''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|n|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Μένων|Μένων]]}}, ''Menōn'') is a [[Socratic dialogue]] written by [[Plato]].  It appears to attempt to determine the definition of [[virtue]], or ''[[arete (excellence)|arete]]'', meaning virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work is written in the [[Socratic method|Socratic dialectical style]] and [[Meno (general)|Meno]] is reduced to confusion or [[aporia]]. In response to Meno's paradox (or the learner's paradox), however, Socrates introduces positive ideas: the immortality of the soul, the theory of knowledge as recollection (''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]''), which Socrates demonstrates by posing a mathematical puzzle to [[Meno's slave|one of Meno's slaves]], the method of hypothesis, and, in the final lines, the distinction between knowledge and true belief.

==Characters==
Plato's ''Meno'' is a Socratic dialogue in which the two main speakers, [[Socrates]] and [[Meno (general)|Meno]] (also transliterated as Menon), discuss human virtue: whether or not it can be taught, and what it is.  Additional participants in the dialogue include [[Meno's slave|one of Meno's slaves]] and the Athenian politician [[Anytus]], a [[Trial of Socrates|prosecutor of Socrates]] with whom Meno is friendly.

Meno is visiting Athens from [[Thessaly]] with a large entourage of slaves attending him. Young, good-looking and well-born, Meno is a student of [[Gorgias]], a prominent [[sophist]] whose views on virtue clearly influence Meno's. He claims early in the dialogue that he has held forth many times on the subject of virtue, and in front of large audiences.

One feature of the dialogue is Socrates' use of one of Meno's [[Slavery in antiquity|slaves]] to demonstrate his idea of ''[[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', that certain knowledge is innate and "recollected" by the soul through proper inquiry.

==Dialogue==
===Introduction of virtue===
The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates to tell him if virtue can be taught.  Socrates says that he does not know what virtue is, and neither does anyone else he knows.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 71b&lt;/ref&gt; Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, virtue is different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm.  Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men—free or slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 71e&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings.

Socrates rejects the idea that human virtue depends on a person's sex or age. He leads Meno towards the idea that virtues are common to all people, that temperance (''sophrosunê''- exercising self-control) and justice (''dikê, dikaiosunê''- refraining from harming other people) are virtues even in children and old men.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 73b&lt;/ref&gt; Meno proposes to Socrates that the "capacity to govern men" may be a virtue common to all people. Socrates points out to the slaveholder that "governing well" cannot be a virtue of a slave, because then he would not be a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 73c–d&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the errors that Socrates points out is that Meno lists many particular virtues without defining a common feature inherent to virtues which makes them thus. Socrates remarks that Meno makes many out of one, like somebody who breaks a plate.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 77a&lt;/ref&gt;

Meno proposes that virtue is the desire for good things and the power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not recognize evil.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 77d–e&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact that so many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 78b&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.

No satisfactory definition of virtue emerges in the ''Meno''. Socrates' comments, however, show that he considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.&lt;ref name=jmd&gt;Jane Mary Day. ''Plato's Meno in Focus''. Routledge, 1994, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-415-00297-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meno's paradox&lt;!--'Meno's paradox' redirects here--&gt;===
Meno asks Socrates: "And how will you inquire into a thing when you are wholly ignorant of what it is? Even if you happen to bump right into it, how will you know it is the thing you didn't know?"&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 80d1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the canonical statement of the paradox: "[A] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not know[.] He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, there is no need to search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to look for."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 80e, Grube translation&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with Meno's slave===
[[File:Meno (Socrates) drawing 29.gif|thumb|The blue square is twice the area of the original yellow square]]
Socrates responds to this [[sophism|sophistical]] paradox with a ''mythos'' (poetic story) according to which souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body.  Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we have only to 'recollect' them when alive.  Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching.  Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry.

Socrates begins one of the most influential dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for [[Innatism|inborn knowledge]]. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with two-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (four feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be three feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss.

Socrates claims that before he got hold of him the slave (who has been picked at random from Meno's entourage) might have thought he could speak "well and fluently" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84c&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates comments that this "numbing" he caused in the slave has done him no harm and has even benefited him.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 84b&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates then draws a second square figure using the diagonal of the original square. Each diagonal cuts each two foot square in half, yielding an area of two square feet. The square composed of four of the eight interior triangular areas is eight square feet, double that of the original area. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has "spontaneously recovered" knowledge he knew from a past life&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 85d&lt;/ref&gt; without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were "newly aroused" in the slave.

After witnessing the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates that he thinks that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates replies, “I think I am. I shouldn’t like to take my oath on the whole story, but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can, in word and act—that is, that we shall be better, braver, and more active men if we believe it right to look for what we don’t know...”&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'', 86b&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Anytus===
Meno now beseeches Socrates to return to the original question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, whether or not it is acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none.

Coincidentally [[Anytus]] appears, whom Socrates praises as the son of [[Anthemion]], who earned his fortune with intelligence and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as [[Themistocles]], [[Aristides]], [[Pericles]] and [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]], and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of [[slander]], warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his [[Trial of Socrates|trial]].) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.

===True belief and knowledge===
After the discussion with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for his own thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that they have made a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between "true belief" and "knowledge". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to "stay in their place" and must be "tethered" by what he calls ''aitias logismos'' (the calculation of reason, or reasoned explanation), immediately adding that this is ''anamnesis'', or recollection.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Vlastos, ''Studies in Greek Philosophy: Socrates, Plato, and their tradition, Volume 2'', Princeton University Press, 1996, p 155. {{ISBN|0-691-01938-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not Plato intends that the tethering of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must ''always'' involve ''anamnesis'' is explored in later interpretations of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Inquiry in the ''Meno''", in Richard Kraut, ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, p 221. {{ISBN|0-521-43610-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Kahn, "Plato on Recollection", in Hugh H. Benson, ''A Companion to Plato, Volume 37'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2006, p 122. {{ISBN|1-4051-1521-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates' distinction between "true belief" and "knowledge" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]". [[Myles Burnyeat]] and others, however, have argued that the phrase ''aitias logismos'' refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Knowledge and True Belief in the ''Meno''", in [[David Sedley]], ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy: Volume XXVII: Winter 2004'', Oxford University Press, 2004, pp 61–62. {{ISBN|0-19-927712-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous people of the present and the past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine inspiration, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, 'What is virtue?'.  In most modern readings these closing remarks are "evidently ironic",&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Waterfield]] in Plato, ''Oxford World Classics: ''Meno'' and Other Dialogues'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pxliv. {{ISBN|0-19-280425-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Socrates' invocation of the gods may be sincere, albeit "highly tentative".&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Scott, ''Plato's'' Meno, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p 193. {{ISBN|0-521-64033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meno and Protagoras==
''Meno'''s theme is also dealt with in the dialogue ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', where Plato ultimately has Socrates arrive at  the opposite conclusion, that virtue ''can'' be taught. And, whereas in ''Protagoras'' knowledge is uncompromisingly this-worldly, in  ''Meno'' the theory of recollection points to a link between knowledge and eternal truths.&lt;ref name=jmd /&gt;

'''Nambassa''' was a series of [[hippie]]-conceived festivals held between 1976 and 1981 on large farms around [[Waihi]] and [[Waikino]] in New Zealand. They were music, arts and alternatives festivals that focused on [[peace]], love, and an [[environmentally friendly]] lifestyle. In addition to popular entertainment, they featured [[workshop]]s and displays advocating [[holistic health]] issues, [[alternative medicine]], clean and [[sustainable energy]], and [[Organic food|unadulterated foods]].

The New Zealand [[History of the hippie movement|hippie]] movement was part of an international phenomenon in the 1960s and 1970s, heralding a new artistic culture of music, [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] and [[social revolution]] where millions of young people across the globe were reacting against old world antecedents and embracing a new [[hippie]] ethos. Specifically New Zealand's [[subculture]] had its foundations in the peace and anti-nuclear activism of the 1960s where hippies were actively trying to stop New Zealand's involvement in the [[Opposition to the US involvement in the Vietnam War|Vietnam war]] and to prevent the French from testing [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|nuclear weapons]] at [[Mururoa]] atoll in [[French Polynesia]] in the [[Pacific Islands]].

The January 1979 three-day music and alternatives festival, held over [[Auckland]] anniversary weekend, attracted over 75,000 patrons making it the largest arts, multiple cultural and popular music event of its type in the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979. {{ISBN|0-589-01216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nambassa is also the tribal name of a [[charitable trust]] that has championed sustainable ideas and demonstrated practical [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] ideals, a [[spirituality|spiritually]] based [[alternative lifestyle]], environmentalism and [[List of Green party issues|green issues]] from the early 1970s to the present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Attendance 15,000 – well down on the 1979 festival. Reacting against the huge 1979 event which was deemed by many of the counterculture movement too large and not reflective of the alternative message, the organizers purposely ran this festival on the same weekend as a major commercial rock concert. While this event lost money, it dramatically changed its character away from rock music towards hippie and New Age culture.&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa Newsletter "Waves (1980–1981)" Volume 1 &amp; 2.

==Arts, self-sufficiency and healing arts workshops==
[[File:1981 Pottery in the Village Market.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pottery making in Nambassa]]
The notion for education-based workshops and displays developed out of a philosophical view; that the world was heading towards difficult times and that people needed to learn how to become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs. If one was unable to access healthy food then the logical solution was to learn how to grow one's food. Nambassa was actively promoting widespread [[Counterculture]], [[Sustainable living]], [[Holistic health]] and environmentalism, 30 years before [[Green politics]] was integrated into mainstream popular culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

The following extracts are taken from the first 1976 "Nambassa Sun" newsletter proposal, in support of their [[Survivalism|survivalist]] [[workshops]] on [[self sufficiency]] and to heal the body and the mind.

{{quote|There can be no doubt we are living in confusing times. The social pressures alone are enough to start one thinking about living an alternative lifestyle. Already many people are leaving the cities to live on the land, simply because they can no longer afford the costs of urban life.

Let us take a look at city life, the frantic rush and bustle on the streets, all that traffic and factories with all their pollution, noise and waste, and cynical exploitation by big business. And where are you? In the midst of the frenzied grime, paying high rent or struggling to cope with mortgage payments. Food and heating costs have rocketed, and we know they can only go up. You are working as many hours as you can to pay for city life, with little time for leisure, even less time to get to know your children, or to spend a few days with friends. Altogether it's a vicious circle, a struggle for survival, with no time to think and be oneself. No wonder that crime is on the increase and mental institutions are overcrowded. If you haven't fallen victim to one of these social ills, then you could be facing a coronary in your efforts to maintain the pace.

We are using up our natural resources at an ever increasing rate and they are not going to last for ever. In fact we are abusing our planet woefully. Mother earth will not tolerate this continued rape, and is groaning under the burden of unenlightened man. Consider this and ask yourself, "Is this a natural way of life, is this how we were meant to live?" In all truth we have entered a depression, and are fast reaching a stage, not only of economic collapse, but a point where our very survival is threatened. Now, more than ever before, there is a need and a growing desire for people to learn to live outside the collapsing economic and social system, with its greed and avarice, and it's denial of individuality.|1976 Peter Terry.&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa Newsletter (1976–1977)Volume 1, Issue 1.Referenced: National Library of New Zealand, Te Puna Matauranga O Aotearoa, Alexander Turnbull Library collections.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Nambassa festivals were not only music and entertainment events but included educational components which sought to instruct people on lifestyle aids it felt important enough to promote within the then conservative society of New Zealand's 1970s. Many of those involved in Nambassa aspired to the notion that throughout the evolution of western [[civilisation]], many valuable [[ancient]] survival, [[Traditional healer|healing]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] techniques, had been lost over 1700 years of a philosophically and culturally dominating [[Catholic Church|Roman Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Dark Side of Christian History |date= 1 July 1995 |publisher= Morningstar Books |via= Amazon.com |asin= 0964487349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nambassa advocates that many past civilisations supporting religious and political institutions, have historically sought to alienate, and too often violently eliminate, many worthwhile belief systems which did not conform to its then strict conservative [[doctrines]] on culture and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages Volume 1 |date=1 December 2005 |publisher=Cosimo Classics |via= Amazon.com |asin= 1596056193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Nambassa promote the ideology which suggests that, to deny what was once integral to survival in [[ancient history]], is essentially to deny one's personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] development. Through its wide variety of workshop subjects, the festivals attempted to nurture a better understanding of culture and [[spirituality]] with the goal of fostering a more tolerant and better informed society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com:80/photos/15433257@N00/378831722/?edited=1|title=flickr.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220064247/https://www.flickr.com/photos/15433257@N00/378831722/?edited=1|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A workshop at Nambassa 1978.jpg|right|thumb|A health workshop at Nambassa 1978]]
The idea of integrating education based [[workshop]] demonstrations with popular mainstream entertainment, set the Nambassa festivals aside from other festivals coming before it. It was during the [[social revolution]] of the early 1960s and 1970s&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx|title=ABC-CLIO/Greenwood – Reference – Home|last=ABC-CLIO|website=''greenwood.com''|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709181001/http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx|archivedate=9 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Nambassa pioneered the concept, and was a world leader, in what was to evolve as a new format of presentation for the all encompassing major cultural, creative arts and [[music festivals]]. Most large open-air entertainment gatherings, prior to Nambassa, were essentially pop concerts. This new format demonstrated the merits of combining, in a complementary way, multiple and diverse entertainment and cultural modules, within the one grand celebratory event. During the 1970s, the Nambassa Trust developed this concept of large scale multidimensional events, which the rest of the world only began adopting some 20 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com:80/photos/15433257@N00/378831722/?edited=1|title=Nambassa book online poster sur Flickr: partage de photos !|website=''flickr.com''|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220064247/https://www.flickr.com/photos/15433257@N00/378831722/?edited=1|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest complaint against the festival organisers from festival patrons, was that there were never enough hours in the day to attend their desired programme.

At all festivals there was a smorgasbord of spiritual and religious learning. Here the public could venture to various Healing Arts areas and attend either a bible study course, or chant spiritual names with the Buddhists and Hare Krishna's, or sing and pray with Christians, or attend Sunday mass with the Catholics or learn how to meditate with Ananda Marga or find out the meaning of Karma from the Hindus. The policy of the Nambassa Trust was to attempt to create an ambiance which would dispel all religious factionalism, so that philosophical labels could dissipate enabling people of all religious persuasion to share in their most common fundamental of traits, their humanity. In maintaining Nambassa's nonsectarian and open door policy on [[religious philosophy]], workshops were conducted on: [[Hinduism]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]], Bible scholarship and [[Born again Christianity|born again]] Christianity, [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Judaism]], [[Ananda Marga]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Islam]], Krishna-[[Hari]]bol, [[Sufism]], [[Esoteric Christianity]], [[shamanism]], [[Wicca]], and [[Zen]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Village market==
[[Image:Nambassa1981 the Village.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Nambassa 1981 Village [[Marketplace]].]] 
At the centre of all Nambassa festivals lay the village [[marketplace]]s. These consisted of dozens of hand craft outlets and [[health food]] eateries. Here the hustle and bustle, the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of [[bartering]] for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, as a method of doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as civilisation itself.

The 1981 festival village was designed around a central rotunda with a [[maypole]], where spontaneously, poets, [[busking|buskers]] and ravers alike featured. Nambassa vigorously promoted handcrafts, not only because of their therapeutic qualities, but because they had the potential to be a source of revenue to lifestyle proponents looking towards self-sufficiency and economic independence. From the festival village one could attend any number of craft [[workshops]], pick up a copy of the daily Nambassa Waves newspaper, go buy fresh bread cooked in the [[wood-fired oven]] bakery constructed in a converted hay shed, go do some shopping, check out Radio Nambassaland, pick up some information from the mother centre, or just simply chill out and absorb the atmosphere.

January 1977 heralded the [[Waikino music festival]], a prelude to Nambassa, which experimented with the concept of amalgamating into a singular festive event, controversial alternative culture with popular music. By February 1977 Lorraine Ward and Bernard Woods in an old restored farmhouse atop of rural Bulltown Rd in [[Waihi]], assisted Terry to edit a blueprint for the Nambassa Trust and the first festival. The first Nambassa [[newsletter]] proposal was printed, ten thousand copies of a free 13-page manuscript outlining the model and need for a Nambassa event, were circulated among the music, arts and alternative communities throughout the nation, inviting the wider community to participate. The first Mother Centre was opened on a farm in Willow Road at [[Waihi]] early November 1977, where the initial Nambassa support base and volunteers assembled to construct the festival facilities to accommodate a small city for the planned three-day music, [[crafts]] and [[alternative lifestyle]] event which was to be held at the end of January 1978 on two farms at the end of Landlyst Waihi.

The Nambassa administration involved hundreds, to the extent that the 1981 five-day celebration gave out 1500 complimentary tickets to people and groups involved in the event in some official capacity. Those mainly responsible were: Peter Terry (Nambassa trustee, founder and events coordinator 1976–2005), Lorraine Ward (Nambassa secretary and trustee 1977–2005), Neil Wernham (art and graphics 1977–1981), Doug Rogers (music and staging technical adviser, 1976–1979), Fred Alder (Nambassa sun coordinator 1979, 1978 construction team, and former trustee 1978 and 1979), Bryce Lelievre (1981 festival secretary), Mike Taylor (communications and site coordinator 1978 and 1979), Jonathon Acorn (1981 Woozlebub coordinator), Trevor Kotlowski (1981 goffa), Mike Colonna (children's facility coordinator 1978 and 1979), Colin Broadley (programing, Nambassa book coordinator and open-air theatre 1979–1981) and Barry Lowther, (Mother Centre father, 1978 and 1979).

The organising of the festivals and supporting events were themselves practical workshops in every sense. The Nambassa spectacles were organised on a purely voluntary basis by energetic and visionary young unemployed hippies (at a time when New Zealand's unemployment rate was at an unprecedented high), coordinated into a cohesive working force by Terry. Three months out of each festival its supporters would assemble at a farm community called the "Mother Centre", living in house trucks, vans, cars and tents. Nambassa's open door policy encouraged anyone of whatever race, creed or economic circumstance to join in, providing one met the basic rules of the Mother Centre camp. The guidelines were no alcohol or hard drugs, and vegetarian diet was supplied by the Trust. Participants were required to work each day towards the collective goal of preparing the festival in time for opening day. In exchange they were fed and had immediate needs catered for. Over the years thousands of people, young and old, carved out permanent careers from the inspiration learnt, just from being involved with or going to a Nambassa event.

Nambassa is administered not by private enterprise but through a registered [[charitable trust]] whose articles list provisions and aims allowing it to organise public events to raise funds to meet objectives. Consequently, the organisation is nurtured by and for the people, as opposed to being driven by [[corporation|corporate]] interests looking to maximise profit. This effectively enabled the events organisers to set minimal entry fees, based upon projected profits, so that festivals were affordable to lower income people. For example, the 1979 festival entrance was $18 (pre-paid) for a three-day adult pass. The [[trustees]] have several times declined offers of corporate sponsorship because the products offered have not met the Trust's philosophical aims and objects. In the 1970s the Nambassa Trust donated $29,698 to other organisations which meet its criteria. All Nambassa events made a profit with the exception of Celebration 1981.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Sound and lighting==
[[Image:Limbs on redhat T.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1981 'Limbs Dance' on Redhat.]]
Nambassa significantly expanded the concept of multiple open air staging, all running simultaneously at the one event. Out of the first 1978 three-day festival, the requirement of a second stage grew from the need to expand the entertainment program because of the resounding feedback from local performers and artists wanting to play at Nambassa. This became the "Aerial Railway", a second fully operational stage with sound, lighting and management. Aerial Railway absorbed the overflow of performers from the Main Stage, and also acted as a venue for spontaneous performances or raves. This second option was integral to the Nambassa philosophy of promoting local music and arts. Although the [[Miami Pop Festival (December 1968)|Miami Pop Festival]] in December 1968 featured two simultaneous 'main' stages, most of the early U.S. and European [[rock festivals]], including [[Woodstock festival]], [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and [[Isle of Wight Festival]] were predominantly single stage productions. The Nambassa 1978 festival had three stages; 1979 saw this expanded to four (including workshop stages), and the 1981 5-day celebration heralded five separate sound and lighting venues, all running at the same time. In 1981, "Aerial Railway" was replaced with the "Open Air Theatre" and "Woozlebub" for children. The multiple staging concepts seem to be finally making a comeback in the 21st century as seen at the recent [[Big Day Out]] and [[Glastonbury festival]]s.

The 1981 Nambassa 5-day event introduced "Radio Nambassaland". This broadcast live feeds from all the 5 stages and workshops, into the surrounding community.

==Interesting occurrences from the Nambassa festivals==
* On a per-capita basis, the 1979 Nambassa festival was over 10 times bigger than the famous 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]]. [[Swami Satchidananda]], who also opened Woodstock ten years previously said, "This is better than Woodstock- you've got it made, lead the world".&lt;ref&gt;''Nambassa: A New Direction'', edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, [[A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed]], 1979.{{ISBN|0-589-01216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As Nambassa sought to demonstrate the practical ideals of alternative lifestyle, alcohol and meat could not be purchased at any Nambassa event. However, festival patrons were welcome to bring their own if they so desired.
* On the Friday night before the 1979 festival was officially opened, the festival [[File:People pix in the village.jpg|thumb|235px|right|1981 Nambassa Village Market]] attendance had already reached its maximum capacity. At 3&amp;nbsp;am Saturday morning Peter was on the phone negotiating paddocks from neighbouring farms, while Fred, Mike and Bernie were out in the dead of night with bolt cutters, removing fences to allow cars and campers into newly acquired festival acreage. By 11&amp;nbsp;am Saturday morning on opening day, the traffic police closed the festival, and were telling people to go home, announcing on radio that the event could accommodate no more patrons. They ordered the organizers to remove the entry gates to free the roads, as vehicles and pedestrians were banked up in all directions for some 20 kilometres. But still they arrived. Some 5 kilometres towards Waihi a tent city spontaneously arose on a neighbouring farm where approximately 15,000 people parked and then walked the final leg into the festival site. Others abandoned their vehicles in Waihi itself and made the [[pilgrimage]] to Nambassa on foot.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Nambassa Festival, a two-hour musical film documentary which had five crews working on it, New Zealand, 1980 [http://events.filmarchive.org.nz/event.php?eventInstanceID=607&amp;eventID=143 The New Zealand Film Archive / Ngā Kaitiaki O Ngā Taonga Whitiāhua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409092304/http://events.filmarchive.org.nz/event.php?eventInstanceID=607&amp;eventID=143 |date=9 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nudity]] was a factor at all Nambassa festivals. In an atmosphere of openness and compelling [[spirituality|spiritual]] flow, a sense of personal freedom and discovery prevailed and this led to a considerable amount of nudity in the most innocent sense. Thousands of people simply got naked and wandered the festivals with little or no clothing.
* Due to post 1978 festival intimidation by the media concerning the public smoking of [[marijuana]] at Nambassa, and whether the police were going to act on it in 1979, 58 people were arrested for [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on the first day of Nambassa 1979. As a response, tens of thousands of festival goers marched up the hill of the main [[auditorium]] to the police compound, threatening to storm it if the arrests did not cease. Festival organiser Peter Terry arranged a meeting with the police principals and advised them that they had made their point. He told the police that they themselves had become the focus of disruption, threatening the peaceful outcome of the event. He advised the police that if the arrests continued then he too would join the [[civil disobedience]] campaign to have them removed from the festival site. The police discontinued their arrest policy. Peter Terry was advised that the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] had been placed on standby as a precaution to any further protest directed at the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* Just a month out of the 1981 5-day celebration at Waitawheta Valley, the Ohinemuri Council sought, and were granted, a legal [[injunction]] which effectively cancelled the festival. This resulted from objections to the event from local Waitawheta [[farmers]]. Once the [[red tape]] and [[bureaucracy]] was negotiated to everyone's satisfaction, the injunction was lifted.[[File:1981 Nambassa Festival at Waitawheta Valley near Waikino.jpg|right|130px|thumb|1981 Nambassa Festival at Waitawheta Valley near [[Waikino]]]]
* The 1978 campaign to bring [[Split Enz]] home from England to play Nambassa 1979, was initially fraught with all kinds of complications. No one, including [[Michael Gudinski]] and his [[Mushroom Records]] label, (Split Enz record company), would back the venture because the band had not fared overly well in the UK and had undergone significant member changes. After talks between Nambassa and Mushroom, (Peter Terry flew to Melbourne in an attempt to negotiate a deal), Michael Gudinski declined to assist financially with the proposed Nambassa venture. He said Mushroom had already lost considerable money on the band's UK adventure and was not in a position to invest further in their future. Gudinski, who Nambassa had dealt with the previous year with Skyhooks, instead offered a compromise without Split Enz, involving top Australian bands eager to play Nambassa. This was rejected by Nambassa organizers. The Trust wanted Split Enz, who they considered to be integral to the NZ music scene, or nothing. Nambassa eventually decided to negotiate directly with the band itself and ultimately financed the band's return. Split Enz performed for free at Nambassa 1979, forgoing their appearance fee so that they could return to New Zealand. In an eleventh hour deal Mushroom agreed to take the band from Nambassa and tour Australia, after which Mushroom Records subsequently released their hit single "[[I See Red (Split Enz song)|I See Red]]" to coincide with their Nambassa appearance. When Split Enz played at 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm on Saturday night on 28 January 1979, their professional performance was widely regarded as having heralded a new and unprecedented era for the new band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/enzology | title=Enzology – Radio New Zealand's story of Split Enz | work=[[Radio New Zealand National]]| publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]  | accessdate=8 November 2016 | author=Jeremy Ansell | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415232949/http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/enzology | archivedate=15 April 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the huge volume of people who attended the Nambassa 3-day festival in 1979, the organizers were unable to get an accurate census of attendees, but have given estimates of 75,000 people. Some segments of the media, including [[Television New Zealand]] who were regularly flying over the festival, were quoting estimates as high as 150,000 people. This event became a free concert, because the police, unable to control the large volume of traffic which had closed all roads in a 20 kilometre radius, officially closed the event down mid-morning of the first day.

==The Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana==
{{main| Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana}}

[[File:Space Angels in the Return of the Ancients, 1978 Nambassa Winter Show.jpg|right|thumb|Space Angels in the 'Return of the Ancients', 1978 Nambassa Winter Show.]]
The '''Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana''' was a [[Musical theatre|musical theatrical]] production of 60 entertainers and crew who toured the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]] in a convoy of [[New age travellers|Mobile homes]], buses and vans, performing at major centres and theatres throughout September and October 1978. While initially 4 main shows were scheduled for this collective theatre company, repeat and spontaneous performances around the nation saw this number of live performances increased to over 10. This theatrical extravaganza was organised by the Nambassa Trust as part of its national promotion of the arts and towards promoting its 1979 3-day music, crafts and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Alternative lifestyle]] festival which was held in [[Waihi]] attracting 70,000 people.

==New Zealand's Housetruckers of the 1970s==
{{main|New Zealand's Housetruckers of the 1970s }}

Housetruckers are individuals, families and groups who convert old trucks and [[school buses]] into mobile-homes and live in them, preferring an unattached and transient [[Romani people|gypsy]] lifestyle to more conventional housing. These unique vehicles began appearing around New Zealand during the mid-1970s and even though there are fewer today they continue to adorn NZ roads.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Karafyllis''' (born 22 April 1970 in [[Lüdinghausen]], [[West Germany]]), is a German-Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[biology|biologist]]. Since 2010, she is Department Chair and Philosophy Professor at the [[TU Braunschweig]], Braunschweig/Brunswick Institute of Technology (Germany).

== Biography ==

Nicole Christine Karafyllis was born in Germany as the child of a German mother and a Greek father. From 1989 to 1994, she studied biology and philosophy at the Universities of [[Erlangen]] and [[Tübingen]]. In 1991, she was a visiting student at the University of Stirling in Scotland (UK). She received a [[doctorate]] at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1999 at the [http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/en/facilities/international-centre-for-ethics-in-the-sciences-and-humanities.html International Center for Ethics in the Sciences and Humanities]. Her [[Habilitation]] in [[philosophy]] was completed at the University of [[Stuttgart]] in 2006, dealing with the topic ''Phenomenology of Growth. Philosophy and scientific History of productive Life between Nature and Technology''.
For ten years, 1998–2008, she has been working at the [[Goethe University]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany and was a scholar of [[Günter Ropohl]]. In 2007 she has been a Visiting Professor for Applied Philosophy of Science at Vienna University ([[Austria]]). 2008 - 2010, she moved to the [[United Arab Emirates]] and was Full Professor of Philosophy at the [[United Arab Emirates University]] (UAEU). In fall 2010 she was senior research fellow of the International Centre for Cultural Studies (IFK) in Vienna (Austria).&lt;ref&gt;See the website of the IFK at http://www.ifk.ac.at&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Germany in summer 2010 to become Department Chair of the Philosophy Department at [[Technische Universität Braunschweig]].
Since 2013, she regularly visits the philosophy department (arts+science-group)&lt;ref&gt;See the webpage of the Arts+Science group at [[UNAM]] http://www.artemasciencia.com/news.html&lt;/ref&gt; at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México ([[UNAM]]) in [[Mexico City]] for research purposes (projects on Spanisch-German philosophy in the early 20th century and beyond).

Her 2013 book entitled "Cleaning as Passion" (German orig. ''Putzen als Passion'') became a philosophy bestseller in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the interview in Germany's daily newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', March 2014, on the webpage of the journalist Anne Haeming http://www.annehaeming.de/interviews/interview-mit-nicole-karafyllis-fas/&lt;/ref&gt; It is both an introduction into philosophical problems and an ironic version of a self-help book on cleaning and related techniques. In addition, a calendar for 2015 is produced, including 52 postcards with philosophical sentences about cleaning (entitled: ''Putzen ist nichts für Feiglinge'' / ''Cleaning is not for cowards'').

== Philosophy ==

Karafyllis is engaged in a cultural philosophy of science and technology, making use of a history of ideas perspective without compromising the idea of manual and [[material culture]]. She is particularly known for her philosophical works on the modeling interfaces between biology and technology (the concept of [[Biofact (philosophy)|biofact]]), and for her union of phenomenology and [[philosophy of technology]]. She also works on the "spirit of craftsmanship".&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Richard]] Sennett, ''The Craftsman'', 2008; [[Hans Blumenberg]]: ''Geistesgeschichte der Technik''. Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2009 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;
Her philosophical fields of work are [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[anthropology]], [[bioethics]], [[philosophy of technology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[history of science]], [[technology assessment]], in which she develops a theory of [[biofacticity]]. She introduced the term [[Biofact (philosophy)|biofact]] in [[philosophy]] in 2001, to stress the shifting borders between the concepts of [[nature]], [[biology]] and [[technology]]. Other main topics of her work are the philosophy of [[plants]], situated in a phenomenology of [[wiktionary:growth|growth]], and the philosophy of [[emotions]] in light of the neurosciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9785">'''Non-classical logics''' (and sometimes '''alternative logics''') are [[formal system]]s that differ in a significant way from [[Classical logic|standard logical systems]] such as [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[Predicate logic|predicate]] logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of [[logical consequence]] and [[logical truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''Logic for philosophy'', [[Theodore Sider]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophical logic]] is understood to encompass and focus on non-classical logics, although the term has other meanings as well.&lt;ref name="Burgess2009i"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John P. Burgess]]|title=Philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k32w3_wjBoYC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13789-6|pages=vii-viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some parts of [[theoretical computer science]] can be thought of as using non-classical reasoning, although this varies according to the subject area. For example, the basic [[boolean algebra|boolean]] functions (e.g. [[Logical conjunction|AND]], [[Logical disjunction|OR]], [[Negation|NOT]], etc) in [[computer science]] are very much [[Classical logic|classical]] in nature, as is clearly the case given the fact that they can be fully described by classical [[Truth table|truth tables]]. However, in contrast, some [[Automated theorem proving|computerized proof methods]] may not use classical logic in the reasoning process.

== Examples of non-classical logics ==
&lt;!--When editing this section, please also update the matching section in the Non-classical logic article--&gt;
There are many kinds of non-classical logic, which include:
* [[Computability logic]] is a semantically constructed formal theory of computability—as opposed to classical logic, which is a formal theory of truth—integrates and extends classical, linear and intuitionistic logics.
*[[Many-valued logic]] rejects bivalence, allowing for [[truth value]]s other than true and false. The most popular forms are [[three-valued logic]], as initially developed by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], and infinitely-valued logics such as [[fuzzy logic]], which permits any real number between 0 and 1 as a truth value.
*[[Intuitionistic logic]] rejects the [[law of the excluded middle]], [[double negation elimination]], and part of [[De Morgan's laws]];

* [[Linear logic]] rejects [[idempotency]] of [[Logical consequence|entailment]] as well;
* [[Modal logic]] extends classical logic with [[Truth function|non-truth-functional]] ("modal") operators.
*[[Paraconsistent logic]] (e.g., [[relevance logic]]) rejects the [[principle of explosion]], and has a close relation to [[dialetheism]];

* [[Quantum logic]]
* [[Relevance logic]], [[linear logic]], and [[non-monotonic logic]] reject monotonicity of entailment;
*[[Reflexive relation|Non-reflexive]] logic (also known as "Schrödinger logics") rejects or restricts the [[law of identity]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Schrödinger logics|first=Newton|last=da Costa|publisher=Studia Logica|year=1994|page=533|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01057649}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of non-classical logics according to specific authors ==
In ''Deviant Logic'' (1974) [[Susan Haack]] divided non-classical logics into [[Deviant logic|deviant]], quasi-deviant, and extended logics.&lt;ref name="Haack1974"&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Deviant logic: some philosophical issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1974|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-20500-9|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed classification is non-exclusive; a logic may be both a deviation and an extension of classical logic.&lt;ref name="Haack1978"&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Philosophy of logics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0GsZ8SBQrUcC&amp;pg=PA204|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29329-7|pages=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few other authors have adopted the main distinction between deviation and extension in non-classical logics.&lt;ref name="Gamut1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[L. T. F. Gamut]]|title=Logic, language, and meaning, Volume 1: Introduction to Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0KhywkpolMC&amp;pg=PA156|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28085-1|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Akama1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Seiki Akama|title=Logic, language, and computation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyksEA5i-1QC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4376-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanna2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Hanna|title=Rationality and logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ka9BhOL1ev8C&amp;pg=PA40|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08349-2|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John P. Burgess]] uses a similar classification but calls the two main classes anti-classical and extra-classical.&lt;ref name="Burgess2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Burgess|title=Philosophical logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k32w3_wjBoYC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13789-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some systems of classification for non-classical logic have been proposed, such as those of Haack and Burgess as described above for example, many people who study non-classical logic ignore these classification systems. As such, none of the classification systems in this section should be treated as standard.

In an ''extension'', new and different [[logical constant]]s are added, for instance the "&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;" in [[modal logic]], which stands for "necessarily."&lt;ref name="Gamut1991"/&gt; In extensions of a logic,

* the set of [[well-formed formula]]s generated is a [[proper superset]] of the set of well-formed formulas generated by [[classical logic]].
* the set of [[theorem]]s generated is a proper superset of the set of theorems generated by classical logic, but only in that the novel theorems generated by the extended logic are only a result of novel well-formed formulas.

(See also [[Conservative extension]].)

In a ''deviation'', the usual logical constants are used, but are given a different meaning than usual. Only a subset of the theorems from the classical logic hold. A typical example is intuitionistic logic, where the [[law of excluded middle]] does not hold.&lt;ref name="Hanna2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess2009"/&gt;

Additionally, one can identify a ''variations'' (or ''variants''), where the content of the system remains the same, while the notation may change substantially. For instance [[many-sorted logic|many-sorted]] predicate logic is considered a just variation of predicate logic.&lt;ref name="Gamut1991"/&gt;

This classification ignores however semantic equivalences. For instance, [[Gödel]] showed that all theorems from intuitionistic logic have an equivalent theorem in the classical modal logic S4. The result has been generalized to [[superintuitionistic logic]]s and extensions of S4.&lt;ref name="GabbayMaksimova2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=Larisa Maksimova|author2-link= Larisa Maksimova |title=Interpolation and definability: modal and intuitionistic logics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v6sDNSaW5wAC&amp;pg=PA61|year=2005|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-851174-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[abstract algebraic logic]] has also provided means to classify logics, with most results having been obtained for propositional logics. The current algebraic hierarchy of propositional logics has five levels, defined in terms of properties of their [[Leibniz operator]]: [[protoalgebraic]], (finitely) [[equivalential]], and (finitely) [[algebraizable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=M. Hazewinkel|title=Encyclopaedia of mathematics: Supplement Volume III|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-0198-3|chapter=Abstract algebraic logic|author=D.

'''Paul-Louis Landsberg''' (3 December 1901 – 2 April 1944) was a twentieth century [[Existentialist]] [[philosopher]] who is known for his arguments in support of [[euthanasia]] as an acceptable method of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agora.qc.ca/thematiques/mort/dossiers/landsberg_paul_louis |title=Encyclopédie sur la mort &amp;#124; Landsberg Paul Louis |website=Agora.qc.ca |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments are used today by [[Christian]] proponents of euthanasia. His best known works are ''The Experience of Death'' and ''The Moral Problem of Suicide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmi.50webs.com/ed.html |title=Living Time® Media Int'l: World Thought: Title Information: 'The Experience of Death' by Paul Louis Landsberg |website=Ltmi.50webs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsberg lectured at the Universities of [[Bonn]], [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]], among others. He was a pupil of [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Scheler]], continuing their work in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] to tackle several vital subjects, including [[personal identity]], [[death]] and [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;'Introduction' by M.Kerr to 'The Experience of Death' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of the Christian Existentialist [[Emmanuel Mounier]] and a key contributor to the philosophical journal [[Esprit (magazine)|''Esprit'']] (1913-2013).&lt;ref name="presse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esprit.presse.fr/whoarewe/author/detail.php?author=LANDSBERG%20Paul-Louis |title=Revue ESPRIT |website=Esprit.presse.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsberg was hounded by the [[Gestapo]] for most of his life, both because of his [[Jewish]] family background and due to his expression of [[Anti-Nazi]] sentiments. He was captured by the Gestapo and deported to Oranienburg [[Concentration Camp]] towards the end of the war and died there of physical and mental exhaustion in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmi.50webs.com/edxinf.html |title=Living Time® Media Int'l: World Thought: Extra Information: 'The Experience of Death' by Paul Louis Landsberg |website=Ltmi.50webs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Paul-Louis Landsberg was born in 1901 at [[Bonn]] into a large, wealthy [[Jewish]] family, the son of the prominent German Jurist [[Ernst Landsberg]] and his wife Anna. His parents had him baptized as a [[Protestant]] but later on he turned towards [[Catholicism]] and allied himself with the benedictine liturgical movement centered around [[Maria Laach]]. He was a pupil of the phenomenological philosophers [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]] (in [[Freiburg]])and [[Max Scheler]]. Though he studied with the latter-most in [[Cologne]], he moved back to his birth-town to become [[Professor]] of Philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]].

However, due to his opposition to [[Nazism]], he fled [[Germany]] just before the coming to power of [[Hitler]] in 1933. By the beginning of March 1933, he had emigrated to [[Spain]] and began teaching [[Philosophy]] there.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (8 Vols.), sub-entry on Landsberg (ed. Paul Edwards)&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he was studying the [[Mysticism|Mystics]] of the 16th century. Between 1934 and 1936 he held positions at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] and the [[University of Barcelona]], where his thought began to exert a great influence over his pupils, and where it is still studied avidly to this day.&lt;ref&gt;'The History of Philosophy' (1941) by Julian Marias - Chapter on 20th Century Existentialists&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris and ''Esprit''==
With the coming of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] in Spain, Landsberg transferred to [[Paris]] where he began giving courses at the [[University of the Sorbonne]] on the [[Meaning of life|Meaning of Existence]]. It was at this time that he also became deeply involved with the journal [[Esprit (magazine)|''Esprit'']] (1913-2013) through which channel his thought gradually became disseminated.&lt;ref name="presse1"/&gt;

Landsberg became close friends with the [[Personalist]] philosopher [[Emmanuel Mounier]], whose themes bore a similarity to those explored in his own works. A friend of Max Scheler's, and a disciple of some of his Phenomenological techniques, Mounier was like Landsberg a Christian. Along with [[Gabriel Marcel]] these were probably the most significant 'Christian Existentialists'. On the other side were, of course, the Atheist Existentialists such as Landsberg's tutor Heidegger, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], while [[Martin Buber]] was a significant Jewish Existentialist and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], if you like, the leading [[Feminist]] Existentialist.

==Capture and death==
Unfortunately, Landsberg was for a long time persecuted by the [[Gestapo]] and it was clear that they were intent on having him put away, if not least for his [[Anti-Nazi]]st views but also for his essentially [[Jewish]] parentage. First his wife Madeleine was taken captive by the Nazis and he spent a long odyssey cycling from town to town in France, both so as to escape from the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and in order to find her. He succeeded in joining an Anti-Nazi military group which provided him with official papers, enabling him to take shelter at several locations ([[Vendôme]], [[Orléans]], [[Lyon]]) yet always without any news of his wife. The group of the [[Esprit (magazine)|''Esprit'']] journal manage to see to the safe storage of some of his works and place him safely (for a moment) at the Psychiatric Asylum in Pau, where he is much in need of recovery after the trauma of being separated from his wife and being detained temporarily by the Nazis.

Ultimately, Jacques Thérond, who heads the 'groupe Esprit' installs Landsberg at a hotel with papers under the name of 'Richert'. Against all odds he succeeds in finding his wife, joins a local combat group and evades [[anti-semitic]] persecution for some time. However, in March 1943 he is arrested as a [[Resistance fighter]] and as being of Jewish origin. He is deported to the [[concentration camp]] at [[Oranienburg]], outside [[Berlin]] and is recorded as having died of exhaustion on 2 April 1944 while still incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;'A Note on the Author' by Edouard d'Araille, from ''The Experience of Death'' (LTMI, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and influence==
Landsberg's work is, like Mounier's and the other [[Existentialists]], personal in tone. He is not interested in philosophy as a theoretical discipline but as an exploration of [[Conscience]] and the individual's personal confrontation with their own [[Meaning of life|life]] and [[death]]. His deeply searching attitude to the questions of [[philosophy]] comes out very clearly in the opening words of his most important and influential work ''The Experience of Death'' : "What is the meaning of death to the human being as a person? The question admits of no conclusion, for we are dealing with the very mystery of man, taken from a certain aspect. Every real problem in philosophy contains all the others in the unity of mystery". His approach to understanding these issues is to look for an answer within experience, and he goes on to say: "It is necessary, therefore, to set a limit and seek a basis in experience for any possible answer".

Landsberg's influence has been particularly marked on [[euthanasia]] groups as his work 'The Moral Problem of Suicide' provides a Christian approach to suicide which condones it instead of condemning it, and provides philosophical support for this view in arguing against traditional Catholic polemics on the topic. For a reader new to Landsberg, probably the most significant extract from his work is Chapter VIII. of his book ''The Experience of Death'' entitled "Intermezzo in the Bull Ring", where he creates an [[analogy]] between the life of any individual man and the struggle of the matador with the bull in the course of a [[Bull-fighting|bull-fight]]. Like [[Plato]] in his '[[Allegory of the Cave]]' Landsberg has managed to make a deep reflection on life through a process of analogy. Through being more concrete in his description he enables the reader to visualize and understand what he is talking about with greater ease.

Though the two key works above have been translated into English, they had been out of publication for several decades before their republication by ''Living Time World Thought'' in 2001. According to their website ''The Academy of the 3rd Millennium'' (A3M) is publishing ''The Essence and Meaning of the Platonic Academy'' as the introductory essay for a volume of [[Platonic Dialogues]] on the topic of [[education]] in April 2014. For an example of the discussion of Landsberg's contribution to the philosophy of death in recent literature see ''Death and Mortality in Contemporary Philosophy'' by Bernard N. Schumacher (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard N. |last=Schumacher |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SjXsJdRQTQC&amp;pg=PA112 |pages=112–115 |title=Death and Mortality in Contemporary Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=1139493272}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an instance of his influence on Phenomenology see the ''Phenomenology of Life - From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3l8yyvfH5AQC&amp;pg=PA216 |title=Phenomenology of Life - From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: Book I.

[[File:Petr Kireevski.jpg|thumb|200px|Pyotr Kireevsky; portrait by [[Emmanuil Dmitriev-Mamonov]].]]
'''Pyotr Vasilievich Kireevsky''' (23 February 1808 in [[Belyovsky District|Dolbino]], Kaluga Governorate &amp;ndash; 6 November 1856) was a Russian [[folklorist]] many of whose materials remain unpublished to this day.

Kireevsky was an ardent [[Slavophile]] like his elder and more famous brother [[Ivan Kireevsky|Ivan Vasilievich]] (although [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] thought Pyotr the more original of the two). He spent his entire life collecting folk songs and lyrics. Some of these were contributed by [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Aleksey Koltsov]], and [[Vladimir Dahl]].

During his lifetime, Kireevsky printed only the first volume of his collection, containing "spiritual lyrics". Ten other volumes were brought out posthumously, between 1860 and 1874, under the supervision of [[Pyotr Bessonov]]. Another anthology was published in 1911; it was used by [[Igor Stravinsky]] to arrange his libretto for the ballet ''[[Les Noces]]'' (first performed in 1923).

'''Raymond Klibansky''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|GOQ}} (October 15, 1905 &amp;ndash; August 5, 2005) was a German-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[historian of philosophy]] and [[history of art|art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-raymond-klibansky-513790.html|title=Professor Raymond Klibansky|work=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|author=Jill Kraye|date=4 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Paris]], to Rosa Scheidt and Hermann Klibansky, he was educated at the [[University of Kiel]], [[University of Hamburg]] and [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg]], where he received a Ph.D. in 1928. From 1927 to 1933 he was an assistant at the Heidelberg Academy and from 1931 until 1933 he was a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Heidelberg. In 1933 he was no longer able to teach since he was a [[Jew]].

In 1933 he moved with his family to [[Italy]] and then to [[Brussels]] finally setting in [[Oxford]],
where he was a lecturer at [[Oriel College, Oxford]] from 1936 until 1946.
He became a British citizen in 1938, and during the Second World War was attached to the [[Political Warfare Executive]], based at [[Woburn Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Raymond Klibanski|newspaper= The Times|date= 30 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He worked at first on Germany, then on preparation for the allied invasion of Italy, and after the war on the denazification programme in Germany.

In 1946 Klibansky became the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at [[McGill University]]; he also lectured at the [[Université de Montréal]].

From 1966 to 1969 he was President of the International Institute of Philosophy, and subsequently its honorary president.
He was a fellow of [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] from 1981 to 1995 and thereafter an honorary fellow of that college.

In 1999 he was made a Grand Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca/recherche_details.asp?id=324|title=National Order of Quebec citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] in recognition for being "one of the greatest intellectuals of our time".&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|6818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raymond Klibansky Prizes were formerly awarded each year for the best books in the [[humanities]] that had received support from the Aid to Scholarly Publications Programme (ASPP), part of the [[Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences]]. One prize each was awarded to the best English book and the best French book. The prizes are now called simply the Canada Prizes/Prix du Canada.

{{double image|right|Nietzsche1882.jpg|150|max stirner.jpg|150|The philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche ''(left)'' and Max Stirner ''(right)''}}
The ideas of 19th-century German philosophers [[Max Stirner]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] have often been compared, and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influences.&lt;ref&gt;"Nietzsche's possible reading, knowledge, and plagiarism of Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own (1845) has been a contentious question and frequently discussed for more than a century now." Thomas H. Brobjer, "Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question", in ''[[The Journal of Nietzsche Studies]]'', Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109–114&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, during the early years of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure, the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;While discussion of possible influence has never ceased entirely, the period of most intense discussion occurred between c. 1892 and 1906 in the German-speaking world. During this time, the most comprehensive account of Nietzsche's reception in the German language, the 4 volume work of Richard Frank Krummel: ''Nietzsche und der deutsche Geist'', indicates 83 entries discussing Stirner and Nietzsche. The only thinker more frequently discussed in connection with Nietzsche during this time is Schopenhauer, with about twice the number of entries. Discussion steadily declines thereafter, but is still significant. Nietzsche and Stirner show 58 entries between 1901 and 1918. From 1919 to 1945 there are 28 entries regarding Nietzsche and Stirner.&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that Nietzsche read about Stirner's book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'', 1845), which was mentioned in [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance]]'' (1866) and [[Eduard von Hartmann]]'s ''Philosophy of the Unconscious'' (1869), both of which young Nietzsche knew very well.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche discovered Lange's book immediately after its appearance and praised it as "the most important philosophical work in decades" (letter to Hermann Mushacke, mid November 1866); as to Hartmann, who was also developing the ideas of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche singled out his book in his second ''Untimely Meditation'' for a caustic criticism, and concentrated on precisely the chapter dealing with Stirner, though he did not once mention Stirner's name; Hartmann wrote: "Nietzsche does not mention at any place the name of Stirner or his writings. That he must have known my emphatic hint to Stirner's standpoint and its importance in the 'Philosophy of the Unconscious' arises from his polemic criticism of exactly that chapter which it contains. That he did not see himself prompted by this hint to get acquainted more closely with this thinker so congenial with himself is of little plausibility." Eduard von Hartmann, ''Ethische Studien'', Leipzig: Haacke 1898, pp. 34–69&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no irrefutable indication that he actually read it, as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche's publications, papers or correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

And yet as soon as Nietzsche's work began to reach a wider audience the question of whether or not he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 (while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness) Eduard von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard von Hartmann, Nietzsches "neue Moral",  in ''Preussische Jahrbücher'', 67. Jg., Heft 5, Mai 1891, S. 501–521; augmented version with more express reproach of plagiarism in: ''Ethische Studien'', Leipzig, Haacke 1898, pp. 34–69&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace, at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 "Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;This author believes that one should be careful in comparing the two men. However, he notes: "It is this intensive nuance of individualism that appeared to point from Nietzsche to Max Stirner, the author of the remarkable work ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum''. Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy." [[Oskar Ewald]], "German Philosophy in 1907", in ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400–426&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, from the very beginning of what was characterized as "great debate"&lt;ref&gt;[in the last years of the 19th century] "The question of whether Nietzsche had read Stirner was the subject of great debate" R.A. Nicholls, "Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany", in ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 1, Aug., 1958, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; regarding Stirner's possible  influence on Nietzsche—positive or negative—serious problems with the idea were noted.&lt;ref&gt;Levy pointed out in 1904 that the similarities in the writing of the two men appeared superficial. Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Nicholls, "Beginnings of the Nietzsche Vogue in Germany", in ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 1, Aug., 1958, pp. 24–37&lt;/ref&gt;

But the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain in some reasonable fashion the often-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings.&lt;ref&gt;"Stirner, like Nietzsche, who was clearly influenced by him, has been interpreted in many different ways", [[Saul Newman]], ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan: Anti-authoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power]]'', Lexington Books, 2001, p. 56; "We do not even know for sure that Nietzsche had read Stirner. Yet, the similarities are too striking to be explained away." R. A. Samek, ''The Meta Phenomenon'', p70, New York, 1981; Tom Goyens, (referring to Stirner's book The Ego and His Own) "The book influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, and even Marx and Engels devoted some attention to it." T. Goyens, ''Beer and Revolution: The German Anarchist Movement In New York City'', p. 197, Illinois, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in establishing precisely how and why Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;"We have every reason to suppose that Nietzsche had a profound knowledge of the Hegelian movement, from Hegel to Stirner himself. The philosophical learning of an author is not assessed by the number of quotations, nor by the always fanciful and conjectural check lists of libraries, but by the apologetic or polemical directions of his work itself." Gilles Deleuze (translated by Hugh Tomlinson), ''Nietzsche and Philosophy'', 1962 (2006 reprint, pp. 153–154)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period suggestions of influence and possible links to Stirner==

[[File:Franz und Ida Overbeck.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Franz and Ida Overbeck, two close friends of Nietzsche's who indicated he had been influenced by Stirner]]

The origin of the debate surrounding whether or not Nietzsche had read Stirner's work—and if so, whether he had been influenced by him—seems to lie in apparent similarities between the ideas of the two men as expressed in their writing. These similarities were recognized early and led many, for a variety of reasons, to attempt to determine the precise nature of any possible relationship.

Eduard von Hartmann's book ''The Philosophy of the Unconscious'' had been attacked by Nietzsche in the second of his ''Untimely Meditations''. In 1891 Hartmann claimed that Nietzsche must have been aware of Stirner because Stirner was treated in the very book by him which Nietzsche subjected to criticism. As mentioned, Hartmann accused Nietzsche of having plagiarized Stirner. Nietzsche is also known to have read Lange's ''History of Materialism'', where Stirner's book ''The Ego and Its Own'' is referred to briefly as "the most extreme, that we have knowledge of". Lange goes on to refer to the "ill fame" of Stirner's book. Nietzsche knew these works by Hartmann and Lange very well.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard von Hartmann, Nietzsches "neue Moral",  in ''Preussische Jahrbücher'', 67. Jg., Heft 5, Mai 1891, S. 501–521; augmented version with more express reproach of plagiarism in: ''Ethische Studien'', Leipzig, Haacke 1898, pp. 34–69; T. H. Brobjer, "Nietzsche's Reading and Private Library", 1885-1889, in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 58, No. 4, Oct., 1997, pp. 663–693&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Lauterbach also appears to have played a role in the origin of the association of the two thinkers. Lauterbach was a close friend of [[Heinrich Köselitz]] ("Peter Gast," who was for many years a kind of private secretary for Nietzsche). Lauterbach came to know Nietzsche's work through Köselitz, and was among the philosopher's earliest admirers. He also worked hard to revive Stirner. According to one view this was a part of his project to present Nietzsche as "the great successor, developer and creative transformer" of Stirner. He edited and wrote an introduction to the 1893 Reclam Edition of Stirner with this in mind. Discussing the book in a letter to Köselitz, he wrote "My introduction has only that one objective, to protect innocent people against it [Stirner's book] and to mystify and paralyze the malevolent, substantially with the assistance of Nietzsche." This introduction appeared in all Reclam editions of ''The Ego and Its Own'' from 1893 to 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd A. Laska, "Nietzsches initiale Krise. Die Stirner-Nietzsche-Frage in neuem Licht". In ''Germanic Notes and Reviews'', vol. 33, n. 2, fall/Herbst 2002, pp. 109–133 ([http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html Engl. trans. online]); zu Lauterbach vgl. Bernd A. Laska: Ein heimlicher Hit. 150 Jahre Stirners "Einziger". Eine kurze Editionsgeschichte. Nürnberg: LSR-Verlag 1994 (pp. 18–28); Paul Lauterbach, Kurze Einführung zum "Einzigen und sein Eigentum", in Max Stirner, ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum. Leipzig'', Philipp Reclam Jun. 1893, pp. 3–10, It reads, on p. 8:
"Geben wir schliesslich dem Probleme Stirners ein Echo aus den Werken seines grossen Nachfolgers, des Ausbauers und Umschöpfers der Ich-Lehre—Friedrich Nietzsche."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Overbeck]], who was one of Nietzsche's closest friends, went through the records of the Basle university library and was able to confirm what Nietzsche's erstwhile favourite student Adolf Baumgartner had claimed: that once he had borrowed Stirner's book (on 14 July 1874), according to Baumgartner "on Nietzsche's warmest recommendations".&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger. Nietzsche: a Philosophical Biography. Granta Books, New York (2002), p. 126–7&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Levy independently confirmed that Baumgartner made the claim, and that Baumgartner had borrowed the book.&lt;ref&gt;"It is certain, however, that Nietzsche recommended reading Stirner to one of his students in Basel. In consulting records of the Library of Basle, it is true that Stirner's book is not on the list of books Nietzsche borrowed, but we find that this book was borrowed three times between 1870 and 1880: in 1872, by private docent Schwarzkopf (Syrus Archimedes), in 1874, by the student Baumgartner and, in 1879 by Professor Hans Heussler. But Mr. Baumgartner [...] was the favorite student of Nietzsche—known in their correspondence as "Erzschüler". Mr. Baumgartner, who is today professor at the University of Basel, said that it is on Nietzsche's advice that he read Stirner, but he is not certain that he lent the volume to his master." Albert Levy, ''Stirner et Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904, p10&lt;/ref&gt;  Franz Overbeck's wife Ida reported that during the period from 1880 to 1883 Nietzsche lived with the couple at several points, and that he mentioned Stirner directly.&lt;ref&gt;There is some confusion as to when this occurred. 1880 to 1883 is given in one instance (directly recounted by Ida Overbeck herself), in another (reported by Franz Overbeck), this was said to have occurred in 1878-79. See: Thomas H. Brobjer, "Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question", in ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'', Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109–114&lt;/ref&gt; She describes a discussion she had with Nietzsche in which he mentioned Klinger and Stirner as follows:

"Ach," he said, "I was very disappointed in Klinger. He was a philistine, I feel no affinity with him; but Stirner, yes, with him!" And a solemn expression passed over his face. While I was watching his features intently, his expression changed again, and he made something like a gesture of dismissal or defense: "Now I've told you, and I did not want to mention it at all. Forget it. They will be talking about plagiarism, but you will not do that, I know."&lt;ref&gt;Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of his Contemporaries, Edited with and Introduction by Sander L. Gilman, Translated by David J. Parent, 1987, Oxford University Press, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Resa von Schirnhofer reports that in 1897 she visited Nietzsche's sister in Weimar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Frau Elisabeth wanted to hear some things about my meetings and conversations with Nietzsche and asked me, among other things, whether he had discussed with me Stirner and his book ''The Individual and His Property''. After a little reflection, I answered that I did not remember him ever having mentioned this name. She seemed very satisfied with this answer and, reformulating the question, she insisted: whether I could state with certainty from memory that he had ''not'' named him. I felt like a criminal under interrogation by a prosecuting attorney and said I could only state that this name occurred neither in my notebook, nor in my memory as having been named by Nietzsche. She, however, came back to this question several times and always received the same answer. But this did not answer the key question as to whether Nietzsche knew Stirner, because not mentioning him to me is not the same thing as his not knowing him. But that Frau Elisabeth asked me this question is very explainable, since R. Schellwien and [[Henri Lichtenberger]] had, in their studies of Max Stirner, drawn a few parallels with Nietzsche's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of his Contemporaries, Edited with and Introduction by Sander L. Gilman, Translated by David J. Parent, 1987, Oxford University Press, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schirnhofer goes on to make specific mention of a public controversy at this time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Henri Lichtenberger—if I am not mistaken—visited the Nietzsche Archives shortly before I did and the question of whether Nietzsche had known Stirner's book must have been discussed intensely. Lichtenberger's book on Nietzsche, which appeared soon afterwards, states about this:

"It is certain that despite his claims to complete originality he submitted, consciously or not, to the influence of his contemporaries, and that his thinking, once stripped of its paradoxical and aggressive style, is often much less new than it seems on first encounter. Uncompromising individualism, the cult of the self, hostility to the state, protest against the dogma of equality and against the cult of humanity are found stamped almost as strongly as in Nietzsche, in an author quite forgotten, Max Stirner, whose main work The Individual and His Property (1845) is, from this point of view, very interesting to compare with Nietzsche's writings."&lt;ref&gt;Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of his Contemporaries, Edited with and Introduction by Sander L. Gilman, Translated by David J. Parent, 1987, Oxford University Press, p. 238; Lichtenberger cites the date of publication printed in the first edition of Stirner's work. However, it was in fact published in 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Ida Overbeck, who knew Nietzsche very well, suggests that the relationship between Nietzsche's work and Stirner's should not be viewed as simple plagiarism. Her view was rather that Nietzsche owed a debt to Stirner for introducing new ideas that were significant to Nietzsche in his own work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
That Nietzsche and Stirner seem to us so diametrically different, and actually are, is obvious! But we are not thereby doing justice to Nietzsche and are not giving him the attention and respect he wishes and may demand. Nietzsche paid innermost attention to Stirner. He neither proceeded from him nor stayed with him. It was the simplest sense of reality that moved my husband to note that Nietzsche had known Stirner. Stirner represents a very specific element in Nietzsche, though a small one if you wish, but for Nietzsche great and significant because of the scantiness of this element which he happened to be pursuing.&lt;ref&gt;Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of his Contemporaries, Edited with and Introduction by Sander L. Gilman, Translated by David J. Parent, 1987, Oxford University Press, p114&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Circumstantial evidence==

Claims of influence might have been ignored were it not for the apparent similarities in the writing of the two men which were frequently noted. In addition to similarities, and reports by Nietzsche's close friend that he felt an affinity for Stirner, there exist three other circumstantial details which perhaps deserve mention.

The first is that [[Richard Wagner]], who is well known as an early influence on Nietzsche, might have been familiar with Stirner's ideas. [[August Röckel]] was known to have introduced Wagner to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], the [[Russian anarchist]], and all three men were involved in the Dresden insurrection in May 1849. Wagner met with Bakunin several times during this period. Wagner is also known to have read the work of the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] theorist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Stirner was often closely associated with [[anarchist]] thought. Several authors have suggested that Wagner knew of Stirner's work, and some have suggested that Stirner influenced him.&lt;ref&gt;On Wagner and Proudhon: Mark Berry, ''Treacherous Bonds and Laughing Fire: Politics and Religion in Wagner's Ring'', Ashgate, 2006, p. 38; For the idea that Wagner knew of Stirner and for discussion of Bakunin: Howard Gray, ''Wagner'', Omnibus Press, 1990, p. 55; For the idea that he was influenced by Stirner's ideas see: "Richard Wagner, Der Nibelungen-Mythus. Als Entwurf zu einem Drama (1848)", in, Richard Wagner, ''Sämtliche Schriften und Dichtungen'', Bd. 2, S. 156–166. Leipzig, Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, 1911;  The possibility that Wagner may have played a role in exposing Nietzsche to Stirner's ideas was noted by Victor Roudine, see: Victor Roudine, ''Max Stirner (Un refrattario)'', Ed. del Gruppo autonomo, 1914 and by Albert Levy, in ''Stirner et Nietzsche''&lt;/ref&gt;

The second involves [[Hans von Bülow]], [[Cosima Wagner]]'s first husband, who was a great champion and interpreter of Wagner's music. Nietzsche apparently first met him in the early 1870s when Nietzsche was frequently a guest of the Wagners and was introduced to members of their circle. Bülow visited Basel on 27 March 1872, where he and Nietzsche held long conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Brown, ''Nietzsche Chronicle'' at [[Dartmouth College]], available online; This fact is also noted in Cosima Wagner's diary entry for 28 March 1872&lt;/ref&gt; In  June of that year Nietzsche dedicated to von Bülow his new musical composition ''Manfred-Meditation'' and sent him a copy of the score. Von Bülow replied on July 24 with strong criticism of the piece. Nietzsche appears to have accepted this criticism with grace. In any case he did not break off all contact with von Bülow as we know that Nietzsche sent him a complimentary copy of the first part of ''Zarathustra'' in late summer or early fall of 1883. Nietzsche also sent von Bülow a copy of ''Beyond Good and Evil'' when the printing was finished in the late summer of 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Brown, ''Nietzsche Chronicle'' at Dartmouth College, available online&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote to Bülow as late as 4 January 1889, during his mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Kritische Gesamtausgabe Briefwechsel, III/5 573&lt;/ref&gt; Hans von Bülow is known to have been a great admirer of Max Stirner, and is reported to have known him personally.&lt;ref&gt;"During the same trip, Strauss attended Bülow's final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic (5 April), which closed with a speech by the conductor exalting the ideas of Stirner, a one-time personal acquaintance." Charles Dowell Youmans, ''Richard Strauss's Orchestral Music and the German Intellectual Tradition'', Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 91; The possibility that Hans von Bülow may have played a role in exposing Nietzsche to Stirner's ideas was noted by Victor Roudine, see: Victor Roudine, ''Max Stirner (Un refrattario)'', Ed. del Gruppo autonomo, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1892 Bülow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic with a speech "exalting" the ideas of Stirner. Together with [[John Henry Mackay]], Stirner's biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner's last residence in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dowell Youmans, ''Richard Strauss's Orchestral Music and the German Intellectual Tradition'', Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 91; The story of Bülow discussing Stirner from the conductor's podium is also described by Alex Ross, music critic for ''The New Yorker'' in "Beethoven Unbound", by Alex Ross, ''The New Yorker'', Oct. 22, 2001; Hans von Bülow's participation in placing a memorial plaque on Stirner's last residence is reported in a ''New York Times Saturday Review of Books'' article on Stirner, "Ideas of Max Stirner", by James Huneker, ''New York Times Saturday Review of Books'', April, 1907; see also: Hans von Bülow, ''Briefe und Schriften'' Hg. v. Marie von Bülow. VIII. Band, Leipzig 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The third is the fact that from 1 to 17 October 1865 Nietzsche visited the house of his friend Hermann Mushacke in Berlin. Hermann's father was one Eduard Mushacke, who in the 1840s had been a "good friend" of Stirner's.&lt;ref&gt;John Henry Mackay, ''Max Stirner. Sein Leben und sein Werk.'' 3. Aufl. Berlin-Charlottenburg: Selbstverlag 1914, p. 90; Manfred Kliem: Wer war der im Engels-Brief vom 22. Oktober 1889 genannte, bisher nicht identifizierte Junghegelianer "Mussak"? In: Beiträge zur Marx-Engels-Forschung, Band 29, Berlin 1990, pp. 176–185; [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/eninnuce.html Bernd A. Laska: Max Stirner – a durable Dissident (2000)], [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's initial crisis (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche apparently got on well with Eduard Mushacke. Writing to his mother from Leipzig a few days later, on 22 October he reported, "The life in Berlin was exceptionally pleasant and enjoyable. The old Mushacke is the most lovable man I ever met. We are on first name terms." One study links this newly discovered biographical detail with an "initial crisis" Nietzsche experienced in 1865, as a result of exposure to Stirner's ideas, leading to his study of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd A. Laska, "Nietzsches initiale Krise. Die Stirner-Nietzsche-Frage in neuem Licht". In ''Germanic Notes and Reviews'', vol. 33, n. 2, fall/Herbst 2002, pp. 109–133 ([http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html Engl. trans. online])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association of the two thinkers by anarchists==
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benjamin R. Tucker]], who suggested that anarchists should exploit Nietzsche's writings for their own ends.]]
During the 19th century, Nietzsche was frequently associated with [[anarchist]] movements, in spite of the fact that in his writings he expressed a negative view of anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;"Derogatory references, which were obvious in published as well as unpublished materials, did not deter American anarchists from recruiting Nietzsche as one of their most redoutable precursors" Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist'' {{cite web |url=http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161104/http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |archivedate=21 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}; In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (6.2:126) he refers to "anarchist dogs"&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the result of a popular association during this period between [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|his ideas]] and [[philosophy of Max Stirner|those of Stirner]], whose work proved influential among [[individualist anarchist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Nietzsche's popularity among the socialists was surpassed only by the admiration showered on him by American anarchists. One reason that the anarchist connection with Nietzsche received more prominent mention was simply because there are several thematic connections between Nietzsche and the anarchist tradition, especially the German tradition associated with Max Stirner." Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist'' {{cite web |url=http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161104/http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |archivedate=21 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were frequently compared by French "literary anarchists" and anarchist interpretations of Nietzschean ideas appear to have been influential in the United States as well.&lt;ref&gt;O. Ewald, "German Philosophy in 1907", in ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400–426; T. A. Riley, "Anti-Statism in German Literature, as Exemplified by the Work of John Henry Mackay", in PMLA, Vol. 62, No. 3, Sep., 1947, pp. 828–843; C. E. Forth, "Nietzsche, Decadence, and Regeneration in France, 1891-95", in Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 54, No. 1, Jan., 1993, pp. 97–117; see also Robert C. Holub's ''Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist'', an essay available online at the University of California, Berkeley website.&lt;/ref&gt; Superficial similarities in the expressed ideas of the two men again seem to have played a key role in this association. "Partly because of his egoistic nihilism, and partly because of his neologistic, aphoristic style, Stirner's name came to be associated with Nietzsche's, as both writers were appropriated by anarchists and other radical thinkers at the turn of the century."&lt;ref&gt;David Weir, ''Anarchy and Culture: The Aesthetic Politics of Modernism'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1997,  p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; This association sometimes exasperated anarchist thinkers, who often viewed Nietzsche's work as derivative.&lt;ref&gt;"Though the Stirnerians inclined to dismiss Nietzsche's work as derivative and popularized, it should be plain that the Nietzschean vogue helped to animate these anti-humanitarian, anti-democratic, anti-metaphysical tendencies." Michael H. Levenson, ''A Genealogy of Modernism – A Study of English Literary Doctrine'', 1908-1922, Cambridge, 1984, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Grave]], a French anarchist active in the 1890s, confronted by the growing numbers of anarchists who associated themselves with Nietzsche and Stirner expressed contempt for this trend, "without a doubt, well before the bourgeois litteratures had discovered Nietzsche and Stirner, several anarchists had found that the 'Individual' had only to consider his own 'self,' his own comfort, and his own development." He went on to question the commitment of those writers who fashionably called themselves anarchists because they could recite by heart a few passages of Nietzsche or Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Forth, "Nietzsche, Decadence, and Regeneration in France, 1891-95", in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 54, No. 1, Jan., 1993, pp. 97–117&lt;/ref&gt;

This association was also common among anarchists (or "individualist anarchists") in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the introduction to [[Benjamin R. Tucker]]'s edition of the first English translation of Stirner's ''The Ego and Its Own'' the question arises again. Here, J.L. Walker notes "Nietzsche has been much spoken of as a disciple of Stirner". He goes on to explicitly state, "In style Stirner's work offers the greatest possible contrast to the puerile, padded phraseology of Nietzsche's "Zarathustra" and its false imagery. Who ever imagined such an unnatural conjuncture as an eagle "toting" a serpent in friendship?"&lt;ref&gt;Max Stirner, ''The Ego and Its Own'', Translated by Steven T. Byington, New York, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; However Tucker himself had sought to promote Nietzsche's ideas as supporting anarchism. One researcher notes "Indeed, translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in ''Liberty'', the anarchist journal edited by Benjamin Tucker." He adds "Tucker preferred the strategy of exploiting his writings, but proceeding with due caution: 'Nietzsche says splendid things,—often, indeed, Anarchist things,—but he is no Anarchist. It is of the Anarchists, then, to intellectually exploit this would-be exploiter. He may be utilized profitably, but not prophetably.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161104/http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against influence==

[[File:Elisabeth förster 1894b.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Nietzsche's sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche|Elisabeth]], who worked diligently during his mental illness and after his death to establish that Nietzsche had not been influenced by Stirner in any way.&lt;ref&gt;One researcher notes "Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth, who had a proprietary interest in maintaining her brother's originality, and who certainly did not desire his works placed in the circle of left-Hegelian individualism, maintained that he had never read Stirner." Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist'' {{cite web |url=http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161104/http://learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/research/ |archivedate=21 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many who have suggested that Stirner had no influence upon Nietzsche simply dismiss the idea without any real discussion. This was the approach taken by [[Alois Riehl]], who, like many later writers, showed his contempt for Stirner by refusing to mention him by name. In 1897 he wrote, "It shows a still greater lack of ability to differentiate between minds, if one puts together Nietzsche with the involuntary parodist of Fichte, with the author of the book 'The Ego and Its Own'—this, however, is the same as putting together writings of a nearly unparalleled power of language and fatal strength of genius with a literary curiosity."&lt;ref&gt;Alois Riehl, ''Friedrich Nietzsche – Der Künstler und der Denker'', Stuttgart: Frommann 1897, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; When writers do bother to offer support for their refutation of the idea, the fact that no definite mention of Stirner exists in Nietzsche's published and unpublished writing is the basic argument against influence.

===Albert Levy===
The absence of any references to Stirner was noted by Albert Levy as early as 1904, in his study ''Stirner and Nietzsche''. This argument against influence has proven quite durable; many of the brief remarks on the debate about Stirner's possible influence on Nietzsche to be found in academic publications mention this fact and little else.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. "Commentators have often linked Stirner with Nietzsche in respect of both style and content, thought there is no evidence that Nietzsche ever read him." Robert C. Solomon &amp; Kathleen M. Higgins, ''The Age of German Idealism'', p300, Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; However, one researcher (who incidentally feels that Nietzsche was most likely ''not'' influenced by Stirner) notes: "It is not possible to prove that someone has not read a certain book (which was available). Nonreading, unlike reading, is always a question of probability."&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Brobjer 2003, pp. 109–114"&gt;Thomas H. Brobjer, "Philologica: A Possible Solution to the Stirner-Nietzsche Question", in ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'', Issue 25, Spring 2003, pp. 109–114&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy also dealt very briefly with the fact that Nietzsche must have been aware of Stirner through the works of Hartmann and Lange (discussed above). In the case of Hartmann he speculated that the context and nature of the mention of Stirner in Hartmann's ''The Philosophy of the Unconscious'' would not have led Nietzsche to consider Stirner's work sympathetically, and goes on to add that in any case, Hartmann's claims do not prove direct influence. As for the mention of Stirner in Lange, Levy suggests that because Stirner's ideas are compared in this work with Schopenhauer's, it follows that Nietzsche must have seen Stirner's work as somehow related to the philosophy of Schopenhauer. Hence Levy proposes that if Stirner had any influence upon Nietzsche it would have come to little more than additional impetus to remain a disciple of Schopenhauer. Along these lines he concludes that the report of the Overbecks alleging Nietzsche's affinity for Stirner arose from a misunderstanding on Nietzsche's part about the relationship between Stirner and Schopenhauer resulting from Lange's faulty interpretation.

Levy then proceeds to compare the seemingly similar ideas of the two thinkers, suggesting the similarities are superficial. According to Levy's interpretation, for example, Stirner wants to free the self from all bonds and laws, while Nietzsche preaches the duty of originality and sincerity; Stirner is a realist, while Nietzsche is a "humanist" who sees only barbarism beyond the frontiers of [[ancient Greece]]; Stirner has a critical mind, while Nietzsche is an artist; Stirner seeks continuous improvement (for him the advent of Christianity and the French Revolution are significant milestones) while Nietzsche admires ancient Greece, sees Christianity as decadent and wants a "Renaissance"; Stirner is a "democrat", while Nietzsche is an aristocrat whose ideal state is "Platonic"; Stirner wants to liberate the self from any hierarchy, while Nietzsche reserves a privileged aristocracy of originality, freedom and selfishness; While Stirner wants to empower the spirit of opposition, Nietzsche wants to impose harsh discipline to create a beautiful race.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Levy, ''Stirner and Nietzsche'', Paris, 1904, Conclusion&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oskar Ewald===
Levy was not alone. Though the details of the differences noted in the expressed ideas of the two men varied, there were others who pointed them out. In a review of the state of philosophical discussion in Germany published in 1907, [[Oskar Ewald]] suggested:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Little as one may contest the importance of Stirner, who was an energetic rather than a profound thinker, still one has good cause to be cautious in comparing him to Nietzsche. Individualism is Stirner's last word, but not Nietzsche's. Nietzsche's philosophy as a whole is not egocentric. He finds the ego spun into the world, into the great complex play, which man must fashion and live from in its innermost centre, without clinging to any singular reality, not even to the reality of his own person, for the wealth of being would thus be lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Ewald, "German Philosophy in 1907", in ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 17, No. 4, Jul., 1908, pp. 400–426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Georg Simmel===
[[Georg Simmel]] also felt that any apparent similarities were superficial.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here we grasp the distance between Nietzsche and Max Stirner, which cannot be bridged despite superficial indications of the sort that made Nietzsche appear to ally with the [[sophist]]s. As did the sophists, Stirner holds that all objective standards and values are imaginary and inessential, ghostly shadows confronting subjective reality. Stirner would find it meaningless to claim that the ego referred to anything beyond itself or that it should be graded according to a scale of values. He represents the renaissance of sophism, whereas Nietzsche writes: "We find abominable any decadent spirit who says: 'Everything only to me!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Schopenhauer and Nietzsche'', Translated by H. Loiskandl, D. Weinstein and M. Weinstein. University of Illinois Press, 1991, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Not all who argued against influence claimed that the similarities to be found in the works of the two men were superficial. [[Rudolf Steiner]] met [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] when he was working on the famous Weimar Edition of [[Goethe]]'s works then in preparation under commission from the Archduchess Sophie of Saxony. She subsequently asked him to arrange the Nietzsche library, and even admitted him to her ailing brother's presence. He spent several weeks in the Nietzsche Archives in Naumberg fulfilling Förster-Nietzsche's request. He also edited and wrote introductions to the works of [[Jean Paul Richter]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Further, he was acquainted with [[Eduard von Hartmann]], and dedicated a book to him. Steiner's ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'', was first published in 1895. In it Steiner suggests:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One cannot speak of Nietzsche's development without being reminded of that freest thinker who was brought forth by mankind of the new age, namely, Max Stirner. It is a sad truth that this thinker, who fulfills in the most complete sense what Nietzsche requires of the superman, is known and respected by only a few. Already in the forties of the nineteenth century, he expressed Nietzsche's world conception. Of course he did not do this in such comfortable heart tones as did Nietzsche, but even more in crystal clear thoughts, beside which Nietzsche's aphorisms often appear like mere stammering.

What path might Nietzsche not have taken if, instead of Schopenhauer, his teacher had been Max Stirner! In Nietzsche's writing no influence of Stirner whatsoever is to be found. By his own effort, Nietzsche had to work his way out of German idealism to a Stirner-like world conceptIon.

Like Nietzsche, Stirner is of the opinion that the motivating forces of human life can be looked for only in the single, real personality. He rejects all powers that wish to form and determine the individual personality from outside. He traces the course of world history and discovers the fundamental error of mankind to be that it does not place before itself the care and culture of the individual personality, but other impersonal goals and purposes instead. He sees the true liberation of mankind in that men refuse to grant to all such goals a higher reality, but merely use these goals as a means of their self-cultivation. The free human being determines his own purposes. He possesses his ideals, he does not allow himself to be possessed by them. The human being who does not rule over his ideals as a free personality, stands under the same influence as the insane person who suffers from fixed ideas. It is all the same for Stirner if a human being imagines himself to be “Emperor of China” or if a comfortable bourgeois imagines it is his destiny to be a good Christian, a faithful Protestant, or a virtuous human being, and so on, or is caught and held captive in orthodoxy, virtuousness, etc.

One need read only a few sentences from Stirner's book, ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'', ''The Individual and his very Own'', to see how his conception is related to that of Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit'', Weimar: Emil Felber, 1895; The translation used is that of Margaret Ingram deRis, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom, Rudolf Steiner Publications, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steiner goes on to quote several passages from Stirner discussing the "Unique One". He explicitly relates this concept of Stirner's with Nietzsche's idea of the "superman".

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This person dependent only upon himself, this possessor of creativity out of himself alone, is Nietzsche's superman.

These Stirner thoughts would have been the suitable vessel into which Nietzsche could have poured his rich life of feeling; instead, he looked to Schopenhauer's world of concepts for the ladder upon which he could climb to his own world of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit'', Weimar: Emil Felber, 1895; The translation used is that of Margaret Ingram deRis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'', Rudolf Steiner Publications, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Steiner's view appears to be that the similarities between the two writers are significant and substantial, but he accounts for this with the suggestion that Nietzsche arrived at a "Stirner-like world conception" on his own. Steiner makes no mention of any of the arguments then current suggesting the possibility or likelihood that Nietzsche was familiar with Stirner's work. Variations of this attempt to account for the seeming similarity in the writings of Stirner and Nietzsche through a theory of independent parallel development can  be found in discussions of Stirner as a "precursor" of Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;"Stirner has also been variously portrayed as a precursor of Nietzsche, an [[individualist anarchist]] and a forerunner of [[existentialism]]." Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 1998, p. 140; Max Stirner, ''The Ego and Its Own'', Cambridge University Press, 1995; this possible solution has much in common with the idea that the similarities between Stirner and Nietzsche arise from the "inalterable logic of post-Hegelian philosophy" see: John Glassford, "Did Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) Plagiarise from Max Stirner (1806-56)?" in, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'', issue 18 (fall 1999), pp. 73–79 and; Karl Löwith, ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', Columbia University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Glassford===
John Glassford believes that there is "staggering similarity" between some of the two men's ideas. While he seems to believe that it is likely that Nietzsche read Stirner, he stops short of asserting any certain influence or plagiarism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Stylistically speaking, Stirner uses hyperbole and metaphor in much the same way as Nietzsche, although most would agree that Nietzsche's technique is the more successful. Compare, for example, Stirner's image of the state—"the state turns against me with all the force of its lion-paws and eagle-claws: for it is the King of beasts, it is lion and eagle" (1995, 226)—with Nietzsche's description of the state in Thus Spoke Zarathustra—the "State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters" (I "On the New Idol"). Even allowing for the vagaries of translation, it is clear that Stirner's prose is more repetitive and pedestrian than Nietzsche's, and very often, as in the example just given, Stirner's metaphors just don't work.

More important, and with regard to content, Nietzsche, like Stirner, denies God (GS 125; Stirner 1996, 6–7), he rejects the traditional boundaries available to moral agents (BGE 1–2; Stirner 1995, 282), he undercuts the more plausible conceptions of truth (BGE Preface; Stirner 1995, 312), and he glorifies the use of power to settle disputes between competing interests (BGE 6, 186, 197; Stirner 1995, 175). Perhaps even more remarkable is Stirner's apparent anticipation of a sacred Nietzschean cow, namely, the critique of the modern account of freedom in which autonomy and obligation are reconciled through some mode or other of self-imposed duty. Rather, Stirner like Nietzsche, appeals to a different conception with a persistent call to authenticity, whatever  the costs (1995, xxii, 177, 149; Nietzsche, ZI "On the Gift-Giving Virtue" 3). Finally, Stirner and Nietzsche shared an obsession with the role of language and its potentially tyrannizing effects (Stirner 1995, 312–15; Nietzsche, TI "Skirmishes").

There is also a staggering similarity between Stirner and Nietzsche's political demonology. Can it be mere coincidence that Stirner, like Nietzsche, loathed the state, nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and communism? Nietzsche called all of these modern isms "little attacks of stupidity," and Stirner rather typically said of one of these ideologies, "That the communist sees in you the man, the brother, is only the Sunday side of communism" (Nietzsche, BGE 251; Stirner 1995, 110). According to Stirner and Nietzsche, then, these ideas are all based upon a latent secularized version of Christian ethics.&lt;ref&gt;John Glassford, "Did Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) Plagiarise from Max Stirner (1806-56)?" in, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'', issue 18 (fall 1999), pp. 73–79&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After reviewing the controversy as regards possible plagiarism he suggests: "Unless new documents emerge, we will probably never be able to establish with complete certainty whether Nietzsche plagiarized from Stirner. The circumstantial evidence provided by the published writings is strong, but only if one glosses over the many differences in the published writings as well. [...] Nevertheless, I know of no other example of two philosophers whose works bear such a strong similarity, but where no debt of acknowledgement took place". Following Löwith, he concludes by offering the idea that Nietzsche most likely arrived at ideas similar to Stirner's because of the "inevitable logic of post-Hegelian philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;John Glassford, "Did Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) Plagiarise from Max Stirner (1806-56)?" in, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'', Issue 18 (Fall 1999), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas H. Brobjer===
Thomas H. Brobjer, unlike Glassford, does not see any "staggering similarity" between the two men. He does accept some of the general similarities mentioned by Glassford in his article, but he feels that claims of plagiarism, and even of influence are inappropriate. He proposes a 'new' possible solution: Nietzsche knew of Stirner through secondary works. Though Brobjer is apparently a very careful scholar, he claims "the only known secondary source that Nietzsche read [mentioning Stirner] has been F. A. Lange's ''Geschichte des Materialismus''". He then announces that Nietzsche definitely read works of Hartmann where Stirner is mentioned at length as though he is the first to have published this "discovery". While the fact that Nietzsche must have read at least one of Hartmann's works in which Stirner was discussed is very old news, Brobjer does add at least one new secondary source discussing Stirner that Nietzsche could have read.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Brobjer 2003, pp. 109–114"/&gt;

==Arguments for influence==

===Anselm Ruest===
[[:de:Anselm Ruest|Anselm Ruest]]&lt;ref&gt;Actually an [[anagram]] for "Ernst Samuel", see: Seth Taylor, ''Left Wing Nietzscheans, The Politics of German Expressionism 1910–1920'', 1990, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed the Nietzsche controversy in his 1906 biography of Stirner&lt;ref&gt;Anselm Ruest (Ernst Samuel), ''Max Stirner. Leben – Weltanschauung – Vermächtnis'', Berlin und Leipzig 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the conclusion "that Nietzsche had read Stirner, but withheld mention of him in his writings because he feared that while it was 'a positive philosophy which yearned for life', it was apt to be 'misused by many readers as a justification for petty crimes and cowardly misdeeds.'"&lt;ref&gt;Seth Taylor, ''Left Wing Nietzscheans, The Politics of German Expressionism 1910–1920'', 1990, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul Carus===
[[Paul Carus]] wrote the following in 1914 about the potential relationship between Nietzsche and Stirner: 

{{quote|Nietzsche has been blamed for appropriating Stirner’s thoughts and twisting them out of shape from the self-assertion of every ego consciousness into the autocracy of the unprincipled man of power; but we must concede that the common rules of literary ethics cannot apply to individualists who deny all and any [[moral authority]]. Why should Nietzsche give credit to the author from whom he drew his inspiration if neither acknowledges any rule which he feels obliged to observe? Nietzsche uses Stirner and Stirner declares that it is the good right of every ego to use his fellows, and Nietzsche shows us what the result would be-the rise of the political boss, a brute in human shape, the overman.|sign=Paul Carus|source=''Nietzsche and other exponents of individualism'', pp. 100–101&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/nietzscheandoth01carugoog#page/n124/mode/2up Paul Caras, ''Nietzsche and other exponents of individualism'', Chicago, Open Court Pub, Co., 1914, pp. 100–101]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Gilles Deleuze===
[[Gilles Deleuze]] suggests that Stirner was a critically important ''negative'' influence on Nietzsche. From this perspective, Stirner's egoism was answered by Nietzsche's self-overcoming and "the theory of the higher man". According to Deleuze:&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, Nietzsche and Philosophy, translated by Hugh Tomlinson, The Athlone Press, 1983, pp. 153–155&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We have every reason to suppose that Nietzsche had a profound knowledge of the Hegelian movement, from Hegel to Stirner himself. The philosophical learning of an author is not assessed by the number of quotations, nor by the always fanciful and conjectural check lists of libraries, but by the apologetic or polemical directions of his work itself. We will misunderstand the whole of Nietzsche's work if we do not see 'against whom' its principal concepts are directed. Hegelian themes are present in this work as the enemy against which it fights. Nietzsche never stops attacking ''the theological and Christian character of German philosophy'' (the 'Tubingen seminary')—''the powerlessness of this philosophy to extricate itself from the nihilistic perspective'' (Hegel's negative nihilism, Feuerbach's reactive nihilism, Stirner's extreme nihilism)—''the incapacity of this philosophy to end in anything but the ego, man or phantasms of the human'' (the Nietzschean overman against the dialectic)—''the mystifying character of so-called dialectical transformations'' (transvaluation against reappropriation  and abstract permutations). It is clear that Stirner plays the revelatory  role in all this. It is he who pushes the dialectic to its final consequences, showing what its motor and end results are. But precisely because Stirner still sees things like a dialectician, because he does not extricate himself from the categories of property, alienation and its suppression, he throws himself into the nothingness which he hollows out beneath the steps of the dialectic. He makes use of the question 'which one?' but only in order to dissolve the dialectic in the nothingness of the ego. He is incapable of posing this question in anything but the human perspective, under any conditions but those of nihilism. He cannot let this question develop for itself or pose it in another element which would give it an affirmative response. He lacks a method, a typological method which would correspond to the question.{{pb}}Nietzsche's positive task is twofold: the Overman and Transvaluation. Not 'who is man?' but '''who overcomes man''?' 'The most cautious peoples ask today: "How may man still be preserved?" Zarathustra, however, asks as the sole and first one to do so: "How shall man be ''overcome''?" The overman lies close to my heart, ''he'' is my paramount and sole concern—and ''not'' man: not the nearest, not the poorest, not the most suffering, not the best' (Z IV 'Of the Higher Man', 3, p. 297)—the allusion to Stirner is obvious.|sign=Deleuze, Gilles|source=''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'', pp. 153–154&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze, ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]'', translated by Hugh Tomlinson, The Athlone Press, 1983, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:EEG cap.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] technology has been used for meditation research]]

For the purpose of this article, '''research on [[meditation]]''' concerns research into the psychological and physiological effects of [[meditation]] using the [[scientific method]]. In recent years, these studies have increasingly involved the use of modern scientific techniques and instruments, such as fMRI and EEG which are able to directly observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself, or before and after a meditation effort, thus allowing linkages to be established between meditative practice and changes in brain structure or function.

Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on [[meditation]] have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Tjosvold L, Vandermeer B, Liang Y, Bialy L, Hooton N, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Klassen TP | title = Meditation practices for health: state of the research | journal = Evidence Report/Technology Assessment | volume =  | issue = 155 | pages = 1–263 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17764203 | pmc = 4780968 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225175425/http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | df = dmy-all | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Antoine |last1=Lutz |first2=John D. |last2=Dunne |first3=Richard J. |last3=Davidson | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |chapter=Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction |pages=499–552 |editor1-first=Philip David |editor1-last=Zelazo |editor2-first=Morris |editor2-last=Moscovitch |editor3-first=Evan |editor3-last=Thompson |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness |series=Cambridge Handbooks in Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-81678-9 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511816789.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"/&gt; In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins, publishing in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]], identified 47 studies that qualify as well-designed and therefore reliable.

==Weaknesses in historic meditation and mindfulness research==
[[File:Meditation&amp;BP.jpg|thumb|300px|A comparison of the effect of various meditation techniques on systolic [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;]]

In June, 2007 the United States [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]] Evidence-based Practice Center. The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: [[mantra]] meditation, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness meditation]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[Qigong]], and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[substance abuse]]. The report concluded, "''Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.''" (p.&amp;nbsp;6) It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques.&lt;ref name="State of the Research" /&gt;

A version of this report subsequently published in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' stated that "''Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to [[Validity (logic)|validity]] in every major quality domain assessed''". This was the conclusion despite a [[statistically significant]] increase in quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956 and 2005. Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality. A call was made for rigorous study of meditation.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Barnes V, Carlson LE, Dusek JA, Shannahoff-Khalsa D | title = Clinical trials of meditation practices in health care: characteristics and quality | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 1199–213 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19123875 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2008.0307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains.

Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;

A 2013 statement from the [[American Heart Association]] evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of TM as a treatment for hypertension as "unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established", and stated: "''Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials...&amp;nbsp;other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook RD, Appel LJ, Rubenfire M, Ogedegbe G, Bisognano JD, Elliott WJ, Fuchs FD, Hughes JW, Lackland DT, Staffileno BA, Townsend RR, Rajagopalan S | title = Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association | journal = Hypertension | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 1360–83 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23608661 | doi = 10.1161/HYP.0b013e318293645f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness scales===
In the relatively new field of western psychological mindfulness, researchers attempt to define and measure the results of mindfulness primarily through controlled, randomised studies of mindfulness intervention on various dependent variables. The participants in mindfulness interventions measure many of the outcomes of such interventions subjectively. For this reason, several mindfulness inventories or scales (a set of questions posed to a subject whose answers output the subject's aggregate answers in the form of a rating or category) have arisen. Twelve such methods are mentioned by the Mindfulness Research Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindfulness Research Guide |url=http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100616/http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |archive-date=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain mechanisms===
In 2011, [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) released findings from a study in which [[magnetic resonance image]]s were taken of the brains of 16 participants 2 weeks before and after the participants joined the mindfulness meditation (MM) program by researchers from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], Bender Institute of Neuroimaging in Germany, and the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Researchers concluded that {{quote|..these findings may represent an underlying brain mechanism associated with mindfulness-based improvements in mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Spotlight: Mindfulness Meditation Is Associated With Structural Changes in the Brain |url=http://nccih.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/012311.htm |date= January 30, 2011 |publisher=[[NCCIH]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[analgesic]] effect of MM involves multiple brain mechanisms including the activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeidan F, Grant JA, Brown CA, McHaffie JG, Coghill RC | title = Mindfulness meditation-related pain relief: evidence for unique brain mechanisms in the regulation of pain | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 520 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–73 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22487846 | pmc = 3580050 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.03.082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, brief periods of MM training increases the amount of grey matter in the [[hippocampus]] and [[parietal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen MP, Day MA, Miró J | title = Neuromodulatory treatments for chronic pain: efficacy and mechanisms | journal = Nature Reviews. Neurology | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 167–78 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24535464 | pmc = 5652321 | doi = 10.1038/nrneurol.2014.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neural changes resulting from MM may increase the efficiency of attentional control.&lt;ref name="Malinowski_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malinowski P | title = Neural mechanisms of attentional control in mindfulness meditation | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 7 | pages = 8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23382709 | pmc = 3563089 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2013.00008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participation in MBSR programmes has been found to correlate with decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density,&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Evans KC, Hoge EA, Dusek JA, Morgan L, Pitman RK, Lazar SW | title = Stress reduction correlates with structural changes in the amygdala | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–7 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19776221 | pmc = 2840837 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsp034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus.&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hölzel BK, Carmody J, Vangel M, Congleton C, Yerramsetti SM, Gard T, Lazar SW | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–43 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21071182 | pmc = 3004979 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in the brain===
Mindfulness meditation also appears to bring about favorable structural changes in the brain, though more research needs to be done because most of these studies are small and have weak methodology.&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011b"/&gt; One recent study found a significant cortical thickness increase in individuals who underwent a brief -8 weeks- MBSR training program and that this increase was coupled with a significant reduction of several psychological indices related to worry, state anxiety, depression.&lt;ref name="Santarnecchi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santarnecchi E, D'Arista S, Egiziano E, Gardi C, Petrosino R, Vatti G, Reda M, Rossi A | title = Interaction between neuroanatomical and psychological changes after mindfulness-based training | journal = PLOS One | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = e108359 | date = Oct 2014 | pmid = 25330321 | pmc = 4203679 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0108359 | bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j8359S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study describes how mindfulness based interventions target neurocognitive mechanisms of addiction at the attention-appraisal-emotion interface.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;
A meta-analysis by Fox et al. (2014) using results from 21 brain imaging studies found consistent differences in the region of the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions associated with body awareness. In terms of effect size the mean effect was rated as moderate. (Cohen's d = 0.46) However the results should be interpreted with caution because [[funnel plot]]s indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research.&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

A follow up by Fox et al. (2016) using 78 functional neuro-imaging studies suggests that different meditation styles are reliably associated with different brain activity. Activations in some brain regions are usually accompanied by deactivation in others. This finding suggests that meditation research must put emphasis on comparing practices from the same style of meditation, for example results from studies investigating focused attention methods cannot be compared to results from open monitoring approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Dixon ML, Nijeboer S, Girn M, Floman JL, Lifshitz M, Ellamil M, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Functional neuroanatomy of meditation: A review and meta-analysis of 78 functional neuroimaging investigations | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 65 | pages = 208–28 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27032724 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.03.021 | arxiv = 1603.06342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention and mindfulness===

====Attention networks and mindfulness meditation====
Psychological and Buddhist conceptualisations of mindfulness both highlight awareness and attention training as key components, in which levels of mindfulness can be cultivated with practise of mindfulness meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kabat-Zinn J | year = 2003 | title = Mindfulness‐based interventions in context: past, present, and future | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 144–156 | doi=10.1093/clipsy/bpg016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focused attention meditation and open monitoring meditation are distinct types of mindfulness meditation, and the former relates to directing and maintaining attention on a chosen object (e.g. the breath).&lt;ref name="Lutz2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz A, Slagter HA, Dunne JD, Davidson RJ | title = Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 163–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18329323 | pmc = 2693206 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Open monitoring meditation does not involve focus on a specific object, and instead awareness is grounded in the perceptual features of one’s environment.

Focused attention meditation is typically practiced first to increase the ability to enhance attentional stability, and awareness of mental states with the goal being to transition to open monitoring meditation practise that emphasizes the ability to monitor moment-by-moment changes in experience, without a focus of attention to maintain. Mindfulness meditation may lead to greater [[cognitive flexibility]] &lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Malinowski P | title = Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–86 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19181542 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2008.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence for improvements in three areas of attention====
''Sustained attention''
* Tasks of sustained attention relate to vigilance and the preparedness that aids completing a particular task goal. Psychological research into the relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sustained attention network have revealed the following:
* Mindfulness meditators have demonstrated superior performance when the stimulus to be detected in a task was unexpected, relative to when it was expected. This suggests that attention resources were more readily available in order to perform well in the task. This was despite not receiving a visual cue to aid performance. (Valentine &amp; Sweet, 1999).
* In a [[Continuous performance task]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Schmertz SK, Anderson PL, Robins DL | year = 2009 | title = The relation between self-report mindfulness and performance on tasks of sustained attention | url = | journal = Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 60–66 | doi=10.1007/s10862-008-9086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association was found between higher dispositional mindfulness and more stable maintenance of sustained attention.
* In an EEG study,&lt;ref&gt;[[Electroencephalography]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attentional blink]] effect was reduced, and [[P3b]] ERP amplitude decreased in a group of participants that completed a mindfulness retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slagter HA, Lutz A, Greischar LL, Francis AD, Nieuwenhuis S, Davis JM, Davidson RJ | title = Mental training affects distribution of limited brain resources | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e138 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17488185 | pmc = 1865565 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of reduced attentional blink effect relates to an increase in detectability of a second target. This may have been due to a greater ability to allocate attentional resources for detecting the second target, reflected in a reduced P3b amplitude.
* A greater degree of attentional resources may also be reflected in faster response times in task performance, as was found for participants with higher levels of mindfulness experience.&lt;ref name="Jha2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jha AP, Krompinger J, Baime MJ | title = Mindfulness training modifies subsystems of attention | journal = Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–19 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17672382 | doi = 10.3758/cabn.7.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Selective attention''
* Selective attention as linked with the orientation network, is involved in selecting the relevant stimuli to attend to.
* Performance in the ability to limit attention to potentially sensory inputs (i.e. selective attention) was found to be higher following the completion of an 8-week MBSR course, compared to a one-month retreat and control group (with no mindfulness training).&lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; The ANT task is a general applicable task designed to test the three attention networks, in which participants are required to determine the direction of a central arrow on a computer screen.&lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan J, McCandliss BD, Sommer T, Raz A, Posner MI | title = Testing the efficiency and independence of attentional networks | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 340–7 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11970796 | doi = 10.1162/089892902317361886 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.590.8796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency in orienting that represent the capacity to selectively attend to stimuli was calculated by examining changes in the reaction time that accompanied cues indicating where the target occurred relative to the aid of no cues.
* Meditation experience was found to correlate negatively with reaction times on an [[Eriksen flanker task]] measuring responses to global and local figures. Similar findings have been observed for correlations between mindfulness experience in an orienting score of response times taken from Attention Network Task performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Hurk PA, Giommi F, Gielen SC, Speckens AE, Barendregt HP | title = Greater efficiency in attentional processing related to mindfulness meditation | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 1168–80 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20509209 | doi = 10.1080/17470210903249365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Executive control attention''
* Executive control attention include functions of inhibiting the conscious processing of distracting information. In the context of mindful meditation, distracting information relates to attention grabbing mental events such as thoughts related to the future or past.&lt;ref name="Lutz2008" /&gt;
* More than one study have reported findings of a reduced [[Stroop effect]] following mindfulness meditation training.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tang2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan D, Woollacott M | title = Effects of level of meditation experience on attentional focus: is the efficiency of executive or orientation networks improved? | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718648 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.7022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stroop effect]] indexes interference created by having words printed in colour that differ to the read semantic meaning e.g. green printed in red. However findings for this task are not consistently found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson ND, Lau MA, Segal ZV, Bishop SR | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness-based stress reduction and attentional control | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 449–463 | doi=10.1002/cpp.544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011b" /&gt; For instance the MBSR may differ to how mindful one becomes relative to a person who is already high in trait mindfulness.&lt;ref name = "Malinowski_2013" /&gt;
* Using the Attention Network Task (a version of [[Eriksen flanker task]] &lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"/&gt;) it was found that error scores that indicate executive control performance were reduced in experienced meditators &lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; and following a brief 5 session mindfulness training program.&lt;ref name="Tang2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Ma Y, Wang J, Fan Y, Feng S, Lu Q, Yu Q, Sui D, Rothbart MK, Fan M, Posner MI | title = Short-term meditation training improves attention and self-regulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 43 | pages = 17152–6 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17940025 | pmc = 2040428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0707678104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10417152T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A neuroimaging study supports behavioural research findings that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with greater proficiency to inhibit distracting information. As greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was shown for mindfulness meditators than matched controls.
* Following a [[Stroop test]], reduced amplitude of the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P3]] ERP component was found for a meditation group relative to control participants. This was taken to signify that mindfulness meditation improves executive control functions of attention. An increased amplitude in the [[N200 (neuroscience)|N2]] ERP component was also observed in the mindfulness meditation group, thought to reflect more efficient perceptual discrimination in earlier stages of perceptual processing.&lt;ref name="pmid22363278"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Gruber T, Derose J, Malinowski P | title = Regular, brief mindfulness meditation practice improves electrophysiological markers of attentional control | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 18 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22363278 | pmc = 3277272 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversies in mindful emotion regulation====
It is debated as to whether top-down executive control regions such as the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quirk GJ, Beer JS | title = Prefrontal involvement in the regulation of emotion: convergence of rat and human studies | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 723–7 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17084617 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2006.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are required &lt;ref name="Farb" /&gt; or not &lt;ref name="Goldin" /&gt; to inhibit reactivity of the amygdala activation related to the production of evoked emotional responses.

===[[Prevention of mental disorders|Prevention of mental illness]]===

An 8 week [[mindfulness]] course given to students was found to reduce the number subsequently needing treatment for [[mental illness]] by 60%, although the study was not of large size and commented that the effect could be due to 'non-specific effects', as the control group had received no attention at all, rather than an alternative intervention.&lt;ref name="Galante et al 2017"

===[[Psychological stress|Stress]] reduction===

Research has shown stress reduction benefits from mindfulness.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2018/06/mindfulness-meditation-relaxation-response-have-different-effects-brain-function&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future directions===
A large part of mindfulness research is dependent on technology. As new technology continues to be developed, new imaging techniques will become useful in this field. Real-time fMRI might give immediate feedback and guide participants through the programs. It could also be used to more easily train and evaluate mental states during meditation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Posner MI | title = Tools of the trade: theory and method in mindfulness neuroscience | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–20 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23081977 | pmc = 3541497 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nss112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new technology in the upcoming years offers many exciting potentials for the continued research.

===Insight (Vipassana) meditation===
[[Vipassana]] meditation is a component of Buddhist philosophy.

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.&lt;ref name="Manocha_2010" /&gt;

{{Main|Kundalini yoga#Medical research}}
Kundalini Yoga has proved to increase the prevention of cognitive decline and evaluate the response of biomarkers to treatment, thereby shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of the link between Kundalini Yoga and cognitive impairment. For the study, 81 participants aged 55 and older who had subjective memory complaints and met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, indicated by a total score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The results showed that at 12 weeks, both the yoga group showed significant improvements in recall memory and visual memory and showed significant sustained improvement in memory up to the 24-week follow-up, the yoga group showed significant improvement in verbal fluency and sustained significant improvements in executive functioning at week 24. In addition, the yoga cohort showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, apathy, and resilience from emotional stress.

==Research on unspecified or multiple types of meditation==

===Brain activity===
{{Main|Brain activity and meditation}}

The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices have been found to be relatively deactivated during meditation (experienced meditators using concentration, lovingkindness and choiceless awareness meditation). In addition experienced meditators were found to have stronger coupling between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices both when meditating and when not meditating.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewer JA, Worhunsky PD, Gray JR, Tang YY, Weber J, Kober H | title = Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 50 | pages = 20254–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22114193 | pmc = 3250176 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112029108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10820254B | jstor = 23060108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

A meta analysis found meditation gave some benefits, but no evidence that it was better than other treatments, for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Goyal_2014"/&gt;

===Physical changes in the brain===
Meditation has been shown to change [[grey matter]] concentrations and the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref name="pmid25632405"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurth_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"/&gt;

An eight-week [[MBSR]] course induced changes in gray matter concentrations.&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt; Exploratory whole brain analyses identified significant increases in gray matter concentration in the PCC, TPJ, and the cerebellum. These results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.

===Perception===
Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties. In 1984 a study showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown D, Forte M, Dysart M | title = Differences in visual sensitivity among mindfulness meditators and non-meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 727–33 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6382144 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1984.58.3.727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 a study of the perception of visual illusions by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators showed statistically significant effects found for the [[Poggendorff Illusion]] but not for the [[Müller-Lyer Illusion]]. The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials.&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tloczynski J, Santucci A, Astor-Stetson E | title = Perception of visual illusions by novice and longer-term meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 91 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 1021–6 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11153836 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.91.3.1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tloczynski has described the theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation thus: "''A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts… With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception.''"&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"/&gt; Brown also points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: "''[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events.''"{{cite quote|date=October 2014}} In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Relaxation response===
[[Herbert Benson]], founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with [[Harvard University]] and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the "relaxation response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benson H | title = The relaxation response: therapeutic effect | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5344 | pages = 1694–5 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9411784 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5344.1693b | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1693B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry. Benson and his team have also done clinical studies at Buddhist monasteries in the [[Himalaya]]n Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cromie |first1=William J. |title=Meditation changes temperatures: Mind controls body in extreme experiments |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524212421/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |archive-date=24 May 2007 |date=18 April 2002 |work=Harvard University Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson wrote ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' to document the benefits of meditation, which in 1975 were not yet widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benson |first=Herbert | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Relaxation Response |year=2001 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-380-81595-1 |pages=61–3}}{{psc|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calming effects===
According to an article in ''Psychological Bulletin'', EEG activity slows as a result of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahn BR, Polich J | title = Meditation states and traits: EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–211 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16536641 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]] has written, "It is thought that some types of meditation might work by reducing activity in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and increasing activity in the [[parasympathetic nervous system]],"{{cite quote|date=October 2014}} or equivalently, that meditation produces a reduction in arousal and increase in relaxation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Arousing effects===
Although the most common modern characterization of Buddhist meditation is a ‘relaxation’ technique, both scientific studies and Buddhist textual sources proves meditation’s arousing or wake-promoting effects.&lt;ref name="Britton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Britton, W, Lindahl, J, Cahn, B, Davis, J, Goldman, R | title = Awakening is not a metaphor: The effects of buddhist meditation practices on basic wakefulness. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 13071 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–81 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditations aiming at improving meta-cognitive skills and compassion (e.g. loving-kindness meditation) are associated with physiological arousal, compared to breathing meditation.&lt;ref name= "Lumma"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lumma, A, Kok, B, Singer, T | title = Is meditation always relaxing? investigating heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced effort and likeability during training of three types of meditation. | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–45 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.04.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada (i.e.Vipassana) styles of meditation induce relaxation responses, while Vajrayana styles of meditation induce arousal responses.&lt;ref name="Amihai"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amihai, I, Maria, K | title = Arousal vs. relaxation: A comparison of the neurophysiological and cognitive correlates of vajrayana and theravada meditative practices. | journal = PLoS One | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term meditation training enables the voluntary activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) results in epinephrine release.&lt;ref name="Kox"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kox, M, Eijk, L, Zwaag, J, Wildenberg, J, Sweep, F, Hoeven, J, Pickkers, P | title = Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans. | journal = National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 20 | pages = 7379–7384 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1322174111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SNS is activated, human body is turning into ‘fight or flight’ mode, whereas the PNS is termed the ‘rest and digest’ mode.&lt;ref name="brodal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Per |last=Brodal |title=The Central Nervous System: Structure and Function  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdATFQ0YUrMC&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |edition=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2004 |pages=369–396 |isbn=0-19-516560-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when SNS is activated, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration will be increased, and catecholamines will be produced, while heart rate variability and galvanic skin resistance will be decreased.&lt;ref name="brodal"/&gt; Therefore, Relaxing meditation seems to correspond to PNS dominance, and arousing meditation seems to correspond to SNS dominance.

===Slowing aging===
Aging is a process accompanied by a decrease in brain weight and volume. This phenomenon can be explained by structural changes in the brain, namely, a loss of grey matter. Some studies over the last decade have implicated meditation as a protective factor against normal age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E, Cherbuin N, Kurth F | title = Forever Young(er): potential age-defying effects of long-term meditation on gray matter atrophy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 1551 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25653628 | pmc = 4300906 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct evidence for this link emerged from a study investigating changes in the cortical thickness of meditators. The researchers found that regular meditation practice was able to reduce age-related thinning of the frontal cortex, albeit, these findings were restricted to particular regions of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, Gray JR, Greve DN, Treadway MT, McGarvey M, Quinn BT, Dusek JA, Benson H, Rauch SL, Moore CI, Fischl B | title = Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = 17 | pages = 1893–7 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16272874 | pmc = 1361002 | doi = 10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study looked to further expand on this finding by including a behavioural component. Consistent with the previous study, meditators did not show the expected negative correlation between grey matter volume and age. In addition, the results for meditators on the behavioural test, measuring attentional performance, were comparable across all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagnoni G, Cekic M | title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 1623–7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17655980 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that meditation can potentially protect against age-related grey matter loss and age-related cognitive decline. Since then, more research has supported the notion that meditation serves as a neuroprotective factor that slows age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Cherbuin N, Luders E | title = Reduced age-related degeneration of the hippocampal subiculum in long-term meditators | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 232 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–8 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25907419 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, all studies have been cross sectional in design. Furthermore, these results merely describe associations and do not make causal inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E | title = Exploring age-related brain degeneration in meditation practitioners | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1307 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–88 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23924195 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12217 | bibcode = 2014NYASA1307...82L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work using longitudinal and experimental designs may help solidify the causal link between meditation and grey matter loss. Since few studies have investigated this direct link, however insightful they may be, there is not sufficient evidence for a conclusive answer.

Research has also been conducted on the malleable determinants of cellular aging in an effort to understand human longevity. Researchers have stated, "We have reviewed data linking stress arousal and oxidative stress to telomere shortness. Meditative practices appear to improve the endocrine balance toward positive arousal (high DHEA, lower cortisol) and decrease oxidative stress. Thus, meditation practices may promote mitotic cell longevity both through decreasing stress hormones and oxidative stress and increasing hormones that may protect the telomere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epel E, Daubenmier J, Moskowitz JT, Folkman S, Blackburn E | title = Can meditation slow rate of cellular aging?

===Happiness===

Studies have shown meditators to have higher happiness than control groups, although this may be due to non-specific factors such as meditators having better general self-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | pmc = 3843423 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.08.040 |title=Meditation and happiness: Mindfulness and self-compassion may mediate the meditation–happiness relationship |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=93 |pages=80–85 |year=2016 |last1=Campos |first1=Daniel |last2=Cebolla |first2=Ausiàs |last3=Quero |first3=Soledad |last4=Bretón-López |first4=Juana |last5=Botella |first5=Cristina |last6=Soler |first6=Joaquim |last7=García-Campayo |first7=Javier |last8=Demarzo |first8=Marcelo |last9=Baños |first9=Rosa María | name-list-format = vanc |hdl=10234/157867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manocha et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="degruyter.com"/&gt;

[[Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche]] has said that neuro scientists have found that with meditation, an individual's happiness baseline can change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Seethalakshmi S | title = Science has proved that meditation can improve quality of life: Buddhist master | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/science-has-proved-that-meditation-can-improve-quality-of-life-buddhist-master/articleshow/58200304.cms | website = Times of India | date = April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive relationships have been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain and both meditation and the subject's subjective [[happiness]] score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato W, Kochiyama T, Uono S, Kubota Y, Sawada R, Yoshimura S, Toichi M | title = The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 16891 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26586449 | pmc = 4653620 | doi = 10.1038/srep16891 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...516891S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25632405"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kurth_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"/&gt;

===Potential adverse effects and limits of meditation===
The following is an official statement from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]-run [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched. People with physical limitations may not be able to participate in certain meditative practices involving physical movement. Individuals with existing mental or physical health conditions should speak with their health care providers prior to starting a meditative practice and make their meditation instructor aware of their condition.''"&lt;ref name="NCAAM overview" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research methods on the human brain remain primitive==
Although we can now scan the brain, inferring value from blood movements in a human brain remains debatable.

{{quote|''Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of a variety of meditation practices. It has been unclear to what extent these practices share neural correlates. Interstingly, a recent study compared electroencephalogram activity during a focused-attention and open monitoring meditation practice from practitioners of two Buddhist traditions (17). The researchers found that the differences between the two meditation traditions were more pronounced than the differences between the two types of meditation. These data are consistent with our findings that theoretical orientation of how a practice is taught strongly influences neural activity during these practices. However, the study used long-term practitioners from different cultures, which may have confounded the results.''&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Hindu philosophy}}      
'''Satadushani''' is a work written by [[Vedanta Desika]] who lived in the 12th century. He is considered as one among the most illustrious [[Acharya]] of the Vaishnavite tradition and is the leader of the Vadagalai sect of the Vaishnavas. Though the title of the work suggests hundred refutations, only 66 of them are now available. Satadushani is a work of logic otherwise called as ''Tarka'' in Hindu philosophy. It is a refutation of the nirvesesha [[Advaita]] of [[Sankaracharya]]. It establishes the validity of the [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy of [[Ramanuja]] as against the Advaita of sankara. It is said that at the age of around 50 or 55 Vedanta Desika was invited by his disciples at [[Srirangam]] to engage in a polemical debate with a group of Advaitins from North India. The arguments made in the form of refutations against these men are said to be the content of this work. The late [[Surendranath Dasgupta]] in his magnum opus ''The history of Indian Philosophy'' has allotted almost 40 pages for this particular book of Vedanta Desika in the third volume of the series. The late [[R. Kesava Aiyangar]], a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of India has written an exhaustive introduction to this work in English for the book titled ''Vedanta Desika's Satadushani'' by Srivatsankacharya.

A '''spiritual practice''' or '''spiritual discipline''' (often including '''spiritual exercises''') is the regular or full-time performance of actions and activities undertaken for the purpose of inducing [[Religious experience|spiritual experiences]] and cultivating [[Spirituality|spiritual development]]. A common metaphor used in the spiritual traditions of the world's great religions is that of walking a path.&lt;ref&gt;In Islam [[Sharia]], in Indian religions [[Noble Eightfold Path|Marga]], in [[Taoism]] and [[Christianity]], [[Tao|The Way]] are examples.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a spiritual practice moves a person along a path towards a goal. The goal is variously referred to as [[salvation]], [[Moksha|liberation]] or union (with God). A person who walks such a path is sometimes referred to as a wayfarer or a [[pilgrim]].

=== Judaism ===
''[[Kavanah]]'' is the directing of the heart to achieve higher contemplative thoughts and attain inner strength. Perhaps the most elevated spiritual exercise for a Jew is known as ''Torah Lishmah'', the diligent study of the Torah. Reciting daily prayers (such as the [[Shema]] and [[Amidah]]), following dietary laws of [[kashrut]], observing [[Shabbat]], [[fasting]], and performing deeds of [[chesed|loving-kindness]] all assist in maintaining awareness of God.  Various Jewish movements throughout history have encouraged a range of other spiritual practices.  The [[Musar movement]], for example, encourages a variety of meditations, guided contemplations, and chanting exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mussarinstitute.org/wisdom-way.htm |title=The Mussar Way - Soul, Jewish contemplative practices and exercises |publisher=The Mussar Institute |accessdate=2012-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720005908/http://www.mussarinstitute.org/wisdom-way.htm |archivedate=2012-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In the Catholic tradition, spiritual disciplines may include: [[prayer]], fasting, corporal and spiritual acts of mercy, [[Sacraments]] (e.g., [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist]]]), [[monasticism]], [[chanting]], [[celibacy]], the use of a [[Rosary|rosary (prayer beads)]], [[mortification of the flesh]], [[Christian meditation]] or contemplative prayer, following the path of Catholic social teachings (including [[almsgiving]]), [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]], and ''[[Lectio Divina]]''.

For Protestants, spiritual disciplines are generally regarded to include any combination of the following, in moderation: celebration, chastity, confession, fasting, fellowship, frugality, giving, guidance, hospitality, humility, intimacy, meditation, prayer, reflection, self-control, servanthood, service, silence, simplicity, singing, slowing, solitude, study, submission, surrender, teaching, and worship.

The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as the Quakers) practices silent worship, which is punctuated by vocal ministry. Quakers have little to no [[creed]] or [[doctrine]], and so their practices constitute a large portion of their group identity.

A well-known writer on Christian spiritual disciplines, [[Richard Foster (theologian)|Richard Foster]], has emphasized that Christian meditation focuses not of the emptying of the [[mind]] or [[soul|self]], but rather on the filling up of the mind or self with God.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite book | last = Foster | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J. Foster | year = 1998 | title = Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth | publisher =  | location = [[San Francisco]] | isbn = 0-06-062839-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Spiritual practice in [[Islam]] is practiced within [[salat]] (ritual prayer) during which Muslims subdue all thoughts and concentrate solely on [[Allah]], also through other forms of worship activities like [[fasting]], and [[Hajj]]. Among many Muslim groups, immersion in spiritual practices is thought of as more noticeable and deep as practiced by [[Sufism|Sufis]] including [[Dhikr]], [[Muraqaba]], and [[Sufi whirling#Sama|Sama]] ([[Sufi whirling]]).

===Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the generic term for spiritual cultivation is ''[[bhavana]]''. The Pali word "yoga," central to many early Buddhist texts, has been often  translated as "Spiritual Practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Fronsdal | first=Gil | authorlink=Gil Fronsdal |author2=Jack Kornfield | title=The Dhammapada: A New Translation of the Buddhist Classic with Annotations | year= 2005 | publisher=Shambhala | location= | isbn=1-59030-380-6 | pages =ix - xix }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen]] Buddhism, meditation (called ''[[zazen]]''), the writing of poetry (especially ''[[haiku]]''), [[painting]], [[calligraphy]], [[flower arranging]], the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] and the maintenance of [[Zen garden]]s are considered to be spiritual practices. The [[Korean tea ceremony]] is also considered spiritual.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Yoga}}
In [[Hinduism]], the practice of cultivating spirituality is known as ''[[sadhana]]''. ''[[Japa]]'', the silent or audible repetition of a ''[[mantra]]'', is a common [[Hindu]] spiritual practice.

[[Tantra|Tantric]] practices are shared in common between Hinduism and certain Buddhist (especially Tibetan Buddhist) schools, and involve the deliberate use of the mundane (worldly, physical or material) to access the supramundane (spiritual, energetic or mystical) realms.

==Other==

===Stoicism (founded 3rd century BCE)===
[[Stoicism]], takes the view that [[philosophy]] is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life and [[discourse]] involving constant practice and training (e.g., [[asceticism]]). Stoic spiritual practices and exercises include [[contemplation]] of death and other events that are typically thought negative, training [[attention]] to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of Eastern meditation), daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions, keeping a personal journal, and so on. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.{{cn}]

=== Baha'i Faith (founded 1863) ===
Prayer in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], refers to two distinct concepts: ''obligatory prayer'' and ''devotional prayer'' (general prayer).

{{Buddhism}}
The term '''subitism''' points to sudden [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], the idea that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once.{{sfn|McRae|1991}} The opposite approach, that enlightenment can be achieved only step by step, through an arduous practice, is called [[gradualism]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}

==Etymology==
The application of the term to [[Buddhism]] is derived from the French ''[[Divine light|illumination]] subite'' (sudden awakening), contrasting with 'illumination graduelle' (gradual awakening). It gained currency in this use in English from the work of [[sinologist]] [[Paul Demiéville]]. His 1947 work 'Mirror of the Mind' was widely read in the U.S. It inaugurated a series by him on subitism and gradualism. &lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subitizing]], also derived from the Latin adjective subitus, is the rapid, accurate, and confident judgments of numbers performed for small numbers of items. It is important to be aware subitism can also be used in this context.

==Early Buddhism==

===''Dhyana'' and insight===
A core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana/dhyana]]'' and insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}{{refn|group=note|[[Bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[vipassana]], [[kensho]]}} The Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of dhyana.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} There is a tradition that stresses attaining [[Vipassana|insight]] ([[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[kensho]]) as the means to awakening and liberation. But it has also incorporated the [[Yoga|yogic tradition]], as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} The problem was famously voiced in 1936 by Louis de La Vallee Poussin, in his text ''Musila et Narada: Le Chemin de Nirvana''.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=133-134}}{{refn|group=note|See [http://www.gampoabbey.org/documents/kosha-sources/La-Vallee-Poussin-Musila-and-Narada-The-Path-of-Nirvana-1937.pdf Louis de La Vallée Poussin, ''Musial and Narad'']. Translated from the French by Gelongma Migme Chödrön and Gelong Lodrö Sangpo.}}

Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism,'' notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Schmithausen discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas. Vetter adds a fourth possibility, which pre-dates these three:{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxii}}
# The four Rupa Jhanas themselves constituted the core liberating practice of early buddhism, c.q. the Buddha;{{sfn|Vetter|1988|xxi-xxxvii}}
# Mastering the four Rupa Jhanas, where-after "liberating insight" is attained;
# Mastering the four Rupa Jhanas and the four Arupa Jhanas, where-after "liberating insight" is attained;
# Liberating insight itself suffices.

This problem has been elaborated by several well-known scholars, including Tilman Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} [[Johannes Bronkhorst]],{{sfn|bronkhorst|1993}} and Richard Gombrich.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}

===Dhyana===
According to Tilmann Vetter, the core of earliest Buddhism is the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Vetter notes that "penetrating abstract truths and penetrating them successively does not seem possible in a state of mind which is without contemplation and reflection."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxvii}} Vetter further argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}

Bronkhorst agrees that ''dhyana'' was a Buddhist invention,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} whereas Norman notes that "the Buddha's way to release [...] was by means of meditative practices."{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} Gombrich also notes that a development took place in early Buddhism resulting in a change in doctrine, which considered ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajna]]'' to be an alternative means to "enlightenment".{{sfn|gombrich|1997|p=131}}

===Insight===
According to Johannes Bronkhorst,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Tillman Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} and K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}} ''bodhi'' was at first not specified. K.R. Norman:
{{quote|It is not at all clear what gaining ''bodhi'' means. We are accustomed to the translation [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|"enlightenment"]] for ''bodhi'', but this is misleading [...] It is not clear what the buddha was awakened to, or at what particular point the awakening came.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}}}

According to Norman, ''bodhi'' may basically have meant the knowledge that ''nibbana'' was attained,{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=30}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxix, xxxi}} due to the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=29}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

Bronkhorst notes that the conception of what exactly this "liberating insight" was developed throughout time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the four truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon: 
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

Discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}} This may have been to due an over-literal interpretation by later scholastics of the terminology used by the Buddha,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-134}} or to the problems involved with the practice of ''dhyana'', and the need to develop an easier method.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxv}} According to Vetter it may not have been as effective as ''dhyana'', and methods were developed to deepen the effects of discriminating insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxv}} It was also paired to ''dhyana'', resulting in the well-known ''sila-samadhi-prajna'' scheme.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxv}} According to Vetter this kind of preparatory ''"dhyana"'' must have been different from the practice introduced by the Buddha, using [[kasina]]-exercises to produce a "more artificially produced dhyana", resulting in the cessation of apperceptions and feelings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxvi}} It also led to a different understanding of the eightfold path, since this path does not end with insight, but rather starts with insight. The path was no longer seen as a sequential development resulting in ''dhyana'', but as a set of practices which had to be developed simultaneously to gain insight.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxvi-xxxvii}}

==Theravada==
The distinction between sudden and gradual is also apparent in the differentiation between [[vipassana]] and [[samatha]]. According to Gombrich, the distinction between vipassana and samatha did not originate in the [[sutra|suttas]], but in the ''interpretation'' of the suttas.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-144}}

==Mahayana==
The emphasis on insight is also discernible in the Mahayana-tradition, which emphasises [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]:
{{quote|[T]he very title of a large corpus of early Mahayana literature, the ''[[Prajnaparamita]]'', shows that to some extent the historian may extrapolate the trend to extol insight, ''prajna'', at the expense of dispassion, ''viraga'', the control of the emotions.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=133}}}}

Although Theravada and Mahayana are commonly understood as different streams of Buddhism, their practice too may reflect emphasis on insight as a common denominator:{{refn|group=note|Warder: "In the Sthaviravada [...] progress in understanding comes all at once, 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva'')".{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}}}}

===Chinese Buddhism===
The distinction between sudden and gradual awakening was first introduced in China in the beginning of the 5th century CE by [[Tao Sheng]].{{sfn|Lai|1991|p=169}}

====Chan====
The term is used in [[Chan Buddhism]] to denote the doctrinal position that [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] ([[kenshō]], [[bodhi]] or [[satori]]) is instantaneous, sudden and direct, not attained by practice through a period of time, and not the fruit of a gradual accretion or realisation. Aspects of [[Dzogchen]] and [[Mahamudra]] may be referred to as subitist, as well as the [[Rinzai school]].

=====Huineng=====
In the 8th century the distinction became part of a struggle for influence at the Chinese court by [[Shenhui]], a student of [[Huineng]]. Hereafter "sudden enlightenment" became one of the hallmarks of Chan Buddhism, though the sharp distinction was softened by subsequent generations of practitioners.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

This softening is reflected in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]].
{{quote|While the Patriarch was living in Bao Lin Monastery, the Grand Master Shen Xiu was preaching in Yu Quan Monastery of Jing Nan. At that time the two Schools, that of Hui Neng of the South and Shen Xiu of the North, flourished side by side. As the two Schools were distinguished from each other by the names "Sudden" (the South) and "Gradual" (the North), the question which sect they should follow baffled certain Buddhist scholars (of that time). (Seeing this), the Patriarch addressed the assembly as follows:&lt;br/&gt;
So far as the ''[[Dharma]]'' is concerned, there can be only one School. (If a distinction exists) it exists in the fact that the founder of one school is a northern man, while the other is a southerner. While there is only one ''dharma'', some disciples realize it more quickly than others. The reason why the names 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' are given is that some disciples are superior to others in mental dispositions. So far as the Dharma is concerned, the distinction of 'Sudden' and 'Gradual' does not exist.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/huineng/huineng8.html The Sudden School and the Gradual School. Chapter VIII]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Rivalry between schools=====
While Southern School placed emphasis on sudden enlightenment, it also marked a shift in doctrinal basis from the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' to the [[prajnaparamita]] tradition, especially the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]''. The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, which endorses the [[Buddha-nature]], emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The ''Diamond Sutra'' emphasizes [[śūnyatā]], which "must be realized totally or not at all".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26–28}}

Once this dichotomy was in place, it defined its own logic and rhetorics, which are also recognizable in the distinction between [[Caodong school|Caodong]] ([[Sōtō]]) and [[Linji school|Linji]] ([[Rinzai school|Rinzai]]) schools.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=123}} But it also leads to a "sometimes bitter and always prolix sectarian controversy between later Ch'an and [[Huayan school|Hua-yen]] exegetes".{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=234}} In the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Huayan classification of teachings]], the sudden approach was regarded inferior to the Perfect Teaching of Huayan. [[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth patriarch of Huayan and Chan master, devised his [[Guifeng Zongmi#The Buddha's Teachings|own classification]] to counter this subordination.{{sfn|Gregory|1993}} To establish the superiority of Chan, [[Jinul]], the most important figure in the formation of [[Korean Seon]], explained the sudden approach as not pointing to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}

=====Later interpretations=====
[[Guifeng Zongmi]], fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain [[buddhahood]].{{sfn|Gregory|1991}}

This is also the standpoint of the contemporary [[Sanbo Kyodan]], according to whom kensho is at the start of the path to full  enlightenment.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

This gradual cultivation is also recognized by [[Dongshan Liangjie]], who described the [[Five Ranks]] of enlightenment]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html The Five Ranks of Tozan]&lt;/ref&gt; Other example of depiction of stages on the path are the [[Ten Bulls]], which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three Mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin Ekaku#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin Ekaku]].{{sfn|Low|2006}} This gradual cultivation is described by Chan Master Sheng Yen as follows:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54}}}}

====Hua-yen====
In the [[Huayan school#Classification of Buddhist teachings|Fivefold Classification]] of the [[Huayan school]] and the [[Tiantai#Five Periods and Eight Teachings|Five Periods and Eight Teachings]] of the [[Tiantai|Tiantai-school]] the sudden teaching was given a high place, but still inferior to the Complete or Perfect teachings of these schools.

===Korean Seon===
[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Buswell|1989|p=21}}

In contemporary Korean Seon, [[Seongcheol]] has defended the stance of "sudden insight, sudden cultivation". Citing [[Taego Bou]] (太古普愚: 1301-1382) as the true successor of the [[Linji Yixuan]] (臨済義玄) line of patriarchs rather than [[Jinul]] (知訥: 1158-1210), he advocated [[Hui Neng]]'s original stance of 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation' ([[Hangul]]: 돈오돈수, [[Hanja]]: 頓悟頓修) as opposed to Jinul's stance of 'sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation' ([[Hangul]]: 돈오점수, [[Hanja]]: 頓悟漸修).&lt;ref name=line&gt;퇴옹 성철.

Haeinsa Baekryun'am (Korea): Jang'gyung'gak.) {{ISBN|89-85244-16-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Jinul had initially asserted that with enlightenment comes the need to further one's practice by gradually destroying the karmic vestiges attained through millions of rebirths, [[Huineng]] and Seongcheol maintained that with perfect enlightenment, all karmic remnants disappear and one becomes a Buddha immediately.&lt;ref name=see&gt;퇴옹 성철.

==Neo-Vedanta==

===Ramana maharshi - Akrama mukti===
[[Ramana Maharshi]] made a distinction between ''akrama mukti'', "sudden liberation", as opposed to the ''krama mukti'', "gradual liberation" as in the Vedanta path of [[jnana yoga]]:&lt;ref group=web name="deathexp2" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Rama P.

The teachings of Bhausaheb Maharaj, the founder of the [[Inchegeri Sampradaya]], have been called "the Ant's way", {{refn|group=note|''Pipeelika Mārg'',{{sfn|Prasoon|2009|p=8}} or ''Pipilika Marg '',&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar"&gt;[http://nondualite.free.fr/c_profile.htm http://nondualite.free.fr, ''Shri Sadguru Siddharameshwar Maharaj'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} the way of meditation,&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway"&gt;[http://sadguru.us/thebirdsway.html sadguru.us, ''The Bird's way''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330175504/http://sadguru.us/thebirdsway.html |date=2015-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the teachings of Siddharameshwar Maharaj and his disciples Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ranjit Maharaj have been called "the Bird's Way",{{refn|group=note|''Bihangam Mārg'',{{sfn|Prasoon|2009|p=8}} or ''Vihangam Marg'',&lt;ref group=web name="nondualite.free.fr-Siddharameshwar" /&gt;}} the direct path to Self-discovery:&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway" /&gt;
{{quote|The way of meditation is a long arduous path while the Bird's Way is a clear direct path of Self investigation, Self exploration, and using thought or concepts as an aid to understanding and Self-Realization. Sometimes this approach is also called the Reverse Path. What Reverse Path indicates is the turning around of one's attention away from objectivity to the more subjective sense of one's Beingness.{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Jinul]]'s "tracing back the radiance".{{Citation | last =Buswell | first =Robert E. | year =1991 | title =Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen | publisher =University of Hawaii Press | isbn =978-0-8248-1427-4}}}} With the Bird's Way, first one's mind must be made subtle. This is generally done with some initial meditation on a mantra or phrase which helps the aspirant to step beyond the mental/conceptual body, using a concept to go beyond conceptualization.&lt;ref group=web name="sadguru.us-birdsway" /&gt;}}

The terms appear in the Varaha Upanishad, Chapter IV:
{{quote|34. (The Rishi) [[Shuka|Suka]] is a Mukta (emancipated person). (The Rishi) [[Vamadeva]] is a Mukta. There are no others (who have attained emancipation) than through these (viz., the two paths of these two Rishis). Those brave men who follow the path of Suka in this world become Sadyo-Muktas (viz., emancipated) immediately after (the body wear away);&lt;br&gt;
35. While those who always follow the path of Vamadeva (i.e., Vedanta) in this world are subject again and again to rebirths and attain Krama (gradual) emancipation, through Yoga, Sankhya and Karmas associated with Sattva (Guna).&lt;br&gt;
36. Thus there are two paths laid down by the Lord of Devas (viz.,) the Suka and Vamadeva paths. The Suka path is called the bird’s path; while the Vamadeva path is called the ant’s path.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/upanishad-varaha-bhumikas.htm swamji.com, ''Seven Bhumikas'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a table containing prophets of the modern [[Abrahamic religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ENOCH - JewishEncyclopedia.com|url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5772-enoch|website = www.jewishencyclopedia.com|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Judaism and Islam the classification of some people as prophets includes those who are not explicitly called so in the [[Hebrew Bible]] or [[Quran]]. Judaism also uses religious texts other than the Hebrew Bible to define prophets. Moreover, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis use different criteria for classifying someone as a prophet, e.g. Enoch is not considered a prophet in Judaism. The New Testament may call someone a prophet even though they are not so classified in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; for example, Abel, Daniel, and Enoch are described in the New Testament as prophets.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ten Conditions of [[Bai'at]]''' is a list of ten conditions required for a person wishing to become an [[Ahmadi]] Muslim, as stipulated by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in Islam. About six years after he had claimed to be divinely commissioned for the renewal of Islam, he announced that God had instructed him to take a pledge of allegiance from his supporters and published 10 conditions of initiation for all who wished to join him with a covenant of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/apps/cob/webapp/ | title=The Ten Conditions of Bai'at | publisher=alislam | accessdate=20 January 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127184453/http://www.alislam.org/apps/cob/webapp/ | archivedate=27 January 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first such initiation took place in 1889 at [[Ludhiana]], when forty of his companions pledged their allegiance to him. The occasion was a simple one where the initiate held the right hand of Ghulam Ahmad, repented of their sins, solemnly promised to give precedence to faith above all worldly considerations and to abide by the ten conditions.

'''''The Neverending Story''''' ({{lang-de|Die unendliche Geschichte}}) is a  [[Fantasy literature|fantasy novel]] by German writer [[Michael Ende]], first published in 1979. An English translation, by [[Ralph Manheim]], was first published in 1983. The novel was later adapted into several [[The NeverEnding Story (film)|films]].

==Plot summary==
The book centers on a boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, a small and strange child who is neglected by his father after the death of Bastian's mother. While escaping from some [[bullying|bullies]], Bastian bursts into the antiquarian book store of Carl Conrad Coreander, where he finds his interest held by a book called ''The Neverending Story''. Unable to resist, he steals the book and hides in his school's attic, where he begins to read.

The story Bastian reads is set in the magical land of Fantastica, an unrealistic place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious Childlike Empress. A great delegation has come to the Empress to seek her help against a formless entity called "The Nothing". The delegates are shocked when the Empress's physician, a [[centaur]] named Cairon, informs them that the Empress is dying, and has summoned a boy warrior named Atreyu, to find a cure. To Atreyu, the Empress gives AURYN: a powerful [[medallion]] that protects him from all harm. At the advice of the giant [[turtle]], Morla the Aged One, Atreyu sets off in search of an invisible [[oracle]] known as Uyulala, who may know the Empress's cure. In reaching her, he is aided by a luckdragon named Falkor, whom he rescues from the monster 'Ygramul the Many'. By Uyulala, he is told the only thing that can save the Empress is a new name given to her by a human child, who can only be found beyond Fantastica's borders.

As Falkor and Atreyu search for the borders of Fantastica, Atreyu is flung from Falkor's back in a confrontation with the four Wind Giants and loses AURYN in the [[sea]]. Atreyu lands in the ruins of Spook City, the home of various wicked creatures. Injured by the fall and stranded in the dangerous city, Atreyu finds the [[wolf]] G'mork, chained and near death, who tells him that all the residents of the city have leapt voluntarily into The Nothing. There, thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive phenomenon, they have become lies in the human world. The wolf also reveals that he is a servant of The Manipulators, the force behind The Nothing. They wish to prevent the Empress's chosen hero from saving her. G'mork then reveals that when the princess of the city discovered his [[Betrayal|treachery]] against the Empress, she imprisoned him and left him to starve to death. When Atreyu announces that he is the hero G'mork has sought, the wolf laughs and succumbs to death. However, upon being approached, G'mork's body instinctively seizes Atreyu's [[leg]] in his [[jaw]]s. Meanwhile, Falkor retrieves AURYN from the sea and arrives in time to save Atreyu from the rapid approach of The Nothing.

Falkor and Atreyu go to the Childlike Empress, who assures them they have brought her rescuer to her; Bastian suspects that the Empress means him, but cannot bring himself to believe it. When Bastian refuses to speak the new name, to prompt him into fulfilling his role as savior, the Empress herself locates the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, who possesses a book also entitled ''The Neverending Story'', which the Empress demands he read aloud. As he begins, Bastian is amazed to find the book he is reading is repeating itself, beginning once again whenever the Empress reaches the Old Man—only this time, the story includes Bastian's meeting with Coreander, his theft of the book, and all his actions in the attic. Realizing that the story will repeat itself forever without his intervention, Bastian names the Empress 'Moon Child', and appears with her in Fantastica, where he restores its existence through his own imagination. The Empress has also given him AURYN, on the back of which he finds the inscription "DO WHAT YOU WISH".

For each wish, Bastian loses a memory of his life as a human. Unaware of this at first, Bastian goes through Fantastica, having adventures and telling stories, while losing his memories. In spite of the warnings of Atreyu and Bastian's other friends, Bastian uses AURYN to create creatures and dangers for himself to conquer, which causes some negative side effects for the rest of Fantastica. After encountering the wicked sorceress Xayide, and with the mysterious absence of the Childlike Empress, Bastian decides to take over Fantastica for himself, but is stopped by Atreyu, whom Bastian grievously wounds in battle. Ultimately, a repentant Bastian is reduced to two memories: those of his mother and father, and of his own name. After more adventures, Bastian must give up the memory of his parents to discover that his strongest wish is to be capable of love and give love to others.

After much searching, and on the verge of losing his final memory, Bastian is unable to find the Water of Life with which to leave Fantastica with his memories. Here, he is found by Atreyu. In remorse, Bastian lays down AURYN at his friend's feet, and Atreyu and Falkor enter AURYN with him, where the Water of Life demands to know Bastian's name, and if Bastian has finished all the stories he began in his journey, which he has not. Only after Atreyu gives Bastian's name and promises to complete all the stories for him does the Water of Life allow Bastian to return to the human world, along with some of the mystical waters. He returns to his father, where he tells the full tale of his adventures, and thus reconciles with him. Afterwards, Bastian confesses to Coreander about stealing his book and losing it, but Coreander denies ever owning such a book. Coreander reveals he has also been to Fantastica, and that the book has likely moved into the hands of someone else and that Bastian - like Coreander - will eventually show that individual the way to Fantastica. This, the book concludes, "is another story and shall be told another time".

==Reception==
Susan L. Nickerson of ''[[Library Journal]]'' writes in a review that "Imaginative readers know the story doesn't end when the covers close; the magic to be found in books is eternal, and Ende's message comes through vividly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Nickerson |first=Susan L. |date=1983-10-15 |title=Book Review: Fiction |journal=Library Journal |volume=108 |issue= 18 |page=1975 |publisher=R. R. Bowker Co. |issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The two parts of the novel repeat each other", as [[Maria Nikolajeva]] states in her book ''The Rhetoric of Character in Children's Literature,'' in that Bastian becomes a hero but then in the second half he "acts not even as an antihero but as a false hero of the fairy tale." The characters of Bastian and Atreyu can also be seen as mirror halves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rhetoric of Character in Children's Literature |last=Nikolajeva |first=Maria |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |location= |isbn=0-8108-4886-4 |pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish pop band ''Vetusta Morla'' derived its name from the ancient [[turtle]] in the novel.

===Audiobook===
A German dramatized [[audiobook|audioplay]] under the title ''Die unendliche Geschichte'' (Karussell/Universal Music Group 1984, directed by Anke Beckert, music by [[Frank Duval]], 3 parts on LP and MC, 2 parts on CD).

In March 2012 Tantor Media released an unabridged audiobook of ''The Neverending Story'' narrated by Gerard Doyle.

===Film===
''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]'' was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was released in 1984, directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and starring [[Barret Oliver]] as Bastian, [[Noah Hathaway]] as Atreyu, and [[Tami Stronach]] as the Childlike Empress. It covered only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantastica (renamed "Fantasia" in the film). Ende, who was reportedly "revolted" by the film,&lt;ref name=TDT/&gt; requested they halt production or change the film's name, as he felt it had ultimately and drastically deviated from his novel; when they did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.&lt;ref name="YM_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.plala.or.jp/mig/me1-uk.html|title=Michael Ende Biography|author=Mori, Yoko|accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music was composed by [[Klaus Doldinger]]. Some electronic tracks by [[Giorgio Moroder]] were added to the US version of the film, as well as the titlesong ''Never Ending Story'' composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Keith Forsey]] becoming a chart success for [[Limahl]], the former singer of [[Kajagoogoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=tt0088323|title=Die unendliche Geschichte (1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter]]'', directed by [[George T. Miller]] and starring [[Jonathan Brandis]] and [[Kenny Morrison]], was released in 1990. It used plot elements primarily from the second half of Ende's novel, but told a new tale.

''[[The NeverEnding Story III]]'', starring [[Jason James Richter]], [[Melody Kay]] and [[Jack Black (actor)|Jack Black]], was released in 1994 in Germany and in 1996 in the US. This film was primarily based only upon the characters from Ende's book, having an original new story. The film was lambasted by film critics and was a [[box office bomb]].

===Novels===
From 2003 through 2004, the German publishing house AVAinternational published six novels of different authors in a series called Legends of Fantastica, each using parts of the original plot and characters to compose an entirely new storyline:

===Stage===
In Germany, ''The Neverending Story'' has been variously adapted to a stage play, ballet, and opera&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omm.de/veranstaltungen/musiktheater20032004/TR-HA-die-unendliche-geschichte.html |title=Die unendliche Geschichte |publisher=Online Musik Magazin |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered at the Linz Landestheater on December 11, 2004. The scores to both the opera and the ballet versions were composed by [[Siegfried Matthus]]. The opera libretto was by Anton Perry.

===Television===
The [[The Neverending Story (TV series)|1995 animated series]] was produced by Nelvana, under the title of ''The Neverending Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux''. The animated series ran for two years, and had a total of twenty-six episodes. Director duties were split between Marc Boreal and Mike Fallows. Each episode focused on Bastian's further adventures in Fantastica, largely different from his further adventures in the book, but occasionally containing elements of them.

''[[Tales from the Neverending Story]]'', a one-season-only TV series that is loosely based on Michael Ende's novel ''The Neverending Story'', was produced in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through December 2000-August 2002 and distributed by Muse Entertainment, airing on HBO in 2002. It was aired as four two-hour television movies in the US and as a TV series of 13 one-hour episodes in the UK. The series was released on DVD in 2001.

===Google Doodle===
On 1 September 2016, a [[Google Doodle]], created by Google artist Sophie Diao commemorated the publication of the work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/doodles/37th-anniversary-of-the-neverending-storys-first-publishing 37th Anniversary of The Neverending Story's First Publishing, ''google.com''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer games===
A [[text adventure]] game was released by [[Ocean Software]] in 1985 for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Atari 800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006740 |title=NeverEnding Story, The |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A computer game based on the second film was released in 1990 by Merimpex Ltd under their Linel label and re-released by System 4 for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0003395 |title=Neverending Story II, The |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the German video game studio attraction published their Ende-inspired video game, ''[[The Real Neverending Story Part 1: Auryn Quest|AURYN Quest]]''.&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/auryn-quest|title=''Auryn Quest'' for Windows|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="667">According to [[Dagobert D. Runes]], Dictionary of Philosophy, 1942, '''theistic personalism''' is "the theory most generally held by [[Personalists]] that God is the ground of all being, immanent in and transcendent over the whole world of reality. It is pan-psychic but avoids [[pantheism]] by asserting the complementary nature of immanence and transcendence which come together in and are in some degree essential to all personality. The term is used for the modern form of [[theism]]. Immanence and transcendence are the contrapletes of personality." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ditext.com/runes/t.html www.ditext.com]

'''Thomas Davidson''' (25 October 1840 – 14 September 1900) was a Scottish-American philosopher and lecturer.

==Biography==
Davidson was born of Presbyterian parents at Old Deer, near [[Aberdeen]]. After graduating from Aberdeen University (1860) as first graduate and Greek prizeman, he held the position of rector of the grammar school of Old Aberdeen (1860–1863). From 1863 until 1866, he was master in several English schools, spending his vacations on the continent. In 1866 he moved to Canada, to occupy a place in the London Collegiate Institute. In the following year, he came to the United States, and, after spending some months in [[Boston]], moved to [[St. Louis]], where, in addition to work on the New York ''Round Table'' and the ''Western Educational Monthly'', he was classical master in the St. Louis high school, and subsequently principal of one of the branch high schools.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

In 1875, he moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  He traveled extensively, and became a proficient linguist, acquiring a knowledge of French, German, Italian, Spanish, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

In Greece, he devoted himself mainly to archaeology and modern Greek. He wrote ''Fragments of [[Parmenides]]'' (1869). In Italy, he studied the [[Catholic Church]], [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]], [[Dante]], and [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]]. For studying the Catholic Church, unusual opportunities were thrown open to him, chiefly through the Princess Carolyne of Sayn-Wittgenstein and [[Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingfürst|Cardinal Hohenlohe]], who offered him an apartment in his episcopal palace at [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], and also in the [[Villa d'Este]] at [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]]. His interest in [[Thomas Aquinas]] having come to the ears of the pope through Bishop (later Cardinal) Schiatlino, he was invited to the Vatican, where the pope suggested that he should settle in Rome and aid his professors in editing the new edition of St. Thomas. For more than a year he lived at [[Domodossola]], in Piedmont, where the Institute of Charity, founded by [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]], has its novitiate. Here he produced the work that first brought Rosmini to the notice of English-speaking students: ''The Philosophical System of Antonio Rosmini-Serbati, translated, with a Sketch of the Author's Life, Bibliography, Introduction, and Notes'' (London, 1882). At the same time he wrote essays on classical subjects, mainly archaeological, published under the title ''The Parthenon Frieze and Other Essays'' (London, 1882). He also translated Rosmini's ''Psychology'' (3 vols., London, 1884). In 1883, he occupied a villa in Capri, and there translated Rosmini's ''Anthropology''. Davidson was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and delivered courses of lectures, before the [[Lowell Institute]] in Boston and elsewhere, on modern Greece, on Greek sculpture, etc. He was mainly instrumental in founding "[[The Fellowship of the New Life]]," which had branches in London and New York.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske|1900}}

Davidson's most successful work was in connection with the [[Educational Alliance]] in New York, where he attained wide popularity by a series of lectures on sociology. A special class was formed for [[Jewish]] young men and women, whom he introduced to the great writers on sociology and their problems. He aimed at founding among them what he called a 
"Breadwinners' College," but his work was cut short by his sudden death in [[Montreal]], Quebec.

==Apeirotheism&lt;!--'Apeirotheism' redirects here--&gt;==
Thomas Davidson taught a philosophy called '''apeirotheism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; that has been described as a "form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism..."&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Bakewell, "Thomas Davidson," Dictionary of American Biography, gen. ed. Dumas Malone (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932), 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, he preferred to identify his philosophy as apeirotheism, an appellation he defined as "a theory of Gods infinite in number." The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of the soul and Nous. Aristotle's "soul" is the rational, living aspect of a living substance and cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance, but rather an essence; Nous is rational thought and understanding. Davidson argued that Aristotle's Nous identified God with rational thought, and that God could not exist apart from the world just as the Aristotlean soul could not exist apart from the body. Thus Davidson grounded an immanent Emersonian World Soul in a sophisticated Aristotelian metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Journal, 1884–1898 (Thomas Davidson Collection, Manuscript Group #169, Sterling Memorial Library, Yale University). Quoted in DeArmey, "Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism," 692&lt;/ref&gt;

Though initially a panentheist, Davidson's studies in Domodossola—including the work of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Giordano Bruno,  Leibniz, Kant, and Rosmini—led him to a panpsychistic monadology, a theory that reality consists of an infinite number of mental or spiritual substances, each with an Aristotelian telos.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, panentheism is the view that, not only are man and nature modes or elements of God, as in pantheism, but God also transcends nature. Davidson co-authored a book on Bruno that was published in 1890. Brinton, Daniel G. and Thomas Davidson, Giordano Bruno, Philosopher and Martyr—Two Addresses (Philadelphia: McKay, 1890).&lt;/ref&gt; Human psyches are unique however, because they possess autonomy, which provides the potential to become divine through proper, moral association with other human psyches. This allowed Davidson to reject pantheism, which, he reasoned, led to a God "scattered through the universe...so that the total [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] exists only in the sum of things taken together." Rather, Davidson argued, God exists everywhere, but he "exists fully or completely" in each monad. Reality is a Göttergemeinschaft, a society of gods; metaphysical, social and spiritual unity is moral rather than ontological.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Davidson, "Noism," The Index  (29 April 1886), 525. Concerning Davidson's views on pantheism, see his letter to Havelock Ellis, 20 October 1883. Quoted in Knight, 41. Cf. DeArmey,  "Thomas Davidson's Apeirotheism," 698.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidson's religious philosophy had important consequences for social thought. Apeirotheism was utterly democratic and perfectionistic because it entailed that each individual has the potential to be a God, although restrictive social relations have thwarted the development of most people's potential. For Davidson, because we contain the divine within us, our unfettered natural instincts would impel us to act morally. As individuals became increasingly aware of the divine within themselves, so they became increasingly moral.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, "The Power Not Ourselves," The Index  (15 October 1885), 184. Cf. Davidson, The Philosophy of Goethe's Faust, ed. Charles M. Bakewell (New York: Haskell House, 1969), 157–58.&lt;/ref&gt; James believed this individualistic religion made Davidson "indifferent...to socialisms and general administrative panaceas." According to James, Davidson taught that "Life must be flexible. You ask for a free man and these Utopias give you an interchangeable part, with a fixed number, in a rule-bound social organism." &lt;ref&gt;James, [https://books.google.com/?id=z2b4uK1ykmsC&amp;pg=PA107 "Professor William James's Reminiscences,"] in Memorials of Thomas Davidson, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Apeirotheism called for the release of each individual's potential divinity through self-cultivation and the nurturing of others rather than through changes in one's material conditions. Davidson was convinced that this release would lead to the only true reform of human society; it was to this task that he devoted the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Anne C. Rose, Transcendentalism as a Social Movement, 1830–1850 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1981), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions''''' (1845) is a book by [[Søren Kierkegaard]].

==History==
Kierkegaard published ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' between the years 1843 and 1844 as well as a number of [[pseudonymous]] books.  His category from ''[[Either/Or]]'' is to choose and his category from his discourses is the "single individual". He has let the reader know that he or she should pay attention to the prefaces in his works and has one in this book which speaks about "[[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]" and the "[[Appropriation (education)|appropriation]]" of meaning and has repeatedly said that he didn't have the "authority to ''preach'' or to ''teach''." Here, in his Preface, he wrote: "This little book, which might be called a book of occasional addresses, although it has neither the occasion which creates the speaker and gives him authority, nor the occasion that creates the hearer and makes him a learner, is lacking in the legitimation of a [[Religious calling|call]], and is thus in its shortcomings without excuse. It is without assistance from external circumstances, and thus quite helpless in its elaboration."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong ''Preface''&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote of an apostle who didn't have the easiest time being a Christian. "Now [[Apostle Paul|Paul]]! Did he live in the favor of the mighty so that it could commend his teaching? No, he was a prisoner! Did the wise hail his teaching so that their reputation could guarantee its truth? No, to them it was foolishness. Was his teaching capable of quickly supplying the individual with a supranatural power, did it offer itself for sale to people through legerdemain? No, it had to be acquired slowly, appropriated in the ordeal that began with the renunciation of everything."&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 82-84&lt;/ref&gt; Would Paul have become a Christian if he knew what was in store for him? Each single individual has a future and there comes a time when a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects. Paul wrote about his own experiences in his [[epistles]] and Kierkegaard thought this was a legitimate way to preach about Christianity. But he stressed indirect communication. {{Quote|The law of delicacy by which an author is permitted to use what he has himself experienced is that he never says the truth but keeps the truth for himself and only lets it emerge in different ways. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Journals and Papers'' IV A 161&lt;ref&gt;He used this idea in Stages on Life's Way. His first section, the confessions of the lovers of women was called [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/kierkegaard/selections/files/veritas.htm ''In Vino Veritas'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In these final three discourses of his [[Søren Kierkegaard#Authorship (1843–1846)|first authorship]] he chooses to write about [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] before God about guilt, sin, forgiveness, marriage and death and the answers that seem to come or don't seem to come to the inquiring individual. {{Quotation|He who knocks-to him, shall it be opened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew 7:7–8]]&lt;/ref&gt; And even if God does not immediately open, be comforted. Imagine an older person who sat in his room making some preparations to please a child who is to visit him at a certain time. But the child came too early. He knocked, but it was not opened to him. The child could see that there was somebody in the room, because there was a light. The child's knocking therefore was certainly heard; and yet the door was not opened. So the child became disconsolate. Ah, but why was not the door opened? Because the preparations for the child's happiness were not yet quite finished. ''Meditations from Kierkegaard'', by [[Thomas Henry Croxall]] 1955 p. 99 ''Journals'' VIII 586}}

==Structure==
Soren Aaby Kierkegaard had ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' published April 29, 1845 and ''Stages on Life's Way'' April 30, 1845. Both books were divided into three sections: confession, marriage, and death; three crucial occasions in the life of each single individual. David F.

===What It Means to Seek God===
Many times an individual has a physical sickness and goes to the physician for help. But is that the only kind of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories.&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong 266-267, 314-315 ''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 27, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol, p. 155, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong 1993 p. 11-15, Concluding Unscientific Discourse, Hong p. 488-490, "Meditations from Kierkegaard'', Thomas Croxall, p. 137 (''Journals of Soren Kierkegaard X2 A206''), ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay, p. 132-137&lt;/ref&gt; We "must want to understand the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 222-227&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in [[The Sickness Unto Death]] Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lowrie, translation of Kierkegaard's ''Fear and Trembling, Soren Kierkegaard ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong, p. 75-76, 339-340, and ''The Sickness Unto Death'', 1941, 1974 p. 240-254&lt;/ref&gt; Robert L. Perkins from [[Mercer University]] published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to [[fear]] and [[Wonder (emotion)|wonder]] within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Prefaces and Writing Sampler: And, Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' in the sources below p. 169ff&lt;/ref&gt;

He suspected his father, Michael, suffered from this "sickness of the spirit" because of something he had done as a young man or while grieving the loss of his first wife. [[Lee M. Hollander]] thought he was afraid he had committed the [[Eternal sin]], one that can never be forgiven. Kierkegaard called his gaining knowledge of his father's sin the "great earthquake". Maybe he heard someone say that cursing God was the unforgivable sin or that fornication was the unforgivable sin.  Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's [[anxiety]] and others like him who believe that God shuts his door against them.&lt;ref&gt;He stated this thought more clearly in his 1847 book: ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits''. &lt;blockquote&gt;Who has not experienced what powers worry can give a person, how he both cunningly and powerfully knows how to defend himself against the comfort, how he is able to do what no commander is ordinarily able to do-to lead the very same defense briskly into the struggle again in the very same moment his worry’s defense is disarmed! Who has not seen how the passion in worry can provide a person with such a power of thought and expression that the comforter himself almost becomes afraid of it! Who has not experienced that scarcely anyone desiring something can speak as ingratiatingly in order to win over another as a worried person can speak fascinatingly in order to convince himself once again-and his comforter-that there is no comfort! But when this is the case, when the worried one has become stronger, at times, alas, actually the stronger because of the magnitude of his affliction, is there then nothing at all that can be done? Certainly there is. In that case one tries to prompt the worried one to enter into someone else’s suffering, and the person who is himself unwilling to accept comfort from another person is often willing to share in another’s cares, to become worried with someone else and on behalf of someone else. In this way the struggle is forgotten. While the worried one sadly suffers with another, his mind is set at ease. Hong translation p. 201-202 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He asks, “How does a person get to know that he is the greatest sinner?”&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong 1993 p. 30, ''Stages on Life's Way,'' Hong p. 250-252&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard started in ''Either/Or'' with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' where he remarked; "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of [[sin]] that it is [[selfish]]ness."&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Anxiety'', Nichol 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; His father was only twelve when he cursed God and didn't have faith that God would forgive him. [[Goethe]] had the same problem because he had many experiences while he was still young.&lt;ref&gt;See Book Seven of [https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyofg00goet#page/218/mode/2up ''The Autobiography of Johann Goethe'', p. 218ff]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard was very interested in the way children are educated; see Practice in Christianity, Hong p. 174ff, Three Imagined Discourses, Swenson translation p. 53-58, 87ff., 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Of very few authors can it be said with the same literalness as, of Kierkegaard that their life is their works: as if to furnish living proof of his untiring insistence on inwardness, his life, like that of so many other spiritual educators of the race, is notably poor in incidents; but his life of inward experiences is all the richer - witness the "literature within a literature" that came to be within a few years and that gave to Danish letters a score of immortal works. Kierkegaard's physical heredity must be pronounced unfortunate. Being the child of old parents -his father was fifty‑seven, his mother forty‑five years. At his birth (May 5, 1813), he had a weak physique and a feeble constitution. Still worse, he inherited from his father a burden of [[Melancholia|melancholy]] which he took a sad pride in masking under a show of sprightliness. His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, had begun life as a poor cotter's boy in West [[Jutland]], where he was set to tend the sheep on the wild moorlands. One day, we are told, oppressed by loneliness and cold, he ascended a hill and in a passionate rage cursed God who had given him this miserable existence - the memory of which "[[Eternal sin|sin against the Holy Ghost]]" he was not able to shake off to the end of his long life. When seventeen years old, the gifted lad was sent to his uncle in Copenhagen, who was a well‑to‑do dealer in woolens and groceries. Kierkegaard quickly established himself in the trade and amassed a considerable fortune. This enabled him to withdraw from active life when only forty, and to devote himself to philosophic studies, the leisure for which life had till then denied him. More especially he seems to have studied the works of the rationalistic philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]]. After the early death of his first wife who left him no issue, he married a former servant in his household, also of Jutish stock, who bore him seven children. Of these only two survived him, the oldest son - later bishop - Peder Christian, and the youngest son, Sören Åbye.

Hollander, Published 1923 by University of Texas in Austin, Introduction p. 12 and See this entry from the [http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/II_A.html ''Journals and Papers of Kierkegaard 2A805'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Speculative reason|speculative]] individuals want to express their opinion about the mysteries of the Christian religion and the nature of sin and guilt. Kierkegaard warns against doing this, because "the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge,"&lt;ref&gt;Three Discourses On Imagined Occasions, Soren Kierkegaard, June 17, 1844,  Hong 1993 p. 35ff&lt;/ref&gt; knowing is one thing, doing another. "If anyone has the task of preaching or teaching others about their guilt, of teaching-something that this discourse, which is without authority, does not do-he does have the consolation that the purest heart is precisely the one most willing to comprehend his own [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] most deeply."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Imaginary Discourses'', Hong p. 14-15, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 481-482&lt;/ref&gt;  Kierkegaard asked every single individual these questions in his 1847 book, ''Works of Love'' in an effort to show how useless it is to compare sin for sin and guilt for guilt. {{Quotation|Tell me if it is possible to speak about this verse that says love is the fulfilling of the Law without judging against one’s will, even if it is one’s will only to judge oneself! Is there any more accurate expression for how infinitely far a person is from fulfilling the requirement than this, that the distance is so great that he actually cannot begin to calculate it, cannot total up the account! Not only is so much neglected every day, to say nothing of what guilt is incurred, but when some time has passed, one is not even able to state accurately the guilt as it once appeared to oneself, because time changes and mitigates one’s judgment of the past-but, alas, no amount of time changes the requirement, eternity’s requirement-that love is the fulfilling of the Law. (Romans 10.4), (Romans 13.10), (1 Timothy 1.5) Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love 1847, Hong 1995 p. 134}}

[[File:Black screen of the camera 2014-04-24 19-20.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Kierkegaard's world of the Spirit&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''The Point of View for My Work as An Author'', Lowrie translation, 1939, 1962 p. 128 ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;]]Kierkegaard was interested in "how" one comes to acquire knowledge. [[Adolph Peter Adler]]s experience may have influenced him. He identified his audience as the "reader" and the "listener"&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 35ff&lt;/ref&gt; but now he speaks of the "seeker". He says, "''no man can see God without purity'' and that ''no man can know God without becoming a sinner''. [[Dostoevsky]] tried to reproduce this concept in his art.&lt;ref&gt;There is a special appropriateness in the contention that before man can be rooted in Christ, he must first be unrooted and uprooted. [[Personality]] is to be viewed in its ultimate relationship with God. Here, once more, Dostoevsky renders in his art what Kierkegaard diagnostically posits in his ''Thoughts on Crucial Situation in Human Life'': “No man can see God without becoming a sinner.”[https://books.google.com/books?id=nfBZDaTsfhUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=kierkegaard&amp;f=false ''Dostoevsky's Spiritual Art: The Burden of Vision'' by George Andrew Panichas 1985, 2005, 2009 Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey p. 133 2004041285]&lt;/ref&gt; In Stages on Life's Way, published the next day, he used [[David]] and [[Solomon]] as examples of those prototypes who did become pure in God's sight by becoming sinners. "While David lay upon the ground with crushed and contrite heart, Solomon arose from his couch, but his understanding was crushed. Horror seized him when he thought of what it was to be God’s elect. He surmised that holy intimacy with God, the sincerity of the pure man before the Lord, was not the explanation, but that a private guilt was the secret which explained everything."&lt;ref&gt;''Stages on Life’s Way'', 1845 Lowrie, Schoken edition 1967 p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

He speaks of finding God in the "darkness" and the "stillness"&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Three Imaginary Discourses'', Swenson p. 9, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; and "of this stillness and its power and the infinite nothing into which it plunges all dissimilarities, even those of wrongs and forgiveness, and of the abyss into which the solitary one sinks in stillness."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Three Imaginary Discourses'', Swenson p. 18, 38&lt;/ref&gt; And asks, "Is it so easy to become still?"&lt;ref&gt;''Three Imaginary Discourses'', Hong p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; This, then, is his [[imaginative]] creation of the world of the spirit and he lets the reader know that it's imaginative in his title.

He also wrote much about "expectancy"&lt;ref&gt;"Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that which unites all human life is passion, and faith is a passion. ''Fear and Trembling'', Hong p. 67 With a smile or with tears, one confesses that expectancy is in the soul originally. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; and where it is found. Now he writes about the darkness, stillness, the "[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/unknown unknown]" and sin. He says "sin is the common lot of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Three Imaginary Discourses'', Swenson p. 15, Hong 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Quotation|There was a time in the world when humankind, weary of wonder, weary of fate, turned away from the external and discovered that there was no object of wonder, that the unknown was a nothing and wonder a deception. What once was life’s substance comes again in the repetition of the race.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, Point of View, Lowrie p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;.... It is so hard to find God that one even demonstrates that he exists and finds a demonstration necessary. Let the work of the [[Christian apologetics|demonstrating]] be hard, let it in particular give trouble to the person who is to understand that it demonstrates something. For the one who is demonstrating it is an easy matter, because he has come to stand on the outside and is not dealing with God but is discussing something about God. If, however, seeking is to mean that one is oneself changed, then let the seeker look to himself.  .... If a speaker had a voice like the thunder of the heavens, a countenance that struck terror, if he knew how to aim with his eyes, and now as you sat there, my listener, he pointed at you and said, “You, there, you are a sinner,” and even did it with such force that your eyes dropped to the ground and the blood drained from your cheeks and you perhaps did not recover from the impact for a long time, then you certainly would realize that in so behaving he was transforming the setting into a burlesque theater, where he played the buffoon, and you would deplore his having disturbed you in finding stillness.

===Love Conquers All===
"Where is [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ernest earnestness] learned? In life." And how can earnestness be lost? How is it related to the resolution? Does "love conquer everything?"&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 45-50&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard thinks, "a true conception of life and of oneself is required for the resolution of marriage; but this already implies the second great requirement, which is just like the first: a true conception of God. No one can have a true conception of God without having a corresponding conception of life and oneself, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of God, or a true conception of life without a corresponding conception of oneself. But a true conception of God is required; an understanding between God and the happy one is required, and thus a [[language]] is required in which they talk to each other. This language is the [[leap of faith|resolution]], the only language in which God will involve himself with a human being."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 63, Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, Hong p. 11-12, 102, 113&lt;/ref&gt;  He asks, "Where does a person find guidance if he himself does not work out his own soul's salvation in [[fear and trembling]]"?&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 48, 50, 52, 60ff, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', Hong p. 11-12, 102, 113&lt;/ref&gt; He's writing about the wedding ceremony in this discourse just as he wrote about it in ''Either/Or'' and ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Either/Or Part II'', Hong p. 59ff&lt;/ref&gt; Here he presents his own imaginative construction of the value of the single individual making a decision about marriage in the presence of God. Even though he never married he still knows that "the adult learns only by appropriating and he essentially appropriates the essential only by doing it."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|[[File:Kierkegaard-Dostoyevsky-Nietzsche-Sartre.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, Sartre; all [[sinners]]]]Aye, the world never has a lack of guides.&lt;ref&gt;See Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'',  Hong p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Behold, here is the man who would guide everybody, and cannot help himself. Now one is proclaimed as wise, and admiration recognizes him as such because he cannot even understand what the common man understands. Now someone has a power of eloquence and leads astray, having the powerful works of untruth. Now what we have learned from childhood has become old-fashioned, and we must learn it all over again. Now someone would tear a husband from his wife’s side, make him important through participation in great enterprises, and teach him to think slightingly about the sacred [[vocation]] of marriage. Now one would tempt the wife, and teach her to sigh under the heavy yoke of matrimony. Now one dangles before the husband and wife a community fellowship that makes the marriage relation unimportant. Now one would teach the married couple to enjoy life, taking the children and therewith the cares of life away from them, so that the parents can live for higher things. And then our expectations are tensed by something extraordinary, a new order of things to come, and we all, both married and unmarried, get a vacation, like children because the schoolmaster is moving, and are free until he gets settled. But we are no longer school children, and everyone shall give an account of himself before God, and the sacred obligation shall give every day its task&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 133, 159-169&lt;/ref&gt; and its responsibility. Where then do we find guidance if we do not work out our own soul’s salvation with fear and trembling, for thus we become really earnest? (See also ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 179)
*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Life'', (1845) Swenson translation (1941) p. 65-66}}

An "observer" may say that the resolution of love was lacking because the marriage didn't work out but how does the observer know that? Perhaps "it wanted a [[Regeneration (theology)|rebirth]] of erotic love" or of "earnestness".&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 55ff, 35&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[poet]] looks for the "rare individual" in order to demonstrate love's rebirth. Kierkegaard almost married [[Regine Olsen]] but changed his mind. Perhaps he wanted her to help him in his vocation as a writer just as Lillian Marvin Swenson helped her husband David and Edna H. Hong helped [[Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library|Howard V Hong]] later in life. He used that experience to build himself up rather than tear himself down. He places the responsibility on the individual listener, reader, watcher, or "doer".&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 59-61&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated his idea of hope and courage in the face of doubt in his Journals and again in this book. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a world of difference between proud courage which dares to fear the worst and the humble courage which dares to hope for the best. My Lord God, give me once more the courage to hope; merciful God let me hope once again, fructify my barren and infertile mind. My doubt is terrible.-Nothing can withstand it-it is a cursed hunger and I can swallow up every argument, every consolation and sedative-I rush at 10,000 miles a second through every obstacle. It is a positive starting point for philosophy when Aristotle says that philosophy begins with wonder, not as in our day with doubt. Moreover the world will learn that the thing is not to begin with the negative, and the reason why it has succeeded up to the present is that it has never really given itself over to the negative, and so has never seriously done what it said. Its doubt is mere child’s play. For the rights of understanding to be valid one must venture out into life, out on the sea and lift up one’s voice, even though God hears it not, and not stand on the shore and watch others fighting and struggling-only then does understanding acquire its ''official sanction'', for to stand on one leg and prove God’s existence is a very different thing from going on one’s knees and thanking him. Soren Kierkegaard's ''Journals'' November 15, 1841&lt;ref&gt;The Soul of Kierkegaard: Selections from His Journals, published by Courier Corporation, Jul 12, 2012 p. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even if the appointed guide in the place where you live were incompetent, well, if you so choose, be the good listener who still benefits from his mediocre [[discourse]]." Kierkegaard continues, "And if the person speaking here is perhaps too young or perhaps expresses himself unclearly or his thought is unclear-well, my listener, then put the discourse aside, or, if you choose, do the great thing, be a good reader who benefits even from an inadequate discourse. As a matter of fact, just as there is supposed to be a power of discourse that can almost work miracles, so there is also a listener’s power that can work [[miracle]]s if the listener so chooses. That kind of listener is the earnest listener. He says, “I want to be built up,” and so he is built up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Psychologist]] [[Rollo May]] referred to this in his book, ''Freedom and Destiny''&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Freedom is continually creating itself. As Kierkegaard puts it, freedom is expansiveness. Freedom has an infinite quality. This ever-new set of possibilities is part of the reason psychology has by and large evaded the subject, for freedom cannot be pinned down as psychologists are wont to do. In psychotherapy the closest we can get to discerning freedom in action is when a person experiences “I can” or “I will.” When a client in therapy says either of these, I always make sure he knows that I heard it from him; for “can” and “will” are statements of personal freedom, even if only in fantasy. These verbs point to some event in the future, either immediate or long term. They also imply that the person who uses them senses some power, some possibility, and is aware of ability to use this power.   ''Freedom and Destiny''  By Rollo May p. 53 W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1999&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; But the earnestness lies in the resolution." ''Three Discourses on Imaged Occasions, On the Occasion of a Wedding'',  Soren Kierkegaard, June 17, 1844,  Hong 1993 p. 62}}

His book ''Either/Or'' discussed whether or not love can be deceived. Is it a good thing to find out you have been deceived or is it something that makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his [[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] where he quoted ''The [[Epistle of James]]'', ''Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God.'' (James 1:17-22)&lt;ref&gt;Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 170, 193-201; James 1:17-22&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. ''There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.''&lt;ref&gt;Galatians, 3: 23&lt;/ref&gt; He asks pointed questions, "Did the woman who was a sinner&lt;ref&gt;Luke 7:36-50&lt;/ref&gt; feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, but it is also a lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness. Leave it solely to God-after all, he knows best how to take care of everything for one who becomes alone by seeking him."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Decisiveness of Death===
Kierkegaard has been writing about the confession of sin before God, confession of love for another before God and how an individual learns to make a resolution. Now he's writing about "death's decision" and the "earnestness"&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard says, "Earnestness is: that we should not be overhasty in acquiring an opinion with regard to death. In all earnestness the uncertainty of death continually takes the liberty of making an inspection to see whether the opinion-holder actually does have this opinion-that is, makes an inspection to see whether his life expresses it. ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; that death brings into the world. Death says, “I exist; if anyone wants to learn from me, then let him come to me.”&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 76, 80, 96, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;

Many individuals want to be teachers of mankind but Kierkegaard has emphasized the teachers that accompany man from one generation to another. He wrote of Abraham, Job, The Apostle Paul, and Anna and Simeon as teachers of mankind in his ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' and [[Johann Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Hegel]] as teachers of [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]]. But he's writing about the earnest confession before God, marriage, and death as teachers of another kind that accompanies mankind from generation to generation. Later he uses the "lily of the field and the bird of the air"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34%2CLuke+12%3A22-32&amp;version=ASV Matthew 6 and Luke 12]&lt;/ref&gt; to teach what it means to be a human being where he calls them the "divinely appointed teachers".&lt;ref&gt;Prayer: Father in heaven! From you come only good and perfect gifts. It must also be beneficial to comply with the counsel and teaching of whomever you have appointed as a teacher of human beings, as a counselor to the worried. Grant, then, that the one who is worried may truly learn from the divinely appointed teachers: the lilies in the field and the birds of the air! Amen. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847 Hong translation p. 157ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard says, "Just as death’s decision is not definable by equality, so it is likewise not definable by inequality."&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 90-92&lt;/ref&gt; Death is not the way all become equal but being able to go before God as a single individual is what creates equality for all since God shows no partiality and God has created death as the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inexplicable inexplicable].&lt;ref&gt;''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 19, 47, 90ff, 101-102, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1992 p. 165ff Kierkegaard used the [[Epistle of James]] often in his ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses''. [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A1-13&amp;version=ESV ''James 2:1'' The Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, Hong p. 141, 280&lt;/ref&gt; 
Therefore, God doesn't deal with the crowd but with the single individual as the one having [[The Concept of Anxiety|anxiety]] and worry. The king and the beggar are equal before God and the beggar is no more to pray against the king than the king is to pray against the beggar. The same goes for the man and the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203&amp;version=KJV Galatians 3], Soren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'', Swenson p. 23ff, ''Point of View,'' Lowrie p. 38-39 and ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p.89-92, Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest His Imperial Highness is able to do, however, is to make the decision before God.

With regard to the accidental, the length of time is the essential factor, as with happiness, for example-the end alone decides whether one has been happy. With incidental work, which is in the external, it is essential that the work be finished. But the essential work is not defined essentially by time and the external, insofar as death is the interruption. Earnestness, therefore, becomes the living of each day as if it were the last and also the first in a long life, and the choosing of work that does not depend on whether one is granted a lifetime to complete it well or only a brief time to have begun it well. 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Hong p. 96}}

==Criticism==
Kierkegaard published these discourses by himself in the usual edition of 525 copies with only 175 sold by 1847. A second edition was published in 1875. He had already finished his ''Concluding Postscript'' and delivered it to Luno, his printer, by December 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Hong’s Introduction to ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', Soren Kierkegaard, ''The Point of View for My Work as an Author'', Lowrie p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Søren Kierkegaard#The Corsair Affair|Corsair Affair]] occupied some of his time and caused him some anxiety after 1845. Later, February 7, 1846, he wrote in his diary "it is now my intention to qualify as a pastor. For several months I have been praying to God to help me ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Journals and Papers of Soren Kierkegaard'' VII A 4&lt;/ref&gt; He didn't want to preach in a huge church but rather in a small church where he could speak to the single individual. He had already preached one sermon at [[Trinitatis Church]] in Copenhagen on February 24, 1844&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Climacus Or, ''De Omnibus Dubitandum Est'' And A Sermon, by Soren Kierkegaard as translated by Thomas Henry Croxall in 1958. pages 157-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Sermon Preached at Trinity Church, 1844 (Kierkegaard)|Here are some quotes from Wikiquote]]&lt;/ref&gt; so he has some experience but is still full of imaginative constructions.&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 625-630&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|I have often [[imagination|imagined]] myself in a [[pastor]]’s place. If the crowds storm to hear him, if the great arch of the church cannot contain the great throngs and people even stand outside listening to him-well, honor and praise to one so gifted that his feelings are gripped, that he can talk as one inspired, inspired by the sight of the crowds, because where the crowd is there must be truth, inspired by the thought that there has to be a little for some, because there are a lot of people, and a lot of people with a little truth is surely truth-to me this would be impossible! But suppose it was a Sunday afternoon, the weather was gloomy and miserable, the winter storm emptied the streets, everyone who had a warm apartment let God wait in the church for better weather-if there were sitting in the empty church a couple of poor women who had no heat in the apartment and could just as well freeze in the church, indeed, I could talk both them and myself warm!

I have often imagined myself beside a grave. If all the people of honor and distinction were assembled there, if solemnity pervaded the whole great throng-well, honor and praise to one so gifted that he could add to the solemnity by being prompted to be the interpreter of the throng, to be the expression for the truth of sorrow-I could not do it! But if it was a poor hearse and it was accompanied by no one but a poor old woman, the widow of the dead man, who had never before experienced having her husband go away without taking her along-if she were to ask me, on my honor I would give a funeral oration as well as anyone. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Journals and Papers V 5948 (Pap. VII A 176)'' 1846 p. 367-368 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong}}

David F. Swenson translated many of Kierkegaard's works into English and helped introduce him to the English reading public as early as 1916. His translation was published in 1941. He wrote a short introduction stating that "God is a person; His will is the everlasting distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness, good and evil; it is goodness and love. Love and righteousness do not attach to impersonal things or essences; the idea of good is not good."&lt;ref&gt;''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'', Introduction, David F. Swenson&lt;/ref&gt; Swenson discussed this same book again when he translated Kierkegaard's ''Edifying Discourses'' in 1945. He said, "Only in this final group of discourses, which, while outside the eighteen, essentially belong with them (''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life''), which appeared in 1845 and was written to accompany the ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments|Postscript]]'' has God become a person, and the Christian faith is a concrete personal attitude."&lt;ref&gt;''Edifying Discourses'', Soren Kierkegaard, Volume III, Translated from the Danish by David F. Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson 1945, 1957 P. ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] reminds the reader that Kierkegaard has said, 'With my right hand I held out the ''Edifying Discourses'', with my left the aesthetic works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'' and ''Stages on Life’s Way'', then ''Three Discourses in Various Spirits'' with ''A Literary Review''; and ''The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air'' with ''Either/Or'', 2nd edition.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lowrie, ''A Short Life of Kierkegaard'', 1942, 1970 P. 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.

Howard V. Hong said Kierkegaard had “seeds for more than six discourses in mind; Three on Peter’s Denial of Christ, three on the Canaanite Woman, and two on suffering as guilty or innocent, as well as funeral addresses to the king’s deceased valet and for the prophetess Anna. He pared this down to the ''Three Imagined Discourses'' published here in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Howard V. Hong, Historical Introduction to ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions''. P. ix 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gates barely mentions the Imagined Discourses in his book on the life of Kierkegaard, but he does see it as a turning point in the development of his vocation and gives an insight into his manner of writing. {{Quotation|On the day before the publication of ''Stages on Life’s Way'', Kierkegaard had published a book under his own name, entitled ''Three Occasional Discourses''. His prolific authorship in these years was due in part to the tremendous urge of his creative genius, and in part to his serious purpose to confront men with Christianity. Such productivity represented a vast amount of sheer, grinding hard work. He rose every morning, gave thanks to God, and then to work, with time off only for meals and his midday walk. Sometimes he interrupted work in the evening to appear at the theater for about ten minutes in order to maintain the fiction that he was a loafer.&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, ''Point of View'', Lowrie p. 49ff&lt;/ref&gt; At a set time in the evening he stopped his work, again gave thanks to God, and so to bed and to sleep. Writing had become his vocation, and he pursued it with single-minded devotion." ''The Life and Thought of Kierkegaard for Everyman'', by John A Gates 1960 p. 91-93&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lifeandthoughtof031098mbp#page/n93/mode/2u ''The Life and Thought of Kierkegaard for Everyman'', by John A Gates 1960 p. 91-93]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gregor Malantschuk, said Kierkegaard's first eighteen discourses were about [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/resignation resignation]. "The individual learns in everything to bend his will to God and to endure patiently his destiny. Then he published ''Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions'', the first of which treats of man's aspiration toward God and his meeting with God and gives a deep insight into the development of man's conception of God. The second discusses the gravity of the wedding vow and the responsibility to God in establishing a marriage. the last is a solemn enlightening meditation on death." Malantschuk goes on to say, "None of these discourses has yet arrived at the distinctively [[Christian]]. For this there must first be a long preparation."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Malantschuk, ''Kierkegaard's Way to the Truth'', 1963 Augsburg Publishing House p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tsaparang''' was the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Guge]] in the [[Garuda Valley]], through which the upper [[Sutlej River]] flows, in [[Ngari Prefecture]] (Western Tibet) near the border of [[Ladakh]]. It is 278&amp;nbsp;km south-southwest of [[Shiquanhe|Senggezangbo Town]] and 26&amp;nbsp;km west of the 11th-century monastery at [[Thöling]], and not far west of [[Mount Kailash]] and [[Lake Manasarovar]]. The Tsaparang [[Dzong]] was located here. Nearby is the [[Bon (religion)|Bon]] monastery of [[Gurugem monastery|Gurugem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Allen (writer)|Allen, Charles]]. (1999) ''The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History'', pp. 265-6. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: 2000 Abacus Books, London. {{ISBN|0-349-11142-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsaparang is a huge fortress perched on a pyramid-shaped rock rising about 500 to 600 feet (152 to 183 m) at the end of a long narrow spur. It contains numerous tunnels and caves that have been carved out of the rock. At its base was a village where the common people lived. Above them were two public temples - the Lhakhang Marpo (Red Chapel) and the Lhakhang Karpo (White Chapel), and quarters for the monks. Further up, ascending a twisting stone staircase in a tunnel, were the royal quarters, and at the very top, the summer palace.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charles. (1999), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

TV Presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC TV/PBS documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggested that Tsaparang was the historical origin of the legend of Shangri-La, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.

==History==
[[File:Guge-householder-yasa.jpg|thumb|Painting showing the story of the Conversion of the Householder Yasa, who became a mendicant and was established as an Arhat, in the Red Temple in Tsparang, fifteenth century.|250px]]
According to some accounts, Tsaparang was made the capital of a Kingdom of Guge by [[Namde Wosung]], one of the sons of the [[Langdharma]] the anti-Buddhist king of Tibet 838-841 CE, after Langdharma was assassinated. The Tibetan Empire was then plunged into civil war and split into a number of independent kingdoms.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Tibet'', p. 200. (2005) Bradley Mayhew and Michael Kohn. 6th Edition. Lonely Planet. {{ISBN|1-74059-523-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts say that two of Langdharma's grandsons fled to Western Tibet about 919 CE. The eldest one, [[Nyima Gon]], established himself at [[Burang Town|Purang]] and conquered a large area including [[Ladakh]] and parts of [[Spiti]]. After his death his kingdom was split up between his three sons into the kingdoms of Guge, Purang, and [[Maryul]] (= Ladakh).  

Guge controlled an ancient trading route between India and Tibet. It emerged in the region previously known as [[Zhangzhung]] and became an important regional power by the 10th century CE.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

:"In the 11th century, King [[Yeshe O]], working with the famous Sanskrit translator, [[Rinchen Zangpo]] ('The Great Translator"), and the Indian master [[Atisha]], reintroduced Buddhism to western Tibet. Soon Tsaparang, and Tholing, also made of mud brick, were built, along with other temples and monasteries. The influence of the Guge Kingdom, particularly the monastic center of Tholing, was felt from Kashmir to Assam."[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E0DB133BF93AA25750C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2]

In the summer of 1624 two [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] missionaries, Fr. [[António de Andrade]] and Brother [[Manoel Marques (Guge)|Manoel Marques]], came to the region looking for Christian kingdoms that had long been rumored to lay beyond the Himalayas. After a harrowing journey (they were the first known Europeans to traverse the Himalayas) they arrived in Tsaparang, where they managed to gain permission from the king of Guge to freely preach their religion throughout the kingdom, and left after less than a month. After gaining formal permission and funds to start a mission in Tibet from the Jesuit superior at Goa, Andrade, Marques, and three other Jesuits journeyed to Tsaparang the next summer and built a church at the foot of the citadel and another one at [[Rudok]] 130 miles (209&amp;nbsp;km) away. António de Andrade left Tibet in 1628, and in 1630 the king of Ladakh, Senge Namgyal, invaded and overthrew the kingdom of Guge, taking the pro-Jesuit king (Tri Tashi Drakpa) and his family captive. Under Ladakhi rule the mission quickly fell into disarray; Andrade was assassinated in Goa in 1634. In 1640 Manuel Marques led an expedition back in an attempt to reestablish the mission but he was captured and the rest of his party fled. He wrote a pitiful letter to the Jesuit headquarters at [[Agra]] in India begging to be rescued, but was never heard from again.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Allen, Charles. (1999) ''The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History'', pp. 243-245. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: 2000 Abacus Books, London. {{ISBN|0-349-11142-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1679–80 Tsaparang and the Guge kingdom was conquered by the Central Tibetan government in Lhasa under the leadership of the 5th Dalai Lama. In spite of massive damage then, and the destruction of most of the statues and murals in both chapels by the [[Red Guards (People's Republic of China)|Red Guards]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]], many magnificent frescoes have somehow survived.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Werner Leinfellner was a pioneer of scientific philosophy, [[game theory|game]] and [[decision theory]] in the tradition of the [[Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref name="stadler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nachruf auf Univ.Prof. DDr.h.c. Werner Leinfellner 1921 – 2010|url=http://www.alws.at/de/index.php/alws/kondolenzbuch_werner_leinfellner|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PV7xZf7h?url=http://www.alws.at/de/index.php/alws/kondolenzbuch_werner_leinfellner|archivedate=2014-05-11|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1950, he studied [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Graz]] and the [[University of Vienna]] and during this time he did research in chemistry.  In 1954, he turned to the study of [[philosophy]], [[logic]] and the [[philosophy of science]] and received his Ph.D. in 1959 for his [[dissertation]] ''Anschauung, Abstraktion und Integration im modernen physikalischen Denken'' (''Intuition, abstraction and integration in modern physical thought'') from the University of Vienna.  From 1960 to 1963, he worked as a research assistant at the [[University of Munich]] in philosophy of science and logic.  In 1963, he moved back to [[Vienna]] and was a research fellow and assistant professor at the Institute of [[Institute of Advanced Studies (Vienna)|Advanced Studies]] in philosophy of science, [[economics]], social and political sciences, and [[game theory|game]] and [[decision theory]].  During this time, he was also a lecturer at the University of Vienna.  In 1967, due to an unfavorable political and scientific climate in  post-war Austria, he was unable to obtain a tenured faculty position in Austria and so he moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]] and joined the department of philosophy at the university of Nebraska-Lincoln as a full professor.&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;

In 1970, he founded the journal [[Theory and Decision]], an international journal for philosophy and methodology of the social sciences.  The founding of the journal was, in part, a reaction to the dogmatic, subjective, and metaphysical approaches he had encountered in Europe prior to coming to the United States.&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;  His vision was that ''Theory and Decision'' would help found a philosophy of the social science based on three premises: 
:(1) it would help in the formation of categories based on logic and mathematics for the social sciences; 
:(2)  it would promote the development of mathematical theories and research methods for the social sciences; and
:(3)  it would promote the integration of theories and formal methods across the social sciences.
In 1974, he cofounded ''Theory and Decision Library'' also based on these three principles.&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;  Indeed, Eberlein and Berghel (1988) concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was essentially Werner Leinfellner's accomplishment that the ideal of [[logical empiricism]] in the 1930s and 1940s, to create a "unified science", was replaced by that of a "methodological unity of science".  Accordingly,... the THEORY AND DECISION school of the philosophy of the social science can substantiate his claim: "... There are no longer any methodological differences at issue". Certainly the term "methodological" has to be interpreted in a broad sense, implicating the unity of science due to common standards of theory formation and to the fact that theories are the methodological basic units of the social science disciplines.  Furthermore, "methodological unity", in the context of this journal and library, refers to the continuously differentiated and integrated unity of an undogmatic, pluralistic philosophy of the social sciences (page xii).&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1976, Werner Leinfellner together with his wife [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]] cofounded the Austrian [[Wittgenstein]] Society and the [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]].&lt;ref name="arturo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stadler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALWS"/&gt;

In 1986, he became professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and returned to Vienna Austria as professor at the  [[Vienna University of Technology]].&lt;ref name="arturo"/&gt;

In 1991, he became a member of the Science Board at the [[Institute Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref name="stadler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute Vienna Circle|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/e_institut/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its goal is to document the continued development of the Vienna Circle's work in science and the continued application of logical-empirical thought to the philosophy of science and thereby it continues Leinfellner's goal of breaking away from irrational, dogmatic, fundamentalist though.

During his career, he received several awards and prizes including Theodor Körner Prize (twice), the Medal of the College de France, Paris, the [[Austrian Decoration for Science and Art|Grand Honorary Cross for Science and Art, 1st Class, Austria]], and membership in the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stadler"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Personal===

During [[World War II]], he was required to serve in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German army]] and was subsequently seriously wounded on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]].  After a year of recovering from his wounds he deserted the German army and joined the [[Austrian resistance|resistance]] at the end of the war&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt; In 1960, he married Elisabeth Leinfellner and they had one daughter Ruth. He died in a Vienna hospital on April 6, 2010 and his wife Elisabeth preceded him in death three months earlier on January 4, 2010.&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stadler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german"/&gt;

==Philosophical and scientific views==

===Philosophy of science===

For Leinfellner, science and philosophy are complementary in that they are both required for knowledge and discovery. Science has revealed a whole new way of viewing nature and society than existed prior to the 20th century. In the past, according to Leinfellner, physical and chemical processes were thought to follow deterministic laws of nature, but this view fell through as the sciences became theoretically more rigorous. In the social and economic sciences, he argued that we have to drop the notion of deterministic laws and search for rules instead. These rules, to varying degrees, involve [[randomness]]. Indeed, there are likely an enormous number of social rules all subject to randomnes that would appear to result in chaos, but more likely these—rules discovered by the social and economic sciences—produce systems that are more or less stable but subject to chaotic breakdowns now and then.  For Leinfellner, this probabilistic aspect of rules and laws extends to the universe.&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;

===Cultural evolution of social and political systems===

Leinfellner long viewed [[game theory|game]] and [[decision theory]] as theoretical and methodological frameworks within which the [[social sciences]] could be integrated.  This was the major motivation for the founding of the journal ''Theory and Decision'' and for confounding ''Theory and Decision Library''.&lt;ref name="Eberlein"/&gt; Later, Leinfellner would come to view [[evolutionary game theory]] as a theoretical framework for integrating biological and cultural evolution. Once placed in an evolutionary game-theoretic framework, it is possible to explain how societal cooperation evolves even though selfishness is favored at the individual level&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;

He viewed evolution as always at work but always producing surprises. He recognized that we can partially influence evolutionary processes themselves, both biological and [[cultural evolution]]. This, however, creates an unimaginable responsibility for society especially when compared to the pre-20th-century view of humans as passive-spectators in world-as-machine view, ultimately unable to influence what we do. He viewed the evolution of society and the ability of humans to influence evolutionary processes as having enormous ethical implications, which we must deal with. The ethical implications, in part, arise because we cannot ultimately know the consequences of our influences on biological and cultural evolution.&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;

In his view, biological and cultural evolutionary processes have implications that go beyond individual humans. At a political level, authoritarian planned economies that don't consider the randomness inherent in evolutionary processes are doomed, sooner or later, to failure. The fact that we are active participants in our own biological and cultural evolution means that we can intervene with science and technology to influence our future societal evolution—with considerable uncertainty as to the outcomes—but this also creates fundamental philosophical and ethical problems.&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz"/&gt;

From a cognitive point of view, the rules by which we interact socially are the result of both biological and cultural evolution according to Leinfellner. For example, in his view, one doesn't need to necessarily learn to be a father when you see your child for the first time.  There are basic "rules of fatherhood" that are instinctual. As he said: "At least this is how it was at the birth of my daughter".  Nevertheless, to learn how to be a father also requires rules obtained by social and cultural learning. These rules, however, can malfunction for a variety of reasons including the fact that we have free will.&lt;ref name ="Leinfellner"/&gt;

{{Western Buddhism}}
[[Zen]] was introduced in the United States at the end of the 19th century by Japanese teachers who went to America to serve groups of Japanese immigrants and become acquainted with the American culture. After World War II, interest from non-Asian Americans grew rapidly. This resulted in the commencement of an indigenous American Zen tradition which also influences the larger western (Zen) world.

==History==

===Late 19th century – The Parliament of Religions===
In 1893, the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World Parliament of Religions]] was held in [[Chicago]]. It was a landmark event for the introduction of Asian religions to a western audience. Although most of the delegates to the Parliament were Christians of various denominations, the Buddhist nations of China, Japan, [[Thailand]], and Sri Lanka sent representatives.

In the January 1844, issue of ''[[The Dial]]'' magazine, the publication of the [[Transcendentalism#The Transcendental Club|New England Transcendentalist Club]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], one of the great originals of the American Renaissance and author of ''[[Walden]]'', introduced a translation of the Parable of the Medicinal Herbs chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the core and heart of all Buddhist teachings, to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=America, Buddhism, and the Dream of America|title=Thoreau, The Lotus Sutra, and Eternity|url=http://www.buddhism-and-the-american-dream.com/?p=848|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Rinzai was represented by [[Soyen Shaku]], the teacher of [[D.T. Suzuki]]. Other Buddhist delegates included Zenshiro Noguchi, a Japanese translator; [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], a Sri Lankan associate of H. S. Olcott; and Chandradat Chudhadharn, a brother of King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Thailand. [[Paul Carus]] also attended as an observer. The Parliament provided the first major public forum from which Buddhists could address the Western public; [[Dharmapala]] was particularly effective because he spoke fluent English.

===Early 20th century – early Zen teachers===
(Rinzai) Zen Buddhism was the first imported Buddhist trend to put down roots in North America. Though [[Soyen Shaku]], [[Nyogen Senzaki]] and [[Sokei-an]], {{sfn|Ford|2006|p=59-62}} were among the first to reach a western audience, the single most important influence was [[D.T. Suzuki]], who popularized Zen with his extensive writings. Early converts included [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki]].

====Soyen Shaku====
In 1893, [[Soyen Shaku]] was invited to speak at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions|World Parliament of Religions]] held in [[Chicago]]. He made the trip to what was then considered the "barbaric" United States, although his associates "discouraged him from attending".{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=59-62}}

In 1905, a wealthy American couple invited Shaku to stay in the United States. For nine months he lived near San Francisco, where he established a small [[zendo]] in the home of Alexander and Ida Russell and gave regular [[zazen]] lessons. Shaku became the first Zen Buddhist priest to teach in [[North America]].{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=59-62}}

====Nyogen Senzaki====
Shaku was soon followed by [[Nyogen Senzaki]], a young monk from his home temple in [[Japan]]. Senzaki briefly worked for the Russells and then as a hotel porter, manager and eventually, owner. [[James Ishmael Ford|James Ford]] says Senzaki referred to himself as a "mushroom": no deep root, no branches, no flowers and "probably no seeds". In 1922 Senzaki rented a hall and gave a talk in English on a paper by Shaku; his periodic talks at different locations became known as the "floating zendo". A teacher of [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], Senzaki established an itinerant sitting hall from [[San Francisco]] to [[Los Angeles]], where he taught until his death in 1958.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=71–72}}

====Sokatsu Shaku and Sokei-an====
Another Zen teacher named [[Sokatsu Shaku]], one of Shaku's senior students, arrived in late 1906 and founded a Zen meditation center called [[Ryomokyo-kai]]. Although he stayed only a few years and had limited contact with the English-speaking public, one of his disciples, [[Shigetsu Sasaki]], made a permanent home in America. Sasaki, better known under his monastic name Sokei-an, spent a few years wandering the west coast of the US. At one point he lived among [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] near [[Seattle]], and reached [[New York City]] in 1916. After completing his training and being ordained in 1928, he returned to New York to teach. In 1931, his small group incorporated as the [[Buddhist Society of America]]; it was later renamed the First Zen Institute of America. By the late 1930s, one of his most active supporters was [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]], an American socialite and the mother-in-law of [[Alan Watts]]. Shortly before Sokei-an's death in 1945, he and Everett would wed, at which point she took the name [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki]].

====D.T. Suzuki====
{{main|D.T. Suzuki}}

D.T. Suzuki, another Japanese associate of Shaku's, had a great literary impact. At the World Parliament of Religions in 1893, Paul Carus befriended Shaku and requested his help in translating and publishing Oriental spiritual literature in the West. Shaku instead recommended Suzuki, then a young scholar and his former disciple. Starting in 1897, Suzuki worked from Carus' home in Illinois; his first projects were translations of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and [[Asvaghosa]]'s ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]''. At the same time, Suzuki began writing ''Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism'', which was published in 1907. Suzuki returned to Japan in 1909 and married Beatrice Erskine Lane, an American Theosophist and Radcliffe graduate, in 1911. Through English language essays and books, such as ''Essays in Zen Buddhism'' (1927), he became a visible expositor of Zen Buddhism and its unofficial ambassador to Western readers until his death in 1966. His 1949 book, ''An Introduction to Zen Buddhism'', featured a thirty-page introduction by [[Carl Jung]], an emblem of the deepening relationship between Buddhism and major Western thinkers.

====Dwight Goddard====
One American who attempted to establish an American Buddhist movement was [[Dwight Goddard]] (1861–1939). Goddard was a Christian missionary to China when he first came in contact with Buddhism. In 1928, he spent a year living in a Zen monastery in Japan. In 1934, he founded "The Followers of Buddha, an American Brotherhood," with the goal of applying the traditional monastic structure of Buddhism more strictly than Senzaki and Sokei-an had previously. The group was largely unsuccessful, as no Americans were recruited to join as monks and attempts failed to attract a Chinese [[Zen|Chan]] (Zen) master to come to the United States. However, Goddard's efforts as an author and publisher bore considerable fruit: in 1930, he began publishing ''ZEN: A Buddhist Magazine''. In 1932, he collaborated with [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D. T. Suzuki]] on a translation of the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. That same year, he published the first edition of ''A Buddhist Bible," an anthology of Buddhist scriptures focusing on those used in Chinese and Japanese Zen.{{sfn|Goddard|2009}}

===1950s – Beat Zen===
In the late 1940s{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and 1950s, writers associated with the [[Beat Generation]], including [[Gary Snyder]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Philip Whalen]], and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], took a serious interest in Zen&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.avdbraak.nl/Taylor_and_Zen_I.doc Andre van de Braak, ''ZEN SPIRITUALITY IN A SECULAR AGE. Charles Taylor and Zen Buddhism in the West'']&lt;/ref&gt; which increased its visibility. In 1951, [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] returned to the United States to take a visiting professorship at [[Columbia University]], where his open lectures attracted many members of the literary, artistic, and cultural elite. In 1958, [[Chicago Review]] published a special issue on Zen, featuring works by the beat poets alongside Zen writings in translation.&lt;ref&gt;“Front Matter.” ''Chicago Review'', vol. 12, no. 2, 1958. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/25293447.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s – Growing popularity===
In the 1960s, there was a growing interest in Zen. The Soto-priests [[Shunryu Suzuki]] and [[Taizan Maezumi]] were especially influential in the spread of Zen. Suzuki's [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and Maezumi's [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]] grew into large centers, attracting huge numbers of practitioners.

===1980s – Scandals===
The 1980s saw a series of scandals involving Zen teachers whose charismatic authority had led to misconduct. In 1983, the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] experienced a sex scandal resulting in the resignation of abbot [[Zentatsu Richard Baker|Richard Baker]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news|title=Zen &amp; the Art of Success|author=Crews, Frederick C.|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/mar/28/zen-the-art-of-success/|date=March 28, 2002|work=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lachs|2002}} [[Taizan Maezumi]] slept with several of his students at the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]] before dying of alcoholism.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=101, 163}}{{sfn|Wright|2010}}

Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are
{{quote|... most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of [[charismatic authority]] that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization".{{sfn|Bell|2002}}}}

Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C}} Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of [[Zen#Zen narratives|religious narratives]], such as lineages and [[dharma transmission]], which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.{{sfn|Lachs|1999}}{{sfn|Lachs|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Lachs|2002}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}{{sfn|Lachs|2011}}

The scandals eventually led to rules of conduct by the [[American Zen Teachers Association]], and the reorganising of Zen Centers,{{sfn|Wright|2010}} to spread the management of those centers over a wider group of people and diminish the role of [[charismatic authority]].

==Japanese Rinzai==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Contemporary Rinzai teachers===
{{main|Rinzai school}}

Contemporary [[Rinzai]] Zen teachers in United States have included [[Kyozan Joshu Sasaki]] Roshi, [[Eido Tai Shimano]] Roshi, and [[Omori Sogen]] Roshi (d. 1994). Sasaki founded the [[Mount Baldy Zen Center]] and its branches after coming to Los Angeles from Japan in 1962.  One of his students was the Canadian poet and musician [[Leonard Cohen]].  Eido Roshi founded [[Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji]], a training center in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  Omori Roshi founded Daihonzan Chozen-ji, the first Rinzai headquarters temple established outside Japan, in Honolulu; under his students Tenshin Tanouye Roshi and Dogen Hosokawa Roshi and their dharma heirs, several other training centers were established including [[Daiyuzenji]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Korinji]] in [[Wisconsin]].

==Japanese Soto==
{{main|Sōtō}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Soyu Matsuoka===
{{main|Soyu Matsuoka}}

Soyu Matsuoka-roshi established the Chicago Buddhist Temple in 1949 (now the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago) and provided Sōtō Zen training and lectures in both America and Japan. Matsuoka-roshi also served as superintendent and abbot of the Long Beach Zen Buddhist Temple and Zen Center. Matsuoka-Roshi was born in Japan into a family of Zen priests dating back six hundred years. In the 1930s he was sent to America by Sōtōshū, the [[Sōtō]] Zen Buddhist authority in Japan, to establish the Sōtō Zen tradition in the United States.  He founded Sōtō Zen temples in both [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]]. He also furthered his graduate work at Columbia with D.T. Suzuki. He relocated from Chicago to establish a temple at Long Beach in 1971 after leaving the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago to his dharma heir Kongo Richard Langlois, Roshi.  He returned to [[Chicago]] in 1995, where he died in 1998.

===Shunryu Suzuki===
{{main|Shunryu Suzuki}}

[[Sōtō]] Zen Priest Shunryu Suzuki (no relation to [[D.T. Suzuki]]) arrived in San Francisco in 1959 to lead an established Japanese congregation. He soon attracted American students and "[[beatniks]]", who formed a core of students who would go on to create the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and its eventual network of Zen centers across the country, including the [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], the first Buddhist monastery in the Western world.  His low-key teaching style was described in the popular book ''[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]],'' a compilation of his talks.

==Sanbo Kyodan==
{{main|Sanbo Kyodan}}
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
[[Sanbo Kyodan]] is a contemporary Japanese Zen lineage which had an impact in the West disproportionate to its size in Japan. It is rooted in the reformist teachings of [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]] (1871–1961) and his disciple [[Haku'un Yasutani|Yasutani Hakuun]] (1885–1971), who argued that the existing Zen institutions of Japan ([[Sōtō]] and [[Rinzai]] sects) had become complacent and were generally unable to convey real [[Dharma]]. Harada had studied with both Soto and Rinzai teachers, and Yasutani founded Sanbo Kyodan in 1954 to preserve what he saw as the vital core of teachings from both schools.

===Philip Kapleau===
{{main|Philip Kapleau}}

Sanbo Kyodan's first American member was Philip Kapleau, who first traveled to Japan in 1945 as a court reporter for the war crimes trials. In 1947, Kapleau visited D. T. Suzuki at Engaku-ji in Japan and in the early 1950s was a frequent attendee of Suzuki's Columbia lectures. In 1953, he returned to Japan, where he met with [[Soen Nakagawa|Nakagawa Soen]], a protégé of [[Nyogen Senzaki]]. At Nakagawa's recommendation, he began to study with Harada and later with Yasutani. In 1965, he published a book, ''[[The Three Pillars of Zen]]'', which recorded a set of talks by Yasutani outlining his approach to practice, along with transcripts of [[Buddhist terms and concepts#D|dokusan]] interviews and some additional texts.

The book and Sanbo Kyodan's approach became popular in America and Europe. In 1965 Kapleau returned to America and, in 1966, established the [[Rochester Zen Center]] in [[Rochester, New York]], making him the first American-born Zen priest to found a training temple. In 1967, Kapleau had a falling-out with Yasutani over Kapleau's moves to Americanize his temple, after which it became independent of Sanbo Kyodan. This created questions regarding lineage since Kapleau never officially was granted transmission from Yasutani. The Rochester Zen Center is now part of a network of related centers in the United States, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and New Zealand, referred to collectively as the Cloud Water Sangha. One of Kapleau's early disciples was [[Toni Packer]], who left Rochester in 1981 to found a nonsectarian meditation center, not specifically Buddhist or Zen.

===Robert Aitken===
{{main|Robert Baker Aitken}}

Robert Aitken is another American member of Sanbo Kyodan. He was introduced to Zen as a prisoner in Japan during World War II. After returning to the United States, he studied with Nyogen Senzaki in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1950s. In 1959, while still a Zen student, he founded the [[Diamond Sangha]], a zendo in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. Three years later the Diamond Sangha hosted the first US visit by Yasutani Hakuun, who visited the US six more times before 1969. Aitken traveled frequently to Japan and became a disciple of [[Yamada Koun]], Yasutani's successor as head of the Sanbo Kyodan. Aitken and the Diamond Sangha first hosted Eido Tai Shimano's immigration to the U.S., encouraged by Soen Nakagawa. Aitken became a dharma heir of Yamada's, authored more than ten books, and developed the Diamond Sangha into an international network with temples in the United States, Argentina, Germany, and Australia.
In 1995, he and his organization split with Sanbo Kyodan in response to reorganization of the latter following Yamada's death. The Diamond Sangha network includes a number of practice centers in the U.S. and abroad. The Diamond Sangha Teachers' Circle, an international group of Aitken Roshi's successors (1st and 2nd generation), meets every 18 months. The [[Pacific Zen Institute]] led by [[John Tarrant (Zen Buddhist)|John Tarrant]], Aitken's first Dharma successor, continues as an independent Zen line.

===White Plum Sangha===
{{main|White Plum Sangha}}

Another Japanese Zen teacher was [[Taizan Maezumi]], who arrived as a young priest to serve at Zenshuji, the North American [[Sōtō]] sect headquarters in Los Angeles, in 1956. Like Shunryu Suzuki, he showed considerable interest in teaching Zen to Americans of various backgrounds and, by the mid-1960s, had formed a regular zazen group. In 1967, he and his supporters founded the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]]. He was later instrumental in establishing the Kuroda Institute and the [[Soto Zen Buddhist Association]], the latter an organization of American teachers with ties to the Soto tradition. In addition to his membership in Soto, Maezumi was recognized as an heir by a [[Rinzai]] teacher and by [[Haku'un Yasutani|Yasutani Hakuun]] of the Sanbo Kyodan. Maezumi, in turn, had several American dharma heirs, such as [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman|Bernie Glassman]], [[John Daido Loori]], [[Joko Beck|Charlotte Joko Beck]], and [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]]. His successors and their network of centers became the [[White Plum Sangha]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi |url= http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/TaizanMaezumi.html |work= Asia Pacific Research Online |accessdate= 2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese Chán==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
[[File:HsuanHuaShangRen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|[[Hsuan Hua]] in 2010]]

Not all successful Zen teachers in the United States have been from Japanese traditions. Some were teachers of Chinese Zen (known as ''Chán''), Korean Zen (or ''Seon''), and Vietnamese Zen (or ''Thien'').

===Hsuan Hua===
{{main|Hsuan Hua}}

[[File:CTTBgate.jpg|thumb|right|The {{convert|480|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[City of Ten Thousand Buddhas]] founded by Hsuan Hua in [[Talmage, California]] is geographically the largest Buddhist community in the western hemisphere.]]

The first Chinese Buddhist monk to teach Westerners in America was [[Hsuan Hua]], a disciple of the 20th-century Chan master, [[Hsu Yun]]. In 1962, Hsuan Hua moved to San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], where, in addition to Zen, he taught Chinese Pure Land, [[Tiantai]], [[Vinaya]], and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. Initially, his students were mostly ethnic Chinese, but he eventually attracted a range of followers. In 1970, Hsuan Hua founded Gold Mountain Monastery in San Francisco and in 1976 he established a retreat center, the [[City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas]], on a 237-acre (959,000 m²) property in [[Talmage, California]]. These monasteries closely adhere to the [[vinaya]], the austere traditional Buddhist monastic code. Hsuan Hua also founded the Buddhist Text Translation Society, which translates scriptures into English.

===Sheng-yen===
{{main|Sheng-yen}}

Another Chinese Chán teacher with a Western following was Sheng-yen, trained in both the [[Caodong]] and [[Linji school|Linji]] schools (equivalent to the Japanese Soto and Rinzai, respectively). He first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the [[Buddhist Association of the United States]], an organization of Chinese American Buddhists. In 1980, he founded the Chán Mediation Society in [[Queens, New York]]. In 1985, he founded the Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies in Taiwan, which sponsors Chinese Zen activities in the United States.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Is Master Sheng-yen |url=http://www.chan1.org/biography.html |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613041853/http://chan1.org/biography.html |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Shi Yan Ming]], a 34th Generation Shaolin monk of the [[Caodong]] lineage,&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= Shi Yan Ming Lineage |url=http://usashaolintemple.org/shiyanming-lineage/ |accessdate= 2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to America and founded the USA Shaolin Temple in New York City. Construction has recently begun on a full-size Shaolin temple in [[Fleischmanns, New York]].

[[File:Dae Soen Sa Nim (Seung Sahn).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|[[Seung Sahn]] in 2002]]

==Korean Seon==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
[[Seung Sahn]] was an influential Korean Zen teacher in America. He was a temple abbot in [[Seoul]] and after living in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]], he moved to the US in 1972, not speaking any English. On the flight to Los Angeles, a Korean American passenger offered him a job at a laundry in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], which became headquarters of Seung Sahn's [[Kwan Um School of Zen]]. Shortly after arriving in Providence, he attracted students and founded the [[Providence Zen Center]]. The Kwan Um School has more than 100 Zen centers on six continents.

[[File:200511241132853328-1-.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|[[Kyong Ho]]]]
Another Korean Zen teacher, [[Samu Sunim]], founded [[Toronto]]'s [[Zen Buddhist Temple (Toronto)|Zen Buddhist Temple]] in 1971. He is head of the [[Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom]], which has temples in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Chicago]], [[Mexico City]], and [[New York City]].

In the early 20th century, Master [[Kyong Ho]] (1849–1912), renergized Korean Seon. At the end of World War II, his disciple, Master Mann Gong (1871–1946), proclaimed that lineage Dharma should be transmitted worldwide to encourage peace through enlightenment.  Consequently, his Dharma successor, Hye Am &lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= Hye-Am |url= http://www.buddhism.org/dharma/Hye-Am/Prolegomena.html |accessdate= 2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1884–1985) brought lineage Dharma to the United States.  Hye Am's Dharma successor, Myo Vong{{sfn|Vong|2008}} founded the Western Son Academy (1976), and his Korean disciple, [[Pohwa]] Sunim, founded World Zen Fellowship (1994) which includes various Zen centers in the United States, such as the Potomac Zen Sangha, the Patriarchal Zen Society and the Baltimore Zen Center.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= World Zen Fellowship |url= http://www.worldzen.org |accessdate= 2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnamese Thien==
[[File:Deer Park Monastery Bell.jpg|thumb|[[Deer Park Monastery]]]]
Vietnamese Zen teachers in America include Thich [[Thien-An]] and Thich [[Nhat Hanh]]. Thich [[Thien-An]] came to America in 1966 as a visiting professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and taught traditional Thien meditation. Thich [[Nhat Hanh]] was a monk in Vietnam during the [[Vietnam War]]. He was a peace activist nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1967 by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] In 1966, he left Vietnam in exile for [[Plum Village]], a monastery in [[France]]. He is the founder of [[Order of Interbeing]] and has written more than one hundred books about Buddhism, which have made him a popular Buddhist author in the West. In his books and talks, Thich Nhat Hanh emphasizes [[mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (''sati'') as the most important practice in daily life. His monastic students live and practice at three centers in the United States: [[Deer Park Monastery]] in [[Escondido, California]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=A Practice Center in the Tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh – Deer Park Monastery |work=web site |url=http://www.deerparkmonastery.org |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115025648/http://deerparkmonastery.org/ |archivedate=January 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blue Cliff Monastery]] in [[Pine Bush, New York]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |title= Blue Cliff Monastery |url= http://bluecliffmonastery.org |work= web site |accessdate= 2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magnolia Grove Monastery in [[Batesville, Mississippi]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title= Magnolia Grove Monastery |url= http://www.sugarmagnoliaweddings.com |accessdate= 2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
