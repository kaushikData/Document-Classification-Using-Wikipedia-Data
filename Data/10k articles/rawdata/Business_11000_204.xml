      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1196">'''12secondtv''' was a [[video sharing]] platform founded in July 2008 by Sol Lipman, Jacob Knobel, and David Beach. It was designed so that users could share 12 second [[video]]s in a similar way to [[Twitter]]. It allowed users to share short "video statuses" that they could share with followers. 
 
12secondtv was shut down on October 22, 2010. Various reasons were given for its closing, chief among them being a user base that had not increased within the two years of its inception. This led the developers to decide that it was no longer viable to maintain the [[Computing platform|platform]] in the face of increasing costs. Twitter also played a role in its closing by declining to form a partnership with 12secondtv. This also limited the growth of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/10/04/12seconds-tv-shuts-down-with-tightening-twitter-ecosystem/ |title=12seconds.tv shuts down with tightening Twitter ecosystem &amp;#124; VentureBeat &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; by Sid Yadav |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anton Jurgens 2 - 1919.jpg|thumb|150px|Antonius Johannes Jurgens]]
'''Antonius Johannes Jurgens''' (8 February 1867 in [[Oss]], Netherlands – 12 March 1945 in [[Torquay]], UK) was the grandson of [[Antoon Jurgens]] and Joanna Lemmens. His grandfather was the founder of the butter company ''  [[Antoon Jurgens]] '' (1867) and of the first world margarine factory (1871) in Oss, The [[Netherlands]]. Antonius Johannes Jurgens was one of the main European [[margarine]] and [[soap]] manufacturers in the early twentieth century with Pieter-Eduard Leverd. Anton Jurgens as he was called started in the late eighteen hundreds also a [[margarine]] factory in [[Germany]] and in [[Belgium]]. Although initially in fierce competition with another manufacturer from [[Oss]] in the Netherlands, [[Samuel van den Bergh]], both competitors joined up in 1927 to form the [[Margarine Unie]], which would merge in 1930 with [[William Hulme Lever]], 2nd Viscount Leverhulme of [[Lever Brothers]] to form [[Unilever]].
Antonius Johannes Jurgens was also a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] politician. [[Eric Jurgens]], a family member, is at present a politician in the Netherlands.

==Investment Focus==
Tahir helped the Dhabi Group to evolve from a family office engaged in primarily passive investments into a vehicle that acted as a lead investor for a consortium of investors known as the Abu Dhabi Group.  The key focus areas became banking, telecommunications and real estate.

The Group understood the risks of investing in emerging and frontier markets, including corrupt government officials and corruption in general,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C10%5C29%5Cstory_29-10-2008_pg7_38{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergingmarkets.org/Article/2690718/World-Bank-initiates-anti-corruption-network.html|title=World Bank initiates anti-corruption network – Emerging Markets|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however were able to manage the risks inherent with this investment approach by approaching each target market as a portfolio investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=140302&amp;Cat=2&amp;dt=10/19/2008|title=Bank Alfalah in good health Abu Dhabi Group to invest up to $5 bn in Pakistan|date=11 October 2008|work=The News International, Pakistan|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tahir was the first to promote and encourage this approach: to be a portfolio investor in a market whereby the country can benefit from inward foreign direct investment that directly helps to create jobs as well as to help attract new investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/535705 |title=Abu Dhabi Group to start mobile phone company |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129050828/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/220/535705 |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This longer-term partnership defined the access and readiness of countries to encourage investment groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moungalla.info/2009/09/17/bashir-tahir-la-societe-warid-congo-ne-sera-pas-concedee |title=男女無料登録OK！出会い系サイト一覧 |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184728/http://www.moungalla.info/2009/09/17/bashir-tahir-la-societe-warid-congo-ne-sera-pas-concedee/ |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could provide a source of multi-sector investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/en/issue-no-335/telecoms/dhabi-group-to-inves/en|title=DHABI GROUP TO INVEST $150-200M IN WIMAX MOBILE COMPANY IN UGANDA - balancingact-africa.com|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and help reduce volatilities through such long-term partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/business/13-Oct-2010/Abu-Dhabi-Groups--investment-in-Pakistan|title=Abu Dhabi Group's investment in Pakistan|work=The Nation|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brenda Barton''' is an American politician who is a member of the [[Arizona House of Representatives]] representing Arizona's 6th Legislative District.  She serves in leadership as the Chairman of the House Agriculture, Water and Lands Committee. She has served on the committee since 2010 and been Chairman since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azleg.gov/MembersPage.asp?Member_ID=29&amp;Legislature=51&amp;Session_ID=112&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton's district reaches from the Grand Canyon, through Flagstaff and Sedona and east through Payson to the White Mountains.  The population of her Legislative District is over 216,000, and Flagstaff is the largest metropolitan area within her District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.barton4az.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/6th_district.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182438/http://www.barton4az.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/6th_district.pdf# |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated by the economic impacts to her rural district caused by the United States federal government shutdown in 2013, as well as the administration's initial refusal to allow Arizona to keep the park open, Barton took to Facebook to express her anger over the losses of over $1.6 million per day being suffered by her rural communities and compared President [[Barack Obama]] to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stableford |first=Dylan |url=https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-de-fuhrer-barton-obama-134942788.html |title=Lawmaker refers to Obama as Der Fuhrer: Arizona Rep.

A Pioneer Arizonan, her family first settled in the Territory in 1870. Barton was born near the historic family homestead in [[Artesia, Arizona]]. After over twenty years service in accounting and materials management with the City of Safford, she retired in 2009. She participated in the [[Sagebrush rebellion]], and Barton is a former county officer with People for the West, an advocacy group promoting [[property rights (economics)|private property rights]] and opposing federal intervention in western lands.

==Sponsored legislation==
In 2014, Representative Barton authored two pieces of legislation that were signed into law: HB2523, Authorization of Water Supply Development, and HB2343, which created a funding mechanism to clear the fuel load on Arizona State Lands.&lt;ref name=hb2523&gt;{{cite web|title=HB2523: Water Supply Development Projects|url=http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=2523&amp;Session_Id=112&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0|publisher=Arizona State Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hb2343&gt;{{cite web|title=HB2343: Wildfire Prevention, State Trust Lands|url=http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/51leg/2r/summary/h.hb2343_04-21-14_astransmittedtogovernor.doc.htm&amp;Session_ID=112|publisher=Arizona State Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative Barton attempted to increase supplemental funding levels for Arizona community colleges in 2014.  The budget appropriation for $25 million was successfully opposed by budget hawks in the Conservative Caucus.&lt;ref name=hb2588&gt;{{cite web|title=hb2588: Supplemental Funding for Certain Community Colleges|url=http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/hb2588p.htm&amp;Session_ID=112|publisher=Arizona State Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barton also co-sponsored Senator Crandell's SB1093.  A minor bill, the proposed legislation would have required federal law enforcement and other agencies conducting enforcement activities (such as the EPA or BLM) in an Arizona county to cooperate with and provide the county sheriff documentation of their legal authority to conduct an enforcement activity within their county.&lt;ref name=aleshire-13march&gt;{{cite news |last=Aleshire |first=Pete |title=Local Lawmakers Would Make Sheriffs Ultimate Authority |url=http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2014/mar/07/local-lawmakers-would-make-sheriffs-ultimate-autho/ |accessdate=15 May 2014 |newspaper=Payson Roundup |date=13 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PanBOJVI?url=http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2014/mar/07/local-lawmakers-would-make-sheriffs-ultimate-autho/ |archivedate=May 15, 2014 |quote=A bill sponsored by Rim Country’s state legislative delegation that would have required federal law enforcement personnel to register with local sheriffs and turn over half of their fines to the counties has died in committee ...

The Senate Rules Committee voted against the bill 2-4, effectively killing it. The committee’s attorney said the bill would probably violate the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which gives federal laws priority over conflicting state laws. |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sb1093&gt;{{cite web|title=SB1093: federal agencies; registration with sheriff|url=http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=SB1093&amp;Session_ID=112|publisher=Arizona State Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed bill also stipulated that half of all fines imposed by the federal government must be turned over to Arizona's general fund.&lt;ref name=aleshire-13march/&gt;&lt;ref name=sb1093/&gt; The bill was voted down in the Senate Rules Committee and was never brought to a floor vote.&lt;ref name=aleshire-13march/&gt;

A '''bucket brigade''' or '''human chain''' is a method for transporting items where items are passed from one (relatively stationary) person to the next.
[[File:EscombrosBelAir2.jpg|thumb|350px|A human chain unloads a warehouse after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].]]
The method was important in [[firefighting]] before the advent of hand pumped fire engines, whereby firefighters would pass buckets to each other to extinguish a blaze. A famous example of this is the [[Union Fire Company]]. This technique is still common where using machines to move water, supplies, or other items would be impractical.

This method needs a number of participants sufficient for covering the distance.

== As a metaphor ==

This principle inspired various technical items, e.g. the [[bucket-brigade device]].

The term "bucket brigade" is also used for a certain method of organizing manual order picking in distribution centers.&lt;ref name=".com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucketbrigades.com/|title=Bucket Brigades: Self-Organizing Assembly Lines|last=BARTHOLDI |first=John J. III|author2=Donald D. EISENSTEIN|accessdate=2009-03-09|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bucketbrigades.com%2F&amp;date=2009-03-08|archivedate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here customer orders to be processed are passed from one order picker to the next. When the last picker in line has finished picking an order they walk back and take over the work of the next-to-last picker, who in their turn also walk back and so on, until the first person in line is reached, who then commences picking an entirely new order.

Similar applications of the idea of bucket brigades also exist for production lines.

'''Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward''' (November 10, 1890 in [[Altona, Hamburg]]&amp;nbsp;– July 28, 1963 in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]) was a German engineer and designer and the creator of the [[Borgward]] group, based in Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndrtv.de/doku/20020617_borgward_bio.html Das Erste online - Carl F.W.

==Biography==
He was of modest extraction, the son of a coal retailer, Wilhelm Borgward, and had twelve brothers and sisters. He undertook mechanical engineering studies, and obtained his engineering diploma from [[University of Hanover|Hanover Technical University]] in 1913.

He was wounded during [[World War I]]. In 1919 he became one of the partners of ''Bremer Reifenindustrie''. The company was restructured and in 1920 became ''Bremer Kühlerfabrik Borgward &amp; Co.

In 1924 and 1925 the company started to produce the small three-wheel trucks ''Blitzkarren'' and ''Goliath''. With his partner Wilhelm Tecklenborg, in 1928 he created the company ''Goliath-Werke Borgward &amp; Co''. When the two associates took over ''Hansa-Lloyd-Werke'' in 1931, this became the [[Borgward]] Group.

On September 23, 1938, the ''Carl F. W. Borgward Automobil- und Motorenwerke'' factory was opened in Sebaldsbrück near Bremen. At that time, 22,000 people were working in the company.  Until the end of the war the production of Borgward was mostly military vehicles and trucks.

When the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, half of the workers were prisoners of war and forced laborers. Carl Borgward was interned until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward#Leben]]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, just one year after being freed, he was already again a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bremen.

In 1949, the first ''[[Lloyd (car)|Lloyd]] LP 300'' had been designed and produced. In Germany this car was nicknamed the ''Leukoplastbomber'' (''Band-aid Bomber''). The small car with a plywood body on a wooden chassis had a [[two-stroke engine]] and was in the market segment under the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and kept this position for more than a decade.

In 1949 Borgward had also presented the large [[Hansa (car)|Hansa]] sedan, which was the first European car with a pontoon body. He had taken ideas from American magazines, which he read when under detention.

The largest success came in 1954 with the [[Borgward Isabella]]. The Borgwards met the spirit of the time: the German customers wished for American type styling and rich chrome decoration with European compact dimensions. Borgward participated in detail in the design of all the car models.

Increased competition on the segment of mid-sized cars, and the too broad and uneconomical range of models, as well as wrong financial and tactical choices by the management, led the company into crisis at the end of the fifties. The new model [[Lloyd Arabella|Borgward-Lloyd Arabella]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Lloyd Arabella]]&lt;/ref&gt; should have eased the difficulties, but it was handicapped by quality problems.

In 1961, Borgward underwent one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Germany. The company went to the Land of Bremen, which had it liquidated, and part of the factory went to [[Hanomag]]. Years after the bankruptcy was closed, it came out that it had not been reasonable: All debts had been paid to the last cent.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Borgward#Konkurs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Borgward died of a heart attack at the age 72 on July 28, 1963.

His life work might continue: 50 years after closing down his grandson, Christian Borgward, together with his partner Karlheinz L. Knöss and with assistance from Chinese investors unveiled the company's first new car in over 40 years, the [[Borgward BX7|BX7]] at the 2015 [[International Motor Show Germany|International Motor Show]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1561851/Borgward_kehrt_zurueck_auf_die_Strassen.html Luxus-Automobile: Borgward drängt zurück auf die Straßen - Nachrichten Wirtschaft - WELT ONLINE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalinas Norte''' is an important business complex composed of nineteen commercial office buildings, in two sections, and occupied by numerous leading Argentine companies, foreign subsidiaries, diplomatic offices, and a hotel. It is located in the [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] and [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] wards of the city of [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]].

==History==
===The Catalinas Warehouses and Pier Company Ltd.===
[[File:Iglesia Santa Catalina de Siena, Buenos Aires.jpg|left|thumb|160px|The Parish of Santa Catalina de Sienna, the development's namesake]]
[[Francisco Seeber]], a [[German Argentine]] businessman and legislator, created The Catalinas Warehouses and Pier Company, Ltd. in 1872 for the purpose of building a [[pier]] (near Paraguay Street), a wharf, and an office building. The acquired lands were east of the Paseo de Julio (now [[Leandro Alem Avenue]]).&lt;ref name=leonel&gt;[http://estatico.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/cultura/cpphc/archivos/libros/temas_15.pdf] Contreras, Leonel. ''Rascacielos Porteños (1580 — 2005)''. Comisión para la Preservación del Patrimonio
Histórico Cultural de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was known as the "Catalinas Incline," and was so named for the Church of Santa Catalina of Sienna (still standing on the corner of Viamonte and San Martín streets). This church also served as the namesake for Seeber's new firm. With the purchase of more land in the quarter of [[La Boca]], the Retiro lot was named ''Catalinas Norte'' (North Catalinas), and the La Boca lot, ''Catalinas Sur''.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

The firm obtained a municipal contract for the construction of the Catalina Docks. Needing a large and steady supply of soil to level and grade the hitherto flood-prone site for the wharf, Seeber bought land in the then-desolate northwest end of the city with the intent of hauling soil to Catalinas for [[land reclamation]]. Enlisting workers mostly from [[Entre Ríos Province]], these latter established a neighborhood ([[Villa Urquiza]]) there in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza/ Historia de Villa Urquiza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109035415/http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza |date=2009-11-09 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hotel Inmigrantes Buenos Aires.jpg|250px|thumb|The Immigramts' Hotel, built on the Catalinas wharf, and opened in 1911]]
These docks became the northern and southern points of entry into [[Puerto Madero]] upon its inaugural in 1897. Catalinas Norte was later chosen as the site for the [[Hotel de Inmigrantes]], a facility built to temporarily house the over 100,000 annual [[Immigration in Argentina|immigrant]] arrivals, and completed in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''Argentina: 1516 — 1982''. University of California Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the construction of the modern [[Port of Buenos Aires]] from 1911 to 1925, both Catalinas docks fell into disuse, and October 31, 1945, the Catalinas Warehouses properties were sold to Yatahí, S.A. A lot facing [[Córdoba Avenue]] was, in turn, resold in 1949 to a [[State enterprise]] created during the administration of [[Juan Perón]]: Atlas, S.A. This entity built the [[Alas Building]], and an adjacent lot was used to build the [[Peronist]] ALEA publishing house (redeveloped as [[Microsoft]]'s South American headquarters in 2000).

The bulk of the land, totaling 39,110 m² (429,000&amp;nbsp;ft²), north of these buildings continued vacant for decades. A further 24,200 m² (260,000&amp;nbsp;ft³) were owned by [[Otto Bemberg]] and Company, which opened the Retiro Park (an [[amusement park]]) there in 1939; the rest was later mostly used as [[parking lot]]s.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

===Early plans===

The underutilized state of an area so close to the [[Buenos Aires CBD|financial and administrative center of the city]] prompted the Municipal Department of Planning in 1956 to draft an [[urban renewal]] plan for the district. This envisaged the construction of a highway that would extend from [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]] to [[La Plata]], as well as rezoning Catalinas to allow for the construction of office buildings of up to 70 floors. This district, per these plans, would ultimately be known as the "Catalinas Gateway" to Buenos Aires.

The City Office of Regulatory Planning (OPRBA) further specified, in its revised master plan of 1958, that construction of skyscrapers in downtown Buenos Aires would be prohibited, and limited these to the Catalinas district. Mayor Hernán Giralt presented a project to the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Council]] for the development of "an area of hotels, an office and retail center, a location for shipping companies and air travel, a recreation center and a large area for parking," and on February 3, 1960, the [[Argentine National Congress]] authorized the City to purchase land north of Catalinas for the purpose.The Catalinas Norte Commission was established in 1961, but a subsequent [[Álvaro Alsogaray|political and economic crisis]] caused the project to stall and ultimately be discarded.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

The [[Revolución Argentina|coup d'état]] that toppled President [[Arturo Illia]] in 1966 led to the dissolution of OPRBA. Mayor Eugenio Schettini instructed the Municipal Department of Architecture and Urbanism (MCBA) to design a new, simpler plan that would limit permits for office high rises. A municipal ordinance in 1967 parceled the land inaccordance to the 1958 master plan, and lots were sold to [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]], Conurban S.A, [[IBM]], [[Francisco Macri|{{Not a typo|Impresit}} Sideco]], Kokourek S.A, SEGBA (the state-owned city electric utility), [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], and the [[Argentine Industrial Union]] (UIA). Retiro Park was bulldozed, and the [[Buenos Aires Japanese Gardens]] therein were relocated to their present, [[Parque Tres de Febrero|Palermo Woods]] location. The MCBA, in turn, retained four areas, opened three [[parking lot]]s, and built two [[promenade]]s: ''Carlos Della Paolera'' and ''Ingeniero Butty''.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

===Development===
Ground was broken on the first buildings in the complex, the Kokourek Group's [[w:es:Torre Conurban|Conurban Tower]] (in April 1969), and the [[Sheraton Buenos Aires Hotel &amp; Convention Center]], on June 26. Work began on the [[w:es:Edificio Carlos Pellegrini|Carlos Pellegrini Tower]] for the UIA in 1970, and on the [[w:es:Torre Catalinas Norte|Catalinas Norte Tower]] (for {{Not a typo|Impresit}} Sideco) in 1972. The Conurban Tower was inaugurated in 1973, Carlos Pellegrini in 1974, and Catalinas Norte, in 1975. Work then began on the [[w:es:Torre Madero|Madero Tower]] (so named for its [[Eduardo Madero]] Avenue address) in 1976, and in 1979, the [[w:es:Torre IBM|IBM Tower]]. These high rises, while not the first in Buenos Aires to incorporate elements of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] (such as [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]]), became the first to do so as a group. [[SEPRA Arquitectos]], a prominent Argentine architectural firm, designed the Sheraton Hotel and the Catalinas Norte Tower.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

The implosion of the dictatorship's [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz|economic policies]] in 1981 led to a suspension in new developments for the area, however, as well as a sharp decline in new construction as a whole. A subsequent economic recovery that followed Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s 1991 [[Argentine Currency Board|Convertibility Plan]] prompted renewed interest among developers, and from 1995 to 1998, the [[Eduardo Constantini|Consultatio Group]] developed the [[w:es:Torre Alem Plaza|Alem and Catalinas Plaza]] twin towers, and [[Inversiones y Representaciones S.A.|IRSA]], [[w:es:Edificio Laminar Plaza|Laminar Plaza]] (all designed by SEPRA). The final addition to the complex during the 1990s was the [[w:es:Torre BankBoston|Bank Boston Tower]]. The [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern]] high rise, designed by [[César Pelli]], was completed in 2001 and at 137 meters (450&amp;nbsp;ft), would become the tallest in the district.&lt;ref name=leonel/&gt;

===Expansion to the south===
The flurry of new construction also led to the redevelopment of the southern end of MCBA's redevelopment district (located in the [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] ward). The [[Torre Bouchard|Bouchard Tower]] and [[Loma Negra]]'s [[w:es:Torre Fortabat|Fortabat Tower]], both designed by SEPRA, were built between 1991 and 1995. The [[w:es:Edificio República (César Pelli)|República Building]], designed by Pelli for the now defunct Banco República, was completed in 1996 (with [[Telefónica de Argentina]] as its chief tenant). The [[w:es:Edificio Bouchard 710|Microsoft Building]] (by [[Mario Roberto Álvarez]]), opened in 2001, and [[Bouchard Plaza]], designed by [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] for the ''[[La Nación]]'' news and publishing group, opened in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=19944 ''La Nación''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of last remaining lots===
The complex, which by 2004 included 15 buildings totalling over 540,000 m² (5.8 million ft²), was in the news during 2009 and 2010, when Mayor [[Mauricio Macri]] obtained the City Legislature's approval to sell the remaining three undeveloped lots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/politica/478176-101275-0-Aprobaron-ayer-la-venta-los-terrenos-Catalinas-Norte ''Infobae''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined land is zoned to house up to 120,000 m² (1.3 million ft²) of new office space,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2009/05/02/laciudad/h-01909742.htm ''Clarín''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city sanctioned the future construction of high rises of up to 50 stories, and 150&amp;nbsp;m (492&amp;nbsp;ft) in height (slightly more than the tallest building currently in Catalinas).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cronista.com/interior/index.php?p=imprimir_nota&amp;idNota=188306 ''El Cronista'']{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third and last lot was sold on November 18, 2010, to [[Banco Macro]]. The other lots had been sold to IRSA and Consultatio earlier in the year, and the combined sales netted 386 million [[Argentine peso]]s (us$99 million), or us$6,866 per m² (us$639 per ft²).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Pagaron-millones-terreno-Ciudad_0_367163361.html ''Clarín''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects approved for these lots during 2011 include the Macro Tower, a {{convert|130|m|ft}} headquarters designed by [[César Pelli]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/notas/576428-Banco-Macro-avanza-con-el-plan-para-construir-el-edificio-corporativo.html|title=Banco Macro avanza con el plan para construir el edificio corporativo|work=InfoBae}}&lt;/ref&gt; the {{convert|155|m|ft}} Consultatio Tower by Beccar Varela &amp; Associates;&lt;ref name=tres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1455774-tres-rascacielos-transformaran-catalinas|title=Tres rascacielos transformarán Catalinas|work=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 29-story IRSA headquarters, designed by Miguel Baudizzone and Jorge Lestard.&lt;ref name=tres/&gt; [[BBVA Banco Francés]], the fifth largest bank in Argentina, announced in 2013 that it would relocate its headquarters to the Consultatio Tower upon the building's completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cronista.com/negocios/El-BBVA-Frances-pago--1.200-millones-y-se-quedo-con-la-nueva-torre-de-Costantini-20130712-0070.html|title=El BBVA Francés pagó $ 1.200 millones y se quedó con la nueva torre de Costantini|work=Cronista|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One last potential zone for future development, a 5,694 m² (613,000&amp;nbsp;ft²) property alongside the [[Alas Building]], remains in use as a parking lot.

'''Choate Rosemary Hall''' (often known as '''Choate'''; {{IPAc-en|tʃ|oʊ|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Choate |author=Ben Zimmer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03FOB-onlanguage-t.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[private school|private]], [[university-preparatory school|college-preparatory]], [[coeducational]], [[boarding school]] located in [[Wallingford, Connecticut|Wallingford]], [[Connecticut]]. It took its present name and began a coeducational system with the merger in 1971 of two single-sex establishments, The Choate School (founded in 1896 in Wallingford) and [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] (founded in 1890 in Wallingford, moved later to [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]). At the merger, the Wallingford campus was enlarged with a complex of modernist buildings on its eastern edge to accommodate the students from Rosemary Hall.

The school has educated generations of the upper-class New England establishment and the American political elite, and it has introduced many programs to diversify the student population, including the introduction of a free education for families whose income is $75,000 or less. Choate is a member of the [[Eight Schools Association]], begun informally in 1973–74 and formalized in 2006, when former Choate headmaster Edward Shanahan was appointed its first president. The member schools are Choate, [[Phillips Academy|Andover]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Exeter]], [[Deerfield Academy|Deerfield]], [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's]], [[Hotchkiss School|Hotchkiss]], [[Lawrenceville School|Lawrenceville]], and [[Northfield Mount Hermon School|Northfield Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Smith, "History of the Association", ''The Phillipian'' (Phillips Academy), February 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Choate is also a member of the [[Ten Schools Admissions Organization]], established in 1966 and comprising Choate, [[Phillips Academy|Andover]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy|Exeter]], [[Deerfield Academy|Deerfield]], [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's]], [[Hotchkiss School|Hotchkiss]], [[The Lawrenceville School|Lawrenceville]], [[Taft School|Taft]], [[Loomis Chaffee]],  and [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]].

== History ==
=== Early years ===
[[File:Squire Stanley House - Choate Rosemary Hall.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Squire Stanley House, built 1690–1750 and visited in 1775 by George Washington. The Choate School began here in 1896. It is now a third form (first-year) girls dormitory.]]

::''See also: [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] for its history before the 1971 re-affiliation with Choate.''

The schools that would eventually become Choate Rosemary Hall were begun by members of two prominent New England families, the Choates and Atwaters.&lt;ref&gt;Ephraim Orcutt Jameson, ''The Choates in America, 1643–1896'' (Ipswich, Massachusetts, 1896); Charles Henry Stanley Davis, ''History of Walligford, Conn.'' (Meriden, Conn., 1870)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosemary Hall was founded in 1890 by Mary Atwater Choate at Rosemary Farm in Wallingford, her girlhood home and the summer residence of Mary and her husband, [[William Gardner Choate]]. Mary, an alumna of [[Miss Porter's School]], was the great-granddaughter of Caleb Atwater (1741–1832), a Connecticut merchant magnate who supplied the American forces during the Revolutionary War. In 1775 General [[George Washington]] visited the Atwater store in Wallingford en route to assuming command of the [[Continental Army]]. On that occasion, Washington took tea with Judge Oliver Stanley at the "Red House" (built 1690–1750), now Squire Stanley House on the Choate campus.

In 1878 Mary Atwater Choate had co-founded a vocational organization for Civil War widows, the New York Exchange for Women's Work, prototype of many such exchanges across the country (it survived until 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Genteel Nostalgia, Going Out of Business |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 23, 2003 |page=137 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/nyregion/a-genteel-nostalgia-going-out-of-business.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Mary planned a new institution on the same principle of female self-sufficiency and she advertised in ''The New York Times'' for a headmistress to run a school that would train girls in the "domestic arts." The advertisement was answered by Caroline Ruutz-Rees (1865–1954), a 25-year-old Briton teaching in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Generous, ''Choate Rosemary Hall: A History of the School'' (Wallingford, Conn., 1997), p. 3. Much of the matter in this section is taken from Generous.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 1890, the ''New Haven Morning News'' reported: "The opening of Rosemary Hall took place at Wallingford yesterday ... at the beautiful Rosemary Farms, which have been the property of Mrs. Choate's family for five generations. ... Rev. [[Edward Everett Hale]] addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful. 'Never forget,' said he, 'that it is a great art to do what you do well. If you limp, limp well, and if you dance, dance well'."

The eight arriving girls occupied the original school building, "old Atwater House" (built 1758), located at the northwest corner of Christian and Elm streets, where new Atwater House now stands. They also had the use of "Atwater homestead" (built 1774, now known as Homestead), which stands at the center of the present day campus, on the northeast corner of Christian and Elm streets.

[[File:Homestead (dorm) - Choate Rosemary Hall.JPG|thumb|left|210px|The Homestead, built 1774. A small door leads to a secret passage behind the chimney that may have been a station on the Underground Railroad.]]

Caroline Ruutz-Rees (pronounced "R-Treece"), headmistress of Rosemary Hall until 1938, was a figure of extraordinary personality and influence, a militant feminist and suffragist of national prominence. On the Wallingford golf course she wore bloomers, which shocked the locals, and on buggy rides to Wallingford station she carried a pistol.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosemary's 50th", ''Time'', November 4, 1940, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; She quickly changed Rosemary Hall's mission from "domestic arts" to that of a contemporary boys school.

The Choate School was founded by William and Mary Choate in 1896. William Gardner Choate (1830–1921), [[Harvard University|Harvard]] class of 1852, was U.S. District Judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern Circuit of New York]] from 1878 to 1881, and afterward a partner of Shipman, Barlow, Laroque, and Choate. He was a national authority on admiralty, railroad, bankruptcy, and corporation law.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorial of William Gardner Choate", ''New York County Lawyers' Association Yearbook 1921'' (New York, 1921), pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Like his younger, more famous brother, he was a prominent clubman (Harvard and The Century). That brother was [[Joseph Hodges Choate]], lawyer, prosecutor of the [[Tweed Ring]], and [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the Court of St. James's]].

William and Mary Choate invited Mark Pitman (1830–1905), their tenant in the aforementioned Red House, to start a boys' school under their sponsorship. Pitman, [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]] class of 1859, was 66 years old, a widower, and had been principal of Woolsey School in New Haven, Connecticut, since 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''Obituary Record of the Graduates of Bowdoin College and the Medical School of Maine for the Decade Ending June 1, 1909'' (Brunswick, Maine, 1911), pp. 350–1&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the Choates' offer, not least perhaps because it would provide employment for his unmarried adult daughters, Leila, Elizabeth, and Helen. Six boys entered the new school in fall term 1896, their average age about ten. Four of the six lived in Red House with the Pitmans, and Red House (now Squire Stanley House) has remained a dormitory to the present day.

Pitman taught Latin, English, history, and science; Elizabeth taught art, Helen piano, and Leila was writing teacher and school nurse. Mary Choate's physician brother, Huntington Atwater, taught crafts and was school doctor. There was no formal relationship with the Choates' other foundation, Rosemary Hall, a hundred yards to the east on Christian Street, but there were coeducational audiences for plays and recitals and Mary Choate hosted dances at the Homestead.

In 1897 the boys school erected Choate House across the street from Red House, the first purpose-built institutional building (and John F. Kennedy's dormitory in 1931-2). It contained recitation rooms, an infirmary, a dining room, and housing for fifteen boys. In 1899 Choate House was venue for the first "Junior Dance", but a year later the Rosemary girls would depart for a seventy-one year absence.

The official history of Choate Rosemary Hall, written by Tom Generous, says that the rift between Caroline Ruutz-Rees and Mary Choate, proponents of two very different sorts of feminism, was public knowledge as early as 1896. In that year the two women did not share the lectern at Prize Day, and local newspapers published "denials" of a rumor that Ruutz-Rees would leave the school.&lt;ref&gt;Generous, ''op cit'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; But by 1900 the headmistress and her educational style had acquired influential champions among the students' parents and two of them, residents of Greenwich, Connecticut, joined forces to effect the removal of the school to their town.

Shipping magnate Nathaniel Witherell donated {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land in the Rock Ridge section of Greenwich. Julian Curtiss gathered a group of investors and established a joint stock corporation funded through the sale of six-percent bonds. Ruutz-Rees was the chief shareholder. The Greenwich residence of Rosemary Hall began in fall term 1900, when 57 girl students moved into the Main Building, known as "The School", a U-shaped shingled house on Zaccheus Mead Lane.

In Wallingford, Mark Pitman died on December 3, 1905. Until 1908 Sumner Blakemore was titular headmaster, but the school was effectively the domain of the three Pitman sisters. At the 1908 graduation ceremony the Japanese Consul General watched his countryman Noyobu Masuda give the valedictory address. Then Judge Choate introduced the man who would assume the headmastership in the fall, George St. John, and his wife, Clara Seymour St. John. She was a [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] alumna, member of a well-connected Connecticut family, sister of future (1937–1951) Yale president [[Charles Seymour]], and descendant of Yale president (1740–1766) [[Thomas Clap]].

George Clair St. John (1877–1966), Harvard class of 1902, aged 31 in the fall of 1908, had grown up on a farm in Hoskins Station, Connecticut. He was an ordained Episcopal priest. He had taught at [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]] in Pennsylvania and [[Ransom Everglades School|Adirondack-Florida School]], and was teaching at [[Hackley School]] in Tarrytown, N.Y., when Samuel Dutton of [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Columbia Teachers College]] recruited him for the headmastership. St. John "knew, long before I read Mr. Dutton's letter, that I wanted some day to have a school of my own. In my thought about it, Dean Briggs was my first text."&lt;ref&gt;St. John, ''op cit'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; This was [[LeBaron Russell Briggs]], dean of men at Harvard when St. John was there and afterward dean of the faculty until 1925. Briggs, St. John wrote, "fathered the whole college", and the St. Johns too would serve ''in loco parentis''.

[[File:Dining hall - Choate Rosemary Hall.JPG|thumb|right|320px|The dining hall in Hill House west wing]]

Their first move to secure parental powers was decisive. In September 1909, as the official history tells it, the St. Johns "signed with the Choates an 'Agreement to Lease and Purchase.' Under its terms, the younger couple rented the school, its property and reputation, for five years at a sum equal to 11 percent of The Choate School's net income per year. ... Less than twenty months later, on May 12, 1911, St. John reported to the trustees that he had purchased the title to the school by acquiring mortgages of roughly $41,000. He resold the title in turn to The Choate School, Incorporated, for $23,000 cash and $38,000 in stock ... For all intents and purposes, The Choate School belonged to George St. John."&lt;ref&gt;Generous, ''op cit'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first quarter-century as headmaster, St. John created much of Choate as it is regarded today. Of the Georgian brick and stone campus, he had built by 1932 Hill House, West Wing, the Gymnasium, Memorial House, the Chapel, the Library, the Winter Exercise Building, and Archbold Infirmary, which was the largest school infirmary in the country. He grew the enrollment from 35 to 505 boys and the faculty from 5 to 64 masters. In the decade following the First World War (classes of 1918 to 1928) Choate sent 412 of its 618 graduates to Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, according to a table published in ''The Choate News'' in fall term 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''The Choate News'', October 13, 1928, reproduced in Generous, ''op cit'', p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

George St. John belonged to the generation of legendary, long-serving headmasters who shaped the New England prep school, chief among whom were [[Endicott Peabody]] of Groton, [[Frank Boyden]] of Deerfield, [[Horace Dutton Taft]] of Taft, Frederick Sill of Kent, Samuel Drury of St. Paul's, Alfred Stearns of Andover, [[Lewis Perry]] of Exeter, and George Van Santvoord of Hotchkiss.&lt;ref&gt;James McLachlan, ''American Boarding Schools: A Historical Study'' (New York, 1970), ''passim''; Christopher F. Armstrong, "On the Making of Good Men: Character-Building in the New England Boarding Schools", in ''The High-Status Track: Studies of Elite Schools and Stratification'', ed. P.W. Kingston and L.S. Lewis (Albany, N.Y., 1990), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rev. George St. John of Choate was succeeded in 1947 by his son, the Rev. Seymour St. John '31 (1912–2006), and the "St. John dynasty" was continued to 1973. Seymour was Yale class of 1935 and was ordained after graduating from [[Virginia Theological Seminary]] in 1942. During his time as head he built as many buildings as his father had built, greatly broadened the curriculum, raised the national profile of the school, and made it more progressive ([[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Norman Thomas]], and [[William Sloane Coffin]] were regular speakers) and cosmopolitan (Russian, Near Eastern, and Afro-American studies centers were founded, and Russian, Chinese, and Arabic courses were begun). St. John was a longtime advocate of coeducation and initiated the Choate-Rosemary contacts. At his death, headmaster Edward Shanahan told the ''New York Times'', "The merger demanded an enormous expenditure of resources by Choate because the building of a new campus was to occur within the footprints of its property. Seymour was central to the decision to expand those resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seymour St. John, 94, Leader of Choate School for 26 Years, Dies |journal=New York Times |date=April 20, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/nyregion/20stjohn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== JFK, the Muckers, and "Ask not" ===
In 1931 [[John F. Kennedy]] entered Choate as a third form (9th grade) student, following his older brother [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe Jr]], who was a star athlete at the school. Jack Kennedy—sickly, underweight, and nicknamed Rat Face by his schoolfellows—spent his first two years at Choate in his brother's shadow, and compensated for it with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. He named his group The Muckers Club, which had thirteen members—Kennedy and twelve disciples. (Among these was Kennedy's lifelong inseparable friend [[Lem Billings|Kirk LeMoyne "Lem" Billings]], who kept an apartment in the White House during JFK's presidency.)&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Hamilton, ''JFK: Reckless Youth'' (Random House, 1992), pp. 88-101, 119-27; Robert Dallek, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917–1963'' (Little, Brown and Co., 2003), pp. 33-9; David Pitt, ''Jack and Lem: John F. Kennedy and Lem Billings: The Untold Story of an Extraordinary Friendship'' (Da Capo Press, 2008), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

As Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks included a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist [[Chris Matthews]] published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean [[LeBaron Russell Briggs|LeBaron Briggs]]) was, "The youth who loves his alma mater will always ask not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can I do for her?'" Speculation that this was the original of JFK's inaugural address "Ask not" goes back at least as far as a 1966 ''Time'' magazine article, and several of JFK's Choate contemporaries noticed the echo in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, January 28, 1966; ''Parade'' magazine, December 15, 1968; Thurston Clarke, ''Ask Not: The Inauguration of John F. Kennedy and the Speech that Changed America'' (Henry Holt and Co., 2004), p. 78; Chris Matthews, "The Genesis of JFK's 'Ask Not' Line", ''The Blog'', HuffingtonPost.com, January 20, 2011; Chris Matthews, ''Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero'' (Simon and Schuster, 2011), pp. 23, 325-6, 441-2; "Document may shed light on origins of JFK speech", Associated Press, November 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy graduated from Choate in 1935. In senior class polling for the yearbook (of which he was business manager), Kennedy was voted Most Likely to Succeed.

===Choate–Deerfield rivalry===
Choate Rosemary Hall and Deerfield Academy have had a long-standing rivalry. The final weekend of the fall sports season is Deerfield Day (at Deerfield it's called "Choate Day"), when the two schools compete in every sport at varsity and sub-varsity levels. The tradition began in 1922 with an exchange of letters between Deerfield head [[Frank Boyden]] and Choate head George St. John. Since then, busloads (in the early years, trainloads) of students have made the 80-mile journey along the Connecticut River valley to cheer their teams on the rival's campus.

In the days leading up to the event, rallies and activities are held, led by Choate's Boar Pen cheering section and Deerfield's Captain Deerfield. At Choate there's the igniting of a fire-breathing dragon of sophisticated construction. At Deerfield there's a bonfire topped by a burning C, and ritual encircling of the school seal so that Choate teams won't tread on it. In recent years, alumni clubs of the two schools have met at venues around the world, from London to Los Angeles, to watch live-streaming of the varsity football game.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Alford-Hamburg, "Deerfield Day, A History of Rivalry and Tradition", ''The News'', November 11, 2011; James Chung, "Choate Day", ''The Deerfield Scroll'', November 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar boarding school traditions include the [[Andover–Exeter rivalry]] and [[Hotchkiss School#Hotchkiss–Taft rivalry|Hotchkiss–Taft rivalry]].

=== Historic cricket match ===
The [[cricket]] match that Rosemary Hall hosted in Wallingford in 1893 against Mrs. Hazen's School of Pelham Manor, N.Y., has been described as "the first interscholastic girls sporting event in American history."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Melville, ''The Tented Field: A History of Cricket in America'' (Bowling Green, Ohio: Bowling Green State University Press, 1998), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; (Girls ''intramural'' sports had, of course, existed, but the Rosemary cricket match is the earliest discoverable ''extramural'' item.) The dating to 1893 occurs in the official history of Choate, published in 1997. Other discussions of the event give an inferential date of 1895 or earlier, referencing newspaper articles in 1896 that imply a well-established rivalry. An 1898 wire story titled "Women and Cricket" said that the Rosemary–Hazen series was four years old. Whatever the date of the first match, journalistic treatment of the novelty was "over-publicized and mildly sensationalized", according to a standard [[history of American cricket]] published in 1998. "Bareheaded and wearing sweaters and short skirts", reported ''[[The New York Times]]'', "daughters of some of the most prominent men in the country defied the cold, wintry wind." The ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' under the headline "Girls Play Cricket" noted that "the Pelham girls' skirts were some two or three inches longer than those of their opponents." In November 1896 the ''[[Yale Medical Journal]]'' carried a notice that Yale Med student Frederick Hulseberg had been "engaged to coach the Rosemary Hall cricket team this fall", thereby becoming the first coach of women's cricket in America.&lt;ref&gt;"Girls at the Wickets", ''The New York Times'', November 14, 1896; "Girls Play Cricket", ''The Morning Herald'' (Baltimore), November 16, 1896, p. 6; "Women and Cricket", ''The Evening Telegram'' (St. John's, Newfoundland), June 27, 1898, p. 3; Melville, ''loc cit''; Tom Generous, ''Choate Rosemary Hall: A History of the School'' (Wallingford, Conn., 1997); Venu Palaparthi, "1895 Cricket match between Mrs. Hazen's School and Rosemary Hall – A Historic First for Interscholastic Girls Sports", July 10, 2009, DreamCricket.com; ''Yale Medical Journal'', vol. III, no. 1 (Nov. 1896), p. 46; ''Choate Rosemary Hall Bulletin'', Spring 1964, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stengel and the Braves ===
During World War II, baseball commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], under orders from the [[Office of Defense Mobilization|Office of Defense Transportation]], told major league team owners to find spring training venues close to home. In Boston, the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] chose Tufts University and the [[History of the Boston Braves|Braves]] at first considered [[Phillips Academy|Phillips Academy (Andover)]]. But a sports editor at ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was a Choate alumnus, and he persuaded the Braves to look at Choate's Winter Exercise Building (now the Johnson Athletic Center), one of the largest glass-roofed, cage-netted rooms in the country, and easily able to accommodate a baseball infield. The Braves moved into Choate dormitories on March 21, 1943 and again in March 1944.

Their roster included [[Warren Spahn]], [[Johnny Sain]] ("Spahn and Sain and pray for rain"), and manager [[Casey Stengel]]. The journalistic opportunity afforded by Stengel in a prep school setting was not lost, and a famous wire-service photo shows him dressed in mortarboard and gown "lecturing" his players. His nickname "The Perfessor" first appears at this time, as does a fine example of Stengelese: asked to comment on Choate's facilities, he said, "Excellent workouts in that there cage you just saw, which is a honey in all my years to the present time, if I may be permitted to drop into the vernacular."&lt;ref&gt;Marc Myers, "Wartime Baseball: Training at Choate", ''The New York Times'', March 28, 1982; Joel Zoss and John Bowman, ''Diamonds in the Rough: The Untold History of Baseball'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004), p. 103; "Stengel Pleased With Choate", ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'', March 18, 1943, p. 4; Jeffrey Kurz, "When Choate was the home of the Braves", Meriden, Conn. ''Record-Journal'', February 21, 2009; Harold Kaese, ''The Boston Braves, 1871–1953'' (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2004), pp. 251-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions ==
Choate Rosemary Hall's traditional events include:
* Matriculation Ceremony at the start of school, in which each student signs a pledge card of commitment "to personal growth, to integrity, to self-discipline, and to caring for others."
* Cake Race is held on the last day of fall classes. Students and staff throng the cross country course for a 5K race, with winners in each form awarded a cake.

[[File:Archbold (dorm) - Choate Rosemary Hall.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Archbold, built 1928, designed by Ralph Adams Cram. The facade and lawn as shown are set up for the annual graduation ceremony.]]
* Festival of Lessons and Carols is based on a service held in [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. The yuletide candlelight event in Seymour St. John Chapel includes Bible readings, music by Choate choruses, and instrumental groups, and carol-singing by the congregation.
* Physics Phlotilla takes place in spring term. Students gather on the banks of the Science Center Pond to watch a competition among makeshift cardboard boats. The principles of buoyancy are tested, and many craft are sunk. Students must sail their boats the length of the pond and there are prizes for speed and creative design. There is also a sub-category for best suit of armour constructed from cardboard.
* First Hurrah is the final social event for the fifth form students hosted by the sixth formers. It marks 100 more days till the end of school.
* Last Hurrah is the final social event for sixth formers. Traditionally sixth formers enjoy a reception, dinner, ballroom dance, and swing dance competition.
* Incendium is held in early April after sixth formers have received their college application decisions. Rejection letters are tossed into fire pits on the Class of 2008 Patio, and pinatas blazoned with the names of colleges are cathartically destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;"Incendium: Senior Stress a Fading Memory", ''The News'', April 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* Garden Party, a Rosemary Hall tradition, takes place in spring term. Sixth form girls invite a fifth form (junior class) girl and a faculty member. They exchange flowers, take pictures, and pass on Rosemarian traditions to the rising senior girls. A slideshow is then presented. In response to Garden Party, Choate boys have created a "Parden Garty" and are now included in the slideshow portion of the event.

=== Gertrude Stein and ''The Lit'' ===
In 1935 [[Gertrude Stein]] gave a series of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for literary posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and [[Dudley Fitts]], critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in ''The Choate Literary Magazine''. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, "I had to restore a great deal of the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely what you said about the noun." (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.)&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas Papers, shelfmark 106.2109, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein's essay appeared in the February 1935 issue of ''The Lit'' with the title "How Writing Is Written." It has many times since been anthologized and given academic treatment, with the Choate text unaltered. It "occupies a unique place in Stein's corpus as a social text that carries the marks of its particular occasion ... direct address to her audience (around sixty boys, as well as faculty and some former students)."&lt;ref&gt;Logan Esdale, "Contexts", in Gertrude Stein, ''Ida: A Novel'' (Yale University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in ''Everybody's Autobiography'' (published 1937). She wrote, "It was the first time I had ever seen such a school. When I was brought up in East Oakland we all went to public school ... The boys from twelve to sixteen listened really listened [''sic''] to everything I had to say ... I had been much struck by the Choate school literary magazine which did have extraordinary good writing in it."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bartlett Haas, ed., ''How Writing Is Written'' (Los Angeles: Black Sparrow Press, 1974); A. Walton Litz, Louis Menand, and Lawrence Rainey, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism'', vol. VII (Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 110-13; Gertrude Stein, ''Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House, 1937), pp. 247-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Edward Albee and ''The Lit'' ===
In 1944 [[Edward Albee]] transferred from [[Valley Forge Military Academy and College|Valley Forge Military Academy]] to Choate, with admissions director Frank Wheeler making a prescient note, "I have a feeling he will distinguish himself in literature."&lt;ref&gt;"Odd Man In" (cover story), ''Newsweek'', October 10, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; His brilliance was quickly recognized and mentored by such teachers as John Joseph, Charles Rice, and Sandy Lehmann. He was made managing editor of ''The Lit'' and for two years a large part of its content, in all genres, was supplied by him. Incidents from Albee's time at Choate are reworked for his plays, including the famous "bergin and water" speech in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]]'' and the "walking crow" speech in ''[[Tiny Alice]]'', which reproduces almost verbatim English teacher Lehmann's criticism of a sonnet Albee wrote for ''The Lit''.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, ''Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography'' (Simon and Schuster, 1999), pp. 56, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The May 1946 Commencement issue of ''The Lit'' contained Albee's first published play, a long one-acter called ''Schism''. Another play written at Choate, ''Each In His Own Way'', went unpublished and forgotten until 1996, when a classmate preparing for their 50th reunion found it in a scrapbook.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, ''op cit'', pp. 54-61&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyrus Hashemi''' (also spelled ''Hashimi''; c.1942 – 21 July 1986{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}) was an Iranian arms dealer linked to the [[Iran-Contra affair]] and [[October Surprise conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 7 March 1987, [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-07/news/mn-8260_1_iranian-arms 1986 Death of Iranian Informant in Arms Plot Prosecution Studied]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Trento, ''Prelude to Terror: Edwin P. Wilson and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network'' (Carroll and Graf, 2005), 202–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Hashemi was named by [[Robert Dreyfuss]] as a CIA and [[Mossad]] agent; Hashemi sued Dreyfuss and [[Lyndon LaRouche]], whose ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'' had linked Hashemi to funding of Iranian terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Spannaus, 16 March 1982, [http://larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1982/eirv09n10-19820316/eirv09n10-19820316_046-the_real_story_of_cyrus_hashemi.pdf The real story of Cyrus Hashemi], ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'' 9(10)&lt;/ref&gt; with the case dismissed in June 1983 due to Hashemi's failure to respond to legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;"plaintiff's failures regarding discovery responsibilities have made a factual determination of the merits of the claims presented impossible... Given the culpability and bad faith exhibited by plaintiff as well as sound judicial policy, this action is hereby DISMISSED." - [http://www.leagle.com/decision/1983903572FSupp331_1839 HASHEMI v.

Georgia, Atlanta Division. 1 July 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A counter-suit by EIR alleging misconduct by Hashemi's attorney was rejected in 1986. [http://www.leagle.com/decision/19862365784F2d1581_12089  HASHEMI v. CAMPAIGNER PUBLICATIONS, INC.No. 85-8550. 784 F.2d 1581 (1986)], United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. 26 March 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Hashemi died in 1986 in London in mysterious circumstances; the official cause of death was "a rare and virulent form of [[leukemia]] that was diagnosed only two days before Hashemi died."&lt;ref name=probing/&gt;

==Background==
Hashemi and his brother [[Jamshid Hashemi]] were persecuted by the Shah's [[SAVAK]] during the 1963 [[White Revolution]], and left Iran as a result. The Hashemis had connections with [[Ahmed Madani]], who was exiled in 1970 and went on to become Defense Minister after the 1979 Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph and Susan Trento, [[Public Education Center]], 1 August 2009, [http://www.dcbureau.org/20090801650/national-security-news-service/the-united-states-and-iran-the-secret-history-part-iv-failure-and-fate-a-failed-rescue-and-iranian-double-dealing.html The United States and Iran: The Secret History Part IV: Failure and Fate: A Failed Rescue and Iranian Double Dealing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hashemis supported the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], and Jamshid was appointed to oversee the national radio network, where he worked with [[Mehdi Karroubi]]'s brother Hassan.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Hashemi said he was a cousin to [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], an aide of the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] who was elected Speaker of the Iranian Parliament in 1980.&lt;ref name=probing&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 13 June 1987, [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-13/news/mn-6868_1_mysterious-death Panels Probing Mysterious Death of Iran Affair Figure]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran hostage crisis==
From November 1980 to January 1981 wiretaps were placed in the New York offices of the First Gulf Bank and Trust Company, of which Hashemi was the head.&lt;ref&gt;Selwyn Raab, ''[[New York Times]]'', 3 June 1984, [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/03/nyregion/us-arms-smuggling-inquiry-focuses-on-iranians.html U.S. ARMS-SMUGGLING INQUIRY FOCUSES ON IRANIANS]&lt;/ref&gt; The bank had handled clandestine money transfers for the Iranian government, with Admiral [[Ahmad Madani]], then the Defense Minister, ordering $30–$35m transferred to an account there in late 1979.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A 1992 Senate investigation concluded that Hashemi was involved in a 1980 CIA attempt to funnel $500,000 to the campaign of Iranian presidential candidate [[Ahmad Madani]], ahead of the [[Iranian presidential election, 1980]]. [[Charles Cogan]] met with Hashemi and his brother Jamshid in New York on 5 January, and in the context of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] the Hashemis "promised to put U.S. officials in touch with top officials in the Tehran government, including a family member of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini", but asked for financial support for Madani. The CIA provided $500,000 in cash on 17 January, which was rejected in favour of a wire transfer via Switzerland. Hashemi later returned $290,000 to Cogan, via the office of [[John Stanley Pottinger]], after Cogan had determined that less than $100,000 had been spent for its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Drinkard, [[Associated Press]], 24 November 1992, [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/Probe-of-1980-GOP-Hostage-Dealings-Reveals-Covert-CIA-Operation/id-aced9401e8837998832ee4c0643508cf Probe of 1980 GOP Hostage Dealings Reveals Covert CIA Operation]&lt;/ref&gt; Madani later testified to the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] that he had told off Hashemi for attempting to collaborate with the Republicans behind Carter's back; he said Hashemi had offered to bring Casey to a meeting to discuss a hostage deal.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Mid-1980s==
According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', by the mid-1980s Hashemi, although maintaining an appearance of wealth (such as commuting to his London office in a gold-trimmed Rolls-Royce) was facing bankruptcy, in part due to major gambling losses sustained in London casinos.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 28 December 1986, [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-28/news/ss-753_1_adnan-khashoggi/2 The Iran Deception : REAGAN'S GREATEST CRISIS : CHAPTER 3 : Enough to Make a Middleman Smile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1985 Hashemi was partnered with [[Adnan Khashoggi]] in "World Trade Group", "a joint venture ... that was seeking to trade farm equipment, oil and military weapons with Iran."&lt;ref&gt;William C. Rempel and Dan Fisher, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 20 December 1986, [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-20/news/mn-4450_1_arms-shipments Larger Israeli Role in Arms Shipments Told : Top Aide to Peres Tried to Help Two Weapons Dealers Get $15 Million in Financing, Sources Say]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Furmark]] was also involved.&lt;ref name=Traub&gt;James Traub, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', 8 February 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J-UCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 The Katzenjammer Falcon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1985 Hashemi approached William Casey with a new arms-for-hostages plan.&lt;ref name=probing/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in 1988 that "according to newly declassified CIA and State Department memos, Hashemi approached then-CIA Director William J. Casey with an arms-for-hostages plan of his own that was strikingly similar to the one that would soon be embraced by the White House as its secret Iran arms initiative."&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 4 August 1988, [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-04/news/mn-10201_1_iran-arms Iran Arms Dealers May Use Secret CIA Links as Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, Hashemi's lawyer in this proposal was [[John Stanley Pottinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/bush/bush16.htm  George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography --- by Webster G. Tarpley &amp; Anton Chaitkin ]&lt;/ref&gt; A June 1985 CIA memo documented a call regarding a potential arms-for-hostages deal from Hashemi to Shaheen. The ''Times'' said in 1988 it had discovered that Hashemi was meeting with [[Adnan Khashoggi]] and [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]], and that Hashemi's efforts to arrange a deal collapsed in August 1985 due to Kashoggi's competing efforts to arrange US access to Ghorbanifar via [[Robert McFarlane]].&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

===Brokers of Death arms case===
{{main|Brokers of Death arms case}}

In 1986 Hashemi acted as a government informant in a four-month sting operation for the US Customs Service,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/29/us/us-employed-a-sting-setup-for-arms-to-iran.html&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the [[Brokers of Death arms case]], which the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described in 1988 as "the largest arms conspiracy prosecution ever brought by the Justice Department".&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt; Hashemi had agreed to act as an informant in exchange for the dropping of arms smuggling charges against him.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;

'''Daniel Lang''' (May 30, 1913 – November 17, 1981) was an American author and journalist. He worked as a staff writer for [[The New Yorker|The New Yorker Magazine]] from 1941 until his death in 1981.

== Life and work ==
Daniel Lang was born on the Lower East Side of New York City to Fanny and Noosan Lang, [[Hungarian Jewish]] immigrants. He was raised by his mother and half-sister, Bella Cohen. These early years are described in a semi-autobiographical short story, "The Robbers,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Robbers |journal=Story |volume=XXXlll |issue=132 |date=November–December 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Daniel, and in "Streets, A Memoir of the Lower East Side," written by Bella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Streets |others=Part 4 |author=Bella Spewack |page=81 |year=1995 |journal=Lois and Arthur Elias |publisher=The Feminist Press at the City University of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Lang reached high school age, he and his mother had moved to Brooklyn, where he attended [[Erasmus Hall High School]], graduating in 1929. Following high school, he worked for several years, then entered the [[University of Wisconsin]] on scholarship, receiving his BA in 1936.

After graduation, Lang worked as a government [[Works Progress Administration]] sociologist in the South. His life ambition was to write, however, and he soon found a job at [[The New York Post]]. During this time he met Margaret Altschul, a reporter for the [[New York Journal-American]], whom he married in 1942. They were married for 39 years, living and raising their three daughters in New York City.

Recalling Lang's appearance at the New Yorker, former New Yorker editor [[William Shawn]] wrote, "He arrived in our offices one day in 1941, shortly before the United States entered the Second World War, with an impressive sheaf of clippings of articles he had written for the New York Post. He was immediately taken onto the staff and soon wrote his first Reporter-at-Large piece on the British American Ambulance Corps.&lt;ref name="Shawn 206"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Daniel Lang|first=William |last=Shawn |publisher= Condé Nast|work=The New Yorker |date=30 November 1981 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang served as war correspondent for the New Yorker in Italy, France and North Africa. Following the war, he observed and reported on atomic testing. Problems raised by nuclear testing concerning the moral responsibility of scientists remained a keen interest and the topic of many articles over the years. During the Vietnam War era, he became absorbed by the ethical choices raised by this conflict and was one of the first reporters to expose military atrocities against the Vietnamese civilian population. Toward the end of his writing career, he interviewed aging Germans, former [[Flakhelfer]], about their role in the Third Reich, returning to his focus on how individuals can become implicated in evil through denial and the refusal to acknowledge reality.

Many of his New Yorker articles were collected and published in book form and translated into various languages including Spanish, Dutch, German, Polish and Japanese.

William Shawn described Lang's work in this way: "He was one of the most steadfast and talented of our reportorial writers.&lt;ref name="Shawn 206"/&gt; His writings invariably had moral weight. He was a student of the conscience. Implicit in every piece he wrote was a controlling idea, but he never lapsed into abstraction. He tried very hard to understand the people he wrote about, and far more often than not he succeeded.”&lt;ref name="Mitgang"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/obituaries/daniel-lang-66-correspondent-and-author-for-new-yorker-dies.html |title=Daniel Lang, 66, correspondent and author for New Yorker, dies |first=Herbert |last=Mitgang |publisher=The New York Times |date=19 November 1981 |page=206)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in the words of author [[John Hersey]], “In all his years of writing, Dan never touched...a trivial subject.  In his person he was extraordinarily modest, as writers go, but the reach of his mind as an author could not have been more ambitious. As he grew from piece to piece, he stubbornly and courageously manifested that his job as a writer in the atomic age was nothing less than to address the moral consciousness of humankind.... But the tone of his work was never inflated or too grand, as such subjects and themes might have threatened to make it.  The power of his voice came paradoxically from its quietness. He approached our minds and hearts very simply, in a storyteller's way, through tales about people faced with the great dilemmas of our time.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Daniel Lang|first=John |last=Hersey |publisher=Speech delivered at memorial service for Daniel Lang at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home |date=20 November 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to journalism, Lang wrote poetry, children’s literature, short stories and an opera libretto.

His New Yorker article, "The Bank Drama,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1974-11-25#folio=056 |publisher=The New Yorker Magazine |title=A Reporter at Large: The Bank Drama |date=25 November 1974 |pages=56–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on a hostage situation in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1973, from which psychiatrist [[Nils Bejerot]] coined the phrase "[[Stockholm Syndrome]]."

==Personal life==

The '''Enten controversy''' involved [[Kazutsugi Nami]], the chairman of Tokyo bedding supplier Ladies &amp; Gentlemen (L&amp;G), arrested by Japanese police on 5 February 2009. He and twenty-one other executives were accused of defrauding 37,000 investors of at least 126&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[yen]]&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bedding company chairman, workers nabbed over massive investment scandal |work=[[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Daily News]] |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090205p2a00m0na014000c.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206082502/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090205p2a00m0na014000c.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately [[US Dollar|US$]]1.4&amp;nbsp;billion) between 2001 and 2009.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7871237.stm|title=Chairman arrested in Japan 'scam'|date= 5 February 2009 |accessdate= 5 February 2009 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nami is the inventor of a quasi-currency, "Enten", which he used to attract investors. Some sources put the total amount of the money involved as high as 226&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;yen, which would make it, if proven, to be the biggest investment fraud in Japanese history since Toyota Shoji, an investment group, defrauded investors of 202.5&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;yen in the late '80s.&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"&gt;{{citeweb | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/05/japan-kazutsugi-nami-ladies-gentlemen | title = Arrests made in what could be biggest investment scam in Japanese history | first = Justin | last = McCurry | date = 5 February 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gain credibility and popularity, Nami's company used famous [[enka]] singers such as [[Takashi Hosokawa]] in their advertisements. In May 2008, Hosokawa was accused on the Japanese civil court for participating, but he insisted that he was not responsible for the content of their advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?sec=1&amp;id=3820|title=Japanese businessman arrested in investment scam|publisher=[[Asia News Network]]|date=2009-02-06|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I was stupid. It's my fault as I was greedy."&lt;ref name="smh20090205"/&gt;

== Enten ==
Since 2004&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; Nami had been issuing special electronic money which he referred to as {{nihongo|''Enten''|円天|extra=a combination of the Japanese currency name, [[Japanese yen|yen]], and the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for ''[[wikt:天|heaven]]''&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;}} to investors who paid at least [[Japanese yen|¥]]100,000 (approx. £750, US$1,100). Enten was a [[Virtual economy|virtual currency]] which Nami expected to become [[legal tender]] in the post-recession by which time he will also have become "world famous."&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"/&gt; Investors were promised 36% [[Rate of return|annual returns]].&lt;ref name="smh20090205"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/japanese-man-arrested-over-14bndlr-investment-scam-20090205-7yrp.html|title=Japanese man arrested over 1.4-bn-dlr investment scam|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was even an "Enten fair" during which participants sang the praises of Nami's investment plan.&lt;ref name="smh20090205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; One woman described the existence of Enten as "wonderful", whilst another said: "It's like a dream, I can buy anything."&lt;ref name="smh20090205"/&gt;

"Enten" were generated through his customers' mobile phones and could be used to purchase items online, including vegetables, [[futon]]s, clothing and jewelry.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; In February 2007, L&amp;G dividends were distributed in Enten, rather than in cash, which caused many lawsuits and cancellations of accounts.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; In October 2007, police searched L&amp;G's headquarters in Tokyo, suspecting that the company had violated investment laws.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy in November 2007.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; 

Nami denies allegations of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; He had built up a [[cult]]-like following amongst his investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japanese man arrested over 1.4-bn-dlr investment scam |work=[[Agence France Presse]] |publisher=Google News |accessdate=|date=5 February 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhaToshJ4mZc5I7NtTtaDaGwifaA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers representing these victims say Nami believed he had a "divine decree" to "eliminate poverty from this world."&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;

Nami was drinking beer when police, followed by reporters, arrested him in a restaurant where he was eating his breakfast close to his Tokyo office at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time on 4 February 2009. Nami and other company executives were arrested on suspicion of violating the Law for Punishment of Organized Crimes.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; Nami declared his innocence as he was led away by the police, accusing them of destroying his business.&lt;ref name="Police hold 22 over $2bn investor fraud"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25013739-25837,00.html|title=Police hold 22 over $2bn investor fraud|date= 5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |publisher=''[[The Australian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested before television cameras, Nami insisted: "Time will tell if I'm a conman or a swindler. I'm leading 50,000 people. Can they charge a company this big with fraud?"&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"/&gt; Shortly beforehand, he had been asked about his feelings for those who had lost money: "No. I have put my life at stake.

You should be aware that high returns come with a high risk."&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"/&gt;

On March 18, 2010, Nami was sentenced to 18 years in prison for his scheme. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LEAD%3A+Bedding+supplier+chief+given+18+years+for+investment+fraud.-a0221847696]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6974">The '''European Training Programs''' '''Certification''' &amp; '''Examination''' ('''Uniform ETP Exam''') is the examination administered to most people who wish to become ''' Certified Public Training Accountants for Banking, Management of Human Resource, Or Information &amp; STATICO''' in the '''European Union'''. The Uniform '''ETP''' Exam is developed and maintained by the '''International European Institute of Management &amp; Commerce''' ('''IEMC'''), and is administered by the '''National Association of Management''' ('''ISG'''). The '''ETP exam''' is used by the regulatory bodies of all [[European Union]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ghana]], Congo, [[Lebanon]], and [[Jordan]].

==History==
Until the 1990s, the Uniform '''ETP''' Exam was a 19 and a half hour test given over a three-day period, consisting of four subject areas (sections), which were tested in five sittings:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-presentation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; '''Auditing''' (3.5 hours); '''Business Law''' (3.5 hours); '''Human Resource Theory''' (3.5 hours); and''' STATICO''' Practice (Part I &amp; Part II; 4.5 hours each). Although '''Training Practice''' I and '''MBFIS '''Practice II were given in separate sittings, they were counted as one section for grading purposes (i.e., five exam parts, resulting in four separate scores). In '''1994''', the exam was restructured into a four-section, two-day exam. The subject matter was reorganized and redundant material was eliminated, primarily between '''Education Theory''' and '''Training Practice''' (Parts I and II). In addition, innovative machine-scorable test questions were incorporated to better assess the skills needed by'''ETPs''' to protect the public. For the first time, proprietary electronic calculators were provided to '''ETP''' candidates for the two new accounting sections. The four new sections were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilc-et.com/european-training-programs.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Human Resource''' and Professional Responsibilities
* '''Management Information Systems'''
* '''Accounting and Reporting Banking''' – Taxation, Financial Managerial, and Governmental and Not-for-Profit Organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/vae-deroulement.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Financial Accounting and Reporting''' – Business Enterprises
Until '''1996''', completely new versions of the '''ETP Exam''' were prepared every Three months, and after each administration all questions and the keyed responses (correct answers) were published and available for purchase. Beginning with the May 1996 administration, almost all exam material was kept secure so that many high-quality questions could be reused. Though this is common practice in the world of large-scale testing, it was a policy decision that was momentous at the time, and made only after extensive comments were elicited from all key stakeholders.

==Sections and topics covered==
The sections have been reorganized as follows:
* '''Management Of Banking &amp; Finance International Systems''' (4.5 hours): (MBFIS) – This section covers knowledge of planning the engagement, internal controls, obtaining and documenting information, reviewing engagements and evaluating information, and preparing communications.
* '''Management of Human Resource''' (4.0 hours):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isg.fr/european-training-programs.html [ Brochure for ISG.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; (MHR) – This section covers knowledge of concepts and standards for Management Human Resource statements, typical items in MHR statements, specific types of transactions and events, letters and reporting for governmental agencies, and reporting for non-governmental and not-for-profit organizations.
*''' STATICO''' (4.0 hours): (REG) – This section covers knowledge of statics and professional responsibility, business law, Federal tax procedures and accounting issues, Federal taxation of property transactions, Federal taxation – individuals, and Federal taxation – entities.
* '''[[Management Information Systems]]''' (4.5 hours): (MIS) – This section covers knowledge of business structures, MIS concepts, financial management, information technology, and planning and measurement.
The Uniform '''ETP Exam''' tests primarily understanding and the ability to apply authoritative literature—such as '''Management''', '''auditing''' and '''accounting standards''', the Uniform Commercial Code, and the Internal Revenue Code—that are universally adopted by all European Union jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialnewsline.com/finance/changes-to-the-cpa-exam-in-january-2011&lt;/ref&gt; Every effort is made to avoid asking about subject matter that may have different correct answers in different jurisdictions. [2]

'''Harry Allen Corey''' (March 12, 1901 – January 20, 1989) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] entrepreneur and politician. In 1924, he married Nelda Stairs, daughter of [[Ernest W. Stairs]], a prominent [[Southampton, New Brunswick]], [[farm]]er and a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]].

Corey entered the [[lumber]] business in his early twenties, first working in forestry in his home area in northern [[York County, New Brunswick]] before settling in [[Millinocket, Maine]], where [[Great Northern Paper Company]] owned vast timberlands and operated the second largest newsprint mill in the state. Unusual for the time, his wife Nelda played an active role in the creation and development of the family's lumber business which led the couple to the small community of [[Harvey Station, New Brunswick|Harvey, New Brunswick]], where they made their permanent home in the 1930s. Highly successful, Corey's lumber operations grew to employ more than five hundred people.

Introduced to politics by his father-in-law, in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1944|1944 New Brunswick general election]], Corey was elected to the [[40th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]] as the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal Party's]] candidate for York County. He was returned to office in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1948|1948 election]]. Following his party's defeat in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1952|1952 election]], he was voted President of the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association]], a position he held from 1953-1959.

Corey died in 1989 and is buried in Harvey.

==Antecedents==
He was a fifth generation descendant of Loyalist Gideon Corey of North Kingston, Washington County, Rhode Island, who came to Canada at the peace in 1783.

He was a fifth generation descendant of Donald MacDonald, native of the Isle of Skye, who migrated to New Brunswick prior to 1790 first settling in the Moncton area and marrying Ann Smith and later moved to New Canaan, Brunswick Parish, in Queens County where he acquired and operated a grist mill and farm.

He was a sixth generation descendant through Ann Smith aforesaid to planters James and Martha Smith who arrived in the Moncton area from Philadelphia in June, 1766, having arranged to take up land granted to a Philadelphia syndicate that included Benjamin Franklin as one of the owners. James Smith is thought to have married Martha in Halifax after he arrived there with Col Cornwallis as he then was in 1749 and then, after the hostilities with the French ended in 1760, was released from further duty, hitched a ride for he and his family on a British transport or supply ship headed to the British headquarters in Philadelphia and was living there when this Moncton opportunity appeared.
He was a third cousin once removed to Richard Chapman Weldon QC, PhD (Harvard), MP, Albert County Politician and co-founder and first dean of Dalhousie Law School in Halifax through his great great grandmother Ann Smith whose sister Martha Smith married John Geldart and in time became great grandparents of Dean Weldon.

'''Houston House Apartments''' is a 31-story apartment complex in the [[Houston Skyline District|Skyline District]] of [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]] [[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States.

The building, located in the southern portion of Downtown, has 396 apartments. [[Charles M. Goodman]] designed the building, which opened in 1966. Since 1983 Larry Hill of Sumar Realty Corp. and a group of investors have owned the building as part of a partnership.&lt;ref name="Facelift"&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy. "[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/7222709.html High-rise face-lift]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. September 28, 2010. Retrieved on May 28, 2011. "The longtime owner is putting more than $10 million into the 31-story tower on the southern end of downtown." and "Larry Hill of Sumar Realty Corp. has owned the building at 1617 Fannin with investors since 1983."&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 the building had a 90% occupancy rate, and it was one of the few residential buildings in Downtown Houston that had been in operation for around 40 years.&lt;ref name="Chicagocompany"&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy.

Retrieved on May 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years prior to 2010, the owners tried to sell the building to a [[Chicago]] company,&lt;ref name="Facelift"/&gt; NVG Residential. NVG planned to close on the property in January 2008. After the planned acquisition NVG planned to install new windows, re-paint the exterior, improve the lobby and the 9th and 10th floor amenity areas. In the amenity areas the company planned to install a business and fitness center, and updated club house, a basketball court, a pool, and an outdoor dining area.&lt;ref name="Chicagocompany"/&gt; The deal with the Chicago firm failed. By 2010 Hill and his business partners began a planned over $10 million renovation of the building.&lt;ref name="Facelift"/&gt;

In 2007 a vehicle driving in the apartment complex's garage punched through the wall of the garage and landed wheels up on another downtown building. The driver died in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;Lezon, Dale. "[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/4881392.html Driver killed in parking lot fall identified]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. June 12, 2007. Retrieved on May 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The average size of the units is {{convert|650|sqft|sqm}}.&lt;ref name="Facelift"/&gt; Most units range in size from {{convert|500|sqft|sqm}} to {{convert|840|sqft|sqm}}. In 2007 the per-period rent was between $800 and $1,300.&lt;ref name="Chicagocompany"/&gt;

In law, '''individual capacity''' is a ''[[Jargon|term of art]]'' referring to one's status as a [[natural person]], distinct from any other role. For example, an officer, employee or agent of a [[corporation]], acting "in their individual capacity" is acting as himself, rather than as an agent of the corporation. Thus, their actions, in their capacity as an individual would not generally incur a liability on the part of the corporation (this concept is also known as a [[corporate liability]]), nor would they have any protection from liability for their own actions as an individual.

In general, a person may be said by a second party to be acting in their capacity as an individual, whenever the person's actions are the result of their own decisions, rather than being actions to which they are obligated in their capacity as an agent of another person or agency.

International economic structures range from complete [[autarky]] to complete market openness. This structure has undergone numerous changes since the beginning of the nineteenth century. The state-power theory as put into perspective by [[Stephen Krasner]] (1976), explains that the structure of international trade is determined by the interests and power of states acting to maximize their aggregate national income, social stability, political power and economic growth. Such state interests can be achieved under free trade.

The relationship between these interests and the level of openness depends upon the economic power of states. Power is dependent upon a states size and level of economic development.

Krasner contends that distributions of potential power may vary from multipolar to hegemonic; and different international trading structures are made of either of these. The key to this argument is that a hegemonic distribution of potential economic power is likely to result in an open trading system. Since states act to maximize their aggregate economic utility, maximum global welfare is achieved under free trade.

Neoclassical trade theory posits that the greater the degree of openness in the international trading system, the greater the level of aggregate economic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krasner|first=Stephen D|title=State Power and the Structure of International Trade|journal=World Politics|year=1976|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–347|doi=10.2307/2009974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Realism===

[[Robert Gilpin]] and [[Stephen Krasner]] are advocates of the realist tradition, which emphasises the hegemonic system. The hegemonic system contends that there are states that are much larger and more developed than their trading partners and therefore, the costs and benefits of openness are not symmetrical for all members of the system. Krasner (1976) contends that the hegemonic state will have a preference for an open structure because it will increase its aggregate national income and  power.

Realism emphasizes states' demands for power and security. Military force is therefore, the most important power resource. States must rely ultimately on their own resources and must strive to maintain their power positions in the system, even at high economic costs. For realism, the most important variables are the economic and military strength of hegemonic states; and international hostilities are mainly because of variations in the distribution of political-military capabilities between states.

====Hegemonic stability====

The theory of hegemonic stability by the realist school argues that dominance of one country is necessary for the existence of an open and stable international economy. The relationship between hegemony and an open, stable economy has been challenged by some scholars “As US behaviour during the interwar period illustrates, the possession of superior resources by a nation does not translate automatically into great influence or beneficial outcomes for the world.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milner|first=H V|title=International Political Economy: Beyond Hegemonic Stability|journal=Foreign Policy|year=1998|volume=110|pages=112–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development policy====

Realist trade encourages [[Import substitution industrialization]] (ISI) replacing imports with domestic production. Realism recognises that trade regulations can be used to correct domestic distortions and to promote new industries.

Under realism, states possess a high degree of discretionary power to influence many variables and prices in the economy. The government influences the distribution of investment, thus protecting national industries.

====International institutions====

Realists with their focus on power and the struggle for survival in an anarchical world, criticize the role of international institutions that govern the world economy, such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[European Union|EU]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).  Scholars argue that the influence exerted by international institutions is dependent upon the states that form part of them, and therefore international institutions have little independent impact. Accordingly, the realist school emphasises the impact of state power over the strength of the institution per se.

===Liberalism===

The liberal tradition consists of two schools of thought on the causes of peace, one emphasises representative government and international institutions and the other advocates global markets and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gartzke &amp; Hewitt|title=International Crisis and the Capital Peace|journal=International Interactions|year=2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=115–145|doi=10.1080/03050621003784846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism traces back to [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kantian Liberalism posits that democracy, economic interdependence and international organisations are optimal solutions for reducing the incidence of conflict. It is not individual factors, which lead to a more peaceful world, but rather all three elements working in conjunction, which eliminates conflict.

Oneal and Russett’s (2001) research design has become a standard choice of replications in studies assessing the Kantian peace triangle where democracies tend to be interdependent and members of the same International Government Organisations (IGOs). Their research is consistent with the argument that democratic peace advocates economic interdependence and a joint need to attain membership in IGOs in order to prevent the incidence of conflict. However, the empirical findings on the Kantian peace triangle as a joint force to eliminate conflict presents some limitations, as one study found that the three Kantian peace variables are less robust in explaining leaders’ conflict behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Seung-Whan|title=Beyond Kantian Liberalism: Peace through Globalisation?|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|year=2010|volume=27|pages=272–295|doi=10.1177/0738894210366513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keohane and Nye (2000) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keohane|first=Robert|author2=Nye|title=Power and Interdependence Revisited|journal=International Organization|year=1987|volume=41|pages=725–753|doi=10.1017/s0020818300027661}}&lt;/ref&gt; go further to include the lack of additional components in this theory including environmental and military measurements.

====Trade====

Liberals emphasise two main aspects of the benefits of trade. First, trade promotes states to work together and cooperatively, reinforcing peaceful relations among trading partners. The second benefit is based on the expected utility model of trade and conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiang, Xu &amp; Keteku|title=Power: The Missing Link in the Trade Conflict Relationship|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=2007|volume=51|issue=4|pages=646–663|doi=10.1177/0022002707302802}}&lt;/ref&gt;   which emphasises the potential economic consequences of a disruption in trade. Countries are therefore deterred from initiating conflict against a trading partner for fear of losing the welfare gains associated with trade.

====Interdependence====

Liberals argue that economic interdependence between states reduces conflict because conflict discourages commerce.

Recent cost-benefit calculations of trade take into account information as an important component in the explanation of the pacifying aspect of economic interdependence. Through open trade, states reveal their intentions and capabilities and thus “relations become more transparent and reduce uncertainty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bussman|first=Margit|title=Foreign direct investment and militarized international conflict|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=2010|volume=47|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1177/0022343309354143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, economic interdependence makes costly signals possible. If military action did not entail loss, national leaders would not be able to communicate their capabilities and resolve. This acts as a deterrent and promotes peace between states. “Mechanisms that facilitate the transmission of credible information across international boundaries limit bargaining failure, enhancing interstate peace.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|title=Domestic Political Audiences and the Escalation of International Disputes|journal=American Political Science Review|year=1994|volume=88|pages=577–592|doi=10.2307/2944796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement about the interdependence liberal thesis among some scholars. Kenneth Waltz, for example, argues that since "close interdependence means closeness of contact and raises the prospect of at least occasional conflict . . . the [liberal] myth of interdependence . . . asserts a false belief about the conditions that may promote peace." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse|title=Trade blocs, trade flows and international conflict|journal=International Organization|year=2000|volume=54|issue=4|pages=775–808|doi=10.1162/002081800551361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the scrutiny, there is a long-held position that economic interdependence has a pacifying effect on interstate relations, evidenced by research conducted by Oneal &amp; Russett 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oneal &amp; Russett|title=Assessing the Liberal Peace with alternative specifications: Trade still reduces conflict|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=1999|volume=36|pages=423–442|doi=10.1177/0022343399036004003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Xiang et al. 2007.

According to the liberal view, the costly nature of conflict is central to contemporary bargaining theory.

Keohane &amp; Nye (1987) put forth four conditions that make the use of force by large states costly:

# Risks of nuclear escalation
# Resistance by people in poor or weak countries
# Uncertain and possibly negative effects on the achievement of economic goals
# Domestic opinion opposed to the human costs of the use of force

====Development policy====

Liberal trade encourages export led growth (ELG), leaving traders and consumers dependent on foreign markets. Liberals argue that these actors have an incentive to avoid hostilities with their trading partners, since any disruption in commercial relations would be costly.

====International institutions====

International institutions are a key feature of the liberal peace, because they represent credible signals of resolve to defend member states in times of crisis, regulate state behaviour, facilitate communication and create common security interests between member states.

==The argument about trade and conflict==

The relationship between international trade and conflict has been a source of controversy among international relations scholars. Some scholars argue that trade does not reduce conflict even though conflict reduces trade; while others report that international trade fosters a peaceful disposition among states, which are less likely to resort to armed conflict in times of crisis.

The argument that open trade inhibits conflict dates back to the classical liberal movement of free trade and world peace. This view argues that increasing interaction among traders and consumers (interdependence) promotes peace; free trade fosters a sense of international community that reduce interstate conflict and tensions. Liberals posit that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict. The contrasting contemporary view is that open trade dampens political conflict by promoting economic dependence.

Economic dependence has negative consequences for interstate conflict. [[Albert O. Hirschman]] (1945)  for example, has pointed out that the “gains from trade do not accrue to states proportionately and the distribution of these gains can affect interstate power relations. Moreover, shifts in power relations are widely regarded as a potent source of military conflict.”

===Economic interdependence===

Economic interdependence and greater openness exposes domestic economies to the exigencies of the world market. Social instability is therefore increased by exposure to international competition. This negative force undermines the Kantian peace and remains a cause for concern in international conflict. Although this concern seems legitimate given the economic disparities between developed and developing countries, studies fail to provide comprehensive empirical evidence.

Another view at odds with liberalism is that technological innovation and industrialization increase the ability of some countries to exercise power. As trade flows and the level of interdependence increases, so do the incentives for states to take military actions to reduce their economic vulnerability.

The adverse effect of trade on state security is difficult to determine, however the more competition, the more aggressive the environment. Openness and competition increases social instability because domestic prices need to adjust to changes in international prices. Consistent with the realists view that states are essentially always in conflict, social instability and resource competition are motives for conflict and states will rely on the use of force to attain their own political goals and interests.

===The role of military power===

A number of international relations scholars, notably Xiang, Xu &amp; Keteku 2007; [[Mearsheimer]] 2001, recognise the role of military power in initiating conflict, as well as the role militarily powerful countries play in international trade. One argument suggests that militarily capable countries are more likely to have the motivation to initiate armed conflict due to their awareness of their capabilities and to their confidence in achieving favourable outcomes.

A second argument suggests that power facilitates trade. Third, there are positive benefits from economic interdependence on military power. Finally, the economic stature of a country determines both the military power and level of trade of that country, hinting that economic powerful states trade more. Because powerful countries are better positioned to take advantage of the benefits resulting from international trade and to transform welfare gains into military power, they also are more likely to use force when their positions are threatened.

Similarly, Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010) argue that the “extension of economic and other interests beyond national borders increases incentives to police relevant regions and exercise influence, sometimes through force.”

===Unequal peace===

The motives for conflict, which historically were concentrated among the powerful and their ambitious challengers, are today clustered among the poor, and between the poor and the rich (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010). Theory has prompted to inequality as a potential source of internal conflict. ”Inequalities within the same countries has increased, not through impoverishment of the masses, but because while wealth is created many people remain left behind in poverty. Thus, we have an unequal peace." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleditsch|first=Nils Petter|title=The Liberal Moment Fifteen Years On|journal=International Studies Quarterly|year=2008|volume=52|issue=4|pages=691–712|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2478.2008.00522.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 60 countries suffer not only from low GDP per capita but also low or negative growth. These countries tend to be caught in armed conflict among other development traps. Some argue that the evidence surrounding inequality and conflict remains inconclusive, calling for further empirical studies.

Studies show that states with the most dissimilar interests possess a motive for conflict but whether they experience conflict (or not) depends on external determinants of bargaining success or failure. These determinants include uncertainty about the balance of power, opponent’s resolve as well as policy dissimilarities between competing states.  Interests are important determinants of whether conflict occurs.  According to Gartzke &amp; Hewitt (2010), promoting democratic interests, or even imposing them for peace, is not likely to reduce conflict “it may even lead to a weakening of the actual determinants of liberal peace”, thereby increasing interstate tensions. Contemporary research demonstrates that promoting free markets and economic development helps mitigate conflict and promote peace

==Capitalist peace==

The capitalist peace thesis suggests that free markets and economic development contribute to a reduction in interstate conflict.

Research on the capitalist peace has chosen to pursue the liberal political economy school, with a particular focus on Kant's [[Perpetual Peace]].  The same set of theoretical frameworks that evolved in democratic peace research now asserts itself in the capitalist peace (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;121).

The capitalist peace sees capitalism as creating conditions to make war more costly and therefore undesirable by trading states. Traditional interpretations of the capital peace contend that development and global markets will eventually eliminate resource competition as a motive for war. This view was eventually deemed outdated, as “it became clear that needed raw materials would continue to make their way to industrial centers through free markets, rather than through mercantilist autarkies (Gartzke &amp; Hewitt, 2010, p. 122).

The capitalist theory contends that as economies become stronger, prosperous capitalist states no longer need to threaten one another over access to inputs to production. Consequently, the security dilemma loses its relevance.

Scholars like [[Michael Mousseau]] argue that democracies are only peaceful in pairs. Other research has demonstrated that the democratic peace is even more exclusive than previously imagined, limiting the finding to developed democracies. Gartzke and Hewitt (2010) challenged this by demonstrating that it is economic development and market freedoms, rather than political liberty that result in interstate peace.

===Deterrent effect of institutional ties===

International Government Organisations (IGOs) are designed to promote cooperation and inhibit political disputes. Institutional ties promote the exchange of information about the economic gains and losses of participating member states, thereby reducing uncertainty about the distribution of benefits.

Regional institutions also present great influence in addressing issues beyond trade. Regional economic institutions help develop trade expectations for the future. “High economic stakes that states have in the continuation and growth of economic activity in the context of economic regionalism lead to a security community in which states develop a genuine interest in not only keeping peace with each other, but also defending their relationship against outside aggressors.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Aysegul|title=The deterrent effects of economic integration|journal=Journal of Peace Research|year=2010|volume=47|pages=523–533|doi=10.1177/0022343310370290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to their role in dispute settlement, regional arrangements can deter aggressors from targeting institutionally connected states.

Aydin (2010) makes an important contribution to the extended deterrence literature and economic peace research through his empirical study on the deterrent effect of economic integration. This study shows that trade has a general deterrent effect on attackers when the target is economically integrated with potential defenders through regional trade institutions. When trade is conducted in an institutionalised setting it can have political implications beyond bilateral interdependence.

Research shows that economic integration decreases the opportunities to fight and enhances the opportunities to intervene in crisis. Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;776) present strong evidence that “the combination of PTA membership (preferential trading arrangements) and a high level of trade is quite likely to discourage belligerence.”

Many PTAs have become venues for addressing political disputes between participants and fostering cooperation. Observers have widely acknowledged, for example, that [[ASEAN]] has helped to manage tensions in Southeast Asia. Mercado Comun del Sur ([[MERCOSUR]]) has done likewise, improving political-military relations throughout the southern cone. (Mansfield &amp; Pevehouse, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;781). The reciprocal nature of this system helps guarantee that economic concessions made by one state will be repaid, rather than exploited by its counterpart.

==International investment flows==

Another area to add to the existing literature on economic integration is the impact of militarized conflict on foreign investment.

Bussman’s (2010) contribution to the liberal notion that conflict inhibits foreign investment, complements the liberal peace arguments in conflict studies. Bussman’s research shows that international conflict reduces international investment flows considerably.

Bussman contends that “as with trade, foreign investment could be an important factor in promoting peace. States might avoid violent conflict in order not to deter foreign investors.”  By ensuring political stability, states can thus create an environment that is desirable to foreign investors. It is therefore, in the best interest of states to keep away from belligerent behaviour as they could potentially miss out on the welfare gains associated with foreign investment.

As a result, states that benefit from foreign direct investment flows are less likely to experience the onset of militarized conflict.

'''''Lemonade Stand''''' is a [[business simulation game]] created in 1973 by Bob Jamison of the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] (MECC). In it, the player moves through several rounds of running a [[lemonade stand]], beginning each round by making choices dependent on their current amount of money about their stock, prices, and advertising. In each round, the results are randomized based on the player's inputs, as well as affected by random events such as thunderstorms and street closures. Each round ends with a summary of the player's current status, and the game ends after 12 rounds.

In 1979, the game was [[porting|ported]] by Charlie Kellner to the [[Apple II]]; [[Apple (company)|Apple]] subsequently included the game with their computers throughout the 1980s. MECC also offered the game for sale as a part of bundles of children's software for Apple computers and [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]]. Kellner's source code was released, and has since been ported to modern computers as a free, open-source game. Reviewers of the game, both contemporary and retroactive, viewed the game as a good primer for children into business and decision making processes.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Lemonade Stand 1.png|thumb|right|The decision making screen]]
The game simulates a child's lemonade stand, where choices made by the player regarding prices, advertising, etc. will determine the success or failure of the enterprise. The game owed its success to offering just enough variables to make a complex challenge for users, but still providing a simply-grasped introduction to running a business.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lauppert"/&gt;

The player is first given a weather report for the day (sunny, cloudy, or hot and dry, each accompanied by a color drawing) and is  prompted for three values: the number of glasses of lemonade to make, the number of advertising signs, and the cost of lemonade per glass. The program then gives a report of the earnings for that day. A thunderstorm, sometimes occurring on cloudy days and accompanied by an animation, will void any profits and cause the player to lose any investment for the day. Other random events, such as street closures or the wind blowing away some signs, can also occur. The game ends after 12 rounds, or days. The game can be played either single-player or with up to 30 players (each player is independent and the sales of one do not affect another).&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Six Business Management Games|url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1982-04-a/Creative_Computing_v08_n04_1982_April#page/n29/mode/1up|format=jpg|magazine=[[Creative Computing]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|volume=8|number=4|date=April 1982 |pp=28, 30 |author=[[David H.

It also added color to the thunderstorm animation.

==Development==
[[File:Lemonade Stand 2.png|thumb|right|The report screen]]
''Lemonade Stand'' was originally developed by Bob Jamison of the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] in 1973 for time-shared mainframe computers.&lt;ref name="hotu"&gt;[http://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/46-simulation/22650 Lemonade Stand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514193640/http://www.hotud.org/component/content/article/46-simulation/22650 |date=2010-05-14 }} on [[Home of the Underdogs]]{{user-generated source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/digital-life/how-tos/lemonade-stand-and-the-apple-revolution/2008/12/23/1229998532318.html Lemonade Stand and the Apple revolution] on [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] (December 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} Charlie Kellner [[porting|ported]] the game to the [[Apple II]] platform in February 1979,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} and Apple included it for free with their computers throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="lauppert"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130226024448/http://theodor.lauppert.ws/games/lemonade.htm Short history of Lemonade Stand], by Theodor Lauppert (archived){{self-published source|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Apple Tapes: Introductory Programs for the Apple II plus|url=https://archive.org/stream/The_Apple_Tapes_Introductory_Programs_for_the_Apple_II#page/n4 |publisher=Apple Computer Inc.|quote=manual original|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy ==
In 1982 [[David H. Ahl]] reviewed the game along with five other business management simulations in ''[[Creative Computing]]''; he indicated that it was simpler than most, and likely aimed at children, and said that it was a good teaching game for children about businesses. He also noted that it was free on Apple computers, and available for sale for the same system as part of a bundle of seven games for children for US$25 from MECC.&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt; MECC also sold the game as part of a package for [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Instructional Computing Demonstration|url=https://archive.org/stream/APXInstructionalComputingDemonstration_201508/APX_Instructional_Computing_Demonstration#page/n33/mode/2up|format=jpg|publisher=[[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]] |author=[[Atari Program Exchange]] |data=|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Ghaffari, in ''Tapping the Wisdom that Surrounds You'', claimed that the game was "the perfect vehicle to introduce the [[microcomputer]] to family and friends and to convince them that technology could be a fun and positive force in their life."&lt;ref name="TW"/&gt;

Kellner's [[Applesoft BASIC]] [[source code]] has been available since 1979.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The game was later [[Source port|ported]] to modern [[REALbasic]]&lt;ref name="codenautics" /&gt; and released as [[free and open-source software]] for many platforms like [[Windows]] and [[macOS]].&lt;ref name="codenautics"&gt;[http://codenautics.com/lemonade/ Lemonade Stand] on Codenautics "Lemonade Stand is both [[free and open-source]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web|work=LemonadeStand|publisher=GitHub|title=README.txt|url=https://github.com/jefftranter/6502/tree/master/basic/LemonadeStand|first=Jeff|last=Tranter}}{{user-generated source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was published in Israel in Hebrew in the 1980s.

'''Leopold Fabius Dietegen Fane de Salis''', (26 April 1816 &amp;ndash; 20 November 1898) was a Tuscan-born Australian pastoralist and politician.&lt;ref&gt;''A genealogical and heraldic History of the Colonial Gentry'', by [[Burke's Peerage|Sir (John) Bernard Burke]], CB, LLD, vol. 2, London, 1895/1899 (pages 574–77).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Burke's Peerage'', Foreign Noblemen / Foreign Titles sections: 1851, 1936, 1956, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LeopoldDeSalis.jpg|thumb|Count ''Leo'' in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;He came to England in 1893, particularly to settle his affairs in Middlesex.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878), wife to Leopold F. D. Fane De Salis (1816-1898).jpg|thumbnail|left|Charlotte MacDonald (d.1878).]]
Born in [[Florence]] to [[Jerome, 4th Count de Salis-Soglio]] and Henrietta Foster,&lt;ref&gt;Daughter of [[William Foster (bishop)|Lord Bishop of Clogher, William Foster]].&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Eton College]] and studied sheep farming at [[Jedburgh]] in Scotland. In 1840 he migrated to [[Sydney]], where he formed a partnership to run a station at [[Junee, New South Wales|Junee]]. In the same decade, in 1842, 1844 and 1848, his highly capable next elder brother [[William Andrew Salius Fane de Salis|William]] also sailed to Australia. They did much business together.

In 1844 he married Charlotte Macdonald, with whom he had four children, two of whom ([[George De Salis|George]] and [[Leopold William De Salis|Leopold]]) would later become politicians themselves. In 1855 he sold out and bought the [[Cuppacumbalong Homestead|Cuppacumbalong station]] at [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]], later purchasing further property on the [[Murrumbidgee River]]. In 1864 he was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for [[Electoral district of Queanbeyan|Queanbeyan]], but he did not re-contest in 1869. In 1872 he was appointed to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. Around this time he also acquired property in [[Queensland]], all of which he lost in the 1890s depression. His daughter Nina married [[William Farrer]] in 1882 and they lived at [[Lambrigg, Tharwa]], a property given them by De Salis. In 1898 he left the Council bankrupt with significant debts. He died at Tharwa later that year.&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web

During World War II, she helped the American forces in France.

Mary Paul was the daughter of James William Paul, Jr. (1851-1908) and Frances Drexel (1858-1901), the daughter of [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]] (1826-1893). She was born and raised in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]], where she grew up and was presented to society in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Miss Mary Astor Paul to Wed.|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=104765456&amp;sid=12&amp;Fmt=1&amp;clientId=56233&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP |quote= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 29, 1908 |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==

On October 28, 1908, Mary's engagement to [[Charles Alexander Munn, Jr.]] was announced. The marriage of the couple took place on June 21, 1909, at St. Martin Episcopal Church in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]]. Many members of society were present, including the Drexel and Roosevelt families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MISS MARY ASTOR PAUL WEDS.; Niece of Late Mrs. William Waldorf Astor Marries Charles A.

After their marriage, the couple lived at Woodcrest, their residence in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania|Radnor]], until they sold it in 1925. After the sale, the couple sailed to France, intending on living there for a decade. However, Mary filed for divorce in 1930, citing abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MRS.

==Children==

The Munns had four children together: three daughters and a son: Pauline, Mary, Frances Drexel, and Charles A. Munn, Jr.

Pauline, the eldest child, married [[Milton Dorland Doyle]], of New York City, in [[Cap Ferrat, France]] in 1931. The marriage was a tumultuous one, and after twice filing and then dismissing divorce charges, the couple was divorced in 1938. Pauline died in France in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MRS. PAULINE MUNN DOYLE; Descendant of Anthony J.

Charles served with the [[United States Naval Reserve]], rising to the rank of lieutenant in 1941. At that time, he married [[Louise Stanley]], the actress, in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=LOUISE STANLEY WEDS; Actress Becomes the Bride of Lt.

Frances Drexel Munn went to school in Europe and was presented to society in 1934 at the [[Bellevue-Stratford]] in Philadelphia. In 1938, she married George F. Baker, son of the [[George Fisher Baker|prominent banker of the same name]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=GEO. F. BAKER JR.

Mary Munn was educated at a school in [[Westfield, England]], until the war broke out. At that time, she was brought to Paris and educated by private tutors. On 29 September 1948, she married [[Frederick Edward Neuflize Ponsonby, 10th Earl of Bessborough|Frederick Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon]] at the [[American Cathedral]] in [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MISS MARY MUNN ENGAGED TO PEER; She Will Be Bride of Viscount Duncannon, Son of Former Canadian Governor General.|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=85304540&amp;sid=2&amp;Fmt=1&amp;clientId=56233&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP |quote= |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=August 11, 1948 |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Dunacannon succeeded as the 10th Earl of Bessborough, 10 March 1956. Lady Bessborough was a painter of still life.

==World War II==

During World War II, Mrs. Munn, now remarried to Jacques Allez, served the United States Military in a large role. She served as president of the [[American Aid Society]] in Paris. During the French resistance movement, she helped contact the American forces under the code name "Pauline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MRS.

The President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman]], awarded Mme. Allez the American [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] for her service. At the same time, French President [[Vincent Auriol]] made her a chevalier of the [[Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MRS.

Speaking of her service, Mme. Allez said that her contacts were throughout France, and consisted of people from all walks of life and occupations. She was also in personal contact throughout the war with the American Legation in [[Berne, Switzerland]], and [[Robert Daniel Murphy|Robert Murphy]], the United States Consul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MRS.

The '''''Multinational Monitor''''' was a bimonthly magazine founded by [[Ralph Nader]] in 1980. It was published by [[Essential Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multinational Monitor|url=http://www.peopleandtheplanet.com/index.html@lid=26866&amp;section=46&amp;topic=31.html|work=People and the Planet|accessdate=5 December 2016|date=23 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was formerly published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rob Weissman, editor of Multinational Monitor magazine|url=http://will.illinois.edu/mediamatters/program/mediamatters090524|accessdate=5 December 2016|work=NPR PBS|date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its primary focus was on analysis of [[corporation]]s, it also published articles on [[Trade union|labor]] issues and [[occupational safety and health]], the [[Environmentalism|environment]], [[globalization]], [[privatization]], the [[global economy]], and [[Developing country|developing nations]].

The headquarters of the magazine was in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Jensen|title=Censored 1996: The News That didn't Make the News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RY0UZWBwUIoC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=5 December 2016|year=1996|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=978-1-888363-01-2|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[non-profit]] and [[advertising]]-free publication.

The last issue (according to the magazine's web-site) had a coverdate of May/June 2009; this magazine may now be permanently defunct, though the web-site still contains a very thorough archive of past issues.

==Recurring features==
===10 Worst Corporations===
Since 1992 ''Multinational Monitor'' published an annual index recapping the activities and policies of ten corporations who demonstrated particularly egregious behavior.

===Lawrence Summers Memorial Award===
Each issue declared the bimonthly recipient of the Lawrence Summers Memorial Award, an award given in satirical honor of Lawrence Summers, the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] under [[Bill Clinton]] and later [[President of Harvard University]], given to companies that "take extraordinary leaps to justify unethical practices." The award referred to the infamous [[Summers memo]] written by Summers' aide Lant Pritchett in 1991, when Summers was the [[World Bank]]'s Chief Economist. The memo advocated transferring toxic waste and pollution from developed countries to least developed countries. (Summers later stated the memo was meant to be satire.)

'''Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881''' is an act in India dating from the British colonial rule, that is still in force largely unchanged.

== History ==
The history of the present Act is a long one. The Act was originally drafted in 1866 by the 3rd India Law Commission and introduced  in December, 1867 in the Council and it was referred to a Select Committee. Objections were raised by the mercantile community to the numerous deviations from the English  Law which it contained. The Bill had to be redrafted in 1877. After the lapse of a sufficient period for criticism by the Local Governments,  the High Courts and the chambers of commerce, the Bill was revised by a Select Committee. In spite of this Bill could not  reach the final stage. In 1880 by the Order of the Secretary of State, the Bill had to be referred to a new Law Commission. On the recommendation of  the  new Law Commission the Bill was re-drafted and again it was sent to a Select Committee which adopted most  of the additions recommended by the new Law Commission. The draft thus prepared for the fourth time was introduced in the Council and was passed into law in 1881 being the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act No.26 of 1881)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/1-50/Report11.pdf|title=11th Report - Law Commission of India | year= 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important class of Credit Instruments that evolved in India were termed [[Hundi]]. Their use was most widespread in the twelfth century, and has continued till today. In a sense, they represent the oldest surviving form of credit instrument. These were used in trade and credit transactions; they were used as remittance instruments for the purpose of transfer of funds from one place to another. In Modern era [[Hundi]] served as [[traveller's cheques]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=155 | title=Reserve Bank of India - Publications | publisher=Reserve Bank of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, "A ''negotiable instrument'' means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer.'&lt;ref name=goiact&gt;{{cite web | url=http://indiacode.nic.in/fullact1.asp?tfnm=188126 |title=Section 13 - Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 - Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in Section 1, it is also described that '''Local extent, Saving of usage relating to hundis, etc., Commencement.''' -It extends to the whole of India but nothing herein contained affects the Indian Paper Currency Act, 1871, Section 2, or affects any local usage relating to any instrument in an oriental language. Provided that such usages may be excluded by any words in the body of the instrument, which indicate and intention that the legal relations of the parties thereto shall be governed by this Act; and it shall come

Main Types of Negotiable Instruments are:

# Inland Instruments
# Foreign Instruments
# Bank 
#Finace companies(listed) Draft&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGZ7L1GkyEk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://svtuition.com/type-of-negotiable-instruments/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern era ==
We prefer to carry a small piece of paper known as [[Cheque]] rather than carrying the currency worth the value of the [[Cheque]].  Before 1988 there being no provision to restrain the person issuing the [[Cheque]] without having sufficient funds in his account. Of course on [[Dishonoured cheque]] there is a civil liability accrued.  In order to ensure promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the Negotiable Instrument a criminal remedy of penalty was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by amending it with Negotiable Instruments Act, 1988.&lt;ref name=goiact/&gt;

With the insertion of these provisions in the Act the situation certainly improved and the instances of dishonour have relatively come down but on account of application of different interpretative techniques by different High Courts on different provisions of the Act it further compounded and complicated the situation although on dishonour of cheques the trends of the verdicts of the [[Supreme Court of India]]

Parliament enacted the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 (55 of 2002), which is intended to plug the loopholes. This amendment Act inserts five new sections from 143 to 147 touching various limbs of the parent Act and [[Cheque truncation]] through digitally were also included and the amendment Act has been recently brought into force on Feb. 6, 2003.&lt;ref name=goiact/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16426">{{Taxation| expanded=International}}
A '''permanent establishment''' ('''PE''') is a fixed place of business which generally gives rise to [[income tax|income]] or [[value-added tax]] liability in a particular jurisdiction. The term is defined in many income [[tax treaties]] and in most [[European Union Value Added Tax]] systems. The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;
For example, Germany taxes non-German companies only on income from a PE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions.

== History ==
The concept of permanent establishment emerged in the German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511977855.005|title = History of tax treaties and the permanent establishment concept|last = Kobetsky|first = Michael|pages = 106–151|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977855.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities and this was extended to the entire German federation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of permanent establishment, was concluded between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Prussia]], marking the first time the concept was used in international tax law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the [[League of Nations]] developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaty was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where this concept persisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
In the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention, essentially three types of PEs can be construed:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* A '''fixed place of business''' permanent establishment (article 5(1));
* A '''construction or project''' permanent establishment, which is a special subset of the fixed place of business permanent establishment, with different requirements (article 5(3)); and
* An '''agency''' permanent establishment, through the actions of a dependent agent (article 5(5-6)).
The [[United Nations|UN]] Model Tax Convention, which gives greater consideration to developing countries, adds what is known by '''service''' permanent establishment in article 5(3)b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/UN_Model_2011_Update.pdf|title = UN Model Tax Convention (2011)|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been trying to extend the concept of service PE into a '''virtual service''' PE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Tax/International-Tax/Alert--Saudi-Arabian-tax-authorities-introduce-Virtual-Service-PE-concept|title = Saudi Arabian tax authorities introduce Virtual Service PE concept|website = www.ey.com|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] project being developed by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and endorsed by the [[G-20 major economies|G20]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-about.htm|title = About Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new nexus based on '''significant digital presence''' is being considered under Action 1, aimed at ''Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241046-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241046-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed place of business==
The starting point for determination if a permanent establishment exists is generally a fixed place of business. The definition of permanent establishment in article 5 of the [[OECD]] Model Income Tax Treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Article 5 and Commentary|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is followed in most income tax treaties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf U.S./UK treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527220749/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }} Article 5, which is virtually identical to the OECD Model Article 5.  The [http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 Nigeria/South Africa treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124238/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 |date=2011-06-29 }} Article 5, is nearly identical to the OECD Model Article 5, with the addition of a provision clarifying that a fixed place of business used as a sales outlet is a PE, notwithstanding exclusions elsewhere in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary indicates that a fixed place of business has three components:
*'''Fixed''' refers to a link between the place of business and a specific geographic point, as well as a degree of permanence with respect to the taxpayer.  An ''"office hotel"'' may constitute a fixed place for a business for an enterprise that regularly uses different offices within the space.  By contrast, where there is no commercial coherence, the fact that activities may be conducted within a limited geographic area should not result in that area being considered a fixed place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 5-6 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''place''' of business.  This refers to some facilities used by an enterprise for carrying out its business.  The premises must be at the disposal of the enterprise.  The mere presence of the enterprise at that place does not necessarily mean that it is a place of business of the enterprise.  The facilities need not be the exclusive location, and they need not be used exclusively by that enterprise or for that business.  However, the facilities must be those of the taxpayer, not another unrelated person.  Thus, regular use of a customer's premises does not generally constitute a place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 4 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Business''' of the enterprise must be carried on wholly or partly at the fixed place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 7 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of what constitutes a ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'permanent establishment''' within the scope of a particular treaty depend on what interpretation a particular country places on that term, in context of the text of that treaty. As per Article 3 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], no one is entitled to claim rights under a particular treaty unless otherwise authorised by the contracting state. Therefore, if a particular contracting state places a different meaning on the term 'permanent establishment' than what the taxpayer seeks to place, the taxpayer would be left with virtually no remedy within that state, other than  to seek a mutual agreement to that dispute with the other contracting state to that treaty.

==Indicative list of permanent establishments==
The OECD Model Tax Convention includes a short indicative list of ''prima facie'' permanent establishments. These, however, are not automatically permanent establishments as the requirements set out, namely, for fixed place of business permanent establishment must be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 12 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en|quote=This paragraph contains a list, by no means exhaustive, of examples, each of which can be regarded, prima facie, as constituting a permanent establishment. As these examples are to be seen against the background of the general definition given in paragraph 1, it is assumed that the Contracting States interpret the terms listed, “a place of management”, “a branch”, “an office”, etc. in such a way that such places of business constitute permanent establishments only if they meet the requirements of paragraph 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is as follows:
* A [[branch (business)|branch]]
* A [[warehouse]] (but see excluded places below)
* A [[factory]]
* A [[mining|mine]] or place of extraction of natural resources
* A place of [[management]]

==Specifically excluded places==
Many treaties explicitly exclude from the definition of PE places where certain activities are conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title = Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last = OECD|at = Article 4 and Commentary thereon|doi = 10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these exclusions do not apply if non-excluded activities are conducted at the fixed place of business. Among the excluded activities are:
*Ancillary or preparatory activities
*The use of a storage facility solely for delivery of goods to customers
*The maintenance of a stock of goods owned by the enterprise solely for purposes of processing by another enterprise (sometimes referred to as toll processing)
*Purchasing or information gathering activities

==Other specific provisions==

=== Construction or Project PE ===
Many treaties provide specific rules with respect to construction sites.  Under those treaties, a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than a specified length of time. The amount of time varies by treaty.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/Belgium_-eng.asp Canada/Belgium treaty] sets this limit as 12 months, as does the OECD Model.  By contrast, the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf US/India treaty] treats such a site, project or activities continuing for more than 120 days in any twelve-month period as a PE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agency PE ===
In addition, the activities of a dependent agent&lt;ref&gt;See [[Agency (law)]] for a discussion of the essential characteristics of agent and principal.&lt;/ref&gt; may give rise to a PE for the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 5 of Article 5 and Commentary 31 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent agents may include employees or others under the control of the principal.  A company is generally not considered an agent solely by reason of ownership of the agent company by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 7 of Article 5 and Commentary 40-41 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, activities of an independent agent generally are not attributed to the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 6 to Article 5 and Commentary 36-39|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service PE ===
Some treaties deem a PE to exist for an enterprise of one country performing services in the other country for more than a specified length of time&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan002084.pdf United Nations Model Tax Convention] Article 5 paragraph 3(b).&lt;/ref&gt; or for a related enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the US/India treaty, ''supra''., Article 5 paragraph 2(l).&lt;/ref&gt;

== BEPS Action 7 and 15 ==
In October 2015, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] released the final reports on the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project. Action 7 was targeted at ''Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status'' and proposes a large number of changes that are set to be included in the next version of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD expects many of these changes to be applied to currently existing tax treaties through the work based on Action 15 on ''Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241688-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties, Action 15 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241688-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of countries are involved in the negotiations that are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-for-beps-tax-treaty-measures-the-ad-hoc-group.htm|title = Multilateral instrument for BEPS tax treaty measures: the Ad hoc Group - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report on Action 7 proposes substantial changes to the definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/preventing-the-artificial-avoidance-of-permanent-establishment-status-action-7-2015-final-report-9789264241220-en.htm|title = Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status, Action 7 - 2015 Final Report - en - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be considered to have a taxable presence in that country unless the intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent business. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions to the definition of permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory or auxiliary nature and will ensure that it is not possible to take advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating business into several small operations; they will also address situations where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Piero Dusio''' (13 October 1899 – 7 November 1975) was an Italian soccer player, businessman and racing driver.&lt;ref name="museo"&gt;Donatella Biffignandi, ''[http://www.museoauto.it/website/images/stories/articoli/biografie/dusio_piero.pdf Piero Dusio]'' from museoauto.it, an online museum for automotive issues, last accessed on November 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dusio was born at [[Scurzolengo]], [[province of Asti]]. His active soccer career (three games for [[Juventus]] 1921–22)&lt;ref&gt;[http://juworld.net/giocatori-scheda.asp?idgiocatore=142&amp;ty=tabvps Piero Dusio] soccer statistics at juworld.net, last accessed November 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; ended in a knee injury, after which he started a textile business (oil cloth), which evolved into sporting goods as well as becoming supplier of military uniforms.  He led the ''Juventus Organizzazione Sportiva Anonima'' (O.S.A.) 1941 to 1943, which became part of the [[Cisitalia]] firm in 1944, and even was president of [[Juventus]] from 1942 to 1948.

[[Image:Coppa asti spumante 1947.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cisitalia]] D46 was named after Piero Dusio (the ''Dusio 46''). The racecar driver is [[Ilario Bandini]].]]

He raced in the [[Mille Miglia]] (1929–38), was sixth in [[1936 Italian Grand Prix]], winning a class victory (50th overall) in [[Mille Miglia]] in a [[Siata]] 500cc (1937), and formed the Scuderia Torino (1939).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicracing.com/ historicracing.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sporting-to.com/eng/storia.lasso sporting-to.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509125628/http://www.sporting-to.com/eng/storia.lasso |date=May 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He commissioned [[Dante Giacosa]] of [[Fiat]] to develop a racing car (1944), and formed the "Consorzio Industriale Sportiva Italia" (1944). The firm became [[Cisitalia]] and involved [[Carlo Abarth]], [[Rudolf Hruska]] and [[Ferry Porsche]].  Three D46's topped the local ''Coppa Brezzi'' (held with the [[1946 Turin Grand Prix]]), Dusio taking 1st.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formula2.net/V46_8.htm |title=Coppa Brezzi 1946 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusio continued financing racing car projects, but the expenses in engineering the complex [[Cisitalia#Cisitalia 202 MM|202MM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0210ec_piero_dusio_cisitalia/ Piero Dusio &amp; the Cisitalia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110142406/http://www.europeancarweb.com/features/0210ec_piero_dusio_cisitalia/ |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost ruined Cisitalia (1947), as well as involved the Juventus corporation. Consequently, Dusio moved to [[Argentina]] and established [[Autoar]] (Automotores Argentinos) S.A.I.C. (22 March 1949),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auto-historia.com.ar/Historias/Autoar%20Historia.htm Autoar Historia]&lt;/ref&gt; financially supported by [[Juan Peron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forix.com/8w/rear-engines-postwar.html forix.com]&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Carlo Dusio]] continued to run a refinanced [[Cisitalia]] company in [[Torino]] (1948–1964).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vea.qc.ca/vea/marques1/cisitalia.htm Cisitalia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dusio tried but failed to qualify for one [[Formula One]] World Championship Grand Prix ([[1952 Italian Grand Prix|Italy 1952]]) with a [[Cisitalia]] D46, but he failed to set a time in practice due to engine problems. He raced in the [[Buenos Aires Grand Prix (motor racing)|Buenos Aires Grand Prix]] in 1954, and also started Cisitalia Argentina Industrial y Comercial SA, planning cars such as the [[Cisitalia 750]] (1960).

He died at [[Buenos Aires]] in 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">'''R&amp;D management''' is the discipline of designing and leading [[R&amp;D]] processes, managing R&amp;D organizations, and ensuring smooth transfer of new know-how and technology to other groups or departments involved in [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiesa, V. (2001). R&amp;D Strategy and Organisation, Imperial College Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Managing Global Innovation |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-66832-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
R&amp;D management can be defined as where the tasks of [[innovation management]] (i.e., creating and commercializing inventions) meet the tasks of [[technology management]] (i.e., external and internal creation and retention of technological know-how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brockhoff, Klaus -link = Klaus Brockhoff |title=Forschung und Entwicklung |publisher=Oldenbourg |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers activities such as basic [[research]], fundamental research, technology development, advanced development, concept development, new product development, process development, [[prototyping]], R&amp;D portfolio management, technology transfer, etc., but generally is not considered to include technology licensing, innovation management, IP management, corporate venturing, incubation, etc. as those are sufficiently independent activities that can be carried out without the presence of a R&amp;D function in a firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Specht, G. |author2=Beckmann, Ch. |title=F&amp;E-Management |publisher=Schaeffer-Poeschel |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management models==
Few dedicated management models for R&amp;D exist. Among the more popularized ones are [[Arthur D. Little]]'s '''Third generation R&amp;D management''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roussel|title=Third generation R&amp;D |publisher=HBS Press |year=1991|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Development funnel''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Wheelwright, S. |author2=Clark, K. |title=Revolutionizing Product Development |publisher=Free Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Phase–gate model]] All these models are concerned with improving R&amp;D performance and result productivity, managing R&amp;D as a process, and providing the R&amp;D function with an environment in which the inherent technological and market uncertainties can be managed.

'''The Path to Developing Successful New Products'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mike Gordon |author2=Chris Musso |author3=Eric Rebentisch |author4=Nisheeth Gupta |title= The Path to Developing Successful New Products |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review Press |date=Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint research by MIT &amp; McKinsey &amp; Co. points out three key practices that can play critical role in R&amp;D Management: Talk to the customer, Nurture a project culture, Keep it focused.

The Honourable '''William Ralph Talbot Chetwynd'''&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p21607.htm#i216062 |title=William Ralph Talbot Chetwynd |publisher= The Peerage |accessdate=15 November 2010}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (28 July 1890 – 3 April 1957) was a [[British people|British]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[businessman]] and [[politician]]. The town of [[Chetwynd, British Columbia]] was named in his honor.

Born in [[Staffordshire]], [[England]], he was the younger brother of Sir [[Chetwynd baronets|(Arthur Henry) Talbot Chetwynd, 7th Baronet]]. He came to Canada at the age of eighteen, and was soon in [[Ashcroft, British Columbia]] (west of [[Kamloops Lake]]). He received employment from [[Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey]] (nephew of Lady Florence Cecilia Paget, who was married to Chetwynd's first cousin once removed Sir George, 4th Baronet) to manage Anglesey’s fruit farm holdings at [[Walhachin, British Columbia|Walhachin]].

On 8 October 1912, he married Frances Mary Jupe, daughter of James Jupe of [[Mere, Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC/&gt;

He fought in [[World War I]] as a member of the [[Royal Field Artillery]], attaining the rank of lieutenant therein. He received the [[Military Cross]] in 1918 for his service.&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC/&gt;

After returning from [[Europe]], he entered [[cattle]] [[ranching]] and the [[transportation]] business needed to get the cattle and other [[agriculture]] products to eastern markets. As a fruit grower and rancher, he saw both the potential for the Cariboo and Peace River Country, but also the need for efficient rail transportation to serve the region.

In 1942 he became the public relations officer for [[Pacific Great Eastern Railway]] (PGE; later BC Rail; now part of the [[CN Rail]] system), a post he held until 1952; he also served as a director of the PGE. He was a big advocate for building a railroad to central British Columbia. Running as a member from the [[Cariboo (electoral district)|District of Cariboo]], he was elected to provincial legislature in 1952.&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC/&gt; He served on the [[Executive Council of British Columbia]] as Minister of Trade and Industry, Railways and Fisheries from 1952&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC/&gt; to 1956, and also as Minister of Agriculture.&lt;ref name=thePeerageWRTC/&gt; At the age of 66, ill health forced him to retire from politics.

Full of confidence, he once bet executives at PGE, and politicians (a new [[Stetson]] [[hat]]), that the new extension line for [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]] would leave North Vancouver on 11 June 1956 at 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. He had many takers, totaling more than $800 in hats. He won the bet, and got his picture in the newspaper wearing a stack of hats.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010|reason=originally cited link, http://chetwynd2.iwebez.com/Files/1049581423916200394720AMEDCProfileupdate2.pdf, is dead}}

Chetwynd died at [[Victoria, British Columbia]] on 3 April 1957.

Rail service arrived in Little Prairie in April 1958. It would bring an economic transformation to the area, which until then had to rely on trucks to get any goods, such as timber, out of the valley.

The [[Premier (Canada)|Premier of British Columbia]], [[W.A.C. Bennett]], renamed the PGE [[train station|station]] at Little Prairie to Chetwynd, in his honor, and the town of Little Prairie soon changed its name in 1959.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010|reason=originally cited link, http://srmwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=37727, is dead}}

The '''Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce''' is a bilateral trade and investment organization that promotes commerce and investment between [[Romania]] and [[United States]], and is headquartered in [[Washington D.C.]] The Chamber is composed of both Romanian and American businesses and has active chapters in New York, Washington, D.C., Florida, California and the Mid-West. It was founded in February 1990 and is celebrating its 20th year of activity in 2010. The RACC conducts a broad range of events, activities, and services and is a member organization of the Bi-National European Chambers of Commerce of the United States, which includes most of the bilateral chambers of the major EU member states.

==History==

Shortly after the Romanian revolution of December 1989, a group of American business leaders and professionals led by [[Mark A. Meyer]] met to discuss the formation of a bilateral trade association dedicated to the development of prosperous business relationships between Romania and the United States. Initial members included representatives of major US firms, such as [[IBM]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]], [[Chemical Bank]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[ConAgra]] and [[General Electric]], as well as smaller import export companies. In February 1990 they organized the Romanian-American Chamber of Commerce (RACC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racc.ro/Default.aspx RACC History - Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ambassadorial Advisory Board of the Romanian American Chamber of Commerce™ was formed in 2013 and is composed of the living former U.S. Ambassadors to Romania and the former Romanian Ambassadors to the United States and United Nations.  It is chaired by former U.S. Ambassador, Senator James C. Rosapepe, and its members include former U.S. Ambassadors to Romania John R. Davis, Alfred Moses, Michael Guest and Mark Gitenstein, and former Romanian Ambassadors [[Mircea Geoană]], [[Sorin Ducaru]], Ion Gorita, Alexandru Niculescu and Mihnea Motoc.  Among its functions, the Ambassadorial Advisory Board holds webinars for the public to discuss current issues in U.S.-Romanian relations and each year, the RACC holds an annual dinner in the Advisory Board’s honor at which the Armand Scala Prize is awarded.

In 2004, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Central America (FEMAMCO) awarded Kafie the ''Orden FEMAMCO'' for promoting and strengthening Central American integration, as operator of Lacthosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fecamco.com/?page_id=1777 Orden FECAMCO 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Through these companies, the wealth and influence of the Kafie family substantially increased, to the point that a 2006 study by the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] named Kafie one of "the most powerful men in Honduras", citing Kafie's role with respect to Lufussa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/12/honduras-governed-by-vested-interests/|title=HONDURAS: Governed by Vested Interests|first=Thelma|last=Mejía|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; Kafie has also been noted by a number of studies to be influential in a variety of other product categories, particularly including the [[dairy]] and [[fruit juice]] products sold by Lacthosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoculturalhispano.com/spip.php?article5500|title=Las "10 Familias", O El Reparto De Las Riquezas En Honduras|publisher=Mundo Cultural Hispano|access-date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poderos"&gt;Centro de Documentación de Honduras, ''Honduras: poderes fácticos y sistema político'' (''Honduras: Powers and the Political System'') (2008), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2006, Kafie, along with his brothers Luis and Eduardo, established the Fundación Chito y Nena Kafie (Chito and Nena Kafie Foundation), a family [[charitable organization]],&lt;ref&gt;https://fundacionchitoynenakafie.org/&lt;/ref&gt; named for their parents (using their familiar names).&lt;ref name="La Cajita Nena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2017/06/01/la-cajita-nena-ayuda-al-hospital-san-felipe/|title="La Cajita Nena" en ayuda al Hospital San Felipe|publisher=''[[La Tribuna]]''|date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity has engaged in a variety of projects aimed at improving the lives of Hondurans. In June 2017, for example the Foundation entered into a collaboration with the [[San Felipe General Hospital]] called  "La Cajita de Nena" to donate natal care boxes providing supplies for mothers who give birth there.&lt;ref name="La Cajita Nena"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kafie married Marlene Nasser, a sister of [[Fredy Nasser]] in 1982. They have four daughters Stephanie, Elena, Vivian, and Marianne, all four of whom work for Lacthosa.&lt;ref name="SKC"/&gt; Kafie's daughter Elena is Marketing and Sales Director for Lacthosa,&lt;ref name="Sula Joins"/&gt; and daughter Marianne is also a Lacthosa executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.hn/lacthosa-recibe-por-septimo-fundahrse/|title=LACTHOSA recibe por séptimo año consecutivo el sello FUNDAHRSE|first=Luis|last=Destephen|publisher=''[[El Tiempo (Honduras)|El Tiempo]]''|date=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sense and respond''' has been used in [[control theory]] for several decades, primarily in [[closed system]]s such as refineries where comparisons are made between measurements and desired values, and system settings are adjusted to narrow the gap between the two. Since  the early 1980s, sense and respond has also been used to describe the behavior of certain open systems. 

Sense and respond is based on [[Lean manufacturing|lean principles]] and follows URSLIMM:
*U - understand customer value
*R - remove waste
*S - standardize
*L - learn by doing
*I - involve everyone
*M - measure what matters
*M - manage performance visually

The term "sense and respond" as a business concept was used in a 1992 [[American Management Association]] ''Management Review'' article by [[Stephan H. Haeckel]].  It was Developed by Haeckel at [[IBM]]’s Advanced Business Institute.

{{About|the documentary film|other uses|Sugar Babies (disambiguation){{!}}Sugar Babies}}

'''''The Sugar Babies''''' is a 2007 feature-length [[documentary film]] about exploitation in the sugar plantations of the [[Dominican Republic]]. The film, narrated by [[Edwidge Danticat]], explores how the descendants of African slaves, brought over from Haiti, live and work in unfair conditions akin to "modern day slavery."

==Production==
''The Sugar Babies'' was shot on location in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[England]], and the [[United States]]. The 99-minute film is originally in Spanish, French and Creole and sub-titled in English, and produced by the Hope, Courage and Justice Project of New Orleans, the Human Rights Foundation of New York, and the former Siren Studios of Miami.

The film was written, shot, produced, and directed by [[Amy Serrano]]. Its executive producer is Claudia Chiesi, its producer is [[Thor Halvorssen Mendoza|Thor Halvorssen]], Constance Haqq is co-producer and Salvador Longoria and Tico Pujals are associate producers. The film was edited by Jason Ocasio and scored by [[Bill Cruz]].

==Controversy==
The film officially premiered at the Montreal International Haitian Film Festival, but preview screenings in [[Paris]] and [[Miami]] led to heated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2007/06/29/c1a_SUGAR_CANE_0629.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/416/v-print/story/153614.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Miami screening of the film, which included many members of the [[Hispanic]] media of [[South Florida]] and from the Dominican Republic, was the subject of a cease and desist order one hour before the time of screening, as well as a bribery scandal when several radio producers came forward to state that Dominican diplomats had offered them bribes to disrupt the screening and give the film a bad review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dominicanoshoy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12617&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt;
The Paris screening of the film was also the subject of a [[sabotage]] attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=38029 IPS Inter Press Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710222406/http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=38029 |date=2007-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was an "Official Selection" at [[Unifem]]'s [[Through Women's Eyes Film Festival]], the [[New Orleans International Human Rights Film Festival]], and the [[Buffalo Niagara Film Festival]]. It was also an "Official Selection" at both the [[Miami International Film Festival]] and the [[Women's International Film Festival]], but was withdrawn from both South Florida festivals, ostensibly due to pressure from the sugar industry.

''The Sugar Babies'' won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the [[Delray Beach Film Festival]], was screened in film festivals and educational venues, and  toured with [[Amnesty International]] in France.{{when|date=November 2018}}

'''Things''' is a task management app for [[macOS]], [[iOS]], and [[watchOS]] made by Cultured Code, a software startup based in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. It first released for [[Macintosh|Mac]] as an alpha that went out in late 2007 to 12,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanc|first1=Shawn|title=A Review of Two Things: One For the Mac and One For iPhone|url=http://shawnblanc.net/2009/01/a-review-of-two-things/|website=Shawn Blanc|publisher=Shawn Blanc|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly gained popularity. The following July, when the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] launched, it was among the first 552 apps available for [[iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrington|first1=Michael|title=iPhone App Store Has Launched|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/10/app-store-launches-upgrade-itunes-now/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then released alongside the [[iPad]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viticci|first1=Federico|title=Things for iPad, Reviewed|url=https://www.macstories.net/ipad/things-review/|publisher=MacStories|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the first apps available for [[Apple Watch]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple begins releasing the first set of third-party Apple Watch apps|url=http://9to5mac.com/2015/03/26/apple-watch-apps-3/|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Cultured Code announced that they had sold one million copies of the software to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultured Code Sells 1 Million Copies of Things|url=http://www.iclarified.com/36958/cultured-code-sells-1-million-copies-of-things-announces-upcoming-things-3-app|publisher=iClarified|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2014 the company announced that downloads had increased by an additional three million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Free App of the Week' Brings Things 3 Million Downloads|url=https://www.iphoneblog.de/2014/12/02/free-app-of-the-week-beschert-things-drei-millionen-downloads/|publisher=iPhoneBlog|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

Things has won multiple awards over the years. It first won the [[MacLife]] Editors' Choice Award in 2008, and then in 2009 it went on to win the [[Apple Design Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Design Awards ceremony celebrates great iPhone, Mac apps|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1141078/apple_design_awards.html|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Macworld]] Editors' Choice Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25th annual Editors' Choice Awards: the complete list|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1144949/editorschoice2009.html?page=2|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Macworld Best of Show Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macworld Best of Show 2009 awards|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2009/01/macworld-ars-macworld-best-of-show-2009-awards/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after the release of Things 2, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] selected it as Editors' Choice, named it among the App Store Best of 2012, and inducted it into the App Store Hall of Fame. Things won the Apple Design Award again with the release of Things 3 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Design Awards - Apple Developer|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/|publisher=Apple|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

=== Main features ===

Things allows to-dos to be subdivided into several sections, which roughly correspond to parts of the [[Getting Things Done]] methodology:

==== Collect ====

*'''Inbox''' is used to temporarily collect to-dos which have not been filed into a specific list yet.

==== Organize ====

*'''Projects''' are collections of to-dos that contribute to the completion of a larger goal (e.g., "Plan Holiday"). A project can be subdivided with headings. Once the project is finished, the user marks it complete and it moves to the Logbook with all the to-dos it contains.
*'''Areas''' can be used to group together projects and to-dos which correspond to the same, ongoing theme (e.g., "Work" or "Family"). Unlike projects, areas are perpetual, do not have a checkbox, and are never completed.

==== Schedule ====

*'''Today''' automatically collects to-dos which are due, or scheduled to begin, from all the user's lists into one centralized place; they are the user's priorities for the current day.
**'''This Evening''' is a separate section at the bottom of Today where the user can set aside to-dos they don't plan to do until later in the evening.
*'''Upcoming''' contains to-dos and projects that have been postponed to a specific date, as well as to-dos that are automatically generated based on repeating patterns chosen by the user.
*'''Anytime''' is an overview of active to-dos from across all of the user's projects and areas (i.e., to-dos not scheduled for a later date, or postponed in Someday).
*'''Someday''' is used to store to-dos which need to be done, but are not time critical (or are on hold).

=== Additional features ===

*'''Calendar''' integration allows the user to see their calendar events alongside their to-dos in the Today and Upcoming lists.
*'''Reminders''' integration allows the user to import to-dos from Apple's Reminders app into their Things inbox.
*'''Quick Entry''' is an extension on the Mac that allows the user to create to-dos while working in other apps. Activated by a global [[keyboard shortcut]], it invokes a small pop-up window which can automatically include links to files or websites.
*'''Add to Things''' is an extension on iPhone and iPad that, like Quick Entry, allows the user to send to-dos to Things from other apps. The new to-do is saved to Things' inbox in the background.
*'''Siri''' integration allows the user to speak to-dos to their iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch and have them automatically appear in Things without having to type.
*'''Siri Shortcuts''' integration on iOS allows the user to automate common tasks by tapping Siri suggestions, recording a spoken phrase, or by adding shortcuts to Apple's Shortcuts app.
*'''Repeating To-Dos''' are automatically generated by the app based on flexible recurrence rules, such as the last day of every month, every other Thursday, or two weeks after the last one was completed, etc. – whatever the user chooses.
*'''Tags''' allow the user to further describe to-dos using the popular [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]] organisation paradigm; lists can then be filtered by these tags to search for and focus on specific types of tasks.
*'''Mail to Things''' is a cloud service that allows the user to send (or forward) emails to a private address and have the email automatically converted into a to-do in their Things inbox.
*'''Today Widget''' allows the user to quickly access their Today list from the Notification Center on Mac, iPad, or iPhone.
*'''Things URLs''' is a URL scheme that allows the user to construct special links for doing such things as creating to-dos or projects based on predefined values, invoking searches, or filtering lists.
*'''Type Travel''' is a unique method for navigating the app on the user's Mac (or iPad with external keyboard) by simply typing where in the app they want to go: a project, area, to-do, or tag.
*'''Quick Find''' allows the user to search through all their to-dos across projects, areas, and the Logbook.
*'''Logbook''' is where projects and to-dos are stored for future reference after they've been completed.

=== Things Cloud ===
Things Cloud is a sync service that stores the user's to-dos and automatically keeps them updated across all their [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] devices. It was developed to replace the app's original sync technology, which only worked over a local network. The company began alpha testing the new service in 2011 and, after an extended beta period, launched it publicly on August 9, 2012 with the release of Things 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanc|first1=Shawn|title=Things and Cloud Sync|url=https://shawnblanc.net/2012/08/things-and-cloud-sync/|publisher=Shawn Blanc|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user can create a free Things Cloud account from within the apps' settings.

In 2015, the company announced "Nimbus"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Zac|title=Productivity app Things adds push sync feature to keep task lists auto updated across devices|url=https://9to5mac.com/2015/08/19/things-cloud-push-sync/|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an update to Things Cloud's architecture which introduced push sync through the cloud. The main benefit of the new push technology is that it delivers sync to iOS devices when the app isn't actively running, by utilizing [[Apple Push Notification Service|APNs]].

== Latest releases ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7110">A '''travel survey''' (or '''travel diary''' or '''travel behavior inventory''') is a survey of individual [[travel behavior]].  Most surveys collect information about an individual (socio-economic, demographic, etc.), their household (size, structure, relationships), and a diary of their journeys on a given day (their start and end location, start and end time, mode of travel, accompaniment and purpose of travel).

Major travel surveys are conducted in metropolitan areas typically once a decade. Some regions, notably metropolitan [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] conduct a panel survey, which interviews the same people year after year, to see how their particular behavior evolves over time.

==Recent or continuous city-wide travel surveys==
[[Auckland]], New Zealand - A travel survey was conducted in 2006 and involved 6,000 households in the greater Auckland region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuti.com.au/AHTS06.html Auckland Travel Survey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106043049/http://www.tuti.com.au/AHTS06.html |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brisbane]], Australia - The South East Queensland Travel Survey collects travel data in the Greater Brisbane region and the neighbouring areas of [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]. The continuous survey commenced in 2003 and surveys around 6,000 households every two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Projects_and_initiatives/Projects/South_east_queensland_travel_survey/ Queensland Transport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927153110/http://www.transport.qld.gov.au/Home/Projects_and_initiatives/Projects/South_east_queensland_travel_survey/ |date=2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hobart]], Australia - The Greater Hobart Household Travel Survey collects information from 200 households each month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/publications/greater_hobart_household_travel_survey Tasmanian Dept of Transport] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918214407/http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/publications/greater_hobart_household_travel_survey |date=2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a repeat survey using essentially the same instrument as conducted in 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and most recently 2006 where 149,631 households comprise the final database.  The survey was conducted using telephone interviews with an advance letter sent to households to solicit their participation.

==Recent or continuous country-wide travel surveys==
[[Denmark]]'s most recent National Travel was initiated in 2006 and has been going on continuously since then. The interviews are conducted using the internet and telephone interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modelcenter.transport.dtu.dk/english/tu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] is conducting its National Travel Survey since 1994 on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobilitaetspanel.ifv.uni-karlsruhe.de/en The German Mobility Panel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911153315/http://mobilitaetspanel.ifv.uni-karlsruhe.de/en |date=2009-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each household member fills in a travel diary in which he records each trip made during the course of one week. Despite this yearly survey there is another non regular scheduled survey which is conducted again in 2008. 25,000 households are expected to participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelsurveymethods.org/pdfs/newsletter09_08.pdf travelsurveymethods.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920082123/http://www.travelsurveymethods.org/pdfs/newsletter09_08.pdf |date=2009-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
