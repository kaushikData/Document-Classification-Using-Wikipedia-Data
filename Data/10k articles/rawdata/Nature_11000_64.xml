The '''Aleutian Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|lj|uː|ʃ|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aleutian Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Aleutian%20Islands|website=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|{{Dictionary.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|Aleutian}}}} {{Lang-ru|Алеутские острова|italic=yes}}; {{lang-ale|Tanam Unangaa}}, literally "Land of the [[Aleut]]s", possibly from [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] ''aliat'', "island") are a chain of 14 large volcanic islands and 55 smaller ones belonging to both the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]] and the Russian [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Kamchatka Krai]].&lt;ref name="EBonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aleutian-Islands|title=Aleutian Islands|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|author=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form part of the [[Aleutian Arc]] in the Northern [[Pacific Ocean]], occupying an area of 6,821 sq mi (17,666&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and extending about {{convert|1200|mi|-2|abbr=on}} westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in Russia, and mark a dividing line between the [[Bering Sea]] to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. Crossing [[180th meridian|longitude 180°]], at which point east and west [[longitude]] end, the archipelago contains both the westernmost part of the United States by longitude ([[Amatignak Island]]) and the easternmost by longitude ([[Semisopochnoi Island]]). The westernmost U.S. island in real terms, however, is [[Attu Island]], west of which runs the [[International Date Line]]. While nearly all the [[archipelago]] is part of Alaska and is usually considered as being in the "[[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaskan Bush]]", at the extreme western end, the small, geologically related [[Commander Islands]] belong to Russia.

The islands, with their 57 volcanoes, form the northernmost part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Physiographically, they are a distinct section of the larger Pacific Border province, which in turn is part of the larger [[Geography of the United States Pacific Mountain System|Pacific Mountain System]] physiographic division.

These Islands are most known for the battles and skirmishes that occurred there during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. It was one of only two attacks on the United States during that war.

==Geology==
Motion between the [[Kula Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]] along the margin of the Bering Shelf (in the Bering Sea north of the Aleutian arc) ended in the early Eocene.  The Aleutian Basin, the ocean floor north of the Aleutian arc, is the remainder of the Kula Plate that got trapped when volcanism and subduction jumped south to its current location at {{Circa}} 56&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The Aleutian [[island arc]], then, formed in the Early Eocene (55–50&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ma|million year ago}}) when the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[North American Plate]] began.  The arc is made of separate blocks that have been rotated clockwise.  The [[Basement (geology)|basement]] underlying the islands is made of three stratigraphic units: an Eocene layer of volcanic rock, an Oligocene—Miocene layer of marine sedimentary rock, and a Pliocene—Quaternary layer of sedimentary and igneous rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Geography==
[[File:UnalaskaAlaska.jpg|thumb|[[Unalaska Island]] in the Aleutian Islands.]]
[[File:The Aleutian Islands 01 Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The Aleutian Islands from 32,000 feet (9,700 m).]]
[[File:North-Pacific-air-routes.png|thumb|Active Aleutian volcanoes.]]

The islands, known before 1867 as the Catherine Archipelago, comprise five groups (east to west)
*the [[Fox Islands (Alaska)|Fox Islands]]
*[[Islands of Four Mountains]]
*[[Andreanof Islands]]
*[[Rat Islands]], and
*[[Near Islands]]

All five are located between 51° and 55° N latitude and 172° E and 163° W longitude.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. east of 172° E and west of 163° W longitude, straddling the [[antimeridian]]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest islands in the Aleutians are [[Attu Island|Attu]] (the farthest from the mainland), and [[Unalaska Island|Unalaska]], [[Umnak]], and [[Unimak Island|Unimak]] in the Fox Islands. The largest of those is Unimak Island, with an area of 1,571.41&amp;nbsp;mi² (4,069.9&amp;nbsp;km²), followed by Unalaska Island, the only other Aleutian Island with an area over 1,000 square miles (2,600&amp;nbsp;km²).

The axis of the archipelago near the mainland of Alaska has a southwest trend, but at Tanaga Island (about 178° W) its direction changes to the northwest. This change of direction corresponds to a curve in the line of [[volcano|volcanic]] fissures that have contributed their products to the building of the islands. Such curved chains are repeated about the Pacific Ocean in the [[Kuril Islands]], the [[Japan]]ese chain, and in the [[Philippines]]. All these island arcs are at the edge of the [[Pacific Plate]] and experience much [[seismology|seismic]] activity, but are still habitable; the Aleutians lie between the Pacific and North American [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The general elevation is greatest in the eastern islands and least in the western. The island chain is a western continuation of the [[Aleutian Range]] on the mainland.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aleutian Islands|volume=1|pages=543–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The great majority of the islands bear evident marks of volcanic origin, and there are numerous volcanic cones on the north side of the chain, some of them active; many of the islands, however, are not wholly volcanic, but contain  crystalline or sedimentary rocks, and also amber and beds of [[lignite]]. The coasts are rocky and surf-worn, and the approaches are exceedingly dangerous, the land rising immediately from the coasts to steep, bold mountains.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

These volcanic islands reach heights of {{convert|6200|ft|m}}. [[Makushin Volcano]] ({{convert|5691|ft|m}}) located on Unalaska Island, is not quite visible from within the town of [[Unalaska, Alaska|Unalaska]], though the steam rising from its cone is visible on a (rare) clear day. Residents of Unalaska need only to climb one of the smaller hills in the area, such as Pyramid Peak or Mt. Newhall, to get a good look at the snow-covered cone. The volcanic [[Bogoslof Island|Bogoslof]] and [[Fire Island (Aleutian Islands)|Fire Island]]s, which rose from the sea in 1796 and 1883 respectively, lie about {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} west of [[Unalaska Bay]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1906, a new volcanic cone rose between the islets of Bogoslof and Grewingk, near Unalaska, followed by another in 1907. These cones were nearly demolished by an explosive eruption on September 1, 1907.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Newly found information in 2017, the volcanic cone erupted sending ash and ice particles 30,000 feet (9000 m) in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/01/26/alaska-volcano-erupts-again-sending-up-another-ash-cloud.html|title=Alaska volcano erupts again, sending up another ash cloud|date=2017-01-26|newspaper=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of the islands is oceanic, with moderate and fairly uniform temperatures and heavy rainfall. Fogs are almost constant. Summer weather is much cooler than Southeast Alaska (around [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]), but the winter temperature of the islands and of the [[Alaska Panhandle]] is very nearly the same.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; According to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, the area southwest of {{Coord|53.5|-167.0|scale:10000000|format=dec|display=inline}} on [[Unalaska Island]] have a "Subpolar Oceanic Climate" (type "Cfc" as are [[Reykjavík]], [[Tórshavn]], and the [[Auckland Islands]]), characterized by the coldest month averaging above {{Convert|0|°C|°F}}, 1–3 months averaging above {{Convert|10|°C|°F}}, and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. To the northeast of that point, the climate becomes "Subarctic With Cool Summers And Year Around Rainfall" (type "Dfc" as are [[Murmansk]], [[St. Moritz]], and [[Labrador City]]), where it is similar but colder, with the coldest month averaging '''below''' {{Convert|0|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-united-states.php|title=Interactive United States Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter the islands become the center for a semi-permanent [[low-pressure area]] called the [[Aleutian Low]].&lt;ref name="RodinovBondOverland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodionov |first1=S.N. |last2=Bond |first2=N.A. |last3=Overland |first3=J.E. |title=The Aleutian Low, storm tracks, and winter climate variability in the Bering Sea |journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography |date=November 2007 |volume=54 |issue=23-26 |pages=2560–2577 |doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.08.002 |bibcode=2007DSRII..54.2560R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean annual temperature for Unalaska, the most populated island of the group, is about 38&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] (3&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]]), being about 30&amp;nbsp;°F (−1&amp;nbsp;°C) in January and about 52&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C) in August. The highest and lowest temperatures recorded on the islands are 78&amp;nbsp;°F (26&amp;nbsp;°C) and 5&amp;nbsp;°F (−15&amp;nbsp;°C) respectively. The average annual rainfall is about {{convert|80|in|mm|-2}}, and Unalaska, with about 250 rainy days per year, is said to be one of the rainiest places within the U.S.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Flora==
[[File:Cape Promontory Cape Lutkes, Alaska. Cape Lutkes is part of the Aleutian Islands.JPG|thumb|Cape Promontory, Cape Lutkes on [[Unimak Island]] in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska.]]
The growing season lasts approximately 135 days, from early in May until late in September, but agriculture is limited to the raising of few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted [[willow]]s, the vast majority of the chain is devoid of native trees.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; On some of the islands, such as [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amaknak Island|Amaknak]], there are a few [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees growing, remnants of the [[#Russian period|Russian period]]. While tall trees grow in many cold climates, Aleutian conifers&amp;nbsp;— some estimated to be two hundred years old&amp;nbsp;— rarely reach a height of even {{convert|10|ft|m|0}}, and many of them are still less than {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall. This is because the islands, much like the [[Falkland Islands|Falklands]] and other islands of similar [[latitude]]s, experience such strong winds that taller trees are vulnerable to snapping off.

Instead of trees, the islands are covered with a luxuriant, dense growth of herbage and shrubs, including [[crowberry]], [[bluejoint]], [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], and many flowering plants.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} There are areas of peat bog near the coasts. Endemic plants include the endangered [[Polystichum aleuticum|Aleutian shield fern]].

==Fauna==
The Aleutians are home to many large colonies of seabirds. [[Buldir Island (Alaska)|Buldir Island]] has 21 breeding seabird species, including the Bering Sea-endemic [[red-legged kittiwake]]. Large seabird colonies are also present at [[Kiska]], [[Gareloi Island|Gareloi]], [[Semisopochnoi Island|Semisopochnoi]], [[Bogoslof Island|Bogoslof]], and others. The islands are also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, including the [[common rosefinch]], [[Siberian rubythroat]], [[bluethroat]], [[lanceolated warbler]], and the first North American record of the [[intermediate egret]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mun.ca/serg/Buldir/buldirbirds.html buldirbirds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The habitats of the Aleutians are largely unspoiled, but wildlife is affected by competition from introduced species such as cattle, [[caribou]], and [[fox]]es. Nearly all of the Aleutians are protected as part of the [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Wilderness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Aleutian Islands|id=na1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations have identified [[sea otter]]s as a [[keystone species]] along the coasts of many of the Aleutian Islands. Their presence encourages the growth of [[kelp forests]], as the otters control [[sea urchin]] populations (as large populations of sea urchins can create [[urchin barrens]] by clearing away kelp stands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=James |date=2016 |title=Serendipity: An Ecologist's Quest to Understand Nature |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520285033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
On the less mountainous islands, the raising of [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[reindeer]] was once believed to be practicable.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} There are [[bison]] on islands near Sand Point. Sheep raising seems to have died off with the advent of synthetic fibers, which lowered the value of wool. During the 1980s, there were some [[llama]] being raised on Unalaska. The current economy is primarily based on [[Fishing industry|fishing]], and the presence of U.S. military. The only crop is [[potato]]. [[Chicken]]s are raised in barns under protection from the cold.

==Transportation==
In addition to a partial air service and a ferry service, the [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through many of the U.S. islands.

==Demographics==
The native people refer to themselves as Unangan, and are now generally known by most non-natives as the "[[Aleut people|Aleut]]". The [[Aleut language]] is one of the two main branches of the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] language family. This family is not known to be related to any others. The [[2000 United States Census|2000 U.S. Census]] recorded a population of 8,162 on the islands, of whom 4,283 were living in the main settlement of Unalaska.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Because of the location of the islands, stretching like a broken bridge from Asia to America, many anthropologists believe they were a route of the first human occupants of the Americas. The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Americas is much farther south; the early human sites in Alaska have probably been submerged by rising waters during the current [[interglacial]] period. People living in the Aleutian Islands developed fine skills in hunting, fishing, and basketry. Hunters made their weapons and watercraft. The baskets are noted for being finely woven with carefully shredded stalks of beach rye.

===Russian period===
Explorers, traders and missionaries arrived from Russia beginning in 1741.

In 1741 the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] government sent [[Vitus Bering]], a [[Denmark|Dane]] in the service of Russia, and [[Aleksei Chirikov]], a Russian, in the ships ''Saint Peter'' and ''Saint Paul'' on a voyage of discovery in the Northern Pacific. After the ships were separated by a storm; Chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the Aleutian group, and Bering discovered several of the western islands. Bering was shipwrecked and lost his life in the Komandorski Islands ([[Commander Islands]]); one of which now bears his name ([[Bering Island]]), along with the surrounding Bering Sea. The survivors of Bering's party reached the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship, and reported that the islands were rich in fur-bearing animals.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Siberian fur hunters flocked to the Commander Islands and gradually moved eastward across the Aleutian Islands to the mainland. In this manner, Russia gained a foothold on the northwestern coast of North America. The Aleutian Islands consequently belonged to Russia, until that country [[Alaska purchase|transferred]] all its possessions in North America to the U.S. in 1867.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

During the consolidation of the Russian-American Company there was sporadic conflict with the native population (frequently disastrous to the poorly armed and vastly outnumbered Russians). The colonies soon entered a relatively stable state based on cooperation, intermarriage, and official policies that provided social status, education, and professional training to children of mixed Aleut-Russian birth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_9.html THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2008 — Page 9&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Within a generation, the day-to-day administration of the Russian-American colonies was largely in the hands of native-born Alaskans. Reversing the usual trend in colonization where indigenous technologies are replaced, the Russians adopted the Aleut kayak, or [[baidarka]], sea otter hunting techniques, and the working of native copper deposits. The Russians instituted public education, preservation of the Aleut language through transliteration of religious and other texts into Aleut via an adaptation of the Cyrillic alphabet, vaccination of the native population against [[smallpox]], and science-based sea mammal conservation policies that were ahead of their time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

By 1760 the Russian merchant Andrian Tolstykh had made a detailed census in the vicinity of [[Adak Island|Adak]] and extended Russian citizenship to the Aleuts.

During his third and last voyage in 1778, Captain [[James Cook]] surveyed the eastern portion of the Aleutian archipelago, accurately determined the position of some of the more important islands, and corrected many errors of former navigators.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

====Orthodox Christian heritage====
Among the first [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries to arrive in the Aleutian Islands was a party of ten [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] monks and priests, who arrived in 1793. Within two years, a monk named Herman was the only survivor of that party. He settled on [[Spruce Island (Alaska)|Spruce Island]], near [[Kodiak Island]], and often defended the rights of the Aleuts against the Russian trading companies. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint [[Herman of Alaska]].

Another early Christian missionary of the Russian Orthodox Church was Father Veniaminov who arrived in [[Unalaska Island|Unalaska]] in 1824. He was named Bishop Innokentii in 1840 and moved to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. He is now known in the Orthodox Church as Saint [[Innocent of Alaska]].

The principal settlements were on Unalaska Island. The oldest was Iliuliuk (also called Unalaska), settled in 1760–1775, with a customs house and an Orthodox church.

===U.S. possession===
After the American [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia in 1867, further development took place. New buildings included a [[Methodism|Methodist]] mission and orphanage, and the headquarters for a considerable fleet of United States [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|revenue cutters]], which patrolled the [[seal hunting|sealing]] grounds of the [[Pribilof Islands]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The first public school in Unalaska opened in 1883.

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] extended American citizenship to all Native Americans (and this law has been held to include the indigenous peoples of Alaska) in 1924. A hospital was built in Unalaska in 1933 by the U.S. [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].

====World War II====
{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}

During [[World War II]], small parts of the Aleutian islands were occupied by [[Japan]]ese forces, when [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] were invaded in order to divert American forces away from the main Japanese attack at [[Midway Atoll]]. The U.S. Navy, having broken the [[Japanese naval codes]], knew that this was just a diversion,{{disputed inline|date=September 2017}} and it did not expend large amounts of effort in defending the islands. More than 90 Americans were taken to Japan as prisoners of war. Most of the civilian population (over 800) of the Aleutians and Pribilovians was detained by the United States in camps in the [[Alaska Panhandle]]. During the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], American forces invaded Japanese-held Attu and defeated the Japanese. American and Canadian troops later launched an invasion of [[Kiska]], but Japanese forces had already withdrawn, ending the campaign in the islands.

June 3, 2002 was celebrated as Dutch Harbor Remembrance Day. The governor of Alaska ordered state flags lowered to half-staff to honor the 78 soldiers who died during the two-day Japanese air attack in 1942. The [[Aleutian World War II National Historic Area]] Visitors Center opened that month.

===Recent developments===
The [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] became law in 1971. In 1977, the Ounalashka Corporation (from Unalaska) declared a [[dividend]]. This was the first village corporation to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders.

'''Alternative Energy Institute''' (also known as '''AEI''') was [[West Texas A&amp;M University]]'s alternative energy research branch. Formed in 1977, the program was nationally and internationally recognized, and along with research provides education and outreach around the U.S. and the globe.

==History==
[[Image:Panorama Czarnkow.jpg|thumb|The Alternative Energy Institute Regional Wind Test Center]]

'''AEI''' was founded at '''West Texas State University''' (now ''West Texas A&amp;M University'') in 1977 by
Dr. Vaughn Nelson, Dr. Earl Gilmore and Dr. Robert Barieau during the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Carr | first = David | title = Regional Wind Test Center - Our History | work = Windtestcenter.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = February 22, 2010 | url = http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313193942/http://www.windtestcenter.org/history/ | archivedate = March 13, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physics department at West Texas State was already experimenting with wind power and these three individuals took the initiative to found a department to concentrate upon the study of wind. The basic goals of the department were:
* To test wind turbine designs.
* Improve on current aerodynamic design.
* Teach public about the state of wind &amp; solar technology.

===First Decade: 1977 - 1987===
Initially, much of the organization's focus was on small wind turbine research and improving blade designs. At this time they installed test turbines and water pumping applications throughout Texas. These projects allowed AEI to develop and improve upon blade design theory and production. During this period the organization also provided consulting in Latin America, Jamaica, Hawaii, and Europe. There, AEI trained villages and groups in wind energy systems.

At this time AEI operated from three locations: one off-campus and two on-campus. At these locations they customized testing on blade designs, turbine generator units, and complete designs.

===Second Decade: 1987 - 1997===
[[Image:Solbuilding-15.jpg|thumb|AEI's Solar Energy Building]]

During this decade the organization focused on green building projects. The most notable of these was AEI's Solar Energy Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Solar Building 1993 Photo Gallery | work = Windenergy.org | publisher = Alternative Energy Institute | date = May 11, 2009 | url = http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611131747/http://www.windenergy.org/multimedia/?page_id=195&amp;album=5&amp;gallery=17 | archivedate = June 11, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finished in 1993, the building served as the main site for AEI's operations for seventeen years. The building covered all of the organization's energy usage, including an on-site 10&amp;nbsp;kW Bergey wind turbine installation, and 3&amp;nbsp;kW of photovoltaics.

Several electric vans were donated to the organization at this time, two of which were maintained for several years. These vans were used to collect data and complete local wind energy projects, as well as to give campus and test site tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LaFleur | first = Oral | contribution = Proceedings of the 2002 ASEE Gulf-Southwest Annual Conference | date = 2002 | title = Exploring Renewable Energy Education | editor = The University of Louisiana at Lafayette | volume = 4 | pages = 11 | publisher = American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1995, AEI began working with the [[Texas General Land Office]] to provide Texas Wind Data to the public. While the GLO data sites have since been decommissioned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mapping and Monitoring Sustainable Energy |date=September 20, 2010 |url=https://roadwaytocollege.com/go/page.pl/000000A/http/www.glo.state.tx.us/sustain/mapping.html |format=Cached |accessdate=December 7, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organization still collects, analyzes and publishes Texas Wind Data for the general public.

===Now: 1998 - Present===
AEI is currently focusing on developing a new degree plan at WTAMU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Ranaivo | first = Yann | title = New WT research head focused on turbines, degree program | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = September 16, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2010-09-16/new-wt-research-head-focused-turbines-degree-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as continuing its research on green energy systems. In terms of turbine testing, the organization focuses on small blade and turbine testing, particularly innovative horizontal and vertical axis designs.

In 2010, the AEI test site was moved to the Nance Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Welch | first = Kevin | title = Energy institute: Change afoot: Vaughn's departure among the shifts | work = Amarillo Globe-News | publisher = Morris Publishing Group | date = July 2, 2010 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/070210/new_news2.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the organization's offices were also moved, to WTAMU's Palo Duro Research Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Palo Duro Research Facility | publisher = West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtamu.edu/academics/palo-duro-research-facility.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 90s, AEI also began developing a fortran program called ROTOR. The program could predict theoretical power curves for blade designs and produce screen and printed output of this. The program has been modified a few times since then and is still being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clark | first = R.N | date = 1979 | title = Irrigation Pumping with Wind Energy | editor-last = Schneider | editor-first = A.D. | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | page = 30 | publisher = Transactions of the ASABE | id = 0002-1458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, AEI's Wind Data program has greatly expanded. In addition to working with wind farmers to provide data for the public, the organization also analyzes and publishes data for private organizations. In total, the organizations now collects data from 75 sites scattered across Texas. 50 of these data sites are archived online, 31 of which offer data for public use by researchers and developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tangler | first = JL | date = 2002 | title = The nebulous art of using wind tunnel aerofoil data for predicting rotor performance | volume = Wind Energy | pages = 11 | publisher = Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Courses===
Since 2009, AEI has been offering online alternative energy courses at WTAMU on [[Wind energy]], [[Solar energy]] and [[Renewable energy]]. Currently, WT offers one course per semester, with alternating subjects. The courses are taught by AEI staff and are open to WT students and those seeking certification.

In addition to the online courses offered by WTAMU, AEI has also authored renewable energy textbooks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Vaughn | first = Nelson | title = Wind energy: Renewable energy and the environment | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | date = 2009 | pages = 304 | isbn = 978-1-4200-7568-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and educational CDs. The CDs cover the subjects of wind energy, wind turbines, solar energy and wind water pumping. Some CDs are also available in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = University Bookstore: West Texas A&amp;M University | url = http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx | accessdate = December 6, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101101180126/http://www.wtbookstore.com/home.aspx| archivedate= 1 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seminars &amp; Symposiums===

====Windy Land Owners====
Started in 1989, AEI has been giving annual '''Windy Land Owners''' seminars. Designed to teach land owners and other interested parties general information about the wind industry, most of the seminars took place in the states surrounding Texas. Due to increased interest, AEI began giving seminars in Texas starting in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Romig | first = Georgia | title = Seminar blows wind farmers away | newspaper = The Prairie | date = October 22, 2009 | url = http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | accessdate = December 6, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717024247/http://www.theprairienews.com/2009/10/22/seminar-blows-wind-farmers-away/ | archivedate = July 17, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at these seminars include:
* Wind farm basics
* Wind resources in Texas
* Potential problem and contract considerations

Starting in 2009, AEI also began offering presentations from the WLO Seminars online for general information.

====WEATS====

AEI's Solar Energy Building

Launched in 1998, The Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS) is an internationally acclaimed workshop for the  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American community]]. Designed for project planners, developers, utility officials, and engineers directly involved with energy projects, it is both a good resource for networking and developing practical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wind Energy Applications Training Symposium (WEATS), September 28–30, 2010 in Golden, CO | work = TEEIC News and Events | publisher = Tribal Energy and Environmental Information Clearing House | date = August 25, 2010 | url = http://teeic.anl.gov/news/index.cfm | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered at this symposium include:
* Practical knowledge and analytical tools for conducting project pre-feasibility and identification analysis
* Implementation of small and large wind energy projects
* Lectures from [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] and local experts about the capabilities of the technology and the economic and financial aspects of sustainable project development
* Site visits

== Community Involvement ==

In addition to its seminars and workshops, AEI also regularly offers consulting to potential wind farmers and hosts tours of its research facilities.

As part of its community outreach, the organization also presents at the Caprock Science Fair&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Beck | first = Bruce | title = Science Fair: Students show off projects at Caprock | newspaper = Amarillo Globe-News | date = June 4, 2008 | url = http://amarillo.com/stories/060408/our_10402501.shtml | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other local schools, informing students about wind energy via displays, demonstrations and brochures at the elementary, junior high and high school levels.

'''Beaver Creek State Park''' is a {{convert|2722|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Ohio state parks|Ohio state park]] in [[Columbiana County, Ohio|Columbiana County]], Ohio in the United States.&lt;ref name=odnr/&gt; The park is near [[East Liverpool, Ohio|East Liverpool]] on the banks of [[Little Beaver Creek]]. It is open for year-round recreation including, camping, boating, hunting, fishing and hiking. Historic remnants of the [[Sandy and Beaver Canal]] can be found throughout the park. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Hunt Morgan]] was captured near what is now the park after conducting [[Morgan's Raid|raids]] across the state during the [[American Civil War]].

==History==
The history of human habitation in the Beaver Creek area dates back to the [[Clovis culture]], about 10,000 years ago. Archaeological digs nearby have uncovered arrowheads, pottery and knives that date back to these [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Paleoindian]] people.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

The land in and around Beaver Creek State Park was inhabited by various [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]]. The last tribe to call the area home before being forced out by the encroachment of Anglo-American settlers in the [[Ohio Country]] were the [[Mingo]] and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] Indians. A [[List of events named massacres|massacre]] of Mingo leader [[Logan (American Indian leader)|Logan]]'s family nearby was the catalyst for [[Dunmore's War]].&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

The first permanent white settler in the area was John Quinn a [[animal trapping|trapper]] who moved into the Little Beaver Creek valley in 1790. He was soon followed by Anglo-American pioneers who cleared the forests and established frontier farms throughout eastern Ohio.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

The [[Sandy and Beaver Canal]] ran {{convert|73|mi|km|0}} from the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] at [[Bolivar, Ohio|Bolivar]], Ohio to the [[Ohio River]] at [[Glasgow, Pennsylvania|Glasgow]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It had 90 [[Lock (water transport)|locks]], was chartered in 1828 and completed in 1848.  However, the middle section of the canal had many problems from the beginning and fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name=ohs/&gt; The canal ceased to operate in 1852, when the Cold Run Reservoir Dam outside of [[Lisbon, Ohio|Lisbon]], Ohio broke, ruining a large portion of the canal.&lt;ref name=shank/&gt; Remnants of the canal can be found at Beaver Creek State Park.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

[[John Hunt Morgan]] was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] and [[cavalry]] officer in the [[American Civil War]]. He is best known for [[Morgan's Raid]] in 1863, when he led 2,460 troops racing past [[Union Army|Union]] lines into [[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]] in July 1863. This would be the farthest north any uniformed Confederate troops penetrated during the war.&lt;ref name=dupuy/&gt; The raid ended when Morgan and his men were forced to surrender near what is now Beaver Creek State Park.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

Beaver Creek State Park was established in 1949 with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

==Attractions==
[[Gaston's Mill]] is a historic [[Watermill|mill]] that was built in 1837 on Little Beaver Creek. It is now restored and is open to the public. The mill is in working condition with various displays of antique milling equipment located within the mill building.&lt;ref name=waymarking/&gt; The mill works seasonally and grinds [[whole grain|whole wheat]] flour, [[cornmeal]] and [[buckwheat]] flour.

The historic recreation '''Pioneer Village''' features a log home, church, schoolhouse, general store and [[blacksmith]] shop, and is next to the mill.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt; The village is open on weekends during the summer season.

The '''Beaver Creek Wildlife Education Center''' features small live animals, natural history dioramas, displays of insects, arrowheads and nature photographs, and also houses a gift shop.  The center's volunteers offer programs about nature and environmental conservation.

==Ecology==
Beaver Creek State Park is in the [[Appalachian Highlands]] region of Ohio. The hilly [[sandstone]] region is home to diverse plant and animal populations. The region contains nearly 70% of the woodlands in Ohio. At one time this same region was a barren wasteland that had been stripped of its old growth forests to provide fuel for the iron furnaces. The forests have since regrown with a diversity of [[hardwood]]s including [[hickory]], [[oak]], and [[maple]].&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

[[Little Beaver Creek]] is a state and national wild and [[National Wild and Scenic River|scenic river]].&lt;ref name=river/&gt; It flows through the park and creates a [[Canyon|gorge]] in the soft sandstone hills of the park. The walls of the gorge are quite steep with high cliffs over the creek.&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt; Little Beaver Creek supports 63 species of [[fish]], 49 [[mammal]] [[species]], 140 types of [[birds]] and 46 species of [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, including the rare and protected [[salamander]] known as the [[hellbender]].

A variety of animals are found in Beaver Creek State Park. These animals are protected from hunting in the park. They include most common Eastern Woodland creatures such as the [[white-tailed deer]], [[skunk]]s, [[wild turkey]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[eastern gray squirrel]]s, [[great horned owl]]s and numerous songbirds, reptiles and amphibians. Plant life at the park includes [[Hesperis matronalis|Dame's violet]], [[goldenrod]], [[Claytonia|spring beauties]] and [[aster (genus)|asters]].&lt;ref name=odnr-history/&gt;

==Recreation==
Beaver Creek State Park is open for year-round recreation. The park is bisected by [[Little Beaver Creek]] which is a cold water fishery. Common game fish include [[smallmouth bass|smallmouth]] and [[rock bass]]. Anglers and hunters are required to have a license issued by the state. The creek is open to canoes and rubber rafts. There are 16 miles of trails open to hiking in the park.&lt;ref name=odnr-activities/&gt;

'''Colloid vibration current''' is an [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]] that arises when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] that contains [[ions]] and either [[solid]] particles or [[emulsion]] droplets.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8UwuPmWMbE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids"], Elsevier, 2002 {{ISBN|0-444-51164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[pressure gradient]] in an ultrasonic wave moves particles relative to the fluid. This motion disturbs the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] that exists at the particle-fluid [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a [[surface charge]]. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. Ions of the diffuse layer are located in the fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of one or the other of the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left hand pole. As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left hand pole and an excess of positive [[surface charge]] at the right hand pole. As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"/&gt; This phenomenon is widely used for measuring [[zeta potential]] in concentrated [[colloids]].

The '''Compiègne Wagon''' was the historical train carriage in which the [[First Armistice at Compiègne|First]] and [[Second Armistice at Compiegne|Second Armistice at Compiègne]] were signed.

After the first armistice was signed in the [[forest of Compiègne]] in 1918, the wagon was eventually moved to a protective place in a French museum. After being returned for the 1940 second armistice at Compiègne, the wagon was moved to Berlin to symbolize Germany's superiority over France.

At some point during World War II it was destroyed, accounts differ as to where, by whom and when.

== History ==

The wagon was built in 1914 in Saint-Denis, as dining car No. 2419D, and was used as such until August 1918. The car was then converted into an office for Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], the [[Generalissimo|Supreme Allied Commander]], who used it from the end of October 1918 to September 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://stevenlehrer.com/compiegne.htm |title=Compiègne |last=Lehrer |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Lehrer |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 1918, Foch, as Supreme Commander, signed the armistice with Germany in the then-called "Wagon of Compiègne". This agreement was the final "cease-fire" which ended fighting in the First World War; the other [[Central Powers]] having already reached agreements with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] to end hostilities.

Sometime after this, the car was returned to the [[Compagnie des Wagons-Lits]] and briefly resumed service as a dining car. In September 1919, it was donated to the [[Musée de l'Armée]], in Paris. The wagon was on display in the Musée‘s Cour des Invalides from 1921 to 1927.

At the request of the Mayor of Compiègne, and with the support of the American [[Arthur H. Fleming|Arthur Henry Fleming]], the car was restored and returned to Compiègne. It was housed in a specially created museum building as part of the "[[Glade of the Armistice]]" historic monument, with the car a few meters from the exact site of the signing ceremony

During the Second World War, Hitler ordered that the wagon be moved to exactly the same location for the signing of the second "armistice at Compiègne", on 22 June 1940; this time with Germany victorious. The carriage was moved out of its protective building and returned to the signing-place, which was several metres away and had been marked out as part of the monument.  Subsequently, the wagon was taken to Berlin and displayed a week later at the Berlin Cathedral. In 1944 the wagon was sent to Thuringia, in central Germany. Then it moved to Ruhla and later Gotha [[Crawinkel]], near a huge tunnel system.  There it was destroyed in March 1945 by the SS with fire and/or dynamite, in the face of the advancing U.S. Army. However, some SS veterans and civilian eye witnesses claim that the wagon had been destroyed by air attack near [[Ohrdruf]] while still in Thuringia in April 1944. Even so, it is generally believed the wagon was destroyed in 1945 by the SS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eberhardt-pfeiffer.de/Salonwagen.html "Compiegne"]. ''Eberhardt''. Retrieved 2014-10-05.{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's historical wagon is the exact copy of the original one. In 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum — 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin, from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. This car had also been part of Foch's private train during the 1918 signing. At the 1950 ceremony, it was renumbered No. 2419D. It is parked beside the display of the original car’s remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apnews.com/45ed2aad6c7a4261a92339db16fd3a79 AP news: Hitler in war, Merkel in peace: A train car for history] Retrieved 2018-11-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crepuscular rays''' {{IPAc-en|k|r|ɪ|ˈ|p|ʌ|s|k|j|ʊ|l|ər}} (more commonly known as '''sunbeams''', '''sun rays''', '''splintered light''', or '''god rays'''), in [[atmospheric optics]], are [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[sunlight]] that appear to radiate from the point in the sky where the sun is located. These rays, which stream through openings in clouds (particularly [[stratocumulus]]) or between other objects, are columns of sunlit air particles separated by darker cloud-shadowed volumes. Despite seeming to converge toward the light source, the rays are in fact near-parallel shafts of sunlight. Their apparent convergence is a [[Perspectivity|perspective]] effect. This phenomenon mimics the way parallel railway lines or long hallways, for example, seem to seek convergence at a distant [[vanishing point]]. The sun rays do converge toward the sun, but the sun is much farther away than the rays might suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/opt/air/crp.rxml|title=Crepuscular Rays|work=Weather World 2010|publisher=University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Field Guide to the Atmosphere|first1=Vincent J.|last1=Schaefer|first2=John A.|last2=Day|first3=Jay|last3=Pasachoff|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=1998|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=76261|title=Crepuscular Rays, India|work=Earth Observatory|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name comes from their frequent occurrences during [[twilight]] hours (those around dawn and dusk), when the contrasts between light and dark are the most obvious. Crepuscular comes from the Latin word "crepusculum", meaning twilight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=crepuscular_rays |title= Crepuscular rays |first= Harald |last= Edens |work= Weather Photography lightning, clouds, atmospheric optics &amp; astronomy |accessdate= November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticrepuscular rays==
[[File:Anticrepuscular Rays.jpg|thumb|Anticrepuscular rays opposite the setting sun off the [[Florida]] Gulf Coast of the United States]]
{{main|Anticrepuscular rays}}
The rays in some cases may extend across the sky and appear to converge at the [[antisolar point]], the point on the sky sphere directly opposite the sun. In this case they are called ''anticrepuscular'' or ''antisolar rays''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/anti1.htm |title= Anti-solar (anti-crepuscular) rays |first= Les |last= Cowley |work= Atmospheric Optics |accessdate= March 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not as easily spotted as crepuscular rays. This apparent dual convergence (to both the solar and antisolar points) is a perspective effect analogous to railway tracks appearing to converge to opposite points in opposite directions.&lt;ref name="cresp"&gt;{{cite book |pages= 124–127 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0cpQGHqxQBUC&amp;pg=PA124 |first= John A. |last= Day |title= The Book of Clouds |year= 2005 |publisher= Sterling |ISBN= 978-1-4027-2813-6 |accessdate= 2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color==
[[File:Crepuscular Rays Reno Nevada USA.jpg|thumb|Crepuscular Rays [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] [[Nevada]] USA during a sunset]]
Crepuscular rays usually appear orange because the path through the atmosphere at sunrise and sunset passes through up to 40 times as much air as rays from a high midday sun. Particles in the air scatter short wavelength light (blue and green) through [[Rayleigh scattering]] much more strongly than longer wavelength yellow and red light.

{{Marxism}}
'''Criticisms of Marxism''' have come from various [[political ideologies]] and [[academic disciplines]]. These include general criticisms about a lack of [[internal consistency]], criticisms related to [[historical materialism]], that it is a type of [[historical determinism]], the necessity of suppression of [[individual rights]], issues with the implementation of [[communism]] and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of [[price signal]]s and reduced [[incentive]]s. In addition, [[empirical]] and [[epistemological]] problems are frequently identified.&lt;ref name=howard/&gt;&lt;ref name=popper/&gt;&lt;ref name=keynes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/theory/marxism.html|title=Who Rules America: A Critique of Marxism|last=Domhoff|first=G.

==General criticisms==

[[Democratic socialism|Democratic socialists]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through [[class conflict]] and a [[proletarian revolution]]. Many [[Anarchism|anarchists]] reject the need for a [[dictatorship of the proletariat|transitory state phase]]. Some thinkers have rejected the fundamentals of Marxist theory, such as [[historical materialism]] and the [[labour theory of value]] and gone on to [[Criticism of capitalism|criticise capitalism]] and advocate socialism using other arguments.

Some contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or somewhat outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or social theory. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as [[Max Weber]], with the [[Frankfurt School]] being one example.

Historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote: "The truth is, even the most superficial inquiry into Marx’s use of evidence forces one to treat with skepticism everything he wrote which relies on factual data". For example Johnson stated: "The whole of the key Chapter Eight of Capital is a deliberate and systematic falsification to prove a thesis which an objective examination of the facts showed was untenable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12009844/Intellectuals_From_Marx_and_Tolstoy_to_Sartre_and_Chomsky_by_Paul_Johnson "Intellectuals From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky by Paul Johnson"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical materialism==
[[Historical materialism]] remains one of the intellectual bases of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/historical-materialism|title=the definition of historical materialism|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Erich Fromm]]|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/ch02.htm|title=Marx's Concept of Man|date=1961|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that technological advances in [[modes of production]] inevitably lead to changes in the social relations of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Marx|title=The Poverty of Philosophy|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.htm|accessdate=23 May 2008|quote=The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This economic "[[Base and superstructure|base]]" of society supports is reflected by and influences the ideological "[[Superstructure (Marxism)|superstructure]]" which encompasses culture, religion, politics and all other aspects of humanity's social consciousness.&lt;ref name=preface&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Marx|title=Preface to a Critique of Political Economy|publisher=The Electric Book Company|year=2001|location=London|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus looks for the causes of developments and changes in human history in economic, technological and more broadly, material factors as well as the clashes of material interests among tribes, social classes and nations. Law, politics, the arts, literature, morality and religion are understood by Marx to make up the superstructure as reflections of the economic base of society. Many critics have argued that this is an oversimplification of the nature of society and claim that the influence of ideas, culture and other aspects of what Marx called the superstructure are just as important as the economic base to the course of society, if not more so. However, Marxism does not claim that the economic base of society is the only determining element in society as demonstrated by the following letter written by [[Friedrich Engels]], Marx's long-time contributor:&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the materialist conception of history, the ''ultimately'' determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. More than this neither Marx nor I ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl and Friedrich Engels. ''Selected Correspondence''. p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this also creates another problem for Marxism. If the superstructure influences the base then there is no need for Marx's constant assertions that the history of society is one of economic class conflict. This then becomes a classic [[Chicken or the Egg|chicken or the egg argument]] as to whether the base or the superstructure comes first. [[Peter Singer]] proposes that the way to solve this problem is to understand that Marx saw the economic base as ultimately real. Marx believed that humanity's defining characteristic was its [[means of production]] and thus the only way for man to free himself from oppression was for him to take control of the means of production. According to Marx, this is the goal of history and the elements of the superstructure act as tools of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Singer|title=Marx: A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0192854056|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if Singer's interpretation of Marx's intuitions on the "goal of history" is faithful to Marx's original intent, that still would not make this viewpoint necessarily true.

Murray Rothbard criticized historical materialism as well, arguing that Marx claimed the "[[base and superstructure|base]]" of society (its technology and social relations) determined its "consciousness" in the superstructure, yet, building on the arguments of Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard observes it is human consciousness which drives the development of technology and social relations. Rothbard argues that Marx ignores how the base arises, which obscures that the true causal path is from the ''superstructure'' to the base, as human beings determine the development of technology and the social relations they wish to pursue. Rothbard quotes von Mises, who states "We may summarize the Marxian doctrine in this way: In the beginning there are the 'material productive forces', i.e., the technological equipment of human productive efforts, the tools and machines. No question concerning their origin is permitted; they are, that is all; we must assume that they are dropped from heaven." &lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothabrd (1995), ''An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought'', Volume 2, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, Chapter 12, pp.372-374, {{ISBN|0-945466-48-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical determinism==
Marx's theory of history is considered a variant of [[historical determinism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2011_chunk_g978140512433111_ss1-9|title=Economic Determinism|author=J.I. (Hans) Bakker|publisher=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; linked to his reliance on [[dialectical materialism]] as an endogenous mechanism for social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/articles/sayers/cohen.pdf|title=Marxism and the Dialectical Method – A critique of G.A. Cohen|author=Sean Sayers|publisher=Radical Philosophy 36 (Spring, 1984), pp. 4–13|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|title=A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|author=Karl Marx|publisher=[[Progress Publishers]], Moscow, 1977|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept [[dialectic]] emerged from the dialogues of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], but it was brought out by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in the early 19th century as a conceptual framework for the often opposing forces of historical evolution. Historical determinism has also been associated with scholars like [[Arnold Toynbee]] and [[Oswald Spengler]], but in recent times this conceptual approach has fallen into disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMMeqKHZIDkC&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=%22rejection+of+historical+determinism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rejection%20of%20historical%20determinism%22&amp;f=false|title=The historical Jesus: ancient evidence for the life of Christ|author=[[Gary R. Habermas]]|publisher=[[Thomas Nelson Inc.]]|year=1996|accessdate=28 December 2011|isbn=978-0899007328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to reassert this approach to an understanding of the forces of history, [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] criticised the narrow conceptual basis of Marx's ideas on historical evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/rethinking-science-and-culture-pr-sarkar-s-reconstruction-of-science-and-society|title=Rethinking Science and Culture: P.R. Sarkar's Reconstruction of Science and Society|author=[[Sohail Inayatullah]]|publisher=[[KurzweilAI]]|date=19 February 2002|accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1978 book ''[[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism]]'', [[Ravi Batra]] pointed out crucial differences in the historical determinist approaches of Sarkar and Marx.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sarkar's main concern with the human element is what imparts universality to his thesis. Thus while social evolution according to Marx is governed chiefly by economic conditions, to Sarkar this [[Law of Social Cycle|dynamic]] is propelled by forces varying with time and space: sometimes physical prowess and high-spiritedness, sometimes intellect applied to dogmas and sometimes intellect applied to the accumulation of capital (p. 38) ... The main line of defence of the Sarkarian hypothesis is that unlike the dogmas now in disrepute, it does not emphasise one particular point to the exclusion of all others: it is based on the sum total of human experience – the totality of human nature. Whenever a single factor, however important and fundamental, is called upon to illuminate the entire past and by implication the future, it simply invites disbelief, and after closer inspection, rejection. Marx committed that folly, and to some extent so did Toynbee. They both offered an easy prey to the critics, and the result is that today historical determinism is regarded by most scholars as an idea so bankrupt that it can never be solvent again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proutglobe.org/2011/09/sarkar-toynbee-and-marx/|title=Sarkar, Toynbee and Marx|author= Ravi Batra|publisher=PROUT Globe|accessdate=28 December 2011|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Suppression of individual rights==
Various economists have argued that a socialist state would by its very nature erode the rights of its citizens. The American economist [[Milton Friedman]] argued that under socialism the absence of a free market economy would inevitably lead to an authoritarian political regime. Friedman's view was also shared by [[Friedrich Hayek]], who also believed that capitalism is a precondition for freedom to flourish in a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Hayek|title=The Road to Serfdom|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|year=1944|isbn=978-0226320618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bellamy, Richard|title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521563543|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Liberalism|liberal]] theorists argue that any redistribution of property is a form of coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwig von Mises|title=Human Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels|Freidrich Engels]] suggested that, in order to ensure the success of the new communist society, revolutionary forces "must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engels |first1=Friedrich |title=On Authority |date=1874 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/10/authority.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists have also argued that Marxist communism will inevitably lead to coercion and state domination. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] believed Marxist regimes would lead to the "despotic control of the populace by a new and not at all numerous aristocracy".&lt;ref name="Statism and Anarchy"/&gt; Even if this new [[aristocracy]] were to have originated from among the ranks of the [[proletariat]], Bakunin argued that their new-found power would fundamentally change their view of society and thus lead them to "look down at the plain working masses".&lt;ref name="Statism and Anarchy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|title=Statism and Anarchy|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic==
[[Marxian economics]] have been criticized for a number of reasons. Some critics point to the Marxian analysis of capitalism while others argue that the economic system proposed by communism is unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Shleifer, Andrei, and Robert Vishny. ''Pervasive shortages under socialism''. No. w3791. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stringham, Edward Peter. "Kaldor-Hicks efficiency and the problem of central planning." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/millennials-open-to-socialism-are-not-living-in-the-real-world|title=Millennials open to socialism are not living in the real world|date=2017-12-11|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|date=December 2014|others=|title=The Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w20766.pdf|journal=NBER Working Paper Series|volume=|pages=|accessdate=6 September 2018|via=NBER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also doubts that the rate of profit in [[capitalism]] would tend to fall as Marx predicted. In 1961, [[Marxian economics|Marxian economist]] [[Nobuo Okishio]] devised a theorem ([[Okishio's theorem]]) showing that if capitalists pursue cost-cutting techniques and if the real wage does not rise, the rate of profit must rise.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Howard and J.E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 7, sects. II–IV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor theory of value===

The [[labor theory of value]] is one of the most commonly criticized core tenets of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/03/what-is-the-biggest-flaw-in-the-labor-theory-of-value.html|title=What is the biggest flaw in the labor theory of value? – Marginal Revolution|date=2010-03-30|work=Marginal REVOLUTION|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|year=1965|title=A Theory of the Allocation of Time|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]|volume=75|issue=299|pages=493–517|doi=10.2307/2228949|issn=1468-0297|jstor=2228949|registration=y|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp|title=Labor Theory Of Value|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-06-24|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wolff |first1=Jonathan |title=Karl Marx |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/#3 |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |accessdate=28 July 2018 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austrian School]] argues that this fundamental theory of classical economics is false and prefers the subsequent and modern [[subjective theory of value]] put forward by [[Carl Menger]] in his book ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]''. The Austrian School was not alone in criticizing the Marxian and classical belief in the labor theory of value. British economist [[Alfred Marshall]] attacked Marx, saying: "It is not true that the spinning of yarn in a factory [...] is the product of the labour of the operatives. It is the product of their labour, together with that of the employer and subordinate managers, and of the capital employed".&lt;ref name="Bucholz"&gt;Bucholz, Todd. ''New Ideas from Dead Economists''. New York: A Plume Book. 1998. pp. 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall points to the capitalist as sacrificing the money he could be using now for investment in business, which ultimately produces work.&lt;ref name="Bucholz"/&gt; By this logic, the capitalist contributes to the work and productivity of the factory because he delays his gratification through investment.&lt;ref name="Bucholz"/&gt; Through the [[Supply and demand|law of supply and demand]], Marshall attacked Marxian theory of value. According to Marshall, price or value is determined not just by supply, but by the demand of the consumer.&lt;ref name="Bucholz"/&gt; Labor does contribute to cost, but so do the wants and needs of consumers. The shift from labor being the source of all value to subjective individual evaluations creating all value undermines Marx's economic conclusions and some of his social theories.&lt;ref name=vonmises&gt;[[Ludwig Von Mises]]. "[[Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis]]" 2nd Ed. Trans. J. Kahane. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1951. pp. 111–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distorted or absent price signals===
The [[economic calculation problem]] is a criticism of [[socialist economics]] or, more precisely, of [[Centralisation#Centralisation in economy|centralized]] [[Planned economy|socialist planned economies]]. It was first proposed by [[Austrian School|Austrian School economist]] [[Ludwig von Mises]] in 1920 and later expounded by [[Friedrich Hayek]].&lt;ref name="Mises"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=8 September 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|year=1990|format=pdf|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=https://mises.org/pdf/econcalc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Hayek, (1935), "The Nature and History of the Problem" and "The Present State of the Debate," om in F.A. Hayek, ed. ''Collectivist Economic Planning'', pp. 1–40, 201–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources [[Rational choice theory|rationally]] in an economy. The [[free market]] solution is the [[price mechanism]], wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. The price conveys embedded information about the abundance of resources as well as their desirability which in turn allows on the basis of individual consensual decisions corrections that prevent [[Economic shortage|shortages]] and [[Economic surplus|surpluses]]. Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution and, without the information provided by market prices, socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by [[economic historian]]s as the [[socialist calculation debate]].&lt;ref name="School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/paretian/social.htm|title=The socialist calculation debate|accessdate=3 April 2007|last=Fonseca|first=Gonçalo L.|year=2000s|publisher=HET|quote=The information here has not been reviewed independently for accuracy, relevance and/or balance and thus deserves a considerable amount of caution.

(1972). eds., ''Socialist Economics. Selected Readings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduced incentives===
Some critics of utopian or egalitarian socialism argue that income sharing reduces individual incentives to work and therefore incomes should be individualised as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Zoltan J. Acs &amp; Bernard Young. ''Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Global Economy''. University of Michigan Press, p. 47, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of socialism have argued that in any society where everyone holds equal wealth there can be no material incentive to work because one does not receive rewards for work well done. They further argue that incentives increase productivity for all people and that the loss of those effects would lead to stagnation. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), [[John Stuart Mill]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is the common error of Socialists to overlook the natural indolence of mankind; their tendency to be passive, to be the slaves of habit, to persist indefinitely in a course once chosen. Let them once attain any state of existence which they consider tolerable, and the danger to be apprehended is that they will thenceforth stagnate; will not exert themselves to improve, and by letting their faculties rust, will lose even the energy required to preserve them from deterioration. Competition may not be the best conceivable stimulus, but it is at present a necessary one, and no one can foresee the time when it will not be indispensable to progress.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''The Principles of Political Economy'', Book IV, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he later altered his views and became more sympathetic to socialism, particularly [[Fourierism]], adding chapters to his ''Principles of Political Economy'' in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mill, John Stuart and Bentham, Jeremy edited by Ryan, Alan.|title=Utilitarianism and Other Essays|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2004|location=London|isbn=978-0140432725|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit in a slightly toned-down form.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Fred|title=John Stuart Mill: Political Economy|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|year=2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#PolEco|format=|doi=|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has criticised communal forms of socialism that promote egalitarianism in terms of wages/compensation as unrealistic in its assumptions about human motivation: &lt;blockquote&gt;This hope [that egalitarian reward would lead to a higher level of motivation], one that spread far beyond Marx, has been shown by both history and human experience to be irrelevant. For better or worse, human beings do not rise to such heights. Generations of socialists and socially oriented leaders have learned this to their disappointment and more often to their sorrow. The basic fact is clear: the good society must accept men and women as they are.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith, ''The Good Society: The Humane Agenda'' (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1996), pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Inconsistency===

[[Vladimir Karpovich Dmitriev]] writing in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;V.K. Dmitriev, 1974 (1898), ''Economic Essays on Value, Competition and Utility''. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ladislaus Bortkiewicz|Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz]] writing in 1906–1907&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1952 (1906–1907), "Value and Price in the Marxian System", ''International Economic Papers'' 2, 5–60; Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz, 1984 (1907), "On the Correction of Marx’s Fundamental Theoretical Construction in the Third Volume of ''Capital''". In Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk 1984 (1896), ''Karl Marx and the Close of his System'', Philadelphia: Orion Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent critics have alleged that [[Karl Marx]]'s [[value theory]] and law of the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once those errors are corrected, Marx's conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by—and equal to—aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Howard and J.E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inconsistency allegations have been a prominent feature of [[Marxian economics]] and the debate surrounding it since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=howard&gt;See M. C. Howard and J.E. King, 1992, ''A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929–1990''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Kliman]] argues that since internally inconsistent theories cannot possibly be right, this undermines Marx's critique of political economy and current-day research based upon it as well as the correction of Marx's alleged inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;Kliman states that "Marx’s value theory would be ''necessarily wrong'' if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence&amp;nbsp;– but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx’s theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?" (Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency,'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx’s theories was argued further by [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] ("The Return of Karl Marx," ''The New Yorker'', 20–27 October 1997, p. 252): "His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days."&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics who have alleged that Marx has been proved internally inconsistent include former and current Marxian and/or [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffian]] economists, such as [[Paul Sweezy]],&lt;ref&gt;"Only one conclusion is possible, namely, that the Marxian method of transformation [of commodity values into prices of production] is logically unsatisfactory." Paul M. Sweezy, 1970 (1942), ''The Theory of Capitalist Development'', p. 15. New York: Modern Reader Paperbacks.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobuo Okishio]],&lt;ref&gt;Nobuo Okishio, 1961, "Technical Changes and the Rate of Profit," ''Kobe University Economic Review'' 7, pp. 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Steedman]],&lt;ref&gt;"[P]hysical quantities ... suffice to determine the rate of profit (and the associated prices of production) .... [I]t follows that value magnitudes are, at best, redundant in the determination of the rate of profit (and prices of production)."

Proponents of the [[Temporal single-system interpretation|temporal single system interpretation]] (TSSI) of Marx's value theory, like Kliman, claim that the supposed inconsistencies are actually the result of misinterpretation and argue that when Marx's theory is understood as "temporal" and "single-system", the alleged internal inconsistencies disappear. In a recent survey of the debate, Kliman concludes that "the proofs of inconsistency are no longer defended; the entire case against Marx has been reduced to the interpretive issue".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Kliman, ''Reclaiming Marx's "Capital"'', Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevance ===
Marxism has been criticized as irrelevant, with many economists rejecting its core tenets and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marxism: Philosophy and Economics|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|publisher=William Morrow|year=1985|isbn=978-0688029630|location=|page=220|quote=Despite the massive intellectual feat that Marx’s Capital represents, the Marxian contribution to economics can be readily summarized as virtually zero. Professional economics as it exists today reflects no indication that Karl Marx ever existed. This neither denies nor denigrates Capital as an intellectual achievement, and perhaps in its way the culmination of classical economics. But the development of modern economics had simply ignored Marx. Even economists who are Marxists typically utilize a set of analytical tools to which Marx contributed nothing, and have recourse to Marx only for ideological, political, or historical purposes. In professional economics, Capital was a detour into a blind alley, however historic it may be as the centerpiece of a worldwide political movement. What is said and done in its name is said and done largely by people who have never read through it, much less followed its labyrinthine reasoning from its arbitrary postulates to its empirically false conclusions. Instead, the massive volumes of Capital have become a quasi-magic touchstone—a source of assurance that somewhere and somehow a genius “proved” capitalism to be wrong and doomed, even if the specifics of this proof are unknown to those who take their certitude from it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leiter, B.

''Essays in Persuasion''. W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 1991. p. 300 {{ISBN|978-0393001907}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Stigler]], "Economists working in the Marxian-Sraffian tradition represent a small minority of modern economists, and that their writings have virtually no impact upon the professional work of most economists in major English-language universities".&lt;ref name="Stigler1732"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George J.|authorlink=George Stigler|date=December 1988|title=Palgrave's Dictionary of Economics|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=26|pages=1729–36|jstor=2726859|ref=harv|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Solow]], in a review of the first edition of [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] criticized it for overemphasizing the importance of Marxism in modern economics. &lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was an important and influential thinker, and Marxism has been a doctrine with intellectual and practical influence.

==Social==

Some criticisms are based on the assertion that the Marxian conception of society is fundamentally flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/13940919|title=Dead end|last=|first=|date=2 July 2009|website=The Economist|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirowsky, John. "Wage slavery or creative work?." ''Society and mental health'' 1.2 (2011): 73–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Marxist stages of history, [[class analysis]] and theory of [[social evolution]] have been criticised. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] concluded that "class" was not a homogenous entity and could never mount a revolution, but continued to advocate Marxist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/ESC76.htm|title=Essays in Self-Criticism|website=www.faculty.umb.edu|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx himself admitted that his theory could not explain the internal development of the "Asiatic" social system, where much of the world's population lived for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert (2000) ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century''. W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0393048187}} pp. 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological==
Arguments against Marxism are often based on [[epistemological]] reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/1489165|title=Marx after communism|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, various critics have contended that Marx or his adherents have a flawed approach to epistemology.

According to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], the [[Dialectical materialism|laws of dialectics]] at the very base of [[Marxism]] are fundamentally flawed: some are "truisms with no specific Marxist content", others "philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means", yet others just "nonsense". Some Marxist "laws" are vague and can be interpreted differently, but these interpretations generally fall into one of the aforementioned categories of flaws as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Currents of Marxism|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|publisher=W. W. Norton and Company|year=2005|isbn=978-0393329438|location=New York|page=909}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ralph Miliband]] countered that Kolakowski had a flawed understanding of Marxism and its relation to Leninism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxist.com/marx-keynes-hayek-and-the-crisis-of-capitalism-part-one.htm|title=Marx, Keynes, Hayek and the Crisis of Capitalism}} {{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1950s/1956/no-625-september-1956/critics-criticised-professor-popper-looks-histor|title=The Critics Criticised}} {{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9248.1981.tb01280.x/full|title=Kolakowski's Anti-Marx|journal=Political Studies|volume=29|pages=115–22|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1981.tb01280.x|year=2016|last1=Miliband|first1=Ralph}} [https://www.marxist.com/in-defence-of-ltv.htm In Defence of Marx's Labour Theory of Value]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Thomas Sowell]] wrote in 1985: &lt;blockquote&gt;What Marx accomplished was to produce such a comprehensive, dramatic, and fascinating vision that it could withstand innumerable empirical contradictions, logical refutations, and moral revulsions at its effects. The Marxian vision took the overwhelming complexity of the real world and made the parts fall into place, in a way that was intellectually exhilarating and conferred such a sense of moral superiority that opponents could be simply labelled and dismissed as moral lepers or blind reactionaries. Marxism was – and remains – a mighty instrument for the acquisition and maintenance of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas Marxism Philosophy and Economics (William Morrow 1985) p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many notable academics such as [[Karl Popper]], [[David Prychitko]], [[Robert C. Allen]], and [[Francis Fukuyama]] argue that many of Marx's predictions have failed.&lt;ref name="Thornton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesjones.com/eoh.htm "The End of History?"] Francis Fukuyama.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, R.C. (2017). ''The industrial revolution: a very short introduction'' (Vol. 509). Oxford University Press p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx predicted that wages would tend to depreciate and that capitalist economies would suffer worsening economic crises leading to the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. The socialist revolution would occur first in the most advanced capitalist nations and once collective ownership had been established then all sources of class conflict would disappear. Instead of Marx's predictions, communist revolutions took place in undeveloped regions in Latin America and Asia instead of industrialized countries like the United States or the United Kingdom.

Popper has argued that both the concept of Marx's [[historical method]] as well as its application are [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and thus it is a pseudoscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science as Falsification|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.html|website=stephenjaygould.org|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that cannot be proven true or false: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Marxist theory of history, in spite of the serious efforts of some of its founders and followers, ultimately adopted this soothsaying practice. In some of its earlier formulations (for example in Marx's analysis of the character of the 'coming social revolution') their predictions were testable, and in fact falsified. Yet instead of accepting the refutations the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree. In this way they rescued the theory from refutation; but they did so at the price of adopting a device which made it irrefutable. They thus gave a 'conventionalist twist' to the theory; and by this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status.&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Popper|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415285940|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. When Marx's predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''[[ad hoc]]'' hypotheses which attempted to make it compatible with the facts. By this means, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudoscientific [[dogma]].&lt;ref name=Thornton&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornton|first=Stephen|contribution=Karl Popper|year=2006|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zolta|editor-first=Edward N.|place=Stanford|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/|postscript=&lt;!-- None. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper agreed on the general non-falsifiability of the social sciences, but instead used it as an argument against [[central planning]] and all-encompassing historiographical ideologies.&lt;ref name=Thornton/&gt; Popper devoted much attention to dissecting the practice of using the dialectic in defence of Marxist thought, which was the very strategy employed by V.A. Lektorsky in his defence of Marxism against Popper's criticisms. Among Popper's conclusions was that Marxists used dialectic as a method of side-stepping and evading criticisms, rather than actually answering or addressing them: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hegel thought that philosophy develops; yet his own system was to remain the last and highest stage of this development and could not be superseded. The Marxists adopted the same attitude towards the Marxian system. Hence, Marx's anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of orthodox Marxism, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example of Engels' Anti-Dühring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics – to defend the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for being traitors. Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. It has thus become what I have called reinforced dogmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Popper|title=Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415285940|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] has criticized as unscientific Marx's belief in progress as a universal law. Russell stated: "Marx professed himself an atheist, but retained a cosmic optimism which only theism could justify".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand History of Western Philosophy Simon and Schuster pp. 788–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Marxists like Thomas Riggins have claimed that Russell misrepresented Marx's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riggins|first1=Thomas|title=V.J.

A '''current''', in a [[river]] or [[stream]], is the flow of [[water]] influenced by [[gravity]] as the water moves [[wikt:downhill|downhill]] to reduce its [[potential energy]]. The current varies [[Three-dimensional space|spatially]] as well as [[Time|temporally]] within the stream, dependent upon the flow [[volume]] of water, [[stream gradient]], and [[Channel (geography)|channel]] geometry. In [[tidal zone]]s, the current in rivers and streams may reverse on the flood tide before resuming on the [[wikt:Ebb tide|ebb tide]].

The [[energy policy]] of [[Australia]] is subject to the regulatory and fiscal influence of all three levels of government in Australia, although only the State and Federal levels determine policy for primary industries such as coal.

As of 2016, Federal energy policies continue to support the [[Coal mining in Australia|coal mining]] and natural gas industries through [[Energy and transport subsidies in Australia|subsidies for fossil fuel use and production]] as the exports by those industries contribute significantly to the earnings of foreign exchange and government revenues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Australia is one of the most coal-dependent countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Mark Diesendorf [http://assets.panda.org/downloads/wwf2003coalfinal2.pdf Australia's Polluting Power: Coal-fired electricity and its impact on global warming]. WWF Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Coal and natural gas, along with oil-based products, are currently the primary sources of Australian energy usage and the coal industry produces approximately 38% of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015 Federal policy reverted to a pro-coal economy with cuts to alternate and renewable energy government offices, targets and subsidies &lt;ref&gt;Giles Parkinson [http://www.crikey.com.au/2014/05/14/environment-green-policies-casualties-of-abbotts-vengeance-mission/?wpmp_switcher=mobile Environment: green policies casualties of Abbott’s vengeance mission].&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal climate change policy changed following the election of the Labor [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]] in December 2007, which committed to introduce an [[Emissions Trading Scheme]] in 2010, and to expand the [[Mandatory renewable energy targets#Commonwealth Government|mandatory renewable energy target]] to ensure 20% of electricity supply in Australia was from renewable sources by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/renewabletarget/pubs/RET-scheme-design.pdf |title=Renewable Energy Target Scheme Design |accessdate=15 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515035607/http://www.climatechange.gov.au/renewabletarget/pubs/RET-scheme-design.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a contentious political debate, a [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon pricing mechanism]] entered force on 1 July 2012 under Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]], but was repealed by the [[Abbott Government]] in 2014. In June 2015 the Abbott Government downgraded the renewable energy target from 41,000 GWh per year to 33,000 GWh.

As of 2013, Australia was now only the 12th highest [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions per capita|emitter of greenhouse gases per capita]] in the world, and 16th (behind China, Russia. the US, Germany, the UK, Japan, India and other major developed nations), in total CO2 emissions (kt per year).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?year_high_desc=true Oak Ridge National Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of power stations in Australia|Clean Energy Regulator}}

===History and governance===
After [[World War II]], New South Wales and Victoria started connecting the formerly small and self-contained local and regional power grids into statewide grids run centrally by public statutory authorities.  Similar developments occurred in other states. Both of the industrially large states cooperated with the Commonwealth in the development and interconnection of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].

Rapid economic growth led to large and expanding construction programs of coal-fired power stations such as black coal in New South Wales and brown coal in Victoria. By the 1980s complex policy questions had emerged involving the massive requirements for investment, land and water.

Between 1981 and 1983 a cascade of blackouts and disruptions was triggered in both states, resulting from generator design failures in New South Wales, industrial disputes in Victoria, and drought in the storages of the Snowy system (which provided essential [[peaking power plant|peak power]] to the State systems). Wide political controversy arose from this and from proposals to the New South Wales Government from the [[Electricity Commission of New South Wales]] for urgent approval to build large new stations at Mardi and Olney on the Central Coast, and at other sites later.

The Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in New South Wales was established, reporting in mid-1985. This was the first independent enquiry directed from outside the industry into the Australian electricity system. It found, among other matters, that existing power stations were very inefficient, that plans for four new stations, worth then about $12 billion, should be abandoned, and that if the sector were restructured there should be sufficient capacity for normal purposes until the early years of the 21st century. This forecast was achieved. The Commission also recommended enhanced operational coordination of the adjoining State systems and the interconnection in eastern Australia of regional power markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1842169?lookfor=nsw%20electricity%20generation%20planning&amp;offset=2&amp;max=405134 Reports of the Commission of Enquiry into Electricity Generation Planning in NSW], 4 vols, Sydney 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New South Wales Enquiry marked the beginning of the end of the centralised power utility monopolies and established the direction of a new trajectory in Australian energy policy, towards decentralisation, interconnection of States and the use of markets for coordination. Similar enquiries were subsequently established in Victoria (by the Parliament) and elsewhere, and during the 1990s the industry was comprehensively restructured in southeastern Australia and subsequently corporatised.

Following the report by the Industry Commission on the sector&lt;ref&gt;Industry Commission, ''Energy Generation and Distribution'', 2 volumes, Canberra, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; moves towards a national market developed. Impetus towards system wide competition was encouraged by the Hilmer recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncp.ncc.gov.au/ Hilmer Committee on National Competition Policy, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the [[National Electricity Market]] in 1997 was the first major accomplishment of the new Federal/State cooperative arrangements under the Council of Australian Governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coag.gov.au/  COAG, Canberra]&lt;/ref&gt; The governance provisions included a National Electricity Code, the establishment in 1996 of a central market manager, the National Electricity Market Management Company ([[NEMMCO]]), and a regulator, National Electricity Code Administrator (NECA).

These arrangements are administered by a national regulator, the [[Australian Energy Regulator]] (AER), and a market rule-making body, the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]] (AEMC), and a market operator, the [[Australian Energy Market Operator]] (AEMO).

Over the 10 years from 1998–99 to 2008–09, Australia's electricity use increased at an average rate of 2.5% a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/Documents/facts-stats-pubs/Energy-in-Australia-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216021352/http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/Documents/facts-stats-pubs/Energy-in-Australia-2011.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008–09, a total of {{convert|261|TWh}} of electricity (including off-grid electricity) was generated in Australia. Between 2009 and 2013 NEM energy usage had decreased by 4.3% or almost {{convert|8|TWh}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconversation.com/why-is-electricity-consumption-decreasing-in-australia-20998 Why is electricity consumption decreasing in Australia?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal-fired power===
[[File:Renewable Electricity Generation Australia 2015-16.png|alt=Hydro 40.54%, Wind 31.76%, Solar PV 18.24%, Bioenergy 10.14%|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia, 2015-16]]
[[File:Graph RE Australia 2010.svg|thumb|Electricity generation from renewable sources in Australia, 2010]]
The main source of Australia's electricity generation is coal. In 2003, coal-fired plants produced 58.4% of the total capacity, followed by hydropower (19.1%, of which 17% is [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped storage]]), natural gas (13.5%), liquid/gas fossil fuel-switching plants (5.4%), oil products (2.9%), wind power (0.4%), biomass (0.2%) and solar (0.1%).&lt;ref&gt;OECD/IEA, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, coal-fired power plants generated 77.2% of the country's total electricity production, followed by natural gas (13.8%), hydropower (7.0%), oil (1.0%), biomass (0.6%) and solar and wind combined (0.3%).&lt;ref name=iea95&gt;OECD/IEA, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The total generating capacity from all sources in 2008-9 was approximately {{convert|51|GW}} with an average capacity utilisation of 52%. Coal-fired plants constituted a majority of generating capacity which in 2008-9 was {{convert|29.4|GW}}. In 2008-9, a total of {{convert|143.2|TWh}} of electricity was produced from black coal and {{convert|56.9|TWh}} from brown coal.  Depending on the cost of coal at the power station, the long run marginal cost of coal-based electricity at power stations in eastern Australia is between 7 and 8 cents per kWh, which is around $79 per MWh.

===Hydroelectric power===
[[Image:SnowyMountainsNSWTalbingoDam20050423a.JPG|thumb|[[Talbingo Dam]] is part of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]].]]

Hydroelectricity accounts for 6.5–7% of NEM electricity generation.&lt;ref name=iea95/&gt;&lt;ref name="How solar ran out of puff"&gt;(17 April 2007). [http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/how-solar-ran-out-of-puff/2007/04/16/1176696757654.html# How solar ran out of puff]. ''Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; The massive [[Snowy Mountains|Snowy Mountains Scheme]] is the largest producer of [[hydro-electricity]] in eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and southern [[New South Wales]].

===Wind power===
{{See also|Wind power in Australia}}
In 2014, Australia's [[wind farm]]s produced over 30% of the country's clean energy. Wind power supplied 4.2% of Australia's total electricity during the year. Australia had 1,866 wind turbines spread across 71 wind farms at the end of 2014. Three wind farms with a combined power generation capacity of 566.7 [[megawatt]]s (MW) were completed in 2014.&lt;ref name="cleanenergycouncil.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/technologies/wind-energy.html#sthash.kZGCcueo.dpuf | title=Clean Energy Council - Wind energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, there were 4,187 MW of installed wind power capacity, with another 15,284 MW either being planned or under construction.&lt;ref name=ieawind13&gt;{{cite book|title=IEA Wind Annual Report 2011|year=2012|publisher=IEA Wind|location=Boulder, Colorado, United States|isbn=978-0-9786383-6-8|pages=186|url=http://www.ieawind.org/annual_reports_PDF/2011.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year to October 2015, wind power accounted for 4.9% of Australia's total electricity demand and 33.7% of total renewable energy supply.&lt;ref name=cecr13&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Energy Australia Report 2011|url=https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/technologies/wind-energy.html|publisher=Clean Energy Council|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As at October 2015, there were 76 wind farms in Australia, most of which had turbines of from 1.5 to 3 MW.

===Solar power===
{{Main|Solar power in Australia}}
Solar energy is used to [[Solar hot water in Australia|heat water]], in addition to its role in producing electricity through photovoltaics (PV).

In 2007, less than 1% of Australian electricity came from solar power generation,&lt;ref name="How solar ran out of puff"/&gt; mainly due to the higher cost per kW than other power sources because of the cost of [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s. Innovative applications of PV technology being developed in Australia and elsewhere include concentrating systems to focus the solar energy on to a smaller area of higher efficiency cells and the use of [[building integrated PV]], where the PV cells perform architectural or structural functions as well as power generation, thereby offsetting some of the cost. In 2014/15, PV accounted for 2.4% of Australia's electrical energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Publications/Documents/aes/2016-australian-energy-statistics.pdf|title=2016 Australian energy statistics update}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installed PV capacity in Australia has increased 10-fold between 2009 and 2011, and quadrupled between 2011 and 2016.

===Wave power===
The Australian government says new technology harnessing [[Wave power|wave energy]] could be important for supplying electricity to most of the country's major capital cities. The [[CETO#Perth Wave Energy Project|Perth Wave Energy Project]] near Fremantle in Western Australia operates through a number of submerged buoys, creating energy as they move with passing waves. The Australian government has provided more than $US600,000 in research funding for the technology developed by Carnegie, a Perth company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907072348/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s1926206.htm Australia looks to future with wave energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power===
[[Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Plant]] was a proposed [[nuclear power reactor]] in the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] on the south coast of New South Wales. It would have been Australia's first [[nuclear power plant]], and was the only proposal to have received serious consideration as of 2005. Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project.

Queensland introduced legislation to ban nuclear power development on 20 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aar.com.au/pubs/ener/cuemar07.htm Queensland bans nuclear facilities] Aleens Arthur Robinson Client Update: Energy. 1 March 2007. Retrieved 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmania has also banned nuclear power development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hg.org/articles/article_1774.html Australias States React Strongly to Switkowski Report] Hieros Gamos Worldwide Legal Directories 10 December 2006. Retrieved 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were enacted in response to a pro-nuclear position, by [[John Howard]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Portal:Australia/Australian nuclear debate|Wikinews Portal]]Australian nuclear debate&lt;/ref&gt; and the release of the  [[Ziggy Switkowski|Switkowski]] report into nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpmc.gov.au/publications/umpner/index.cfm Uranium Mining, Processing and Nuclear Energy – Opportunities for Australia?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729200539/http://dpmc.gov.au/publications/umpner/index.cfm |date=29 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent panel of Australian scientists and nuclear experts have been critical of the findings of the Switkowski nuclear inquiry. They found that the Switkowski report relies on some flawed assumptions which reveal a bias towards nuclear power on economic, technological, health and environmental grounds.&lt;ref name = energyscience&gt;[http://www.energyscience.org.au/media-releases.html Media Release 24 Nov 2006: Response to UMPNER draft report]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Howard went to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|November 2007 election]] with a pro-nuclear power platform but his government was soundly defeated by Labor, which is opposed to nuclear power for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112447/http://www.solarpowertoday.com.au/blog/2006-support-nuclear-power-falls/ Support for Nuclear Power falls]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2007/11/24/1195753376406.html Rudd romps to historic win]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===
{{Main|Geothermal power in Australia}}
There are vast deep-seated granite systems, mainly in central Australia, that have high temperatures at depth and these are being drilled by 19 companies across Australia in 141 areas. They are spending A$654 million on exploration programs.  South Australia has been described as "Australia's hot rock haven" and this emissions-free and renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6.8% of Australia's base load power needs by 2030. According to an estimate by the Centre for International Economics, Australia has enough [[Geothermal power|geothermal energy]] to contribute electricity for 450 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/hot-rock-power-the-way-ahead/2007/04/11/1175971183212.html Scientists get hot rocks off over green nuclear power]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2008 federal budget]] allocated $50 million through the Renewable Energy Fund to assist with 'proof-of-concept' projects in known geothermal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alp.org.au/media/0508/msrese200.php "Clean Coal and Renewable Energy". Martin Ferguson Press Release.] 20 May 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526104131/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0508/msrese200.php |date=26 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomass===
[[Biofuel|Biomass power]] plants use crops and other vegetative by-products to produce power similar to the way coal-fired power plants work. Another product of biomass is extracting ethanol from sugar mill by-products. The GGAP subsidies for biomass include ethanol extraction with funds of $7.4M and petrol/ethanol fuel with funds of $8.8 million. The total $16.2M subsidy is considered as a renewable energy source subsidy.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Biodiesel====
Biodiesel is an alternative to fossil fuel diesels that can be used in cars and other internal [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] vehicles. It is produced from vegetable or animal fats and is the only other type of fuel that can run in current unmodified vehicle engines. The advantages of using biodiesels are:

* they can be mixed with normal fuels (B20 is the common biofuel mixture consisting of 20% biodiesel and 80% petrol)
* produces 80% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 100% less [[Sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]]
* reduces cancer risks by 90%
* biodiesels are 11% oxygen and contain no sulphur
* provides 30% more [[lubricity]] for car engines{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

Subsidies given to ethanol oils totaled $15 million in 2003–2004, $44 million in 2004–2005, $76 million in 2005–2006 and $99 million in 2006–2007. The cost for establishing these subsidies were $1 million in 2005–2006 and $41 million in 2006–2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd033.htm#Purpose |title=Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme Bill 2003 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AEnergy+Grants+%28Cleaner+Fuels%29+Scheme+Bill+2003&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911055737/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd033.htm |archivedate=11 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the introduction of the Fuel Tax Bill, grants and subsidies for using biodiesel have been cut leaving the public to continue using diesel instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ato.gov.au/content/downloads/n16229-10-2006.pdf Biodiesel – fuel tax credits and fuel grant entitlements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154912/http://www.ato.gov.au/content/downloads/n16229-10-2006.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}.

In 2005, Australia was the largest coal exporter in the world with 231 million tonnes of hard coal.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt; Australian black coal exports are expected by some to increase by 2.6% per year to reach 438 million tonnes by 2029–30, but the possible introduction of [[emissions trading]] schemes in customer countries as provided for under the [[Kyoto protocol]] may affect these expectations in the medium term.

Coal mining in Australia has become more controversial because of the strong link between the [[effects of global warming on Australia]] and burning coal, including exported coal, and [[climate change]], [[global warming]] and [[sea level rise]]. Coal mining in Australia will as a result have direct impacts on [[agriculture in Australia]], health and [[natural environment]] including the [[Great Barrier Reef]].&lt;ref&gt;[[CSIRO]]'s Climate Change Impacts on Australia and the Benefits of Early Action to Reduce Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions"  {{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/files/files/p6fy.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225160612/http://www.csiro.au/files/files/p6fy.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[AR4]] Working Group III Report "Mitigation of Climate Change" states that under Scenario A (stabilisation at 450ppm) Annex 1 countries (including Australia) will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% to 40% by 2020 and 80% to 95% by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter13.pdf at page 776]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many environmental groups around the world, including those represented in Australia, are taking direct action for the dramatic reduction in the use of coal as [[carbon capture and storage]] is not expected to be ready before 2020 if ever commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Nonviolent_direct_actions_against_coal Nonviolent direct actions against coal – SourceWatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport subsidies ==

===Petrol===
In the transport sector, [[Energy subsidies|fuel subsidies]] reduce petrol prices by $0.38/L.{{Citation needed|reason=Can't immediately find anything in a web search, and the following citation has a broken link|date=April 2017}} This is very significant, given current petrol prices in Australia of around $1.30/L. The acceptable petrol prices hence result in Australia's petroleum consumption at 28.9 GL every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}{{cite journal |url=http://www.abareconomics.com/interactive/energy_dec06/pdf/energyAUS_06.pdf |format=PDF|title=Australian Energy Projections 2029–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greenpeace, removal of this subsidy would make petrol prices rise to around $1.70/L and thus could make certain [[alternative fuel]]s competitive with petroleum on cost. The 32% price increase associated with subsidy removal would be expected to correspond to an 18% reduction in petrol demand and a Greenhouse Gases emission reduction of 12.5 Mt CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/australia/resources/reports/climate-change/energy-and-transport-subsidies.pdf |format=PDF |author=Chris Riedy |title=Energy And Transport Subsidies In Australia |journal=Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney Report, 2007, for Greenpeace Australia Pacific |accessdate=7 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724085454/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/australia/resources/reports/climate-change/energy-and-transport-subsidies.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax keeps oil prices low and encourages investment in the 'finite' supplies of oil, at the same time considering alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Webb (6 February 2001).

===Diesel===
The subsidies for Oil-Diesel fuel rebate program are worth about $2 billion, which are much more than the grants devoted to renewable energy. Whilst renewable energy is out of scope at this stage, an alternative [[Wind hybrid power systems#Wind-diesel system|diesel–renewable hybrid system]] is highly recommended. If the subsidies for diesel were bounded with the renewable subsidies, remote communities could adapt [[Wind hybrid power systems#Wind-diesel system|hybrid electric generation systems]].&lt;ref name="sustainabilitycentre.com.au"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/Subsidies.pdf |format=PDF |title=Subsidies to Fossil Fuels are Undermining a Sustainable Future |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829112817/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/Subsidies.pdf |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Energy Grants Credit Scheme (EGCS), an off-road component is a rebate program for diesel and diesel-like fuels.

===Petroleum subsidies===
Companies involved in the extraction of the fossil fuel petroleum are given special deductions as follows:
* deduction of expenditures
* deduction of expenditures on capital and current [[Environmental movement|environmental protection]] on pollution control and waste management
* deduction of mine rehabilitation costs.

==Federal Government==
Australia introduced a national [[energy rating label]] in 1992. The system allows consumers to compare the energy efficiency between similar appliances.

===Institutions===
The responsible governmental agencies for energy policy are the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG), the Ministerial Council on Energy (MCE), the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources (MCMPR), the Commonwealth Department of Resources; Energy and Tourism (DRET), the Department of Environment and Heritage (DEH), the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO), the Department of Transport and Regional Services, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]], the [[Australian Energy Regulator]] and the [[Australian Energy Market Operator]].

===Energy strategy===
In the 2004 [[White paper|White Paper]] ''Securing Australia's Energy Future'', a number of initiatives were announced to achieve the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government's]] energy objectives. These include:
* a complete overhaul of the fuel excise system to remove A$1.5 billion in excise liability from businesses and households in the period to 2012–13
* the establishment of a A$500 million fund to leverage more than A$1 billion in private investment to develop and demonstrate low-emission technologies
* a strong emphasis on the urgency and importance of continued energy market reform
* the provision of A$75 million for [[Solar Cities in Australia|Solar Cities]] trials in urban areas to demonstrate a new energy scenario, bringing together the benefits of [[Solar power|solar energy]], energy efficiency and vibrant [[energy market]]s
* the provision of A$134 million to remove impediments to the commercial development of renewable technologies
* incentives for [[Oil exploration|petroleum exploration]] in frontier offshore areas as announced in the 2004–05 budget
* new requirements for business to manage their emissions wisely
* a requirement that larger energy users undertake, and report publicly on, regular assessments to identify energy efficiency opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/energy_future/docs/energy.pdf |title=Securing Australia's Energy Future |accessdate=15 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030020336/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/publications/energy_future/docs/energy.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticisms'''
# On a net basis this is a tax on the top 40% of income earners which will then be used largely to subsidise the coal industry in attempts to develop [[carbon capture and storage in Australia]], [[clean coal]].
# Deforestation is not included in the scheme where there will be reforestation in spite of the significant timing differences, uncertainty of reforestation and effect of leaving old growth forests vulnerable.
# It is unclear what level of carbon price will be sufficient to reduce demand for coal-fired power and increase demand for low emissions electricity like [[Wind power in Australia|wind]] or [[Solar power in Australia|solar]].
# No commitment to maintain [[mandatory renewable energy targets|Mandatory Renewable Energy Target]].&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003170 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The scheme fails to address climate change caused by burning of coal exported from Australia.

===Energy market reform===
[[File:Power lines in the dawn light - globe derby - 1.jpg|thumb|Power lines in South Australia]]
On 11 December 2003, the [[Ministerial Council on Energy]] released a document entitled "Reform of Energy Markets".&lt;ref name=rem&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.efa.com.au/Library/MinCouncilonEnergyRpttoCOAG.pdf | title=Reform of Energy Markets | work=Report to the Council of Australian Governments | date=11 December 2003 | accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall purpose of this initiative was the creation of national electricity and natural gas markets rather than state-based provision of both. As a result, two federal level institutions, the [[Australian Energy Market Commission]] (AEMC) and the [[Australian Energy Regulator]] (AER), were created.&lt;ref&gt;OECD/IEA, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==State policies==

=== Queensland ===
{{Main|Energy in Queensland}}
Queensland's energy policy is based on the year 2000 document called [https://web.archive.org/web/20060917172918/http://www.energy.qld.gov.au/zone_files/General_PDFs/qldenergypolicy2000.pdf Queensland Energy Policy: A Cleaner Energy Strategy]. The [[Queensland Government]] assists [[energy development]] through the [[Queensland Department of Energy]] and is most noted for its contribution to [[coal mining in Australia]].

=== South Australia ===
The South Australian Government has developed an energy policy based on sustainability objective as well as on South Australia's Strategic Plan.

A major priority of South Australia's Strategic Plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in South Australia to achieve the Kyoto target as a first step towards reducing emissions by 60% (to 40% of 1990 levels) by 2050.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Measures announced in South Australia include:
# stabilisation of greenhouse pollution by 2020
# legislated cuts of 60% in greenhouse pollution by 2050
# legislated renewable energy target of 15% by 2014
In 2009 Premier Mike Rann announced plans to increase the State's renewable energy production target to 33% by 2020. (Letter from Energy Minister Michael O'Brien 29/4/11)
# solar [[feed-in tariff]]
# ban on electric hot water systems.

===Victoria===
{{Main|Energy in Victoria}}
[[File:Yallourn-w-power-station-australia.jpg|thumb|[[Yallourn Power Station]] is the third largest power station in Victoria]]
In 2006 Victoria became the first state to have a renewable energy target of 10% by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;(17 July 2006). [http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/bc348d5912436a9cca256cfc0082d800/2716fe821cdeeb84ca2571af00030fb3!OpenDocument Victoria Leads Nation On Renewable Energy Target] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930124402/http://www.dtf.vic.gov.au/domino/Web_Notes/newmedia.nsf/bc348d5912436a9cca256cfc0082d800/2716fe821cdeeb84ca2571af00030fb3!OpenDocument |date=30 September 2011 }}. Media Release from the Minister For The Environment, Minister For Energy And Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the target was increased to 25% by 2020.&lt;ref name="vtse"/&gt;

=== New South Wales ===
New South Wales has a renewable energy target of 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="mtis"/&gt; New South Wales had the world's most generous feed in tariff for solar power from 2010 – 2011 at A$0.60/kwh.&lt;ref&gt;(12 October 2010).

''The Bellingen Shire Courier Mail''. Fairfax Media.&lt;/ref&gt;
This 60c/kWh feed in tariff was revoked for new customers from 27 October 2010. Those in the scheme will get that feed in tariff until 31 December 2016. Current customers enter under a net feed in tariff, in which the power is used by the consumer (and is therefore worth to them whatever they would have paid for that power). Excess power is exported at a low rate (from 0c to 7.7c per kwh).

=== Western Australia ===

In some remote areas of WA, the use of fossil fuels is expensive thus making renewable energy supplies commercially competitive.&lt;ref name="remotewapv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Wagner |first3=L. |last4=Foster |first4=J.|date=June 2016 |title=Reviewing the viability of renewable energy in community electrification: The case of remote Western Australian communities |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=59 |pages=470–481 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032115016561 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Australia offers renewable energy subsidies including; solar heaters, Photovoltaic rebate program for installations at households, schools, factories and renewable Remote Power Generation Program of &gt;$500,000 rebates for large off-grid systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.energy.wa.gov.au/2/3205/64/subsidies_and_r.pm |title=Office of Energy, WA, Subsidies and Rebates }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.clean.energy.wa.gov.au/pages/renewable_energy.asp |title=Office of Energy, Government of WA, Renewable Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426120526/http://www.clean.energy.wa.gov.au/pages/renewable_energy.asp |archivedate=26 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Capital Territory ===
The ACT Government's {{cite journal |url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/energy/energy_policy |title=Sustainable Energy Policy |date=20 November 2018 }} an integrated policy framework for managing the social, economic and environment challenges faced by the Territory in relation to energy production and use, was released on 28 September 2011. The policy is a continued commitment to maintain affordable and reliable electricity and gas supply to Canberra. The policy also establishes the key objective of achieving a more sustainable energy supply as the Territory moves to carbon neutrality by 2060.

===Other states===
[[Tasmania]] has a concession rebate and a life support discount. The [[Northern Territory]] has similar programs.

==Renewable energy targets==
{{See also|Renewable energy in Australia|Mitigation of global warming in Australia}}
In 2001, the federal government introduced a [[Mandatory Renewable Energy Target]] (MRET) of 9,500 GWh of new generation, with the scheme running until at least 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orer.gov.au/publications/mret-overview.html Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator: "Mandatory Renewable Energy Target"] February 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an increase of new renewable electricity generation of about 4% of Australia's total electricity generation and a doubling of renewable generation from 1997 levels. Australia's renewable energy target does not cover heating or transport energy like Europe's or China's, Australia's target is therefore equivalent of approximately 5% of all energy from renewable sources.

The Commonwealth and the states agreed in December 2007, at a [[Council of Australian Governments]] ([[COAG]]) meeting, to work together from 2008, to combine the Commonwealth scheme with the disparate state schemes, into a single national scheme. The initial report on progress and an implementation plan considered at a March 2008 COAG meeting. In May 2008, the [[Productivity Commission]], the government's independent research and advisory body on a range of economic, social and environmental issues, claimed the MRET would drive up energy prices and would do nothing to cut greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23744414-601,00.html Kevin Rudd's energy strategy 'flawed' says Productivity Commission] "The Australian" May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Productivity Commission submission to the climate change review, stated that energy generators have warned that big coal-fired power stations are at risk of "crashing out of the system", and leaving huge supply gaps and price spikes if the transition is not carefully managed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This forecast has been described as a joke because up to A$20 billion compensation is proposed to be paid under the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In addition, in Victoria where the highest emitting power stations are located, the state government has emergency powers enabling it to take over and run the generating assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/opinion/politics/power-giants-crying-foul-what-a-joke-20091129-jyqx.html|title=Power giants crying foul?

On 20 August  2009, the Expanded Renewable Energy Target increased the 2020 MRET from 9,500 to 45,000 gigawatt-hours, and continuing until 2030. This will ensure that renewable energy reaches 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026000000/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2020, the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme and improved efficiencies from innovation and manufacture was expected to allow the MRET to be phased out by 2030.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The target was criticised as unambitious and ineffective in reducing Australia's fossil fuel dependency, as it only applied to generated electricity, but not to the 77% of energy production exported, nor to energy sources which are not used for electricity generation, such as the oil used in transportation. Thus 20% renewable energy in electricity generation would represent less than 2% of total energy production in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themonthly.com.au/renewable-energy-comment-guy-pearse-2988 Guy Pearse: ''Renewable Energy''], in [[The Monthly]], February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer modelling by the [[National Generators Forum]] has signalled the price on greenhouse emissions will need to rise from $20 a tonne in 2010 to $150 a tonne by 2050 if the federal government is to deliver its promised cuts. Generators of Australia's electricity warned of [[Rolling blackout|blackout]]s and power price spikes if the federal government moved too aggressively to put a price on [[greenhouse emissions]].&lt;ref name=power&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23749166-11949,00.html Power producers warn on emission targets] "The Australian" May 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Australia]] achieved its target of 20% of renewable supply by 2014 three years ahead of schedule (i.e. in 2011). In 2008 it set a new target of 33% by 2020.&lt;ref name="renewsa11"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Renewable Energy Plan for South Australia|url= http://www.renewablessa.sa.gov.au/files/111019-renewable-energy-plan-for-south-australia.pdf |work=RenewablesSA |publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=9 March 2013|date=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energymatters.com.au/index.php?main_page=news_article&amp;article_id=566 Renewable Energy News], retrieved 2009-11-02&lt;/ref&gt; New South Wales and Victoria have renewable energy targets of 20%&lt;ref name="mtis"/&gt; and 25%&lt;ref name="vtse"/&gt; respectively by 2020. Tasmania has had 100% renewable energy for a long time.

In 2011 the 'expanded MRET' was split into two schemes: a 41,000 GWh Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) for utility-scale renewable generators, and an uncapped Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme for small household and commercial-scale generators.

The MRET requires wholesale purchasers of electricity (such as electricity retailers or industrial operations) to purchase [[Renewable Energy Certificates Registry|renewable energy certificates]] (RECs), created through the generation of electricity from renewable sources, including wind, hydro, [[landfill gas]] and geothermal, as well as solar PV and solar thermal. The objective is to provide a stimulus and additional revenue for these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026164549/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 January 2011, RECs were split into small-scale technology certificates (STCs) and large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). RECs are still used as a general term covering both STCs and LGCs.

In 2014, the [[Abbott Government]] initiated the Warburton Review and subsequently held negotiations with the Labor Opposition. In June 2015, the 2020 LRET was reduced to 33,000 GWh.&lt;ref&gt;''Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/History-of-the-scheme|title=Renewable Energy Target - History of the scheme |website=www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au|date=30 November 2016|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will result in more than 23.5% of Australia's electricity being derived from renewable sources by 2020. The required gigawatt hours of renewable source electricity from 2017 to 2019 were also adjusted to reflect the new target.&lt;ref name=AnnStmt&gt;[http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/About/Pages/Accountability%20and%20reporting/Administrative%20Reports/The%20Renewable%20Energy%20Target%202015%20Administrative%20Report/Annual-statement.aspx Annual statement—progress towards the 2020 target ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets==
Coal is the most carbon-intensive energy source releasing the highest levels of [[carbon dioxide]] into the atmosphere.

* South Australia, legislated cuts of 60% in greenhouse pollution by 2050 and stabilisation by 2020 were announced.
* Victoria announced legislated cuts in greenhouse pollution of 60% by 2050 based on 2000 levels.
* New South Wales announced legislated cuts in greenhouse pollution of 60% by 2050 and a stabilisation target by 2025.

===Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund (LETDF)===
* $500 million – competitive grants
* $1 billion – private sector funds

Currently has funded six projects to help reduce GHG emissions, which are summarised below

82% of subsidies is concentrated in the Australian Government's 'Clean Coal Technology', with the remaining 18% of funds allocated to the renewable energy 'Project Solar Systems Australia' $75 million.
The LETDF is a new subsidy scheme aimed at fossil fuel energy production started in 2007.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/australia/resources/reports/climate-change/energy-and-transport-subsidies.pdf |format=PDF |title=ENERGY AND TRANSPORT SUBSIDIES IN AUSTRALIA |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724085454/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/australia/resources/reports/climate-change/energy-and-transport-subsidies.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feed-in tariffs==
{{Main|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}
Between 2008 and 2012 most states and territories in Australia implemented various feed-in tariff arrangements to promote uptake of renewable electricity, primarily in the form of rooftop solar PV systems. As system costs fell uptake accelerated rapidly (in conjunction with the assistance provided through the national-level Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)) and these schemes were progressively wound back.

'''Ethel Charlotte Pedley''' (19 June 1859 – 6 August 1898) was an [[Australia]]n [[author]] and musician.
==Early life==
Ethel Charlotte Pedley was born on 19 June 1859 at Acton, near London.&lt;ref name="ANDB"&gt;{{Citation|last=Norst|first=M.|title=Pedley, Ethel Charlotte (1859–1898)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/pedley-ethel-charlotte-8010|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was the daughter of Frederick Pedley and his wife Eliza, née Dolby.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt; Pedley began piano lessons aged 5.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt; Pedley migrated to Australia with her family in the 1870s but returned to London to study at the [[Royal Academy of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article147279781 |title=Miss Ethel C. Pedley. |newspaper=[[Table Talk (magazine)|Table Talk]] |issue=218 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=23 August 1889 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied with her uncle Prosper Sainton, professor of violin, and won a medal.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt; She was also trained by her aunt, the famous contralto [[Charlotte Sainton-Dolby]], at her Vocal Academy.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt;

==Career==
===Musician and music teacher===
Pedley returned to Sydney in 1882, and began teaching singing and the violin.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237215097 |title=MISS PEDLEY'S "AT HOME." |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |issue=2764 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=28 May 1888 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896 Emmeline Woolley and Pedley visited London and persuaded the Associated Board of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and the Royal College of Music to extend their examinations to the Australian colonies.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt; Pedley was appointed the solo representative of the Royal Academy of Music for New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/pedley-ethel-charlotte-8010|title=Obituary - Ethel Charlotte Pedley - Obituaries Australia|website=oa.anu.edu.au|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first examiner visited in 1897.&lt;ref name="ANDB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14139016 |title=DEATH OF MISS PEDLEY. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=18,845 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=8 August 1898 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
[[File:Dot and the Kangaroo, Author Page.jpg|right|thumb|A scan of a first edition copy of ''Dot and the Kangaroo'', which included a photograph of Pedley and a copy of her signature.]]
Pedley's most well-known book is ''[[Dot and the Kangaroo]]'', which featured a little girl named Dot who becomes lost in the [[Australian outback]], and is helped to find her way back home by a friendly [[kangaroo]]. The illustrations were drawn by [[Frank P. Mahony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Pedley, Edith | author2=Mahony, Frank P. (Frank Prout), 1862-1917 | title=Dot and the kangaroo | publication-date=1899 | publisher=Tomas Burleigh | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6580620 | accessdate=19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedley was a believer in the conservation of the Australian [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and usually wrote her books from this perspective, singling out 'man' as disconnected from nature and the rest of the animals.

Ethel's preface to ''Dot and the Kangaroo'' is as follows:

&lt;poem style="font-style:italic"&gt;
::To the children of Australia
::in the hope of enlisting their sympathies
::for the many beautiful, amiable, and frolicsome creatures
::of their fair land,
::whose extinction, through ruthless destruction,
::is being surely accomplished
&lt;/poem&gt;

It is an oil refinery town named after the first oil well. A water well, dug in 1917, can be found on the airport side of town. Today there are over 800 wells within a {{convert|25|km}} radius of the town.&lt;ref name="HamLuckham2007"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Messaoud Water Well.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Historical Hassi Messaoud Well]]
The Name Hassi Messaoud means "the well of Messaoud" in Arabic, named after Messaoud Rouabeh, a well-digger in the region. Before the discovery of oil in the region, Hassi Messaoud was not very populated. After discovering oil in the region in the 1950s the French built two petroleum bases. After the nationalization of oil and gas in the early 70s, the  bases became property of [[Sonatrach]] (the national oil and gas company).

In 1984, and after a new administrative zoning, Hassi Messaoud became a municipality (a local district) with a local assembly. After that date people started populating the town independently. Sonatrach has imported ready-built houses, approximately 2000 units. Now Hassi Messaoud is a town with more than 60,000 inhabitants (non official source), without counting those living in the oil and gas company bases. The town contains several bases for the oil and gas companies, where Algerian and foreign people are working and living. As of 2008, Hassi Messaoud has an oil field with estimated reserves of 8 billion barrels, and the Hassi R ̓Mel gasfield has estimated reserves of 50 trillion cubic feet of gas and 2 billion barrels of crude oil.&lt;ref name="Schlüter2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlüter|first=Thomas|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfvKWpsISTQC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=28 January 2013|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-76373-4|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks against women===
{{main|Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women}}
In 2010 [[Amnesty International]] reported that [[Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women|mob attacks]] against single women accused of being [[prostitute]]s were taking place in Hassi Messaoud.&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women |url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/ |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=August 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903140432/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/ |archivedate=September 3, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International there are reports that "some women have been sexually abused" and were targeted "not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent."&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;

== Climate ==

[[File:UIC dark green - active, light green - associate, brown - affiliate.png|thumb|350px|UIC members {{legend|#008000|active}} {{legend|#00FF00|associated}} {{legend|#804000|affiliated}}]]

The '''UIC''' ({{lang-fr|'''Union Internationale des Chemins de fer'''}}) or '''International Union of Railways''' is an international [[rail transport]] industry body.

== History ==

The railways of Europe originated as many separate concerns, and there were many border changes after [[World War I]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Colonial railways were the responsibility of the mother country. Into this environment the UIC was created on 17 October 1922,&lt;ref&gt;http://uic.org/1922-UIC-a-long-life-organisation&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of standardising industry practices.

Ticket revenue sharing was originally undertaken with the [[UIC Franc]] currency equivalent.  [[UIC classification]] and [[UIC Country Code]]s allowed precise determination of rolling stock capabilities and ownership, with wagons assigned unique [[UIC wagon numbers]].  The 1990s [[GSM-R]] radio telecommunication system is an international [[interoperability]] specification covering voice and signalling systems for railway communications whose specification is maintained by the International Union of Railways project [[ERTMS]].

== Mission ==

The UIC's mission is "to promote rail transport at world level and meet the challenges of mobility and sustainable development."&lt;ref name="UIC website"&gt;[http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article528 UIC Overview] as at 12 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The UIC's main objectives&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; are to:

* Facilitate the sharing of best practices among members (benchmarking)
* Support members in their efforts to develop new business and new areas of activities
* Propose new ways to improve technical and environmental performance
* Promote interoperability, create new world standards for railways (including common standards with other transport modes)
* Develop centres of competence (High Speed, Safety, Security, e-Business, …)

== Members ==

When founded in 1922 the UIC had 51 members from 29 countries, including [[Japan]] and [[China]]. They were soon joined by the [[USSR]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Today, the UIC has 194 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://vademecum.uic.org/en/ VADEMECUM (LIST OF UIC MEMBERS)]&lt;/ref&gt; across 5 continents.&lt;ref name="UIC website"/&gt; Of these there are:
* 73 active members (including from [[Europe]], [[Russia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[South Africa]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Taiwan]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2013/12/18/afghanistan-becomes-uic-member&lt;/ref&gt; and companies operating worldwide such as [[Veolia]] Transport)
* 68 associate members (including from [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Australia]])
* 53 affiliate members (related or ancillary businesses or services)

On 12 November 2010, the UIC opened an African regional office in [[Tunis]] with the support of [[SNCFT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/iru-office-opened-in-tunis/|accessdate=2010-11-27|title=UIC OFFICE FOR AFRICA OPENED IN TUNIS|website=Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard terminology ==

[[File:UIC pallet marking.JPG|thumbnail|UIC mark on an [[EUR-pallet|EPAL]] pallet. EPAL has criticised the UIC for poor quality assurance processes which, according to EPAL, permit [[counterfeit]] or inferior quality pallets to enter the European pallet pool.&lt;ref&gt;EPAL, ''EPAL assumes responsibility for the pallet pool's safety and quality'', 12 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In order to provide a common understanding and reduce potential confusion, the UIC has established standard international railway terminology and a trilingual (English-French-German) thesaurus of terms. The thesaurus was the result of cooperation with the [[European Conference of Ministers of Transport]] (ECMT/{{lang|fr|CEMT}}) and was published in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| title=Transport Thesaurus| year=1995| accessdate=May 20, 2009| publisher=UIC| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606032638/http://www.uic.org/spip.php?article1593| archivedate=6 June 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of railway vehicles ==

The UIC has established systems for the classification of [[UIC identification marking for tractive stock|locomotives]] and their [[UIC classification|axle arrangements]], [[UIC classification of railway coaches|coaches]] and [[UIC classification of goods wagons|goods wagons]].

== Some UIC regulations ==

UIC plays an important role in standardization of railway parts, data and terminology. Therefore, UIC codes (also known as '''UIC leaflet''') are developed since the beginning of UIC's work. A new term for these UIC leaflets is used by UIC for better understanding: '''International Railway Solution''' ('''IRS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magnien|first=Airy|title=UIC e-news|url=http://uic.org/com/uic-e-news/394|publisher=UIC|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[UIC code]]s are:

* [[UIC 568]] The 13-corded standardized connection [[Electrical cable|cable]] with connector is used to transmit data and commands between the [[locomotive]] and the carriages of a [[passenger train]].
* UIC 592-2 Large containers for transport on wagons - Technical conditions to be fulfilled by large containers accepted for use in international traffic. Describes the classes and categories of large containers, handling characteristics,  identification markings, and special conditions applying to large tank containers.
* UIC 592-3 Large containers (CT), swap bodies (CM) and transport frames for horizontal transhipment (CA) - Standard report on acceptance tests.
* UIC 592-4 Swap bodies for grab handling and spreader gripping - Technical conditions. Swap bodies are the removable superstructures of road transport vehicles. Their dimensions and some of their fittings are standardised, particularly  dimensions, strength parameters and securing devices, of the road vehicle, the wagon and transhipment arrangements (grab-handling grooves, lower securing parts and, in special cases, upper securing parts).
* UIC 596-5 Transport of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conveyance of semi-trailers with P coding or N coding on recess wagons. This leaflet sets out regulations and provisions for semi-trailers with normal road transport characteristics for conveyance on fixed-recess carrier wagons. The provisions are valid for semi-trailers, gantry equipment/industrial trucks with grab handles, recess wagon types 1a and 1b in accordance with UIC Leaflet 571-4.
* UIC 596-6 Conveyance of road vehicles on wagons - Technical organisation - Conditions for coding combined-transport load units and combined-transport lines. The leaflet sets out the coding and organisation of loading units in respect of road vehicles on wagons, designed to ensure compatibility of loading units (LU) with the permissible profile for combined transport lines. The provisions aim to facilitate LU identification to speed-up international traffic movements. They are applicable to semi-trailers, swap bodies, roller units loaded on wagons and bogies in combined transport operations.

'''Joris van Spilbergen''' (1568 in [[Antwerp]] &amp;ndash; 1620 in [[Bergen op Zoom]]) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] naval officer.
Joris van Spilbergen was born in Antwerp in 1568.&lt;ref name=is&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;u=http://www.isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joris-van-spilbergen-en-de-zeeslag-bij-arequipa/&amp;prev=search Bakker, Michel. "Joris van Spilbergen and the Battle of Arequipa", ''IsGeschiedenis'', June 4, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

His first major expedition was in 1596, when he sailed to Africa.

He then left for Asia on 5 May 1601, from Veere, a seaport on the island of Walcheren in Zealand, in command of the fleet of the company of [[Balthazar de Moucheron]] (a trading company before the establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]]). His ships were the ''Ram'', ''Schaap'', and ''Lam''.&lt;ref name=Anthonisz&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h2mkUharg6AC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=joris+van+spilbergen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xcmsC0PXpg&amp;sig=v-pb0ivbvWCfILmNykj2rrT9zpY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bmBnVbyAGpKVyAST7IGgBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=joris%20van%20spilbergen&amp;f=false Anthonisz, Richard Gerald.

In 1607, Spilbergen, onboard ''Aeolus'', was with [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] at the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]].

In 1614, he sailed beyond the [[Strait of Magellan]]&lt;ref name=is/&gt; with an expedition of five ships and raided the Spanish settlements on the coast of Mexico and South America. He fought the Spanish at [[Callao]], [[Acapulco]] and [[Navidad, Chile|Navided]].&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;Quanchi, ''Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands'', page 233&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, he captured the pearl fishing ship ''San Francisco'' at Zacatula.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-chO8R-i3PYC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;lpg=PA459&amp;dq=joris+van+spilbergen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CJ3_XALEdL&amp;sig=S746FRlB4G7O2FyachvHsl3vLUY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KZZnVbu7EsGWyASi44P4Bw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=joris%20van%20spilbergen&amp;f=false Myers, Paul A., ''North to California'', Llumina Press, 2004] {{ISBN|9781595262516}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then sailed across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the [[Mariana Islands]], the [[Philippine Islands]] and eventually to [[Ternate]] in the [[Maluku Islands]] in March 1616.&lt;ref name= Quanchi/&gt; He circumnavigated the earth, and returned to the Dutch Republic in 1617.

He died a poor man in [[Bergen op Zoom]] in 1620.

'''Lacus Gaudii''' ([[Latin]] for "Lake of Delight") is a small [[lunar mare]] in the [[Terra Nivium]] region of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;Digital Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Moon, Lunar and Planetary Institute [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/lunar_orbiter/images/aimg/iv_097_h2.jpg Annotated Lunar Orbiter 4 Image 097 h2], based on Bowker and Hughes (NASA SP-206)&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at 16.2° N, 12.6° E and is 113&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.  The land lake borders with [[Lacus Hiemalis]] surrounding a small mountain formation in the middle, also in that location is a larger mountainous formation nearly surrounded by the small plain.  Further south is [[Lacus Lenitatis]] and narrowing bordering to the west is [[Lacus Doloris]].  In that eastern corridor lies next to [[Montes Haemus]] and just about 10&amp;nbsp;km away is [[Mare Serenitatis]], the terrain in between are small mountains.  Southeast of the corridor is the crater [[Daubrée (crater)|Daubrée]] and the more prominent [[Menelaus (crater)|Menelaus]].

West of the lake is the prominent crater [[Manilius (crater)|Manilius]].  Inside the lake is Manilus' satellite crater lettered A in the eastern end and Z located in the middle.

'''Lake Nemi''' ({{lang-it|Lago di Nemi}}, {{lang-la|Nemorensis Lacus}}, also called '''Diana's Mirror''', {{lang-la|Speculum Dianae}}) is a small circular [[volcanic]] lake in the [[Lazio]] region of [[Italy]] {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Rome]], taking its name from [[Nemi]], the largest town in the area, that overlooks it from a height.

==Archaeology and history==
The lake is famous for its [[Nemi ships|sunken Roman ships]].  These ships were very large and technologically advanced for their time.

The lake was sacred to the goddess [[Diana Nemorensis]] and the site of the festival [[Nemoralia]]. Near the sanctuary of Diana were found a number of diminutive bronze statues of draped women and men, each holding [[libation]] bowls and incense boxes. Four of these figures are now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=34993&amp;plaA=34993-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Emperors [[Caligula]] and [[Tiberius]] sailed Lake Nemi not merely to cool off in summer, but to assert themselves as [[Nemorensis]], rulers aligning with the Stars, wedded to Earth's perpetual life-force.

Near the temple of Diana was the [[sacred grove]] of [[Aricia, Italy|Aricia]]. Here there was a priest called the [[Rex Nemorensis]] who would reign until he was killed by a challenger. This practice is described in the opening chapter of [[The Golden Bough]] by [[James George Frazer]].

At the Hotel Diana, on the Western edge of the crater at Via Nemorense, there is a fine exhibit of the archeological excavation of the late 1920s, which exposed the enormous structure which Caligula built.

==The lake in art and literature==
[[Image:John Robert Cozens 002.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[John Robert Cozens]] (c. 1777)]]
* Lake Nemi has been the subject for works by such artists as [[John Robert Cozens]], [[George Inness]], and [[Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes]].  
*[[Muriel Spark]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Takeover (novel)|The Takeover]]'' is set in three fictitious villas overlooking Lake Nemi.
*Lake Nemi inspired the first name of Norwegian comic character [[Nemi (comic strip)|Nemi Montoya]].
*The lake and its surroundings are featured in the game [[Assassin's Creed Brotherhood]] wherein the title character destroys a war machine commissioned by the work's antagonist [[Cesare Borgia]] and invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

B and C have the same apparent distance from the star as seen from [[Earth]].]]

A '''light echo''' is a physical phenomenon caused by [[light]] [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] off surfaces distant from the source, and arriving at the observer with a delay relative to this distance. The phenomenon is analogous to an [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]] of [[sound]], but due to the much faster [[speed of light]], it mostly only manifests itself over astronomical distances.

For example, a light echo is produced when a sudden flash from a [[nova]] is reflected off a [[cosmic dust|cosmic dust cloud]], and arrives at the viewer after a longer duration than it otherwise would have taken with a direct path. Because of their [[geometry|geometries]], light echoes can produce the [[illusion]] of [[superluminal]] speeds.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

[[File:Ellipse Animation Small.gif|right|thumb|The distance traveled from one focus to another, via some point on the ellipse, is the same regardless of the point selected.]]
Light echoes are produced when the initial flash from a rapidly brightening object such as a [[nova]] is reflected off intervening [[interstellar dust]] which may or may not be in the immediate vicinity of the source of the light.  Light from the initial flash arrives at the viewer first, while light reflected from dust or other objects between the source and the viewer begins to arrive shortly afterward.  Because this light has only traveled forward as well as away from the star, it produces the illusion of an echo expanding faster than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name="space"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first illustration above, light following path A is emitted from the original source and arrives at the observer first.  Light which follows path B is reflected off a part of the gas cloud at a point between the source and the observer, and light following path C is reflected off a part of the gas cloud perpendicular to the direct path.  Although light following paths B and C appear to come from the same point in the sky to the observer, B is actually significantly closer.  As a result, the echo of the event in an evenly distributed (spherical) cloud for example will appear to the observer to expand at a rate approaching or faster than the speed of light.

All reflected light rays that originate from the flash and arrive at the Earth together will have traveled the same distance. When the rays of light are reflected, the possible paths between the source and the Earth that arrive at the same time correspond to reflections on an [[ellipsoid]], with the origin of the flash and the Earth as its two foci (see animation to the right). This ellipsoid naturally expands over time.

==Examples==

===V838 Monocerotis===
[[Image:V838 Monocerotis expansion.jpg|right|thumb|Images showing the expansion of the light echo of [[V838 Monocerotis]]. Credit: [[NASA]]/[[ESA]].]]

The variable star [[V838 Monocerotis]] experienced a significant outburst in 2002 as observed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The outburst proved surprising to observers when the object appeared to expand at a rate far exceeding the speed of light as it grew from an apparent visual size of 4 to 7 [[light years]] in a matter of months.&lt;ref name="space"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;

===Supernovae===

Using light echoes, it is sometimes possible to see the faint reflections of historical [[supernova]]e. Astronomers calculate the [[ellipsoid]] which has the [[Earth]] and a [[supernova remnant]] at its [[Focus (geometry)|focal points]] in order to locate clouds of dust and gas at its boundary. Identification can be done using laborious comparisons of photos taken months or years apart, and spotting changes in the light rippling across the interstellar medium. By analyzing the [[Emission spectrum|spectra]] of reflected light, astronomers can discern chemical signatures of supernovae whose light reached Earth long before the invention of the telescope and compare the explosion with its remnants, which may be centuries or millennia old. The first recorded instance of such an echo was in 1936, but it was not studied in detail.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;

An example is supernova [[SN 1987A]], the closest supernova in modern times. Its light echoes have aided in mapping the morphology of the immediate vicinity &lt;ref&gt;

Light echoes have also been used to study the supernova that produced the [[supernova remnant]] [[Cassiopeia A]].&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt; The light from Cassiopeia A would have been visible on Earth around 1660, but went unnoticed, probably because dust obscured the direct view. Reflections from different directions allow astronomers to determine if a supernova was asymmetrical and shone more brightly in some directions than in others. The progenitor of Cassiopeia A has been suspected as being asymmetric,&lt;ref&gt;

Light echoes were used to determine the distance to the [[Cepheid variable]] [[RS Puppis]] to an accuracy of 1%. Pierre Kavella at the [[European Southern Observatory]] described this measurement as so far "the most accurate distance to a Cepheid".&lt;ref&gt;

===Nova Persei 1901===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this study, Couderc published the derivation of echo locations and time delays in the paraboloid, rather than ellipsoid, approximation of infinite distance.&lt;ref name=Couderc1/&gt; However, in his 1961 study, Y.K. Gulak queried Couderc's theories: "It is shown that there is an essential error in the proof according to which Couderc assumed the possibility of expansion of the bright ring (nebula) around [[GK Persei|Nova Persei 1901]] with a velocity exceeding that of light."&lt;ref name=Gulak&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several studies of light and ionisation echoes, it is thought they are likely caused by the 'echo' of a previously-active AGN that has shut down. [[Kevin Schawinski]], a co-founder of the website [[Galaxy Zoo]], stated: "We think that in the recent past the galaxy IC 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar. Because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the Voorwerp, light from that past still lights up the nearby Voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100,000 years, and the galaxy's black hole itself has gone quiet."&lt;ref name=HsV_PhysOrg/&gt; [[Chris Lintott]], also a co-founder of Galaxy Zoo stated: "From the point of view of the Voorwerp, the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off – it's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe."&lt;ref name=HsV_PhysOrg/&gt; The analysis of HsV in turn has led to the study of objects called Voowerpjes and [[Green bean galaxy|Green bean galaxies]].

East Sussex is bordered by [[Kent]] to the north, and [[Surrey]] to the south,&lt;ref name="EastSussexMap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/7C0A3782-EB89-4E92-8E99-17CC34672073/0/map_of_east_sussex_focus.pdf|title=Map of East Sussex|accessdate=2008-04-06|publisher=[[East Sussex County Council]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012063638/http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/7C0A3782-EB89-4E92-8E99-17CC34672073/0/map_of_east_sussex_focus.pdf|archivedate=2007-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an estimated population of 757,600 within an area of {{convert|1795|km2|acre|1|abbr=on}}, therefore making it the [[List of ceremonial counties of England by population|28th largest ceremonial county]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="East Sussex_population"&gt;{{cite web|title=T 08: Selected age groups for local authorities in the United Kingdom; estimated resident population; Mid-2006 Population Estimates|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|date=August 22, 2007|url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9664&amp;More=Y|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008}}, there are 64 sites designated within this [[Area of Search]], 46 of which have been designated for their biological interest, 14 for their geological interest, and 4 for both biological and geological interest.&lt;ref name="SSSIs-in-East-Sussex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Search results for East Sussex|publisher=[[Natural England]]|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1014|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the body responsible for designating SSSIs is [[Natural England]], which selects sites because of their [[plant|flora]], [[fauna]], [[geology|geological]] or physiographical features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |publisher=English Nature |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2008-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the [[Countryside Agency]] and the [[Rural Development Service]].

East Sussex is, from a geological viewpoint, the southern [[anticline]] of the [[Weald]]. The South Downs contain numerous chalk hills, which continue along much of the southern area of the county. East Sussex is home to much [[marshland]] area, with large amounts to the east of [[Beachy Head]].&lt;ref name="TheArgus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hooe circular |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/walks/eastsussex/hooecircular/ |accessdate=2008-06-11 |last=Perkins |first=Ben |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705173123/http://www.theargus.co.uk/whatson/walks/eastsussex/hooecircular/ |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="79142">This is a list of fictional alien species that appeared in various games of the ''[[Star Control]]'' franchise.

==History and reception==
The original ''Star Control'' game featured a melee combat mode where players could engage in combat using a variety of alien ships. However, ''Star Control II'' became critically acclaimed for its innovative storyline where the player must recruit the help of several memorable alien races. All Games praised the storyline based on the fact that "races span a range of emotions", resulting in an overall "rare and praiseworthy design achievement".&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14213&amp;tab=review | author = "Francois Laramee"| title = All Games - Star Control II Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpot considers ''Star Control II'' one of the greatest games of all time, in part because "the 18 different races in Star Control II were all distinctively different, and none of them fit the generic science-fiction stereotypes that have always been so common in games."&lt;ref name = "GameSpot"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-7.html | title = Greatest Games of All Time - Star Control II }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This also earned the game a top 10 ranking for the best game worlds of all time among GameSpot readers, claiming that "the extraterrestrial races you meet ... are what made the gameworld one of your favorites of all time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_readers_worlds/p2_01.html | title = Readers' Choice - The Ten Best Gameworlds }}&lt;/ref&gt; These exterrestrial races were also instrumental in earning the game a rank as one of the top 10 game endings of all time. "The ending sequence was not only highly amusing, it also provided a great deal of closure, since it tied up all of the loose ends for each race.&lt;ref name="gamespotEndings"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_bestending/page8.html | title = The Ten Best Endings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Star Control 3 took the template of races that the series had become known for and expanded upon it. Computer and Video Games felt the game lacked the appeal of its predecessor, but still offered praise for its "brilliant characters".&lt;ref name="CandV"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=3451 | title = Star Control III - Review |publisher= computerandvideogames.com|author= David McCandless|date = 2001-09-13|accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GameSpot, "the creepy critters and droids who inhabit Star Control 3 are its strongest point ..., all of them animatronically controlled renderings, and each with its own distinct personality.&lt;ref name = "gamespotSC3review"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcontrol3/review.html |author = Tim Soete| date = 2006-10-03| title = Star Control 3 - Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameRevolution praised the game for its character design, noting that "the new species vary in their traits and appearances so as to make the players {{sic}} interaction with each species an interesting experience of it's {{sic}} own."&lt;ref name="gamerevolution"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/star-control-3 | title = Star Control 3 - Review| date = 2004-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Androsynth===
The Androsynth are super-intelligent ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' [[cloning|clone]]s. Genetically engineered for intellectual superiority, they were denied equal rights and forced into a life of work. As a result they grew to harbour deep hatred for their imprisoners. They went renegade, escaping Earth in one large movement, having secretly invented [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] travel before the Earthlings. The race found a new home in the [[Vulpecula]] constellation and allied with the [[Ur-Quan]] in their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, hoping to defeat some of their old oppressors.

In the events of Star Control II the human Captain entered the Androsynth home system intent on contacting them, only to find the apparent remains of the Androsynth civilization on the second planet. Not a single Androsynth, dead or alive, was found among the scraps of their buildings and technology. Evidence was found of a recent breakthrough by the Androsynth in the field of interdimensional physics, leading to some cataclysmic event, but the exact nature of the calamity remained a mystery.

The [[Arilou]] suggest the [[Orz (Star Control)|Orz]] did something terrible to them after the Androsynth interdimensional discovery attracted their attention. The Arilou avoid discussing it further, warning that the mere knowledge of it could put all of humanity in danger of suffering the same fate.

===Arilou===
The Arilou (short for Arilou Lalee'lay) are aligned with the Alliance of Free Stars.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; They resemble the [[little green men]] of popular science fiction, and their ships also resemble stereotypical [[UFO|flying saucers]]. The Arilou live outside the galaxy, out of truespace and [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. This little "nook" is called QuasiSpace, and it contains their homeworld ''Falayalaralfali''. Well versed in information gathering and intergalactic or interdimensional travel, they know many races and beings that Earthlings do not. The Arilou would rather keep it that way—they claim that things exist, the mere knowledge of which is dangerous.

The Arilou have had much interaction with Humans throughout mankind's evolution, and hint at a "vested interest" in the Human race. They visit Earth often to "check up" on Humans, although their true motive remains unrevealed. It's likely no coincidence that the Arilou appeared and joined the Alliance of Free Stars the day after the humans entered the war, and abruptly left again the day Earth was slave shielded. They have peaceful relations with the [[Umgah]] race, even after the tricksters joined the [[Ur-Quan]] Hierarchy of Battle Thralls. [[Orz (Star Control)|Orz]] are another dimension-traveling race; however, the Arilou say that is where their similarity ends.

Due to their age and partially due to their time in QuasiSpace, Arilou [[DNA]] is prone to abnormalities and defects, and human DNA can be "spliced in" to alleviate this. Like many of ''Star Control 3''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "revelations", this is generally disregarded as non-[[canon (fiction)|canonical]] by fans of the series,&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Star_Control_3&lt;/ref&gt; although it would explain alien abductions.

===Chenjesu===
The Chenjesu are a [[crystalline]] [[Silicon biochemistry|silicon race]] of aliens who interact with their ships using lightning-like "fingers". The only other known beings of similar composition are the extinct [[Taalo]].

They naturally evolved intelligence, and since they have no natural predators, they are entirely non-aggressive. Their most preferred activity is calm philosophical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Star Control II manual Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chenjesu were the first race humans came in contact with, in 2112 at Ceres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starcontrol.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sc2/sc2_hist2.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212064317/http://starcontrol.classicgaming.gamespy.com/sc2/sc2_hist2.shtml |archivedate=12 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; when they arrived to offer the humans membership in the Alliance of Free Stars to fight the Ur-Quan.

After successfully resisting the Ur-Quan for a long time, the Ur-Quan deployed their precursor battle platform, the [[Sa-Matra]], and destroyed the Chenjesu and [[Mmrnmhrm]] fleets. The two races both chose to be slave shielded on Procyon II and synthesized their races to create a more powerful composite race. This synthesis was powered by solar energy and expected to take 60 years. In Star Control II the human Captain used the Mycon "Sun Device" to supply the energy needed to accelerate the process and create the [[Chmmr]] race.

===Earthling===
{{See also|Human}}
The Earthlings are a member race of the Alliance of Free Stars in ''Star Control'', and the founding race of the New Alliance in ''Star Control II''. They rely on weaponry derived from the 1980s [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI]] projects, such as point-defense lasers and guided nuclear missiles. In the Star Control universe, humanity sealed away the nuclear weapons from the Cold War era in 'Peace Vaults'; when they revealed how much ordnance they had stockpiled, even the more technologically advanced races were in awe of the sheer volume of destructive power.

===Ilwrath===
The Ilwrath resemble large red spiders with four visible (probably [[Compound eyes|compound]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}) eyes on top of their head, large [[mandible]]s where eyes would usually be in humanoids, and below that a mouth. Their mandibles allow them to eat, communicate, and have uses as weapons. Their appendages will regenerate if lost or damaged, often a result of their many rituals of pain. When talking, they sound bloodthirsty and sometimes draw words out, and sometimes inhale when talking about their religious tortures with fondness. In the game, every word they speak is capitalized. Their ship type, the Avenger, is armed with a short-range flamethrower and a [[cloaking device]], making it one of the trickier ships to pilot and to pilot against.

The Ilwrath consider themselves evil, believing their gods would never reward a species that was not evil with their baleful grace. Since evil is sanctioned by their culture, it would be "bad" to do otherwise, and the Ilwrath grow extremely angry when people point this out. The [[Pkunk]] have a theory that the Ilwrath were once so noble, pure and good that they could get no better. Then they paradoxically '''did''' become better which somehow "flipped" them over to being as evil as possible (a programming joke, see [[Signed number representations]]). Religion is the primary factor in Ilwrath society. They worship two gods, Dogar and Kazon; later shown to be part of a particularly despicable Umgah 'practical joke'. They begin their religion at birth, believing that their first frenzied gorging is the hatchlings showing their respect to the gods. During their "Dark Ages", the Ilwrath worshipped many gods from Awk of the Seds (a reference to the Unix tools [[AWK]] and [[sed]]) to Zith of the Pelt.{{Or|date=September 2010}} After a priestly body was formed, the priests announced that only Dogar and Kazon were the true gods and should be worshipped. All heretics were to be eaten, and all possessions were delivered to holy sites or priestly dwellings. The priests controlled the Ilwraths' method of worshipping until the Ilwrath could "Do No Better". In modern times, the Ilwrath believe their gods speak to them through their hyperwave radio.

For eons the Ilwrath lived a subsistence existence ("appendage to mandible"). Thousands of years before the game, the Ilwrath started worshipping Dogar and Kazon. They advanced their technology to create more sophisticated tools for murder. Then, c. 2126, the [[Ur-Quan]] improved their starships and weapons and they joined their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls. During the war, the Ilwrath attacked the Humans, and probably also ate them. When Earth fell to the Ur-Quan, their gods made clear their desire for death by the billions. The Ilwrath transported thousands of portable altars and millions of blood gowns and fillet knives to Earth, but were disappointed when the Ur-Quan commanded that the humans be left alive. After the Alliance of Free Stars fell, they used native animals for their religious ceremonies, until all the lifeforms on their planet were extinct. In c. 2147, the Ilwrath believed that they received guidance to attack the [[Pkunk]], and use them for their ceremonies. Sometime within the 5-year timespan of ''Star Control 2'' from 2155 to 2159 or 2160, depending on events, the player has the opportunity to use a hyperwave caster to impersonate Dogar and Kazon. If the player orders them to stop attacking the Pkunk and seek other prey, the Ilwrath attack the [[Thraddash]].

===Mmrnmhrm===
The '''Mmrnmhrm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɜr|n|əm|h|ɜr|m}} {{respell|MUR|nəm-hurm}}) are a sentient robotic race of unknown origin. They resemble a series of metal discs with a sensor in the top disc, probably acting as "eyes" to the Mmrnmhrm. Where the Mmrnmhrm came from is unknown - their Mother Ark arrived in our region of the galaxy and promptly built a large number of Mmrnmhrm and then shut down. Mmrnmhrm have no reproductive organs and cannot build more of their kind.

They quickly met and befriended the [[Chenjesu]], and they shared the same region of space in peaceful coexistence. When the [[Ur-Quan]] armada appeared they were the core group that formed the Alliance of Free Stars to try and fight back the enslavers. In ''Star Control'', the Mmrnmhrm played the part of sidekicks to the Chenjesu. Plot-wise they had little weight or importance of their own.

The Mmrnmhrm were forced to surrender after the Ur-Quan deployed the Sa-Matra against them and the Chenjesu. The Mmrnmhrm and Chenjesu opted to be slave shielded together on the Chenjesu homeworld at Procyon and joined to become the [[Chmmr]] race.

===Mycon===
The Mycon resemble fungi 0.5 to 3.5 m tall that thrive in hostile, [[volcanic]] environments created for themselves by implanting "Deep Children" (living terraforming devices) under the crust of a blue, life-bearing planet. The outcome is known as a "Shattered World" with significant crust destabilization and rivers of magma on the surface. [[Amphibole]] structures allow them to withstand such extreme environments. [[Star Control 3]] revealed them to be [[terraforming]] tools of the [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursors]], whose programming drifted after their Creators' mysterious disappearance. Mycon reproduce by budding and offspring apparently reach instant maturity. They can genetically modify themselves by thought.

Mycon are hard to understand. Mycon ramblings seldom seem to attach any relevance to what's said to them even when they acknowledge the presence of others. Mycon receive select memories of their forebears at birth and dead Mycon from millennia ago can speak through their descendants, one of the few times a Mycon will refer to itself as ''I''. They are lucid when presented with knowledge of a world ideal for their Deep Children.

A central concept to the race is ''Juffo-Wup'', the hot light in the darkness, which is like a religion for the Mycon. Mycon live for it, and only for it. Juffo-Wup seems to be positive, connected to them or their spread. Related are the ''Non'', what is not Juffo-Wup, and ''Void'', what Non that does not become Juffo-Wup must become Void.  Juffo-Wup seems to refer to the Mycon and anything under their control, Non is other life and planets that the Mycon have not yet violently terraformed to their liking, and Void is anything else, such as space or dust. The Mycon claim that Juffo-Wup recognizes Non that cannot be turned into Void at a certain time. The Ur-Quan are an example of this. Instead, the Mycon will attempt to ally with the Non until such time as they can destroy it, turning it into Void.

Mycon are capable of clearly purposeful action and pursue large-scale objectives. The specific nature of those objectives is not clear; they are the only known race to actively seek out the [[Ur-Quan]] to become willing members of the Hierarchy. The Mycon have existed for over two hundred thousand years, though their Sphere of Influence is only medium-sized.

During the second game, they  fight against the Alliance of Free Stars.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; After the Alliance's collapse they serve as unattended combat thralls of the [[Kzer-Za]], who are otherwise preoccupied, and only concern themselves with the spread of Juffo-Wup. The Mycon spread was responsible for the cataclysmic destruction of the [[Syreen]] homeworld Syra, and the almost total extermination of their race. When the Syreen find out, they trick the Mycon into an ambush and destroy their fleet of Podships.

During the third game, the League can learn the secrets of the Deep Children, which appear to be young Mycon. They appear to be born with their own distinct personalities, but normally the elders catch them and imprint their own personalities into them, transforming their mentality to that of the "elder" Mycon. In effect, they are mentally enslaved by their elders at birth. As with all SC3 changes to the races, this is considered non-canon by the fanbase and the creators of the Star Control universe.

A powerful device, the Plasma Regroover, could be used to undo the Precursor programming of the Mycons, essentially transforming all Kessari quadrant Mycons into Deep Children.

===Shofixti===
The Shofixti are a marsupial-like species that were [[Biological uplift|uplifted]] by the [[Yehat]]. Their culture has a code of honor similar to [[Bushidō]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and their spacecraft are equipped with a powerful self-destruct bomb called a "Glory Device" that makes their otherwise weak Scout a dangerous [[kamikaze]] weapon.

With their friends the [[Yehat]], at the beginning of the [[Ur-Quan]] Slave War they joined the Alliance of Free Stars against the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls. At the end of the war (between ''Star Control I'' and ''II''), after the conquest of the Humans and the withdrawal of the [[Yehat]], the Shofixti caused their own sun to go [[supernova|nova]] with a [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] device to destroy the Ur-Quan invasion fleet. This destroyed their entire species, with the exception of a group of female Shofixti in [[cryogenics|cryogenic suspension]] in Admiral ZEX's zoo and the brothers Tanaka and Katana who continued to patrol their sterile home system. The Shofixti are capable of very rapid breeding, such that it is possible in Star Control II to repopulate the Shofixti race by bringing the survivors of the two genders together, giving a significant increase in manpower to the New Alliance in only a few months.

===Spathi===
Spathi resemble shellfish with large familial units, often numbering in the tens of thousands, with one female parent. They receive only a small amount of attention from their parent, and it is rare to be referred to directly by name. Spathi culture is based almost entirely around cowardice, paranoia and self-preservation. Their cowardice makes them easily bullied into doing things against their will. Dialogue with Spathi contains references to "monsters" and a supposed "Ultimate Evil", which lurks just outside the range of the most sensitive sensors. This rampant neurosis makes them a favorite target for the pranks of the [[Umgah]]. All Spathi technology was developed as a response to fear; they went from stone age technology to primitive nuclear-powered rockets in under a century, purely to get off their planet to escape predators that suddenly appeared on their homeworld. (These predators were introduced into their environment by the Umgah, of course.) They resided for a time on Spathiwa's moon because they feared these "Evil Ones". Spathi will fight if they cannot run away or if their allies are scarier than their enemies and force them to. Their ship design reflects their personalities; the Eluder is extremely fast, packs in a huge crew (to reduce any individual crewman's chance of dying in combat) and has its most powerful weapon mounted on the rear so it can be fired while running away.

The Spathi were defeated by the [[Ur-Quan]] before the first war erupted. They were offered the usual terms of slavery: become Battle Thralls or be forever encased beneath an impenetrable shield. The Spathi were ecstatic at the prospect of a life of safety beneath a permanent shield, however, due to the [[Umgah]] delivering their response deciding to play a joke and swapping the white (fallow slave) baton with the black, they accidentally became battle thralls and were forced to fight against the Alliance of Free Stars.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; After the first war concluded, the Spathi and [[Ilwrath]] were stationed on Earth's moon to ensure that the defeated humans did not try to break the conditions of their surrender. Shortly after, the Ilwrath left and the Spathi began to "strategically redeploy" themselves farther and farther from Earth. At the time of ''Star Control II'', they are stationed on Pluto, leaving a few bio-droids on Earth's moon to make it look like they were still there. After the player clears the "Evil Ones" from Spathiwa for them, the Spathi briefly join the New Alliance, but after studying the shield around Earth, they abruptly left the Alliance to encase themselves in an Ur-Quan slave shield.

===Syreen===
The Syreen are a melange of "green-skinned space babe" clichés, full of [[double entendre]]s and a [[phallic]] starship, the Penetrator. The Syreen are biologically compatible with humans. This is an acknowledged evolutionary impossibility (two life forms never evolve in exactly the same way in separate biosystems) and would have been examined had the races not been engaged in a fight for their lives when they met. Their name is a reference to the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] in Greek mythology, whose enchanting song brought sailors dangerously close to nearby cliffs, where they would crash on the rocks and drown. Syreen look like blue-skinned humans with slightly [[luminescence|luminescent]] eyes and "certain parts".

The Syreen evolved on the lush world of Syra, which was Earth's near twin, though warmer and somewhat more hospitable. It hosted a peaceful utopia in harmony with nature from agrarian tribes to the first steps of interstellar exploration, until a stray asteroid smashed into the world and penetrated into the mantle. A year later, a series of [[supervolcano]]es and [[fissure vent|fissure]]s erupted planetwide, incinerated Syra's continents, poisoned its atmosphere, and shattered the crust. The largely female Space Patrol was the only faction off-planet, leaving the race with under 10000 members, 500 male. They added stardrives to anything that could be made to hold air and set out to the stars. Several decades later, the sublight Habitat fleet found itself in the middle of the Alliance-Hierarchy war and joined the Alliance out of necessity, being unable to defend itself. When the Alliance fell, the Syreen chose imprisonment on their world over thralldom as their slavery. Since the Syreen had none, the [[Kzer-Za|Ur-Quan]] gave them the terran planet of Gaia in the [[Betelgeuse]] system as the closest equivalent. When the human Captain asks for Syreen aid against the Ur-Quan in Star Control II they are initially reluctant to risk losing their new home, but when the "asteroid" that destroyed Syra is revealed to be a Mycon Deep Child terraformer, the Syreen join the Captain in return for revenge against the Mycon. They retrieved their starships, destroyed the Mycon fleet and joined the New Alliance against the Ur-Quan.

Talana, clad in a near-exact replica of [[Princess Leia|Princess Leia's]] slave girl outfit, is the commander of the Ur-Quan resupply starbase orbiting Gaia at the time of ''Star Control II''. The player delivers to her proof of the Mycon's culpability and has the ability to engage in heavily implied sexual relations. The two go on to have children.

Developer Paul Reiche III addressed the Syreen in a questions-and-answers session in 2007, describing the Syreen song's strength as a "glass of white wine" in comparison to the Dnyarri compulsion being "intravenous lab alcohol" plus a "horse tranquilizer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uqm.stack.nl/files/chat/tfbchat-20070613-clean |title=Log of the 2007-06-13 IRC session with Toys for Bob |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same session, he stated that the Syreen are supposed to always be "sexy and strong", criticising their graphic design in [[Star Control 3|the sequel]] as "spooky and unpleasant".

===Umgah===
The Umgah were the second race in the quadrant (after the Thraddash) to be defeated by the [[Ur-Quan]] and to join their Hierarchy of Battle Thralls. The Umgah are large, pink or lilac-colored blobs, with several mouths, eyes, and tentacles at seemingly random positions in their bodies. All Umgah are born with [[agoraphobia]], and prefer biotic environments in their ships. They are immensely skilled at bioengineering and often add or remove limbs and organs from themselves for fun.

Umgah discussion is full of jokes, and their sense of humor is renowned (or, more accurately, feared) throughout the galaxy. Umgah "jokes" include using a HyperWave caster to send messages to other civilizations, claiming to be the Ilwrath Gods or the Spathi "Grand Master Planet Eater", and changing the Spathi response to the Ur-Quan surrender terms. Their pranks have resulted in several thousand Spathi dead of acute anxiety, a six-year holy war by the Ilwrath against the Pkunk, and the Spathi coerced in to serving as Battle Thralls instead of fallow slaves as they desired.

When the [[Arilou]] discovered a living Talking Pet, they took it to the Umgah for medical treatment. The Umgah were able to restore it to health, but their genetic alterations restored the full psychic potential of the creature, a [[Dnyarri]], and led to the entire Umgah race being psychically dominated. The Captain later freed the Umgah from the Dynarri's control.

===Ur-Quan Kzer-Za===
The Ur-Quan Kzer-Za (referred to simply as Ur-Quan until the appearance of the Kohr-Ah in StarCon II) are the main villains of the series.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; They were originally large brown [[centipede]]-like creatures who evolved from solitary hunters on their harsh home planet. While they were still using crude atomic vehicles to explore their system, the Ur-Quan encountered the [[Taalo]]. The fiercely territorial Ur-Quan attacked them, but the patient Taalo eventually won the Ur-Quan's friendship—the only race to ever do so. The Taalo convinced the Ur-Quan to join the Sentient Milieu, a cooperative of alien races. Due to their solitary nature, the Ur-Quan were frequently used as scouts and explorers and were active in finding [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] artifacts.

After many centuries in the Milieu an Ur-Quan scout mission discovered the [[Dnyarri]], who quickly enslaved or destroyed the entire Milieu. The Dnyarri genetically experimented on the Brown Ur-Quan and separated them into two sub-species: the Green Ur-Quan, to be scientists and technicians and the Black Ur-Quan for basic soldiers and laborers. (No further mention is made of Brown Ur-Quan.) After many centuries of mindless enslavement, and at great cost, the Ur-Quan managed to free themselves and defeat the Dnyarri.

The two sub-species of the Ur-Quan developed doctrines to ensure they would not be slaves again. The green Ur-Quan, renamed the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za in honor of the scientist who freed them, devised the "Path of Now and Forever", which states that all non-Ur-Quan sentient life be enslaved to the Ur-Quan as battle thralls, or forever be imprisoned on their planets under impenetrable force-fields. The Black Ur-Quan, renamed the Ur-Quan [[Kohr-Ah]] after their new leader, felt that only their "Eternal Doctrine", the annihilation of non-Ur-Quan life, would keep them safe from slavery. This led to a war between the Kohr-Ah and the Kzer-Za known as The Doctrinal Conflict, which devastated both sides. The Kzer-Za eventually triumphed through the discovery of an enormous [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] battle platform named the [[Sa-Matra]] or 'Great Trophy'. Defeated, the Kohr-Ah were sent in the opposite direction of the galaxy as the Kzer-Za, with the understanding that when the two species met again, they would fight The Doctrinal Conflict once more, with the victor claiming the Sa-Matra.

===VUX===
The VUX are green, tentacled creatures with a long snout and one visible eye. They are noted for their fiendishly extreme dislike of humans (with the exception of Admiral ZEX, a sexual deviant who is attracted to humans), and will be more than happy to engage in combat whenever the revolting visage of a human appears on their communication screens. They are referred to in all capital letters by nearly every other alien race in the game, including themselves, and their captains also capitalize their three-letter names as well. This has caused the humans to joke that VUX stands for Very Ugly Xenoform.

The first encounter between humans and VUX was between Captain Rand and an unknown VUX captain. Upon seeing the new alien species for the first time, Rand burst out with the first thing that came to mind, which happened to be a comment about how disgustingly ugly the alien was. Rand was unaware that the VUX translating technology was so far advanced that his words were relayed to the VUX captain perfectly. This botched first encounter between the two races soured relations long enough for the Ur-Quan [[Kzer-Za]] to subjugate the VUX who chose to become battle thralls. The VUX then eagerly fight against the humans.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; In ''Star Control II'' it is revealed that the VUX's reason for not joining the Alliance was due to their own extreme disgust with the appearance of humans.  Captain Rand's overheard comment had been merely a scapegoat, for they find humans far more disgusting than humans find them.

In Star Control 3, they are revealed to be "half" of the Vyro-Ingo race, and can be reunited in the course of the storyline. As with all SC3 changes to the races, this is considered non-canon by the fanbase and the creators of the Star Control universe.

===Yehat===
{{redirect|Yehat|the fictional Indian tribe called Yeehat|Call of the Wild}}
The Yehat are fearsome and honorable [[pterodactyl]]-like creatures who were allied with the Alliance of Free Stars in ''Star Control''. For some reason they speak with a notable [[Scottish English|Scottish accent]] when their language is translated to English. The Yehat are ruled over by a Queen, who rules over the various Yehat clans. Historically, this has been one from the Veep-Neep Clan. The Yehat are very close allies with the [[Shofixti]].

In ''Star Control I'' the Yehat are the backbone of the Alliance Starfleet, due to their advanced weapons technology and their intensely martial society.&lt;ref&gt;Star Control II manual page 63&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of the Veep-Neep Queen is based on the Yehat never being defeated under a Veep-Neep, so to save face, the Queen orders them to defect to the Ur-Quan side late in the war. This is a source of great shame to many Yehat, compounded when their friends the Shofixti chose to annihilate their species in a blaze of glory rather than surrender.

As such, at the beginning of ''Star Control II'', the Yehat are Ur-Quan battle thralls, and while sympathetic to the human Captain they will not give any aid. Once the Captain brings them evidence that their adopted children, the Shofixti, are still alive, it triggers a civil war among the Yehat. Eventually the rebels win and the Veep-Neep Queen is deposed and the Yehat join the New Alliance.

The [[Pkunk]] are an offshoot of the Yehat race. In ''Star Control II'' they decide to reunite with their Yehat brethren, despite the fact that the Yehat despise them. The human Captain tries to dissuade them, but eventually the Pkunk make contact with the Yehat and the Yehat seemingly destroy them. In the final battle against the Sa-Matra, a combined Pkunk and Yehat fleet arrives to reinforce the Captain, and they reveal that after much perseverance the Pkunk persuaded the Yehat to accept them after all, and the Yehat even chose a Pkunk Queen as the replacement for their deposed Veep-Neep queen.

==Introduced in ''Star Control II''==
''Star Control II'' introduced eleven playable races: Chmmr, Druuge, Melnorme, Orz, Pkunk, Slylandro, Supox, Thraddash, Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah, Utwig, and Zoq-Fot-Pik.

===Chmmr===
The Chmmr (pronounced ''ch'mer'' with 'ch' as in "chance") are a fusion of the crystalline [[Chenjesu]] and the mechanical [[Mmrnmhrm]]. The species was formed in ''Star Control II'', when the player uses the Sun Device to speed up the fusion process, which would have normally taken several decades. They ally with humans &lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; and are needed to complete the game and destroy the Sa-Matra.

It's unclear whether the Chmmr race is what the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm intended to become, or an unintended consequence of the Captain's interference in the synthesis process. They have assumed the Chenjesu's old position as the unofficial leaders of the New Alliance.

The appearance of the Chmmr was changed slightly in ''Star Control 3''. They are still a mixture of mechanical and crystalline objects, but the bond appears to be less complete, and they float. The interior of the structure shines moving lights through the crystals depending on the mood of the Chmmr. In Star Control 3 the Chmmr are separated into Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm by a Daktaklakpak device, but the player again joins the two races using another sun device.

===Dnyarri===
The Dnyarri are a race of small brown toad-like creatures, physically weak but with an extremely powerful ability to mentally enslave other sentients. An Ur-Quan scout mission discovered the Dnyarri and was forced to bring thousands of Dnyarri to the heart of the Sentient Milieu. The Dnyarri used their psychic powers to dominate the minds of the Milieu races, conquering the entire Milieu in record time. The [[Taalo]] were immune, so the Dnyarri compelled the other races of the Milieu to annihilate them. The Ur-Quan were the favored slaves of the Dnyarri, and the most susceptible to their psychic powers. The Dnyarri began to genetically experiment and separated the Brown Ur-Quan into two sub-species: the Green Ur-Quan were scientists and administrators and the Black Ur-Quan were basic soldiers and laborers. As far as anyone knows, the original Brown Ur-Quan became extinct.

Over thousands of years, the Dnyarri eventually became lax in their mental domination. A green Ur-Quan scientist named Kzer-Za noticed that the Dnyarri "detached" psychic control from an Ur-Quan suffering near-lethal pain. Using one of the few moments of mental freedom the Dnyarri gave their slaves, he injected his body with a lethal and painful poison, and used the mental freedom to broadcast the news across the empire. Ur-Quan slaves everywhere began burning themselves and hacking their own bodies to give them the freedom needed to kill the nearest Dnyarri. This was refined into a brain implant known as an Excruciator which constantly causes the user to feel extreme pain, making them unbearable for Dnyarri to control, but leaving the Ur-Quan's body whole and functional.

Now free, the Ur-Quan decided that extinction was too good for the Dnyarri. Instead the Dnyarri were genetically modified into sub-sentient "Talking Pets", retaining psychic powers only to allow translation and communication with alien species, something the Ur-Quan now considered demeaning.

[[Star Control II]] players have a chance to interact with a Dnyarri. An Ur-Quan wreck was discovered by the Arilou, which included a wounded Talking Pet that the Arilou gave to the Umgah, who possessed better biological and medicinal technologies. The Umgah saved the creature, but accidentally unlocked the Talking Pet's latent powers; the Dnyarri put his psychic powers to use and took over the Umgah home planet. If the player forces the Dnyarri to reveal itself without adequate protection, the Dnyarri will compel the player to fly into the middle of the Ur-Quan civil war battlefield to await death at the hands of his enemies. The player must find a Taalo mind shield, which provides near-immunity to the Dnyarri to allow the player to defeat it and free the Umgah. Once captured, the Dnyarri proves essential in the attack on the Sa-Matra by creating an illusionary diversion, distracting the Ur-Quan defense fleet and allowing the player to attack the Sa-Matra with minimal defenses. While the Dnyarri will tell his story, and the story of his race, the Taalo shield is not perfect; if the Dnyarri grows impatient or angry, he can still exert enough psychic control to force the player to stop asking questions, which hints at the malicious nature of the Dnyarri. The Dnyarri was "accidentally" left in the hold of the Captain's flagship, which was sacrificed to destroy the Sa-Matra, while the Captain and his crew ejected in an escape pod.  The game's credit sequence reveals that the Dnyarri managed to get away from the ship at the last second.

===Druuge===
The Druuge are a race of horned, pig-like aliens that are notorious for their insatiable greed and callous treatment of other races. Their planet and the entirety of its resources are owned by the Crimson Corporation, of which every Druuge is a member and shareholder. They believe that the purpose of every individual Druuge is to serve the corporation; those who relinquish their membership  are convicted of stealing corporate air, and are instantly sentenced to death. Anyone who threatens the group's profit margin due to illness, debt, or old age is thrown into the furnaces. The Druuge justify their actions with conveniently convoluted legal and ethical systems. For example, they hold unarmed travelers in their territory responsible for encouraging piracy, as their vulnerable ships are likely to attract belligerent plunderers. Therefore, in order to prevent piracy, any Druuge vessel may attack and plunder such ships and penalize their crews with indefinite slavery. Their ships consume crew to fuel the engines, and the player can pay for items and resources by selling crew members. This has an increasingly negative effect back home if done. There is always a better way to get the Druuge's few important items. The Druuge's unscrupulous personality was inspired by Paul Reiche's negotiations with [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and [[Electronic Arts]].&lt;ref name="chat" &gt;[http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/IRC_chats_with_Toys_For_Bob #StarControl IRC chat - 10-18-1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melnorme===
The Melnorme are a race of merchants, primarily in the business of buying and selling information. The name is a reference to [[Mel Tormé]], the singer.&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; They provide history, current events, fuel, and technology in return for biological data and the locations of certain colorful worlds assembled (or found) by the [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursors]] known as Rainbow Worlds. They use large ''Trader'' vessels to seek out, contact, and strike deals with potential customers. Though in possession of a great deal of information and technology, the Melnorme come across as benign and harmless. While trading with them is not required to complete ''Star Control II'', abstaining from it makes the game vastly harder to finish.

The Melnorme are highly secretive of themselves and their origins, but their similarities have led many to believe that the Melnorme are the descendants of the Mael-Num. This link was later confirmed outside of the game by the game designers.&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt; While they are technically ready to divulge such information, the prices are ludicrous. To learn why their bridge turns purple, for instance, costs more credits than the player can possess in the game. They based their culture entirely on equivalent trade and reject the concept of charity, finding it highly offensive. Though the Melnorme are by definition mercantile, they deal fairly with the protagonist and sell trustworthy information. They place a great emphasis on colour, to the point of basing their own names on different shades, such as Trade Master Greenish of the starship ''Inevitably Successful in All Circumstances''.

===Orz===
The Orz are fish-like creatures that live in what used to be [[Androsynth]] space. They are yellow and roughly spherical, with a stub too small to be a tail, two eyes on stalks, a large set of [[gills]], four tentacles, and a [[beak]]. Their ships are filled with liquid ethanol, and they appear to be somewhat similar to [[parrotfish]]. The Orz language is excessively unorthodox, and translation computers in the game are not particularly good at deciphering it. With effort from the player at least some degree of understanding can be gained. They can join an alliance with the humans.&lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; This race has been described by reviewer Francois Laramee as "disturbingly scary".&lt;ref name="allgame"/&gt;

The [[Arilou]] imply that the Orz are manifestations of a single extra-dimensional being; even the Orz refer to themselves as 'fingers'. In essence, all Orz are the same creature. This was confirmed by the game's developers, [[Fred Ford (programmer)|Fred Ford]] and [[Paul Reiche III]], in a chat on [[EFnet]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;This excerpt is a reply of one of the game's developers from a [http://starcontrol.classicgaming.gamespy.com/history/files/scchatlog.txt chat log] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919010347/http://starcontrol.classicgaming.gamespy.com/history/files/scchatlog.txt |date=19 September 2008 }}: "&lt;Fwiffo&gt; In regards to the Androsynth: They were snagged by the entity who/which projected its fingers into our dimension (which looked to us as the Orz.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Star Control II'', the Orz seemed to have displaced the [[Androsynth]], who were apparently conducting experiments with other dimensions. This made them visible to the Orz. As a result, the Androsynth disappeared, leaving their cities behind in ruins. The Orz are very sensitive about the Androsynth, and will fight when pressured to tell about their fate. According to the Arilou, even knowing too much about other dimensions makes one vulnerable to extra-dimensional dangers, such as the Orz, and the Arilou suggest that this is what happened to the Androsynth.

This ominous pattern continues in ''Star Control 3'', in which the Orz destroy the Supox, for reasons that are not entirely clear. Later on, the Orz betray their alliances to the League and attack the player.  Since the Orz of ''Star Control 3'' followed the trends set in the game before, it could be argued that the Orz were the race most faithfully carried over into ''Star Control 3'', which was otherwise widely derided {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}for continuity problems and ham-handed [[retconning]].

===Pkunk===
The Pkunk are a race of bird-like offshoots of the [[Yehat]]. They ally with the protagonist in ''Star Control II'' &lt;ref name="CandV"/&gt; as soon as he meets them. They resemble a stereotypical phony psychic,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} consistently agreeing with anything mystical the player says and basing all their decisions on universal harmony and similar grand-sounding concepts. However, the Pkunk really are powerful psychics who provide hints to the player, even going so far as actual [[clairvoyance]]. The Pkunk believe that their psychotic and genocidal neighbors, the Ilwrath, were perfect beings in their past lives, and that the karmic consequence of their excessive goodness was their totally evil reincarnation. To avoid such a fate, the Pkunk strive to remain just short of perfection. They accomplish this by being slightly annoying to whoever they encounter. When flying their ships in battle, they constantly taunt and insult their opponents, a  practice that powers their ships. They state that, as they are so inherently happy and carefree, they must work themselves up by screaming insults. Fitting with their emphasis on past lives and mysticism, destroyed Pkunk ships can be supernaturally reborn, suddenly rejoining the battle with all their energy restored and crew revived.

===Slylandro===
The Slylandro are a race of ancient and friendly gas bag people that inhabit a [[gas giant]] planet in star system Beta Corvi they call Source. The Slylandro are restricted to a narrow band on their surfaceless world. Below their inhabited area are "the Depths", which grow darker and more hostile as one ventures deeper. When a Slylandro sinks deep enough into the depths, their gas bag is almost ruptured by the pressure, causing scarring to occur which is believed to attract potential mates. Above is "the Void", which when ventured into, causes a Slylandro to "grow giddy and behave inappropriately". The Slylandro see on a [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum band]] where they are opaque to each other and are very shy about humans seeing their "glowy bits" (their [[reproductive organs]]).

The Slylandro have no technology and no means of building any. Attempts to construct any but the simplest of tools or devices have resulted in them becoming too heavy and dragging their inventor to the Depths. As a result, the Slylandro play very little part in the greater scheme of things and have been discovered and rediscovered by several subsequent civilizations. Due to Source's low-[[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] environment and the Slylandro's inability to venture off-planet, they have become intensely curious about other worlds and races.

Since the Slylandro have no methods of physically recording history, long chants of past events have to be memorized in order to preserve the past. The standard measurement of time for the Slylandro is the Drahn, which is equal to 4 million rotations of the planet, or about 6460 Earth years. Their long life-spans and equally long memories mean that they are surprisingly knowledgeable about ancient galactic history. They even have records of contact with the Precursors.

Shortly before the start of Star Control II the Slylandro trade information about their unique physiology with the Melnorme for an automated self-replicating probe, designed to seek out and contact alien civilisations for them. Unfortunately, due to a programming error by the Slylandro, the probe considers everything, including alien spacecraft, as replication material and begins to attack and devour anything it meets to create copies of itself that go on to do the same. The player in Star Control II, upon explaining this to the Slylandro, is given a self-destruct code for the probes that allows him to greatly reduce the threat.

===Supox===
The Supox Utricularia are allies of the [[Utwig]]. They are a race of kind, sentient plant creatures who evolved from a species of semi-mobile symbionts.&lt;ref name="stratbook"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Ford |first=Fred |author2=Reiche III, Paul |others=Illus. George Barr, Jeff Rianda |title=Star Control II Role Playing Resource Guide |publisher=Accolade |pages=31, 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Can we get a confirmation of the year? It's laid out much like the SC2 manual (1992), but gives a WWW adress (updated version?). It was printed, but is not sold. --&gt; In the setting, the evolutionary path of sentient plants is considered an established scientific impossibility, one that Supox science has verified. Many Supox attribute the incongruity of their existence to the favor of "Higher Powers."&lt;ref name="stratbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''The Captain''': "C'mon, plants can't be intelligent! Our top scientists and science fiction writers have proved it!"  '''Ala-la'la''': "Yes. This has been confirmed by our people as well. Strange, is it not? Many of our people regard this inconsistency as proof of our divine origin." {{cite video game|title=Star Control 2 |developer=[[Toys for Bob]] |publisher=[[Accolade]] |date = November 1992|platform=PC
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supox have always been symbionts. During their long evolutionary path they forged symbiotic relationships with several races of plants and animals on their homeworld, trading "reproductive assistance" for nutrients. The Supox look to the Utwig for guidance, and use the Utwig culture as a model for their own. In return, they give the Utwig the emotional support they need.&lt;ref&gt;'''Ala-la'la''': "Oh yes, we have a strong cultural bond with the Utwig. They have been the foundation around which we have grown our starfaring culture." {{cite video game|title=Star Control 2 |developer=[[Toys for Bob]] |publisher=[[Accolade]] |date = November 1992|platform=PC
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Star Control II the Supox give the Captain the Utwig Ultron, hoping that he can repair it. Beyond that they mainly play a support role to the Utwig.  In ''Star Control 3'' they are part of the expedition but their colony ships are destroyed, with the [[Orz (Star Control)|Orz]] implicated, and hence play no active part in the game.

===Thraddash===
The Thraddash are a noisy and extremely aggressive race of rhinoceros-like aliens. They constantly bluster and boast while interacting with the protagonist, providing a thin facade over the actual inadequacy of their military and its primitive technology. This backwardness, the result of their tendency to repeatedly bring themselves to the brink of cultural annihilation by constantly nuking each other, does not deter them from throwing their outdated forces into battle at the slightest provocation.

The Thraddash have had 18 different planetary cultures. Each time their culture reached a certain point a new ideology for a more perfect culture arrived, and they fought a bitter war and started a new culture from scratch. The earliest Culture mentioned by the Thraddash is Culture Two, which glorified fortitude and stoic resistance to pain. The most important artifact common to all Thraddash cultures is the Aqua Helix. Culture Nine was the only culture to question its significance. Culture Nine considered excessive the amount of blood and passion expended over the artifact. Unfortunately, their complete defeat at the hands of Culture Ten after only two weeks of dominance only reinforced the Thraddash belief in the sanctity of the Aqua Helix.

Culture Fourteen is the second Culture to question traditional Thraddash values. Shortly after achieving dominance, Culture Fourteen claimed that the Thraddash method of cultural evolution was wrong. They claimed that every inter-Culture conflict set the Thraddash back 500 years. As with Culture Nine, Thraddash tradition again proved itself immune to change as Culture Fourteen was destroyed by Culture Fifteen after a reign of only ten years. The violence ensuing from Culture Fourteen's replacement only set the Thraddash back by "two, three hundred years tops", hence disproving Culture Fourteen's main tenet.

Culture Eighteen was the dominant Thraddash culture when the [[Kzer-Za|Ur-Quan]] invaded. Their swift defeat by the Ur-Quan put their superiority into question, and an attempt for a resolution was made by the means of a thermonuclear exchange. The Ur-Quan in orbit around the Thraddash homeworld did not allow such intra-species fighting, and intercepted all of the warheads with their fighter vessels. The Ur-Quan's intervention, however, only postponed the inevitable. Shortly after the failed thermonuclear weapon exchange, Culture Eighteen's challengers introduced a super-lethal poison into the air and water, ending the reign of Culture Eighteen.

After the poisoning of Culture Eighteen, the Ur-Quan executed all of the emerging Culture's leaders, and arbitrarily assigned leaders. The Ur-Quan explained that any further violations of the Slave Laws would be punished by the eradication of the Thraddash species. Culture Nineteen elected to become Battle Thralls upon being enslaved by the Ur-Quan. As such, they expected to be part of the Ur-Quan's offensive in the quadrant. Their relative military weakness, however, as well as their predisposition to pick fights with other slave races, especially the [[Umgah]] and [[Ilwrath]], made the Ur-Quan decide that they would be more of a liability than an asset in the coming battles, and ordered them to "guard the flank." The modern Thraddash have improved their Torch ships with an effective Reeunk Afterburner (named posthumously after its creator, who blew himself up discovering it), and are itching to prove their worth to the Ur-Quan.

===Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah===
The Kohr-Ah are a subspecies of the [[#Ur-Quan Kzer-Za|Ur-Quan]]. After freeing themselves from the Dnyarri, the Kohr-Ah decided to adopt the "Eternal Doctrine," which is a plan to protect the Ur-Quan from enslavement ever again by exterminating all non-Ur-Quan sentients in the galaxy. The Kohr-Ah are physically similar to the Kzer-Za except their skin is black and their eyes are a deep red. They are led by a matriarch called the Kohr-Ah Primat.

The Kohr-Ah were not present in Earth's part of the galaxy during the first Alliance-Hierarchy war in ''Star Control I''. ''Star Control II'' takes place during the Second Doctrinal Conflict between the Kzer-Za and Kohr-Ah Ur-Quan, after which the Kohr-Ah will kill all sentient life if victorious. The Kohr-Ah carry out the words of their doctrine to ensure their freedom and security, and to a lesser degree, they believe they are doing those they cleanse a service: the opportunity to be reincarnated as an Ur-Quan, the superior race. Perhaps as a result of this dispassionate view, neither the Kohr-Ah nor the Kzer-Za will insult or lie to their adversaries.

===Utwig===
The Utwig are a race of fatalist and sophisticated humanoids; they are mentors to the [[Supox]] and the keepers of the Ultron device, which they believe provides happiness and enlightenment. Utwig are required to wear masks for as long as they live. They have developed "Mask-Etiquette" for the thousands of masks they wear. Each is suitable for different activities, moods, festivals, and ceremonies. This custom was born in their ancient violent past, when they came to the conclusion that the expression of primal emotions upon faces was the source of war and violence. Therefore faces must be hidden in order for a culture to progress peacefully. The accidental destruction of the Ultron sent the entire species into a state of depression and resulted in the destruction of all masks except the Mask of Ultimate Embarrassment and Shame. Its subsequent reconstruction was more than enough to pull the previously unaffiliated Utwig and Supox into the war against the [[Ur-Quan]]. The Utwig has been described as "comic" by reviewer Francois Laramee.&lt;ref name="allgame"/&gt;

===Zoq-Fot-Pik===
The Zoq, Fot, Pik and Zebranky species all evolved on the same planet. The Zoq, Fot and Pik were non-carnivorous, but the Zebranky preyed on them. The Zoq, Fot and Pik races banded together, annihilated the Zebranky, and formed a cooperative union. They integrated so well that they no longer recall which of the races are Zoq, which are Fot, and which are Pik.  Afterwards, they faced a dilemma: whether to develop technological and cultural sophistication, or to return to the forests and relax. They chose the latter.

For another fifty thousand years, the Zoq, the Fot and the Pik relaxed in the forests, until one day one of each race was walking up a steep path looking for something to eat, when a bolt of lightning struck nearby. The bolt of energy carved a wheel-shaped chunk of granite out of a cliff. As the rock began to roll down the hill, some dry grass got caught in its hole, and since the rock was still hot the grass caught on fire. Thus the Zoq, Fot, and Pik simultaneously discovered the wheel, fire, and religion. The wheel and fire were based on the rock, and religion developed when the Zoq was killed by the rolling rock and the remaining two decided that he had simply gone to "a better place".

The three species are said to feed on airborne zooplankton, solar and ambient energies, and rocky fungal clingers. It is never said exactly which species feeds on what, but there are some clues – the one on the right of the communication screenshot is shown blowing air out the three holes on its head, and the one on the left exclaims "our favorite" when speaking of rock clingers. Also, the green one on the left seems to be a botanical species, from her appearance, and, at one point, threatens to "blow a cloud of spores" in the face of the blue one, so she seems to absorb the sunlight. The function of the arm-like appendages on the leftmost creature are unknown, but possibly includes communication since they move when the creature "talks".  Very little is known about the one-eyed creature in the center as neither of the other two mentions anything about it except that it never talks.

A [[Satire|satiric]] take on bad [[spectator sports]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Frungy is a wildly popular sport among the Zoq-Fot-Pik. No details about the rules or concept are disclosed, although the Zoq-Fot-Pik (or at least the one on the right) are ''very'' glad to comment on how great, fun and interesting it is, making numerous references to Frungy throughout the game.  Frungy, like most spectator sports, appears to have a governing organization. When beginning a new playthrough of The Ur-Quan Masters, a splash screen noting sponsorship by the Interstellar Frungy League is shown.

The Zoq-Fot-Pik are one of the first races encountered by the human captain in ''Star Control II'', when the captain meets a scout ship near Rigel that gives him the co-ordinates of their homeworld hidden on the edge of the Ur-Quan conflict zone. The Zoq-Fot-Pik ally with the humans in return for protection from the Ur-Quan should they find them. While their material assistance is not great, their position makes them a valuable source of intelligence on the Ur-Quan and the progress of their war.

&lt;div id="Algolites"&gt;
;Algolites:No information.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Burvixese"&gt;
;Burvixese:The Burvixese are sentient, turtle-like aliens native to Arcturus I. When the Gg had come under attack by the [[Ur-Quan]] [[Kohr-Ah]], the Gg shared this information with its neighbors before they were annihilated by the Kohr-Ah. The Burvixese then warned the neighboring Druuge that a Kohr-Ah fleet was heading toward Druuge space following the Druuge's powerful hyperwave transmissions advertising their location and services for sale.  Not wishing to share the fate of the Gg, the Druuge secretly installed a powerful hyperwave 'caster on the Burvixese moon and activated it while shutting down their own in hopes of tricking the Kohr-Ah fleet into thinking the Burvixese were the source of the Druuge hypercasts.  Unfortunately for the Burvixese, the Kohr-Ah fell for the Druuge ruse and the Burvixese were destroyed in a genocidal orbital bombardment.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Drall"&gt;
;Drall:The Drall were a founding race of the Sentient Milieu. When the Dnyarri took control of the Milieu, the Drall were found to be inferior to the other slave races and the Dnyarri compelled the Ur-Quan and Mael-Num to destroy them.&lt;/div&gt;

;Dramya:No information. The Melnorme mention that they had a war with them but no information is known about what they looked like or much about them.

&lt;div id="Faz"&gt;
;Faz:The Faz were a member of the Sentient Milieu, and one of the few of those races which managed to survive the Dnyarri slave empire. They joined the Ur-Quan revolt and helped overthrow the Dnyarri, but were the first to fall victim to the Ur-Quan path of "Now and Forever". Since they refused to become Ur-Quan battle thralls, all of them were sent to their home planet and encased in a slave shield. Their eventual fate is unknown.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Gg"&gt;
;Gg:The Gg were known only by the now-extinct Burvixese race who communicated with the Gg via long range HyperWave broadcast. It was the Gg who warned the Burvixese of the approach of the hostile Kohr-Ah, as well as the accurate conjecture that the Kohr-Ah used HyperWave transmissions to locate their prey. Since the Gg were loath to engage in visual transmissions, their appearance must remain an eternal mystery for their world was incinerated by the Kohr-Ah in 2142.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Keel-Verezy"&gt;
;Keel-Verezy:The Melnorme occasionally mention this race, citing conversations or trade dealings with them.  When encountering a Melnorme ship it is possible that the Melnorme will mention that the Captain's Flagship almost hit a Keel-Verezy ship, which the Captain apparently did not see. The Melnorme say that the Keel-Verezy decline to show themselves to humans because they would "frighten them".&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Mael-Num"&gt;
;Mael-Num:The Mael-Num were members of the Sentient Milieu, and one of the few of those races which managed to survive the Dnyarri slave empire. Afterwards the Ur-Quan then set out to destroy them. The Mael-Num's question of why the Ur-Quan were doing this and the assertion that it was wrong caused delay amongst the Ur-Quan which led to them breaking out into the first doctrinal war. In the confusion the Mael-Num made their escape and supposedly were never seen again. Several sources within the game however hint that the [[List of Star Control races#Melnorme|Melnorme]] are in fact the Mael-Num, a fact confirmed by the developers.&lt;ref name="chat" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Nnngn"&gt;
;Nnngn:The Arilou explain their presence in the Hyperspace area surrounding the unstable QuasiSpace warp point as "hunting *Nnngn*", which they capture and then let go, since the *Nnngn* do not like to be confined. The player is told that he cannot catch *Nnngn* because he is "not quite solid enough".&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Precursors"&gt;
;Precursors:The Precursors are an ancient, technologically advanced race who ruled the galaxy for several thousands of years and then vanished. Various, hyper-advanced artifacts of theirs, including the Ultron and the [[Sa-Matra]], have been pivotal in the fates of the younger races.  Precursor devices have been discovered on various planets in the region of space accessible to the player, but only a single complete, intact installation has been found, the one which begets the beginning of the story of ''Star Control II'', becoming activated by a group of Earthling scientists and assuming its role of creating a Precursor starship on the planet Unzervalt (also known as Vela II). The Precursors were big, shaggy creatures, known to the [[Slylandro]] as the Shaggy Ones.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Taalo"&gt;
;Taalo:The Taalo (pronounced Tah-''ay''-lo) are the only member of the Sentient Milieu known to inhabit the region of space currently occupied by the New Alliance of Free Stars. According to [[Melnorme]], [[Slylandro]] and other alien sources, they are large, rock-like creatures. The unusual [[silicon]]-based physiology of the Taalo did not trigger the instinctual territoriality of the [[Ur-Quan]] and the two races became friends, resulting in the entrance of the Ur-Quan into the Sentient Milieu. They were highly advanced technologically, their final creation being the Taalo Shield, created in desperation for their allies as a protection against Dnyarri mind-control (the Taalo themselves were naturally immune). After the arrival and enslavement of the rest of the Milieu by the [[Dnyarri]], they were annihilated by their former allies, the Ur-Quan. The Orz report that some Taalo escaped to another dimension, where they interact somehow with the Orz.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Yuli"&gt;
;Yuli:The Yuli are one of the seven founding member races of the Sentient Milieu. All that is known about them is that they were considered inferior by their Dnyarri slave masters, and ordered destroyed by their psychically-compelled Milieu allies, the [[Ur-Quan]] and [[Mael-Num]].&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Yuptar"&gt;
;Yuptar:Like the Yuli, the Yuptar were of the Sentient Milieu and fell victim to the psychic coercive abilities of the evil Dnyarri. Unlike the Yuli, the Yuptar survived the millennia of slavery only to become the first victim of the Kohr-Ah's "Eternal Doctrine" which required the "cleansing" of all non-Ur-Quan races.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="Zebranky"&gt;
;Zebranky:The Zebranky preyed on the Zoq, Fot, and Pik. The three races banded together as the [[Zoq-Fot-Pik]] and annihilated the Zebranky.&lt;/div&gt;

==Introduced in ''Star Control 3''==

===Clairconctlar===
The Clairconctlar are noble warriors of ancient heritage. Their origins are shrouded in history, unknown both to the Crux and the League. The craggy, stone-faced warriors are a mystery even to the Precursors, who suspect that they resemble the ancient Taalo race.

The Clairconctlar move and speak at a stately, nearly glacial pace. They are patient, and extremely slow to anger. When aroused, however, they move with deadly swiftness. They seek just and honourable contact with all other races. They have little patience for brutality and the kinds of atrocities marking much of the galaxy's development.

All living Clairconctlar were sired by their queen. The queen looks like a majestic blue-grey mountain, larger than many moons. At intermittent cycles, the queen emits a pale blue egg, called a Conc Rock. The Conc Rock is actually a mass of adamantine flakes. In the right circumstances, each flake has the potential to grow into a Clairconctlar. When the queen releases a Conc Rock, the Clairconctlar take it deep into a cave rich with mineral deposits. There, the flakes leach geologic nutrients from the stone walls, and grow into embryonic Clairconctlar.

Over the centuries of gestation, the flakes accrete enough matter to be born as living Clairconctlar. The Conc Rocks are vital to the Clairconctlar because they represent the continuation of the race. Anyone who knowingly destroys one is subject to a vengeance hunt. Clairconctlar forsake all other obligations until they hunt down and exterminate the rock-breaker.

When the Crux arrived in the Kessari Quadrant, the Clairconctlar resisted their incursions. The Crux saw no way to win a war against the indomitable stone warriors, and decided to defeat them with subterfuge. They recruited the Clairconctlar after the Daktaklakpak discovered the Clairconctlar's unusual means of reproduction. The Ploxis sent the K'tang to abduct the Clairconctlar queen.

After a bloody battle which greatly reduced K'tang forces, they subdued the queen. They took her to another planet and used Precursor technology to affix her to bedrock, and to record a phony message. The message tells the Clairconctlar that a debt of honour binds them to the Ploxis. The message does not divulge the origin of this debt, but the Crux created a convenient fiction in case the Clairconctlar get curious: The Clairconctlar, they claim, destroyed most of the Ploxis race. In truth, the Ploxis destroyed most of their own.

The queen calls out to her people for salvation, but the Crux has forbidden them to visit the planet where they hold her, without saying why. The Clairconctlar know the Crux is an empire without honour, but are duty-bound to serve until the queen tells them they're free of the debt. They're stuck - unless the League can find a way to liberate them.

The Clairconctlar are known for their valour in battle. The ship is built to launch deadly broadside attacks, then transport away with its warp beacon in order to recharge its energy reserves for another attack.

===Daktaklakpak===
A semi-sentient machine, Daktaklakpak form the technological wing of the Hegemonic Crux. They are arrogant because the [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursors]] made them; however, they do not realise they were created as maintenance drones. The Precursors prevented the Daktaklakpak from developing full sentience which, combined with their amateurish self-modification, resulted in an initially indecipherable language ("Daktaklakpak! 5576 squared! 888, warning!", etc.). ''Daktaklakpak'' is the beginning of an alphanumeric string that encodes their creation by the Precursor factories, and contains all information about them.  They believe the same applies to the Eternal Ones.

They adore the Precursors and seek their artifacts. Though allied with the Crux, they would eagerly defect for the pursuit of greater knowledge. In particular, they quest to find the full name of Eternal Ones, which they believe will reveal the exact nature of the species. They will trade virtually anything for this information, including information on their allies, advanced weaponry, or services in battle. When the Daktaklakpak met the [[Ploxis]] (who were engaged in a civil war), they traded a Precursor vessel for several valuable artifacts. With this vessel the Ploxis Plutocrats and their [[K'tang]] allies won the war. In the Crux, the Daktaklakpak dissect new races and technologies provided by their allies, the Ploxis. This was the origin of the name of their ship: The Daktaklakpak Vivisector.  They have several such craft stationed at every artifact site in the quadrant, presumably guarding them till excavation crew arrive.

===Doog===
The Doog are a species of extremely loyal and naive dog-lizards. Dull-witted, they lack the intelligence to understand that no matter how hard they worked, they could never make enough money to buy themselves out of their K'Tang-Ploxis owned financial slavery.

===Exquivan===
The Exquivans are a race of "monks" who try to reduce their own level of sentience in order to avoid being devoured by the Eternal Ones.

===Eternal One===
The '''Eternal Ones''' are a race of god-like, extra-dimensional beings who consume all sentient life in the [[Universe]] from time to time. According to the [[Daktaklakpak]], the Eternal Ones' name comes from their DNA formulae that start as 'Eternal1'. Their complete name is their complete DNA formulae, something so complex that any sentience that tries to learn it all, organic or machine, becomes insane.

The Eternal Ones evolved from sentient organic beings until they lost their material bodies and became pure energy, reaching the verge of transforming into "something else". The Eternal Ones were afraid to evolve and lose their last physical vestige, and made a plan to stop their evolution that required consuming incredible quantities of sentient energy. To harvest sentience in great quantity, the Eternal Ones planted "seeds" throughout the universe that created all the other races in the Star Control universe. The Precursors became aware of this and devolved themselves to non-sentient animals and created semi-sentient machines called [[Daktaklakpak]] to re-evolve themselves when the harvest was over. Unfortunately the Daktaklakpak forgot their main objective and started to wander the galaxy collecting and protecting all Precursor technologies. The long-term purpose for the Precursors was to develop an artifact to optimize the harvest for the Eternal Ones. The Precursors had noticed that sentient harvest was incredibly inefficient, and theorized that by optimizing the harvest, there would not be a need for such genocide.

In ''Star Control 3'', the player, as the human leader of the sentient races, foresees the harvest, and unites most races to find a solution. He finds the unfinished artifact and re-evolves a Precursor who helps the player finish it in time for the next harvest.  The much greater efficiency of energy absorption allowed by the artifact allows the Eternal Ones to feed without requiring the death of all sentient creatures.

===Harika &amp; Yorn===
The Harika &amp; Yorn evolved as a symbiotic relationship with the warlike reptilian Harika eating the Yorn which serves to control the Yorn's population numbers. They also gain the advice of their somewhat more diplomatically minded food. The Yorn resemble ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[Tribble (Star Trek)|tribbles]] and as such would not be capable of a technological society on their own; the Harika grant them this chance. At the start of the game they are members of the Hegemonic Crux and suffer from the [[Xchagger]] virus.

===Herald===
The current Heralds are an unnamed species which were defeated by the previous Heralds. The Eternal Ones, while destroying all other sentient life, gave the Heralds the choice of oblivion, or becoming their messengers. The Heralds chose the latter fate.

===K'tang===
The K'tang are small, weak, cowardly worms of low intelligence and cunning. They evolved aware of their own inferiority, among bigger and smarter species. In an unusual display of cunning, the K'tang managed to scavenge or hijack enough sophisticated technology to cobble together [[Mecha]]. They killed all competing races, a significant portion of their own species and enslaved those that remained. Despite their powerful weaponry, not a single worm had strategic thought, no warrior lowered himself to running the supply lanes, and no slave was good enough to do it. Each K'tang scrounged whatever weapons he could, then went into battle hiding behind his allies. They encountered the [[Ploxis]] Plutocrats, who were looking for some easily controllable muscle to serve them. The K'tang quickly allowed their "allies" to run their logistics and strategy, turning the tide of the war in their favour and forming the Hegemonic Crux. The K'Tang fervently believe that they are the leaders of the Crux, despite admitting that the Ploxis "administrators" tell the K'Tang where to go and who to fight. Their downfall came when the Captain procured the Overlord-Seeking Larvacide missile from the [[Daktaklakpak]] and atomized the armoured shell that housed the K'tang King. The naked worm quickly surrendered to the League, and he and his race served as sullen allies for the remainder of the war, lest the League use their weapon and return them to the dirt.

===Lk===
The Lk are a species of fungus which used to feed on Precursor artifacts. They have a callous view of life, expecting other species to behave the same way.

===Owa===
An underwater species. Their planet's sun went nova long before the development of its life. All life on their home planet developed from underwater chemical reactions, therefore they have no light sensing abilities.

===Ploxis===
Not much is known about the Ploxis race, beyond the short history described by a rebel captain of that race, who had spent quite some time in suspended animation. The Ploxis were at once a race that celebrated diversity, and believed deeply in the idea of fairness and of the correlation between success and worthiness as a sentient. This liberal attitude caused them to respect even those who decided that the acquisition of wealth and power should be their primary motivation. By the time the peace-loving Ploxis decided to take a stand against these new thinkers, the Plutocrats, it was too late. The Plutocrats had already made contact with the [[K'tang]], and had swapped technology for servitude. With the K'tang and various Precursor artifacts, the Plutocrats made short work of those Ploxis who wished to cling to the old ways. All that remains of the defeated forces are a few scattered individuals in suspended animation.

===Vyro-Ingo===
Crustaceans with a full exoskeleton resembling lobsters.

They were non-sentient before being genetically uplifted by the Precursors. They "lost" DNA during this process, and this lost DNA became the VUX. The Vyro-Ingo were left with a sense of genetic inferiority, so they frequently insult others. During the storyline, they can reunite with the VUX.

===Xchagger===
The Xchagger are a microscopic race of sentient parasites who typically live on [[Ortogs]]. While individual Xchaggers are not intelligent, when part of a larger group they form a collective mind. At one time there were many Xchagger colonies, until all but one was exterminated by the Hegemonic Crux. Following this attack, the [[Daktaklakpak]] kidnapped many Xchagger (these abductees were known to the last colony as the "Lost Dynasties") and used them as a biological weapon against the [[Harika &amp; Yorn]]. Ultimately the Dynasties were extracted from the Harika by advanced technology, and returned to the Xchagger colony.

== Introduced in ''Star Control: Origins''==
Star Control: Origins introduced several new species.

=== Drenkend ===
A species of organic/mechanoid beings that were bred by the Scryve to follow orders and no more.  They use cloning pods to overwhelm their enemies with numbers because they have little else.  They serve as the Scryve's frontline soldiers.

=== Greegrox ===
Sapient "space fish" that live on and tend to the "Ancient One" which is a moon-sized being.  Because they are difficult to communicate with, most species consider them non-sapient until informed otherwise.

=== Measured ===
Sapient sea plants that were altered by the Scryve to serve as biological computers and bureaucrats.  They are record keepers for the Scryve Empire.

=== Menkmack ===
A long-necked, four-eyed species that has a penchant for mischief and are highly opportunistic.  They stole an egg from the Ancient One and, as a consequence of that, are on the run because the Ancient One keeps sucking away their home world's atmosphere.  They would rather keep moving than return the egg, unless there's profit in it for them.

=== Mowlings ===
A dog-like species that breeds fast and in great numbers.  They evolve through trial and error.  Mostly error.  When humanity finds them, they are worshiping an ancient machine called Jeff.  Jeff no longer wants to be their god.  While technically a ward of the Scryve Empire, the Scryve has done little with them because of Jeff.

=== Mukay ===
The Mukay are a species of aquatic aliens with a preoccupation with fish.  They are responsible for biological research as a ward of the Scryve Empire.

=== Phamysht ===
Prounced "famished," they're highly intelligent snake-like cannibals.  They were a ward species until the Scryve discovered they returned to their cannibalistic ways and have been at war since.

=== Pinthi ===
A sentient bioweapon/super virus developed by the Scryve but now independent.  It is trying to atone for it was it forced to do under Scryve control.

=== Scryve ===
The Scryve are the supreme power and primary antagonist in the Mid Spur making other species either their wards or dead.  Humanity is targeted for destruction by the Scryve because of their inclination towards freedom.

=== Trandals ===
A species that has been taken over by an AI called the Overmind.  "Free Trandals" have escaped the influence of the Overmind.

=== Tywom ===
The Tywom are an extremely friendly, slug-like species that is the first aliens that humans encounter in the Origins universe.  They are a ward of the Scryve Empire responsible for all things slimy but, due to interfering with humanity, are targeted for destruction.

=== Xraki ===
Four-armed, four-eyed former ward species of the Scryve Empire, they almost destroyed the Empire but were driven back.  They were breed by the Scryve to act as space marines.

There have been a number of '''nuclear [[whistleblowers]]''', often [[nuclear engineering|nuclear engineers]], who have identified safety concerns about [[nuclear power]] and nuclear weapons production. In 1976 [[Gregory Minor]], Richard Hubbard and Dale Bridenbaugh "blew the whistle" on [[nuclear safety and security|safety]] problems at [[nuclear power plant]]s in the [[United States]], and [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima]] in Japan. [[George Galatis]] was a senior nuclear engineer who reported safety problems at the [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone 1 Nuclear Power Plant]], relating to reactor refueling procedures, in 1996.&lt;ref name=Time_article&gt;Eric Pooley. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984206-1,00.html Nuclear Warriors] ''Time Magazine'', March 4, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nuclear power whistleblowers include [[Arnold Gundersen]] and [[David Lochbaum]].

==Karen Silkwood==

{{Main|Karen Silkwood}}

The first prominent nuclear whistleblower was [[Karen Silkwood]], who worked as a [[chemistry|chemical]] technician at a [[Kerr-McGee]] [[nuclear fuel]] plant. Silkwood became an activist in the [[Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union]] in order to protest health and safety issues. In 1974, she testified to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] about her concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rashke|first1=Richard L.|title=The Killing of Karen Silkwood: The Story Behind the Kerr-McGee Plutonium Case|date=1981|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=978-0801486678}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later she [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interact/silkwood.html died in a car crash under mysterious conditions] on the way to a meeting with a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter and a national union leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tolley|first1=Laura|title=Karen Silkwood Case Returns to Haunt Parents : Whistle-blower: The disclosure that Los Alamos lab has had her bone fragments since 1974 outrages family.

==The "GE Three"==

{{Main|GE Three}}

On February 2, 1976, [[Gregory Minor|Gregory C. Minor]], Richard B. Hubbard, and Dale G. Bridenbaugh (known as the [[GE Three]]) "blew the whistle" on safety problems at [[nuclear power plant]]s, and their action has been called "an exemplary instance of [[whistleblowing]]".&lt;ref name=nuke&gt;[http://ethics.iit.edu/career/ Whistleblower on Nuclear Plant Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024813/http://ethics.iit.edu/career/ |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three engineers gained the attention of journalists and their disclosures about the threats of nuclear power had a significant impact. They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in [[General Electric]]'s nuclear energy division, and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments, federal agencies, and overseas governments. The consulting firm they formed, MHB Technical Associates, was technical advisor for the movie, "[[The China Syndrome]]." The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,918045,00.html|title=Environment: The San Jose Three|date=16 February 1976|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879643,00.html|title=Environment: The Struggle over Nuclear Power|date=8 March 1976|work=TIME.com|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction.jpg|thumb|Browns Ferry Unit 1 under construction]]

[[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant|Browns Ferry nuclear power plant]] construction went underway in 1966. It was located in Alabama and in 1967 it earned a Federal construction permit. The plant received new design standards which call for "physical separation of electrical cables." &lt;ref&gt;Weil, Vivian. "Moral Responsibility and Whistleblowing in the Nuclear Industry: Browns Ferry and Three Mile Island." (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; There was an issue with the instructions on how to accomplish this so the AEC inspector F.U. Bower requested that the AEC elaborate; however, there was no response from the organization and installation went on. Still, no instructions were issued after five failed inspections in 1970. The lack of cable separation instructions led to the sacrifice of safety coolant systems in two of the units in order to improve one with severe safety violation. The ignorance of the AEC led to the fire that occurred on March 22, 1975, that almost led to a radiation leak. The substance separating the wires caught fire when tests to find air leaks with a candle ignited it thus resulting in damage to the control systems. With damage to the control systems, the cooling system that keeps the units from leaking radiation did not work properly. Somehow the situation was avoided and the units were put out of service. Throughout the occurrence of these events Bridenbaugh had been discussing his reservations on the safety at the plant in vain and in 1976 a year later Bridenbaugh, Hubbard and Minor resigned.

==Crystal River 3 and Lou Putney==

{{Main|Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant}}

Lou Putney came on the scene of the [[Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant|Crystal River 3]] plant after receiving a call from a plant engineer. The engineer claimed that the managers hired engineers based on "good ol' boy mentality."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Riggs, Stephanie. "FLORIDA POWER AND THE CRYSTAL RIVER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT." (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; The plant had experience numerous shut downs since 1978. Along with this concern, the engineer was not confident that the manager possessed the qualifications to be a manager. Although the engineer pursued nothing further with his complaint, it prompted Putney to purchase shares of stock in the company that would allow him to file "[[shareholder resolution]]s." Putney had looked into the nuclear reactors that were built of an unsafe material for emergency cooling procedures. The NRC had placed Crystal River on the top 14 worst reactors list because of this. So, the shares were purchased in 1981, which is when Putney filed his first shareholder resolution requesting the plant be shut down. This tradition was upheld by Putney for seven years until he was required to purchase more stock in order to continue filing resolutions. Over the course of sixteen years, Putney filed a total of fourteen shareholder resolutions. All of these resolutions were ignored and were met with offers to buy out his shares so he could no longer file the resolutions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The plant was officially decommissioned in September 2009.

==Ronald Goldstein==
Ronald J. Goldstein was a supervisor employed by [[Electric Bond and Share Company|EBASCO]], which was a major contractor for the construction of the South Texas plants. In the summer of 1985, Goldstein identified safety problems to SAFETEAM, an internal compliance program established by EBASCO and Houston Lighting, including noncompliance with safety procedures, the failure to issue safety compliance reports, and quality control violations affecting the safety of the plant.

SAFETEAM was promoted as an independent safe haven for employees to voice their safety concerns. The two companies did not inform their employees that they did not believe complaints reported to SAFETEAM had any legal protection. After he filed his report to SAFETEAM, Goldstein was fired. Subsequently, Golstein filed suit under federal nuclear whistleblower statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zuniga|first1=Sonia|title=20 memorable whistleblowers in the U.S.|url=http://www.chron.com/news/politics/us/slideshow/20-memorable-whistleblowers-in-the-U-S-128656/photo-9901160.php|accessdate=18 September 2016|agency=Houston Chronicle|date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] ruled that his submissions to SAFETEAM were protected and his dismissal was invalid, a finding upheld by Labor Secretary [[Lynn Morley Martin|Lynn Martin]]. The ruling was appealed and overturned by the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], which ruled that private programs offered no protection to whistleblowers. After Goldstein lost his case, Congress amended the federal nuclear whistleblower law to provide protection reports made to internal systems and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="Whistleblower's Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=Stephen Martin|title=The Whistleblower's Handbook: A Step-by-Step Guide to Doing What's Right and Protecting Yourself|year=2011|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=9780762774791|pages=116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fernald Nuclear Incidents==

[[File:Fernald Production-era Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Fernald Feed Materials Production Center]]
[[File:HD.6D.724 (13452891054).jpg|thumb|Uranium components fabricated at Fernald]]

{{Main|Fernald Feed Materials Production Center}}

The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was built in Crosby Township, Ohio in 1951, and decommissioned in 1989. Fernald processed [[uranium trioxide]] and [[uranium tetrafluoride]], among other radioactive materials, to produce the [[Nuclear fuel|uranium fuel cores]] for nuclear weapons. It was shrouded in suspicion with many manager changes and the people of the town ill-informed of the purpose of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonfield|first1=Tim|title=History repeats itself|url=http://enquirer.com/fernald/stories/021196c_fernald.html|accessdate=18 September 2016|agency=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=February 11, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center also conducted an evaluation of how much material was contaminated by Radium. Using 138 pieces of the CR-39 film assays, they were able to determine that people working in the area where K-65 silos ( Underground chamber used to store missiles) had lower levels of exposure of materials contaminated by Radon than the Q-11 silos between the period of 1952-1988 [[Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology]].[[Estimation of radon exposures to workers at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center 1952- 1988|Throughout]] 1951-1995 the plant had numerous scandals including faking numbers for contamination and disregarding evidence of ground water pollution. Among the citizens affected by the pollution was Mrs. Lisa Crawford who took action. Crawford and other residents filed a lawsuit in 1985 and became president of the organization [http://www.lm.doe.gov/land/sites/oh/fernald_orig/50th/secr.htm FRESH (Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and Health)].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enquirer.com/fernald/stories/021196c_fernald.html|title=The Enquirer's Fernald Investigation|website=enquirer.com|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was then filed once again against Fernald by former employees several years later in 1990. After several years of being heavily advised not to blow the whistle, the workers earned themselves a $15 million settlement and lifelong medical monitoring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1992, FERMCO was hired to construct a cleanup plan for the plant and in 1996, around accusations of wasteful spending, the cleanup of ground water and soil was completed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Mordechai Vanunu==

[[File:Mordechai Vanunu 2009.jpg|thumb|Mordechai Vanunu 2009]]

[[Mordechai Vanunu]] blew the whistle on the nuclear plant in Dimona, Israel in an interview with [[The Sunday Times]] that was published on 5 October 1986. According to Vanunu, this plant had been producing nuclear weapons for 10 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2536653|title=The Nuclear Arsenal in the Middle East|first=Frank|last=Barnaby|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=1|pages=97–106|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/2536653}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there may be around 200 nuclear weapons in possession of Israel's nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nuclear Energy in the Gulf|last=The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research|first=|publisher=I.B.Tauris &amp; Company, Limited|year=2009|isbn=9789948141174|location=|pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanunu demonstrated his knowledge to [[Frank Barnaby]] and John Steinbach and they confirmed the credibility of his story. Frank Barnaby wrote in his ''Declaration of Frank Barnaby in the Matter of Mordechai Vanunu'' that Vanunu had the bare minimum knowledge of nuclear physics that a technician should have and accurately described the makeup of the nuclear plant in Dimona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/barnaby.pdf|title=Expert Opinion Of Charles Frank Barnaby in The Matter of Mordechai Vanunu|last=Barnaby|first=Frank|date=14 June 2004|website=fas|publisher=|access-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having served in full his 18 years prison term, ruled in closed door trial, including 11 years in solitary Vanunu has been further in and out of jail after. In 2007, sentenced to six months for violating terms of his parole, and in May 2010, again to three months for having met foreigners in violation of his release terms from jail.

Vanunu is of the ethnic [[Mizrahi]] Jewry, having emigrated out of Arabic-speaking North-Africa, many of whom claim discriminatory practices effect them in the [[Ashkenaz]] dominated intelligensia and judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Identity, Place, and Subversion in Contemporary Mizrahi Cinema in Israel, by Yaron Shemer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3646993.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nuclear-whistleblower-mordechai-vanunu-israel-wont-let-me-leave-because-im-moroccan-1518669&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International issued a press release on 2 July 2007, stating that "The organisation considers Mordechai Vanunu to be a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release."[6] Vanunu has been characterized internationally as a whistleblower[7][8] and by Israel as a traitor. Despite the whistle blown towards the operation of the nuclear weapons program in Israel, the Israeli government denied the existence of all allegations.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1714013298&lt;/ref&gt;
Mordechai Vanunu is known as [[Israel`s Nuclear Whistleblower]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/29/vanunu.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arnold Gundersen==

{{Main|Arnold Gundersen}}

In 1990 [[Arnold Gundersen]] discovered radioactive material in an accounting safe at Nuclear Energy Services in [[Danbury, Connecticut]], the consulting firm where he held a $120,000-a-year job as senior vice-president.&lt;ref name=gunder/&gt; Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations, Gundersen was fired.  According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', for three years, Gundersen "was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night" and he "became concerned about his family's safety". Gundersen believes he was blacklisted, harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right.&lt;ref name=gunder&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/nyregion/paying-the-price-for-blowing-the-whistle.html |title=Paying The Price For Blowing The Whistle |author=Julie Miller |date=February 12, 1995 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reports that Gundersen's case is not uncommon, especially in the [[nuclear industry]]. Even though nuclear workers are encouraged to report potential safety hazards, those who do risk demotion and dismissal. Instead of correcting the problems, whistleblowers say, industry management and government agencies attack them as the cause of the problem. Driven out of their jobs and shunned by neighbors and co-workers, whistleblowers often turn to each other for support.&lt;ref name=gunder/&gt;

The [http://whistleblowing.us/ Whistleblower Support Fund] is an organization that has compiled resources for whistleblowers to access if they are considering whistleblowing. It was founded by Donald Ray Soeken, who has counseled whistleblowers for 35 years. In addition, a social network to connect whistleblowers to other whistleblowers will be implemented. It will be a private discussion where whistleblowers can safely seek support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whistleblowing.us/|title=Whistleblower Support Fund|website=Whistleblower Support Fund|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Lochbaum==

{{Main|David Lochbaum}}

In the early 1990s, nuclear engineer [[David Lochbaum]] and a colleague, Don Prevatte, identified a safety problem in a plant where they were working, but were ignored when they raised the issue with the plant manager, the utility and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heidorn Jr.|first1=Rich|title=Whistle-blower Tells Of Nuclear-plant Fears He Disagreed With Bosses Over Safety Issues In Allentown And Was Fired.

Gerald W. Brown was the whistleblower on the Thermo-Lag scandal, as well as on [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Silicone_foam silicone foam firestop] issues in the US and Canada, exposing the fact that [[fireproofing]] of wiring between control rooms and reactors did not function as intended and exposing [[bounding]] and combustibility issues with [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[firestop]]s.

==George Galatis==

As a result of going to the NRC, Galatis experienced "subtle forms of harassment, retaliation, and intimidation".&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

==Rainer Moormann==
[[File:Moormann rainer 04.jpg|thumb|Rainer Moormann in 2004]]

[[Rainer Moormann]] is a German chemist and nuclear power whistleblower. Since 1976 he has been working at the [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], doing research on safety problems with [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[fusion power]] and [[Neutron source|spallation neutron sources]]. In 2008 Moormann published a critical paper on the safety of pebble bed reactors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/2128/3136/1/Juel_4275_Moormann.pdf|title=JuSER|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111154905/http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/2128/3136/1/Juel_4275_Moormann.pdf|archivedate=11 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/2128/3585/1/Moormann-Juwel.pdf|title=JuSER|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719031547/http://juwel.fz-juelich.de:8080/dspace/bitstream/2128/3585/1/Moormann-Juwel.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which raised attention among specialists in the field, and managed to distribute it via the media, facing considerable opposition. For doing this despite the occupational disadvantages he had to accept as a consequence, Moormann was awarded the whistleblower award of the [[Federation of German Scientists (VDW)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdw-ev.de/images/stories/vdwdokumente/aktuelles/whistleblowerpreis%202011%20begrndung%20kurz.pdf Press statement of the VWD (in German)]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, official short version in English: http://ialana.net/uploads/media/Program_Whistleblower_Award_2011.pdf, inofficial English translation of the press release: https://euzicasa.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/presentation-of-whistleblower-award-2011_via-hintergrund/&lt;/ref&gt; and of the German section of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (IALANA).

==Setsuo Fujiwara==
Setsuo Fujiwara, who used to design reactors, said he clashed with supervisors over an inspection audit he conducted in March 2009 at the Tomari nuclear plant in Japan. Fujiwara refused to approve a routine test by the plant's operator, Hokkaido Electric Power, saying the test was flawed. A week later, he was summoned by his supervisor, who ordered him to ''correct'' his written report to indicate that the test had been done properly. After Fujiwara refused, his employment contract was not renewed. "They told me my job was just to approve reactors, not to raise doubts about them", said Fujiwara, 62, who is now suing the nuclear safety organization to get rehired. In a written response to questions from ''The New York Times'', the agency said it could not comment while the court case was under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warnings on Fukushima ignored, insiders say; They attribute failure to cozy ties between government and industry|date=March 11, 2012|author=|work=Power Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the lawsuit Mr. Fujiwara filed against the agency he used to work for, he had gone to the Tokyo District Court to further write several complaints about how the JNES ( Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization) failed to follow the UN laws concerning how to properly inspect nuclear energy reactors. Mr. Fujiwara also submitted several documents and emails that dealt with how the reactor inspections were improperly handled by JNES even though JNES denies all allegations. [42]

==Walter Tamosaitis==
The [[Hanford site]] resulted in a number of whistleblowers during the efforts to clean the site up. Walter Tamosaitis blew the whistle on the [[United States Department of Energy|Energy Department's]] plan for waste treatment at the Hanford site in 2011. Tamosaitis's concern was the possibility of explosive hydrogen gas being built up inside tanks that the company was to store the harmful chemical sludge they were trying to put into hibernation for its chemical life. Shortly after this Tamosaitis was demoted and two years later, fired which triggered his lawsuit for wrongful termination. A $4.1 million settlement was offered to Tamosaitis from AECOM on 12 August 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hanford-whistleblower-settlement-20150813-story.html|title=Hanford nuclear weapons site whistle-blower wins $4.1-million settlement|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamosaitis has since been reinstated.

Donna Busche blew the whistle resulting in her 2013 lawsuit with claims that the URS "retaliated against her.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was head of nuclear safety and a URS employee around the time when she expressed her concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CBS News|title=Second whistleblower Donna Busche fired at troubled Wash.

==Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins==
In 2012, Larry Criscione and Richard H. Perkins publicly accused the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] of downplaying flood risks for nuclear plants which are sited on waterways downstream from large reservoirs and dams. They are [[engineer]]s with over 20 years of combined government and military service who work for the NRC. Other nuclear safety advocates have supported their complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/04/nuclear-power-whistleblowers_n_2232108.html|title=Nuclear Power Whistleblowers Charge Federal Regulators With Favoring Secrecy Over Safety|date=April 4, 2012|author=Tom Zeller Jr.|work=Huff Post Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Pace and Dan Parks==
In 1959, John Pace was employed at the Santa Susana Field Lab, 36 miles from Los Angeles, at the time of the partial meltdown during the Sodium Reactor Experiment. According to Pace, the reactor building doors and reactor exhaust stack were opened, releasing radiation into the atmosphere. Dan Parks also worked at the Santa Susana Field Lab, as a health physicist in the 1960s, where he witnessed the burning of radioactive waste in burn pits, and frequently saw workers illegally vent radiation into the atmosphere. In 2015 they spoke out about the incident in an investigative report by NBC News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grover|first1=Joel|last2=Glasser|first2=Matthew|title=L.A.'s Nuclear Secret|url=http://data.nbcstations.com/national/KNBC/la-nuclear-secret/|accessdate=31 October 2016|agency=National Broadcasting Network|publisher=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grover|first1=Joel|last2=Glasser|first2=Matthew|title=L.A.'s Nuclear Secret: Part 1|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/investigations/LA-Nuclear-Secret-327896591.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|agency=National Broadcasting Company|publisher=NBC News - Investigative Team|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nemrut''' or '''Nemrud''' ({{lang-tr|Nemrut Dağı}}; {{lang-ku|Çiyayê Nemrûdê}}; {{lang-hy|Նեմրութ լեռ}}) is a {{convert|2134|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-high}} mountain in southeastern [[Turkey]], notable for the summit where a number of large statues are erected around what is assumed to be a royal tomb from the [[1st century BC]].

==Location and description==
[[File:Mount Nemrut.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Some of the statues near the peak of Mount Nemrut]]
The mountain lies {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Kahta]], near [[Adıyaman]]. In 62 BC, King [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene]] built on the mountain top a tomb-sanctuary flanked by huge statues {{convert|8|-|9|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-high}} of himself, two lions, two eagles and various [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Armenian mythology|Armenian]], and [[Median Empire|Medes]] gods, such as [[Zeus]]-[[Aramazd]] or Oromasdes (associated with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] god [[Ahura Mazda]]), [[Hercules]]-[[Vahagn]], [[Tyche]]-Bakht, and [[Apollo]]-[[Armenian mythology|Mihr]]-[[Mithras]]. These statues were once seated, with names of each god inscribed on them. The heads of the statues have at some stage been removed from their bodies, and they are now scattered throughout the site.

The pattern of damage to the heads (notably to noses) suggests that they were deliberately damaged as a result of [[iconoclasm]]. The statues have not been restored to their original positions. The site also preserves stone slabs with bas-relief figures that are thought to have formed a large [[frieze]]. These slabs display the ancestors of [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus]], who included [[Armenians]],  [[Greeks]] and [[Persian people|Persians]].

The same statues and ancestors found throughout the site can also be found on the [[tumulus]] at the site, which is {{convert|49|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-tall}} and {{convert|152|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is possible that the tumulus was built to protect a tomb from tomb-robbers since any excavation would quickly fill with loose rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert H. Hewsen |title= Armenia: A historical Atlas |year= 2001 |page= 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues appear to have Greek-style facial features, but Armenian clothing and hair-styling.

[[File:Löwenhoroskop Humann 1883.jpg|thumb|right|The Lion with the Stars]]
The western terrace contains a large slab with a lion, showing an arrangement of stars and the planets [[Jupiter]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Mars]]. The composition was taken to be a chart of the sky on 7 July 62 BC.&lt;ref&gt; [[Otto Neugebauer|Neugebauer O.]] and H. B. Van Hoessen, ''Greek horoscopes'' (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, xlviii; Philadelphia, 1959), 14–16. The authors chose that date in preference to 23 July 49 which other researchers prefer, see Belmonte J., and Gonzales Garcia,  [http://www.iac.es/proyecto/arqueoastronomia/media/BelmonteGonzalez_JHA2010.pdf ''Antiochos's Hierothesion at Nemrud Dag Revisited'' ] J. Hist. Astronomy, 41 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This may be an indication of when construction began on this monument. The eastern portion is well preserved, being composed of several layers of rock, and a path following the base of the mountain is evidence of a walled passageway linking the eastern and western terraces. Possible uses for this site are thought to have included religious ceremonies, owing to the astronomical and religious nature of the monument.

The arrangement of such statues is known by the term [[hierothesion]]. Similar arrangements have been found at Arsameia on Nymphaios at the hierothesion of the father of Antiochus, [[Mithridates I Callinicus]].

== Ancient history ==
When the [[Seleucid Empire]] was defeated by the Romans in 190 BC at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] it began to fall apart and new kingdoms were established on its territory by local authorities. [[Commagene]], one of the Seleucid successor states, occupied a land between the [[Taurus mountains]] and the [[Euphrates]]. The state of Commagene had a wide range of cultures which left its leader from 62 BC – 38 BC [[Antiochus I Theos of Commagene|Antiochus I Theos]] to carry on a peculiar dynastic religious program, which included not only [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Persia]]n deities but Antiochus and his family as well. This religious program was very possibly an attempt by Antiochus to unify his multiethnic kingdom and secure his dynasty's authority.&lt;ref name=siliotti217&gt;{{harvnb|Siliotti|2006|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiochus supported the cult as a propagator of happiness and salvation.&lt;ref name=siliotti218&gt;{{harvnb|Siliotti|2006|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ruins on Mount Nemrud are monuments of the imperial cult of Commagene. The most important area to the cult was the tomb of Antiochus I, which was decorated with colossal statues made of [[limestone]]. Although the imperial cult did not last long after Antiochus, several of his successors had their own tombs built on Mount Nemrud.&lt;ref name=siliotti220&gt;{{harvnb|Siliotti|2006|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; For around half of the year, Mount Nemrud is covered in snow, the effect of which increases weathering, which has in part caused the statues to fall in ruin.&lt;ref name=siliotti217/&gt;

==Modern history==
The site was excavated in 1881 by {{ill|Karl Sester|de}}, a German [[engineer]] assessing transport routes for the Ottomans. After her first visit in 1947, [[Theresa Goell]] dedicated her life to the site, starting campaigns in 1954. Subsequent excavations have failed to reveal the tomb of Antiochus. This is nevertheless still believed to be the site of his burial. The statues, all of them "beheaded", have not been restored to their original condition.

In 1987, Mount Nemrut was made a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Engineering Geology for Society and Territory - Volume 5: Urban Geology, Sustainable Planning and Landscape Exploitation |editor1= Giorgio Lollino|editor2=Andrea Manconi|editor3=Fausto Guzzetti|editor4=Martin Culshaw|editor5=Peter Bobrowsky|editor6=Fabio Luino |edition= illustrated |publisher= Springer |year= 2014 |isbn= 9783319090481 |page= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists typically visit Nemrut during April through October. The nearby town of [[Adıyaman]] is a popular place for car and bus trips to the site, and one can also travel from there by helicopter. There are also overnight tours running out of Malatya or Kahta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Volcanic Tourist Destinations; Geoheritage, Geoparks and Geotourism |editor= Patricia Erfurt-Cooper |edition= illustrated |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= 2014 |isbn= 9783642161919 |page= 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model''' (NOBM) is a three-dimensional representation of coupled circulation/[[biogeochemical]]/radiative processes in the global [[oceans]]. It was built at the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and is in the process of being coupled to the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) climate systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/research/modeling/ | title=Modeling |work=Global Modeling and Assimilation Office |publisher=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]] |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It spans the domain from -84° to 72° latitude in increments of 1.25° longitude by 2/3° latitude, including only open ocean areas, where bottom depth are greater than 200 m. The biogeochemical model contains 4 [[phytoplankton]] groups, four nutrient groups, a single [[herbivore]] group, and three [[Detritus (geology)|detrital pools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/documents/NOBM_Readme-20120606.pdf | title=Document for NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3336">The '''National Wetlands Coalition''', founded in 1989,[http://www.law.miami.edu/library/everglades/news/2002/2002_01_index.html] has opposed U.S. [[wetlands]] policy, saying "the federal government, while seeking to protect wetlands, casts a wide net and imposes burdensome and ineffective regulations on private property that does not function as or provide the ecosystem benefits of high-value wetlands".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000128171106/http://thenwc.org/home.htm National Wetlands Coalition home page, January, 2000] via archive.org, accessed March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Time Magazine'' called it "a big-biz coalition against wetlands".&lt;ref&gt;John Snow, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990844-3,00.html "Lost In Cyberspace"], ''Time Magazine'', April 26, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the organization consisted of about 60 municipal associations, utilities and major industrial companies, such as [[Exxon]], [[Texaco]] and [[Kerr-McGee]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dowie, [http://www.earthisland.org/eijournal/new_articles.cfm?articleID=832&amp;journalID=75 "Greens outgunned"], ''Earth Island Journal'', Spring 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Wetlands Coalition has been characterized as the quintessential [[Astroturfing|astroturf organization]], which is an organization that presents itself as a [[grassroots]] organization, but was actually founded by (and is largely funded by) a separate commercial or political organization in order to promote its own agenda, while keeping its relationship to the new organization hidden. A study by the [[University of Oklahoma]] used the National Wetlands Coalition as a specific example to examine the influence of corporate front-group stealth campaigns, in which corporations form associations that, in turn, adopt names that are designed to misrepresent their true intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Michael, et al. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/429b/7e26552147599e8bdede9831b9d043417709.pdf "The Influence of Corporate Front-Group Stealth Campaigns"]. ''Communication Research'', vol 34, no. 1, Feb. 2007, pp. 73–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study indicated that front-group stealth campaigns were effective in enhancing public perceptions of the front group itself. The National Wetlands Coalition campaigns successfully undermined perceptions of the targeted attitude object, eroding support for any federal efforts to restrict wetlands’ development or regulate developers.

The organization has been relatively inactive since around the late 1990s. [http://www.americaswetlandresources.com/background_facts/detailedstory/solutions.html].  The website was being "reworked" from February 2001 [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.thenwc.org/home.htm] through November 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20051130221127/http://www.thenwc.org/]; it went offline in December 2005.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051211003317/http://www.thenwc.org/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3752">The '''North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests''' is a [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of southwestern [[India]]. 

==Setting==
The North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests lies in the northern portion of the [[Western Ghats]] (Sahyadri) range. It extends from southeastern [[Gujarat]] through [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Goa]], and [[Karnataka]]. It covers the eastern and western slopes of the range between 250 and 1000 meters elevation, and surrounds the [[North Western Ghats montane rain forests]] ecoregion, which lies above 1000 meters elevation.  The ecoregion has an area of {{convert|48,200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is bounded on the west by the [[Malabar Coast moist forests]] ecoregion, which lies between the 250 meter elevation and the [[Arabian Sea]]. At its northern end, the ecoregion extends to the [[Narmada River]], and borders the [[Kathiarbar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] to the northwest and the [[Narmada Valley dry deciduous forests]] to the northeast. The Wayanad forests at the southern end of the ecoregion mark the transition to the [[South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]] to the south. To the east, in the dry [[rain shadow]] of the Ghats, are the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, whose [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forests]] cover the Ghats' eastern foothills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Asia: Southwestern India|url=http://worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/im0135|work=WWF|accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Protected areas==
In 1997, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] identified thirteen protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 2,200 km², that encompassed 5% of the ecoregion's area. &lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.'' Island Press; [[Washington, DC]]. pp. 311-313&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3879">The '''Olympus National Park Information Center''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Κέντρο Πληροφόρησης Εθνικού Δρυμού Ολύμπου, Kendro Pliroforisis Ethnikou Drymou Olymbou) informs their visitors about geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects relating to [[Mount Olympus]].
[[File:Ausstellung Olymp-Nationalpark-Informationszentrum.jpg|thumb|Exhibition at the Olympus National Park Information Center]]

==Location==
The centre is located about one kilometer above [[Litochoro]], directly at the road leading to the summits, lies the Olympus National Park Information Center. It is located opposite the extensive sports complex and is signposted.

==Purpose==
In 1938, [[Mt Olympus|Mount Olympus]] was established as the first national park in Greece, and declared a Biosphere Reserve by [[UNESCO]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/greece/mount-olympus/|title=Biosphere Reserves: Mount Olympus|website=Unesco.org|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The building houses the offices of the National Park Administration, the exhibition, a library, various meeting rooms and a spacious atrium for events or exhibitions. There are also rooms for a café and a souvenir shop. The exhibition is the link between the National Park Administration and the public. The visitor is given an overall picture of the mountains. Hiking, nature, archeology, history, fauna, flora, monasteries and, of course, [[Greek mythology]] are treated.

==Exhibition==
The design of the exhibition was designed by the [[Goulandris Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnhm.gr/en/|title=Goulandris National History Museum|website=Gnhm.gr|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is divided into seven areas, in which the peculiarities of the seven different zones of the mountain are presented, one will find large-sized boards that provide information about relevant topics in Greek and English. With every rise in the exhibition, the next higher altitude of the mountains is shown and the plant and animal world prevailing there is explained. Places of interest beyond nature are treated on separate boards, information about archaeological sites such as [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Dion]] or [[Leivithra]] is provided. The hiker is pointed out to interesting places near the hiking trails, such as the monastery of [[Monastery Agios Dionysios|Agios Dionysius]] or the cave of the painter Ithakisios. 
[[File:Ausstellung_Schautafeln.jpg|thumb|Exhibition at the Olympus National Park Information Center]]  

==Service==
Multilingual guides are available to assist visitors. A certified Ecoguide is responsible for guided tours in the mountains. The works in the library mainly deal with the themes of Olympus, animals and plants. Most are written in Greek, but books in English, German and French language are also on the shelves. The amphitheater, a room with 142 seats, can be used for congresses, lectures, meetings, etc. A seminar room can also be provided upon request. Registration is required.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Olympus National Park Information Center is one of the venues of the [[Olympus Festival]].

'''''Poem Strip''''' ({{Lang-it|'''Poema a fumetti'''}}) is a 1969 comic book by the Italian writer and illustrator [[Dino Buzzati]]. It retells the myth of [[Orpheus]] and [[Eurydice]], set in [[Milan]] in the 1960s. The aesthetics are influenced by 1960s pop culture. An English translation by Marina Harss was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/poem-strip/oclc/299708098|title=Poem strip|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Richard Rayner]] of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in 2009: "The images are surreal, sexy and frightening, and the text (translated here for the first time into English by Marina Harss, with lettering by Rich Tommaso) is both compelling and poetic. There are shades of [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], shades of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], shades of the great Italian horror director [[Mario Bava]]. A beautiful book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rayner|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Rayner|date=2009-11-15|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-caw-paperback-writers15-2009nov15-story.html|title=Paperback Writers: Greek myth is hip, so is Richard Milward's new novel|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote: "The text might have lost some of its lyricism in the translation from the Italian, as it occasionally seems stiff. The artwork retains its bold, sensual power, however."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59017-323-7|title=Fiction Book Review: Poem Strip by Dino Buzzati|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sacred garden''' is a religiously-influenced [[garden]], often found on [[temple]] grounds.

==Overview==
Religion has been an important influence on garden design. Temple gardens were made in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Sacred grove]]s were made in ancient India, Greece, Rome, China and Japan. [[Sacred tree]]s were important in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and Germanic Europe and still are important in India. 

Many groves or forests were sacred in [[ancient India]] and continue to be so in modern [[Hindu]] worship. [[Buddhism]] had a significant influence on garden design, with the [[Zen]] gardens of [[China]] and [[Japan]] as famous examples. In Christianity, particularly [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], [[Mary garden]]s are common among churches and institutions.

The practise of creating sacred gardens is re-invigorated and adapted for modern times in the ''Ringing Cedars'' series of books by Russian author [[Vladimir Megre]].

A '''serac''' (originally from [[Swiss French]] ''sérac'') is a block or column of glacial [[ice]], often formed by intersecting [[crevasse]]s on a [[glacier]]. Commonly house-sized or larger, they are dangerous to [[mountaineer]]s, since they may topple with little warning. Even when stabilized by persistent cold weather, they can be an impediment to glacier travel.

Seracs are found within an [[icefall]], often in large numbers, or on ice faces on the lower edge of a hanging glacier.&lt;ref name="Post &amp; Lachapelle"&gt;{{cite book |title=Glacier Ice |last=Post |first=Austin |first2=Edward R. |last2=Lachapelle |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |edition=Revised |year=2000 |isbn=0-295-97910-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of the overhanging glacier edge type are well-known obstacles on some of the world's highest mountains, including [[K2]] at "[[Bottleneck (K2)|The Bottleneck]]" and [[Kanchenjunga]] on the border of India and Nepal. Significant seracs in the [[Alps]] are found on the northeast face of [[Piz Roseg]], the north face of the [[Dent d'Hérens]], and the north face of [[Lyskamm]].

==Incidents==

*In the August [[2008 K2 disaster]], the collapse of large seracs was responsible for at least 8 of the 11 mountaineers' deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/world/asia/05K2.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=More Are Feared Dead Near K2's Harsh Summit|last=Perlez|first=Jane|work=The New York Times | date=August 5, 2008 | accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The April [[2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche]] responsible for the deaths of 16 climbers was caused when a large serac broke off.
*In October 2018, nine climbers from Korea were killed at Mount Gurja basecamp in Nepal from a gust of wind driven by falling seracs and snow. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/nepal-rescuers-retrieve-bodies-of-nine-climbers-10826616/|title=Nepal rescuers retrieve bodies of nine climbers|website=channelnewsasia.com

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">[[Image:Sermilik.jpg|thumb|right|Sermilik Station, August 2007]] '''Sermilik Station''' is a [[glaciology]] [[research station]] on [[Ammassalik Island]], dedicated to the research of the nearby the [[Mittivakkat Glacier]]. The station is located approximately at {{coord|65|41|N|37|55|W}} on the west side of the Ammasalik island in south east Greenland,&lt;ref&gt;DPC&lt;/ref&gt; on the shore of the [[Sermilik Fjord]]. The station is not permanently staffed. However, during most times in summer they will have researchers working there.

== History ==

The station was built in 1970 to provide the logistical base for the research.&lt;ref&gt;Hasholt&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the main building was destroyed by an avalanche. It was rebuilt later closer to the shore, which is its current location.

== Transportation ==

The station is located on the west side of Ammassalik Island. The closest settlement is [[Tasiilaq]], and it would take around 1 day on foot to get from there to the station. The station is situated on a popular hiking route around the island.

It is home to the Sámi Museum and Northern Lapland Nature Centre. Siida arranges exhibitions on Sámi culture and the nature of Northern Lapland. In addition, Siida has an [[open-air museum]] open in the summers, which was originally known as the Inari Sámi Museum. The first buildings were moved to the museum grounds in 1960. The {{convert|7|ha|adj=on}} area has nearly 50 sites of interest related to Lapland's nature and the Sámi and their culture. Furthermore, the area is where the earliest settlers in Northern Lapland lived and archaeological finds from approximately 9,000 years ago have been found.

'''Summer learning loss''' is the loss of academic skills and knowledge over the course of summer holidays. The loss in learning varies across grade level, subject matter, and family income.  A common finding across numerous studies is that on average, students score lower on standardized tests at the end of the summer than they do at the beginning of summer (on the same test).  Summer loss for all students is estimated to be equal to about 1 month (Cooper 1996), but this varies across subject matter:
*[[Mathematics]] - 2.6 months of grade-level equivalency loss
*[[Reading (process)|Reading]]- Varies across [[Socioeconomic status|SES]].  Low income students generally lose about 2 months of reading achievement.  Middle income students experience slight gains in reading performances.

For over a century, scholars have recognized that [[summer vacation]] is a period when students’ rate of academic development declines relative to the school year.  All children lose academic skills during the summer months, and family socioeconomic status (SES) is highly correlated to the level of academic growth or decline in the summer months.  Two-thirds of the academic achievement gap in reading and [[language]] found among high school students has been explained through the learning loss that occurs during the summer months of the primary school years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gse.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/uk/Alexander,%20Entwisdel,%20and%20Olson%20(2001).pdf] Entwisle, D., Alexander, K., &amp; Olson, L.  2000.  “Summer Learning and Home Environment.”  In R. Kahlenberg Ed.,  A Notion at Risk: Preserving Public Education as an Engine for Social Mobility pp. 9-30.  New York: Century Foundation Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional school calendar ==
When formal schooling was first established, the school calendar fit the needs of a particular community. When families became more mobile, the school calendar was standardized.  The current 9-month calendar that most schools operate
on was established when 85% of Americans (and students) were involved in agriculture, and when climate control did not exist in school buildings.  In today's United States, only about 3% of Americans are engaged in agriculture.  Also, most schools have air conditioning, making it possible for students to be there in the hotter months.

== Summer programs combatting learning loss ==
[[After-school activity|After-school activities]] and summer programs can play a role in combatting summer learning loss. Studies have shown that if students are able to participate in organized academic activities during the summer months, they are less likely to experience the losses in academic skills and knowledge before the start of the next school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maríñez-Lora|first=Ané M|last2=Quintana|first2=Stephen M.|year=2010|title=Summer Learning Loss|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of cross-cultural school psychology|publisher=Springer US|volume=|pages=962–963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Gap and summer learning loss ==
Throughout the 20th century, numerous studies examined general learning loss among all students during the summer months.  A meta-analysis of 39 studies conducted since 1978 found that in the absence of school, all students score lower on standardized math tests at the end of the summer as compared to their performance on the same tests at the beginning of summer.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, H., Nye, B., Charlton, K., Lindsay, J., &amp; Greathouse, S.  1996.  “The effects of summer vacation on achievement test scores: A narrative and metaanalytic review.”  Review of Educational Research, 66, 227–268.&lt;/ref&gt;  This loss was most acute in factual and procedural learning such as mathematical computation, where an average setback of more than two months of grade-level equivalency was observed among both middle- and lower-class students. In reading and language, however, substantial differences were found between middle- and lower-class students.  Whereas middle-class students showed a nonsignificant gain in reading scores, lower-class students showed a significant loss that represented a gap of about three months of grade-level equivalent reading skills between middle- and lower-class students.

These results are consistent with other researcher's findings that a family’s socioeconomic status affects children’s achievement scores almost exclusively when school is closed.  Barbara Heyns’ 1978 landmark study of 2,978 6th and 7th graders in the Atlanta city public schools was the first thorough investigation of summer learning.&lt;ref&gt;Heyns, Barbara.  1978.  “Summer Learning and the effects of schooling”.  Orlando, FL: Academic.Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heyns found that while poor children and black children came close to keeping up with middle-class children in cognitive growth when school was in session, they lagged far behind during the summer.

Researchers Doris Entwistle and Karl Alexander extended Barbara Heyns’ line of research through the Beginning School Study (BSS) in 1982.  BSS compared the school-year and summer achievement gains of 790 youth across 20 of Baltimore’s public schools  from the beginning of first grade in 1982 through the end of elementary school.  The study also tracked these students’s progress through high school and college.  They found that in year nine, the low-socioeconomic status (SES) group’s Reading Comprehension average lagged 73 points behind the high-SES group’s on the California Achievement Test (CAT-V).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Karl, Entwisle, Doris, and Olson, Linda.  2004.  “Schools, Achievement, and Inequality: A Seasonal Perspective.”  In Geoffrey Borman and Matthew Boulay Eds., Summer learning research, policies, and programs pp. 25-51. Mahwah, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  About a third of the 73 points difference (27 points) was in place when the students started first grade.  After the first grade, the low-SES students fall farther behind each year, with the gap reaching a plateau of around 70 points in the 5th grade.  The remaining two-thirds of the 73 point gap accumulate over the course of the elementary and middle school years, with a staggering 48.5 points being attributed to the cumulative summer learning gap from the five elementary years.  As this data shows, virtually the entire achievement gap reflects differences between low-SES and high-SES students’ home environments, with cognitive gains during the school year being relatively equal between both groups.

Researchers from The Ohio State University extended summer learning gap research further by conducting a national study of 17,000 kindergarten and first grade children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study.  The authors confirmed earlier findings of an unequal starting point, showing that a standard deviation’s advantage in SES  predicts a 1.77 month advantage in initial reading skill on the first day of kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, D., von Hippel, P., &amp; Broh, B.  2004.  “Are Schools the Great Equalizer? Cognitive Inequality during the Summer Months and the School Year.”  American Sociological Review, 69 5,  613-635.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors also confirmed that the SES achievement gap continues to grow after schooling starts, with summer learning accounting for the vast majority of the difference.  While the average kindergarten learning rate was 1.65 test points per month, a standard deviation’s advantage in SES predicted a relative gain of 0.16 points per month during summer, 0.07 points per month during kindergarten, and 0.05 points per month during first grade.

== Magnitude of the problem ==
The United States has a K-12 public school enrollment roughly 48 million, of which only 9.2 percent attend summer school programs.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander, K., Entwisle, D., &amp; Olson, L.  2007.  Summer learning and its implications: Insights from the Beginning School Study.  In R. Fairchild, &amp; G. Noam Eds.,   “Summertime : Confronting Risks, Exploring Solutions” pp. 33-43.  San Francisco : Jossey-Bass/Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  These summer school programs typically differ significantly from the regular school program in terms of curriculum, goals and rigor.  Because summer school programs are voluntary, self-selection also confounds the effects of attending.  Due to these differences, most summer school programs have not been effective in reducing the achievement gap between low-SES and high-SES youth, and in some cases actually exacerbate the gaps.  For those low-SES students who do not have access to high quality summer learning opportunities, the personal impact is significant.

The early learning gap among low-SES students, which is predominantly driven by summer learning loss in the elementary school years, casts a long achievement shadow.  When compared to high-SES youth, the low-SES youth are “more likely to enter adulthood without high school certification (36 percent versus 3 percent at age twenty-two) and less likely to attend a four-year college (7 percent versus 59 percent, also at age twenty-two)."&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;  The college wage premium doubled from 1967 to 1997, while the dropout penalty similarly doubled.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, F.  1999.  “In Defense of Inequality.”  The American Economic Review, 89 2, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an economy that is increasingly unaccommodating of low-skill workers, joblessness and declining wages are related to growth in ghetto poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W.J.  1996.  “When Work Disappears”.  New York: Alfred Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;  In characterizing the U.S. poverty population, John Iceland revealed that “poor African-American children are less likely to escape poverty than others – 1 in 3 were still poor at ages 25 to 27, as compared to 1 in 12 white children." &lt;ref&gt;Iceland, J.  2003.  “Poverty in America.”  Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  While no consensus has been reached on a model to explain this lack of mobility, some research has provided the strongest support for the economic resources model, “where parents’ lack of money and time hinders the ability to invest in children’s education."  The correlation between SES and educational attainment thus has significant implications for the likelihood of low-SES children escaping poverty.

== Vulnerable learners ==

Cooper’s (1996) study (as cited in Graham, McNamara and VanLankveld, 2011, pg.575) indicates that the gap in the learning cycle which occurs during summer vacation is more prominent for children that are less advantaged.  Children who are the most susceptible are those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic minorities and students with exceptionalities (Graham, 2011; Guryan &amp; Kim, 2010; &amp; Kim, 2006). Further, it is predominantly literacy related skills that are affected the most (Graham,2011).

In a study conducted by Kim (2006) an intervention was designed to provide children with effective summer learning experiences and to improve the reading abilities of minority student’s and struggling readers. The results of the study indicate that the most significant reading gains occurred for disadvantaged students while students from middle to high socio-economic upbringings remained stable on standardized measures of reading (Kim, 2006). However, such findings are not consistent with a recent review by Guryan and Kim (2010) whereby a summer reading intervention was implemented for low-income Latino children. Low-income parents often lack the resources to provide children with sufficient reading materials needed to reinforce important literacy skills. Further children who are English language learners need additional exposure to print material, which may be difficult for children in homes where English is not the native language (Guryan and Kim, 2010).

== Parental involvement ==

The majority of the literature which examines the effects of the summer learning loss lends to the importance of involving families in the implementation of summer reading programs. Graham, McNamara and Van Lankveld (2011) conducted a summer literacy program to address specific literacy needs of young children which also required the involvement of caregivers in program delivery. Children as well as caregivers attended literacy skill building workshops where instructional sessions were tailored towards both children and parents, as well as include a collaborative component.  Based on the analysis of pre-test and post-test data collected during the study, children demonstrated significant improvements in developing their literacy skills (Graham, 2011).

Timmons (2008) also identifies the importance of providing literacy education to parents and children, while also bringing them together to work collaboratively in group situations. The active involvement of caregivers in their child’s educational career only enhances academic achievement, as research indicates the significant influence that family involvement has on successful student outcomes (Timmons, 2008).  Effective summer reading programs provide families with meaningful strategies and resources that can be carried over and implemented in their home, which ensures continuity of summer reading programs throughout year, after the intervention has concluded (Timmons, 2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4949">'''Supercritical liquid–gas boundaries''' are lines in the [[phase diagram|p–T diagram]] that delimit more liquid-like and more gas-like states of a [[supercritical fluid]]. They comprise the '''Fisher–Widom line''', the '''Widom line''', and the [[Frenkel line]].

==Overview==
[[File:PT-FrenkelFisherWidomSchematic.png|thumb|supercritical gas-liquid boundaries in PT-diagram]]

According to textbook knowledge, it is possible to transform a liquid continuously into a gas, without undergoing a phase transition, by heating and compressing strongly enough to go around the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. However, different criteria still allow to distinguish liquid-like and more gas-like states of a [[supercritical fluid]]. These criteria result in different boundaries in the pT plane. These lines emanate either from the critical point, or from the liquid–vapor boundary (boiling curve) somewhat below the critical point. They do not correspond to first or second order phase transitions, but to weaker singularities.

The Fisher–Widom line&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Fisher]], [[Benjamin Widom]]: ''Decay of Correlations in Linear Systems'', J. Chem. Phys. 50, 3756 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; is the boundary between monotonic and oscillating asymptotics of the pair correlation function &lt;math&gt;G(\vec{r})&lt;/math&gt;.

The Widom line is a generalization thereof, apparently so named by [[H. Eugene Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston University Research Briefs (2003), http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/researchbriefs/display.php?id=659&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was first measured experimentally in 1956 by Jones and Walker&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=|last2=Walker|date=1956|title=Specific Heats of Fluid Argon near the Critical Point|url=|journal=Proc. Phys. Soc. B|volume=69|pages=1348-1350|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and subsequently named the 'hypercritical line' by Bernal in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernal|first=J.D.|date=|title=The Structure of Liquids|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1382/299|journal=Proc. Roy. Soc. A|volume=280|pages=299|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who suggested a structural interpretation. The Frenkel line is a boundary between "rigid" and "non-rigid" fluids characterized by the onset of transverse sound modes.&lt;ref&gt;Brazhkin et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 031203 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the above mentioned criteria is based on the velocity [[autocorrelation]] function (vacf): below the Frenkel line the vacf demonstrates oscillatory behaviour, while above it the vacf monotonically decays to zero. The second criterion is based on the fact that at moderate temperatures liquids can sustain transverse excitations, which disappear upon heating. One further criterion is based on [[Heat capacity#At constant volume|isochoric heat capacity]] measurements.  The isochoric heat capacity per particle of a monatomic liquid near to the melting line is close to &lt;math&gt; 3 k_B &lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; k_B  &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]). The contribution to the heat capacity due to the potential part of transverse excitations is &lt;math&gt; 1 k_B &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore at the Frenkel line, where transverse excitations vanish, the isochoric heat capacity per particle should be &lt;math&gt; c_V=2 k_B &lt;/math&gt;, a direct prediction from the phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120524/srep00421/full/srep00421.html D.

'''Thyine wood''' is a 15th-century English name for a wood from the tree known botanically as ''[[Tetraclinis articulata]]'' (syn. ''Callitris quadrivalvis'', ''Thuja articulata''). The name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ''thuon'', "fragrant wood," or possibly ''thuein'', “to sacrifice”, and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance.

In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], wood from this tree was called ''citrum'', "citrus wood". It was considered very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Craftsmen who worked in citrus wood and ivory had their own [[collegium (ancient Rome)|guild ''(collegium)'']].&lt;ref&gt;''Eborarii'' and ''citriarii'': Koenraad Verboven, "The Associative Order: Status and Ethos among Roman Businessmen in Late Republic and Early Empire," ''Athenaeum'' 95 (2007), preprint p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thyine wood is mentioned in the [[King James Version of the Bible]] at [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 18:12 as being among the articles which would cease to be purchased when [[Babylon]] fell.  The New International Version translates the passage "citron wood"; the Amplified Bible translates it as "scented wood".

The resin is used as the basis for [[euparal]], a mounting medium used in [[microscopy]].

[[File:Tisvildeleje2004.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tisvildeleje at the sea of [[Kattegat]].]]
'''Tisvilde''' is a small town with a population of 1,537 (1 January 2014) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&amp;PLanguage=1 "BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas"] database from [[Statistics Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt; located on the north coast of the island [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] (Sjælland) in [[Denmark]] {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} in [[Gribskov Municipality]], northeast of [[Hillerød]].

[[Tisvildeleje]] is the coastal part of Tisvilde. "Leje" roughly translates as 'plain' and used to be a fishermans village. Now most of the fishermen's houses are used as charming summer residences. The southeast of Tisvilde is referred to as [[Tibirke]].

Tisvilde, alongside [[Hornbæk]] further to the east, has the highest prices of summer houses in Denmark. A 175 sqn summer house was sold for DKK22 mio. in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/#ia9728694;finans|title=Ny kæmpehandel på sommerhusmarkedet er blandt de dyreste nogensinde|language=Danish|website=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Tisvilde broken down to Tis-vilde, means "Ti's vælde" and have many interpretations. It can be understood as ''Where Tyr Reigns'' and the area is conceived as dedicated to the god [[Tyr]] in former ages. Ti is a common word for Tir (Týr) in Danish place names and can also mean God, without being specific about what God. "Væld" also means a ''spring'' and that spring is believed to be the spring known as Helene Spring nowadays. In addition "Væld" is also referring to the [[old Nordic]] word "ved" or "wald" meaning ''Forest''. Tisvilde was previously covered by extensive oak woods, before the sand drifts began. So all in all, Tisvilde has three parallel meanings: ''Where Tyr Reigns'', ''Tyrs Spring'' and ''Tyrs Forest''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The word Leje is used in several other place names in Denmark, such as [[Liseleje]] west of Tisvildeleje or Rågeleje and [[Gilleleje]] to the east.

====Tisvilde Hegn====
From around 1500, drifting sands began to bury the fields and farms around Tisvilde. The problem accelerated over the years and by 1700, most of the area had been deserted. Several attempts to counter the forces of nature, had been tried, but in 1724 the German [[Johan Ulrich Røhl]] was hired by the Crown and by help of the local peasants and 100 soldiers from Copenhagen, they managed to stop the dunes in the course of the 1730s, by covering them with [[seaweed]] and digging trenches. But while the dunes was successfully stopped in their march against civilisation, the sands had covered and transformed the countryside and made it completely barren. From around 1800 to 1900 this state was reversed, by planting the c. 1,300 ha forest&lt;ref name=GOE&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Tisvilde_Hegn Tisvilde Hegn] Gyldendals Open Encyclopedia {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; of '''Tisvilde Hegn''' in association with the plantations of Asserbo and Liseleje southwest.

*'''Helene Spring''' is one of Denmark's most famous springs, and legend has it that anyone whose illness has not responded successfully to other forms of treatment must come to the spring on 23 June (''[[John the Baptist|Sankt Hans]]'' Eve or Midsummer's Eve). Culturally, legend in Denmark has it that if one consumes a certain amount of water from its springs in the night and then stays at Saint Helene's grave until morning, he should be cured of all his sicknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/danmark/tisvildeleje-gdk702882 |title=Tisvildeleje |language=ln |publisher=VisitDenmark |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Tibirke Church''' was built on the site of an ancient "vi", a pre-Christian holy place. At the foot of the church near Bækkebrovej is a spring which may have been the place where pilgrims came in days of old. The church was originally the center of a small village with 10 farms, but they were all (including Tibirke Church) buried by drifting sand dunes and abandoned by order of the King in 1725.&lt;ref name=DNA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travbuddy.com/Tisvildeleje-travel-guide-923366 |title=Tisvildeleje Travel Guide |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Helene's Tomb''' is now a rectangular, grazed area surrounded by low stone fences. The two boulders leaning against each other indicate Helene's Tomb. It is located at Sankt Helenevej, 3220 Tisvildeleje.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tisvilde.dk/lokalraadet/minder.htm |title=historiske minder |publisher=Tisvilde.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211021454/http://www.tisvilde.dk/lokalraadet/minder.htm |archivedate=11 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and activities==
Being a popular summer destination for tourists, the level of activity is at its peak during the summer months. Examples are:

*Tisvilde flea market. Every Saturday throughout the summer a large, lively flea market (Tisvilde Loppemarked) is held in the Birkepladsen in front of Tisvildeleje station. The flea market is exclusively for private individuals, which means stalls full of unique finds from box-rooms and attics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/tisvildeleje/1968010031.html Tisvilde Loppemarked]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Musik i Lejet (English: ''Music in "Lejet"''). An annual outdoor music festival held each summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikilejet.dk/ |title=Musik i Lejet &amp;#124; Sommerens festival i Tisvildeleje |publisher=Musikilejet.dk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainability in chemical supply chains ==

Over the past few years sustainability aspects in the chemical industry have become more important and holistic. Nowadays, chemical companies’ measures focusing sustainability include apart from ecological aspects also social concerns and collaborative issues.

Today, it has been well accepted that the creation of sustainable chemical supply chains requires a joint effort beyond individual businesses. These efforts should integrate chemical companies, suppliers, customers as well as consumers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date = 2015 | title = Guide to Corporate Sustainability | url = https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/publications/UN_Global_Compact_Guide_to_Corporate_Sustainability.pdf | publisher = United Nations Global Compact | access-date = 18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Dr Wolfgang Stolze and Marc Müller of the University of St. Gallen summarize the development in the chemical industry in recent years as follows: “The scope of sustainability in the chemical industry has evolved from a firm-level construct with a strong focus on green aspects to a chain-level approach attempting to address the triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental elements.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= Prof. Dr. Martin Müller|date= 23 September 2016|title= Nachhaltige Lieferketten – Herausforderungen und Lösungsansätze ''(Sustainable supply chains - challenges and solutions)''|url= https://www.ranking-nachhaltigkeitsberichte.de/data/ranking/user_upload/2015/Präsentationen/Müller_Universitaet_Ulm_Nachhaltige_Lieferketten-Herausforderungen_und_Loesungsansätze.pdf|language= German|publisher= Ulm University|access-date= 14 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Together for Sustainability initiative was founded in 2011 by [[BASF]], [[Bayer]], [[Evonik Industries|Evonik]], [[Henkel]], [[Lanxess]], and [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay]]. The objective was to develop a global supplier engagement program and improve their own sustainability sourcing practices in line with the [[United Nations Global Compact]]. 

Since June 2012, TfS conducts  assessments and audits by independent experts, as well as the early partnership with the French company EcoVadis, which provided with sustainability scorecards and benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BASF, Bayer Among Chemical Firms Pushing Supply Chain Sustainability|url=https://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/10/basf-bayer-among-chemical-firms-pushing-supply-chain-sustainability/|publisher=Environmental Leader|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2015, the TfS initiative is incorporated as an international non-profit association according to the Belgian law. 

== Objectives ==

TfS has developed and implemented a global supplier engagement program that assesses sustainability sourcing practices, including ecological and social aspects. The focus in the supply chain of the member companies seeks to reduce inefficiencies and share best practices among the members' suppliers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New in Sustainability: Megatrends Driving Opportunity for Change |url=https://www.sdcexec.com/sustainability/blog/21011670/new-in-sustainability-megatrends-driving-opportunity-for-change|publisher=Supply and Demand Chain Executive|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Moreover TfS provides the framework for conducting assessments and audits across the chemical industry supply chain, organizes workshops, and provides e-learning tools. 

The TfS approach consists of two core elements: 
* TfS Assessments conducted by the French company EcoVadis, who provides scorecard on its shared, web-based collaborative platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supplychaindigital.com/logistics/necessity-sustainable-supply-chains|title=The necessity of sustainable supply chains|publisher=Supply Chain Digital|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and
* TfS Audits, conducted by independent audit companies approved by TfS

== Structure ==

The TfS is governed by two main organs, the General Assembly and the Steering Committee. 
The General Assembly is formed by all the [[Chief procurement officer|Chief Procurement Officers]] of the member companies, and holds power over the direction and structure of the organization, as well as approving the decisions of the Steering Committee. 
The Steering Committee, formed by six elected members of the General Assembly as well as the TfS president, is the executive council of the organization and decides upon its activities and projects.

Additionally, TfS has several Regional Operating Committees (Asia, United States and South America) as well as, currently, four mission-specific work streams led and staffed by participants from the TfS member companies:
* Work Stream 1: Governance and Mutual recognition
* Work Stream 2: Supplier Sustainability Assessments
* Work Stream 3: Supplier Sustainability Audits
* Work Stream 4: Communication and Awareness Raising

TfS’ headquarter is in [[Brussels]]. It manages the day-to-day affairs of the organization and stays in close contact with the representatives and coordinators of the member companies. 

TfS is working towards partnership with several other chemical industry associations: [[American Chemistry Council|American Chemistry Council (ACC)]], [[European Chemical Industry Council|European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)]], [[German Chemistry Council (VCI)]],  [[China petroleum and chemical|China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF)]], [[Indian Chemical Council (ICC)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sustainablebrands.com/press/together_sustainability_initiative_launched_india_chemical_industry|title=Together for Sustainability Initiative launched in India for Chemical Industry|publisher=Sustainable Brands|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[Associação Brasileira da Indústria Química (ABIQUIM)]]. 

== Members ==
Membership in the TfS is open to all companies in the chemical industry who subscribe to the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations Global Compact,]] [[Responsible Care]], and show a commitment to sustainability. TfS membership has been growing steadily since its founding, and in May 2018 its members had a joint global turnover of € 313 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Together for Sustainability: The Chemical Industry Initiative for Sustainable Supply Chains|url=http://www.essensciaforsustainability.be/planet/together-for-sustainability-the-chemical-industry-initiative-for-sustainable-supply-chains/|publisher=Essenscia for Sustainability|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2018, TfS has 22 member companies.

'''VRSS-2''' (Venezuelan Remote Sensing Satellite-2) is the second [[Venezuela]]n [[remote sensing]] satellite, and the third Venezuelan satellite after [[VRSS-1]]. It will be used to study Venezuelan territory and support planning, agriculture and disaster recovery. It was built and launched by the [[Chinese space programme|Chinese]] and has been named after Venezuelan revolutionary [[Antonio Jose de Sucre]].

==Satellite==



The satellite was built after a contract between Venezuela and China was signed in [[Caracas]] on 05 Oct 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firma del Contrato Satélite Antonio José de Sucre (Vrss-2)|url=http://www.abae.gob.ve/web/VRSS-2.php|publisher=ABAE|accessdate=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and follows from their previous collaboration on VRSS-1 Miranda Remote Sensing Satellite. The contract, worth $170 million [[USD]], The main contractor is [[China Great Wall Industry Corporation]] and the satellite is based on the CAST 2000 bus developed by the [[China Academy of Space Technology]]. 

The satellite contains two different cameras, High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Infrared Camera (IRC). The highest resolution band 0.98 mt GSD in [[panchromatic]], and 4 mts GSD in [[multispectral]]. The Infrared cameras have a resolution of (Long Wave) 60 mts and (Short Wave) 30 mts GSD, totaling 10 spectral bands. 

The satellite passes over Venezuela three or four times every 24 hours, covering the same area in 101 days at [[Nadir]]. Is operated from the Base Aeroespacial Capitán Manuel Ríos in [[El Sombrero]], [[Guárico]] state by Venezuela's [[Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities]], design   life span (5 years)

==Launch==

The satellite was launched in October 9th 2017 at 4:12 UTC from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center|Jiuquan Launch Centre]] in P.R China by a [[Long March 2D]] rocket, into a Sun Synchronous Descending [[Orbital node]] at 10:30am [[low earth orbit]]. It was given the [[international designator]] 2017-060A and  [[United States Space Command]] [[Satellite Catalog Number]] 42954.&lt;ref&gt;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=2017-060A&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Velvet season''' ({{lang-ru|Бархатный сезон}} {{lang-uk|Оксамитовий сезон}}) is a term&lt;ref&gt;http://kraevedenie.net/2009/08/04/velvet-season/&lt;/ref&gt; for one of the most comfortable parts of the year for people to live in the [[subtropics]], particularly in [[mediterranean climate]] conditions. During the velvet season, the weather is not as hot as it is in mid-summer months but is still quite warm, even at night. In northern latitudes dominated by a [[temperate climate]], an analog of "velvet season" is the [[Indian summer]].

== Origins of term ==
The term appeared in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] when it was fashionable to vacation in the [[Crimea]]. According to Alexander Levintov, at the beginning of the twentieth century "velvet season" referred to several weeks in April and May, when the court and the royal family moved from [[St. Petersburg]] to the Crimea. Fur clothes were replaced with velvet, as the Crimea at this time was still cool. The summer in the Crimea was called [[calico]] season and September called plys season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.port-folio.org/2004/part771.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its origins relate to the nobility, the velvet season came to have a more general meaning. It is better defined by the general public‘s tastes, behaviors, and morals than by those of the nobility. By the 1900s, people traveled for the velvet season because it was fashionable and they were hoping to meet people, rather than because the court was traveling.&lt;ref name=ohiolink&gt;https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1343701259&amp;disposition=inline&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known Russian author [[Alexander Kuprin]], described Velvet season in his 1914 short story "''The Wine Barrel''" (Винная Бочка):&lt;ref name=ohiolink/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the golden days for [[Yalta]], and, perhaps, for all of the [[Crimean coast]]. It lasts not more than a month and usually coincides with the [[Holy Week|last week]] of [[Great Lent]], [[Easter]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas']] Sunday. Some people come to get rid of sad necessity to do visits; others, as a newlywed, making their wedding trip; and the third, the majority, because in Yalta at this time gathers everything noble and rich, it is possible to express themselves with dress and beauty, strike up favorable acquaintances. The nature, of course, noticed by no one. And I must say that Crimea  is truly beautiful in this early spring time, all in white and pink frame of blooming apple trees, almonds, pears, peaches and apricots, is not dusty, not malodorous, refreshed by magical sea air. &lt;!-- Это золотые дни для Ялты, да, пожалуй, и для всего крымского побережья. Он продолжается не более месяца и обыкновенно совпадает с последней неделей Великого поста, с Пасхой и Фоминой неделей. Одни приезжают для того, чтобы избавиться от печальной необходимости делать визиты; другие — в качестве молодоженов, совершающих свадебную поездку; а третьи — их большинство — потому, что это модно, что в это время собирается в Ялте все знатное и богатое, что можно блеснуть туалетами и красотой, завязать выгодные знакомства. Природы, конечно, никто не замечает. А надо сказать, что именно в это раннее весеннее время Крым, весь в бело-розовой рамке цветущих яблонь, миндаля, груш, персиков и абрикосов, ещё не пыльный, не зловонный, освежённый волшебным морским воздухом, — поистине прекрасен. --&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it has proven impossible to determine the exact point in time, at some point, the velvet season switched from referring to the spring to the fall, overlapping with the wool/silk seasons in August and September.&lt;ref name=ohiolink/&gt;

[[File:Zagroda z Rożnowic (Rozenberg, 1858).JPG|thumb|A wattle fence at [[Muzeum Budownictwa Ludowego w Sanoku|Sanok-Skansen]] outdoor museum in [[Poland]]]]
'''Wattle''' is a lightweight construction material made by weaving thin branches (either whole, or more usually split) or [[:wikt:slat|slat]]s between upright stakes to form a woven lattice. It has commonly been used to make [[fence]]s and [[hurdle]]s for enclosing ground or handling livestock. The wattle may be made as loose panels, slotted between [[timber framing]] to make infill panels, or it may be made in place to form the whole of a fence or wall. The technique goes back to [[Neolithic]] times.

[[Image:Wattle hurdle under construction.JPG|right|175px|thumb|A wattle hurdle being made.]]

It forms the substructure of [[wattle and daub]], a [[composite material|composite]] [[building material]] used for making walls, in which ''wattle'' is ''daubed'' with a sticky material usually made of some combination of wet [[soil]], [[clay]], [[sand]], [[Feces|animal dung]] and straw.  Wattle and daub has been used for at least 6,000 years, and is still an important construction material in many parts of the world. This process is similar to modern [[lath and plaster]], a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of nailed wooden strips are covered with [[plaster]] smoothed into a flat surface.
Many historic buildings include wattle and daub construction, and the technique is becoming popular again in more developed areas as a low-impact [[sustainable building]] technique.

==Square panels==

[[Image:Wattle hurdle.JPG|right|175px|thumb|Wattle hurdle or panel.]]
Square panels are large, wide panels used as [[hurdle]]s or forming panelling in some later timber frame houses.  They have a square shape although sometimes they are triangular to accommodate arched or decorative bracing.  This style does require wattles to be woven for better support of the daub.

To insert wattles in a square panel several steps are required.  First, a series of evenly spaced holes are drilled along the middle of the inner face of each upper timber.  Next, a continuous groove is cut along the middle of each inner face of the lower timber in each panel. Vertical slender timbers, known as staves, are then inserted and these hold the whole panel within the timber frame.  The staves are positioned into the holes and then sprung into the grooves.  They must be placed with sufficient gaps to weave the flexible horizontal wattles.

[[File:500mb geopotential height wavenumber 4 Rossby wave (planetary waves) pattern. October 9-21, 2010 daily average.jpg|thumb|400px|right|500mb geopotential height averaged between October 9–21, 2010 illustrating Rossby wave pattern with the zonal wavenumber 4. [[Meteorological reanalysis|DOE AMIP reanalysis]] data.]]
In meteorological applications, a '''zonal wavenumber''' or '''hemispheric wavenumber''' is the [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless number]] of wavelengths fitting within a full circle around the globe at a given latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Main_Page |title=AMS Glossary |website=Glossary.ametsoc.org |date=2015-07-28 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{2\pi r\cos\varphi} \lambda &lt;/math&gt;
where ''λ'' is the wavelength, ''r'' is the Earth's radius, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude.

Zonal wavenumbers are typically counted on the upper level (say 500-[[millibar]]) [[Geopotential height|geopotential]] maps by identifying [[Trough (meteorology)|troughs]] and [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridges]] of the waves. Wavenumber 1 has one trough and one ridge, i.e. one wavelength fits &lt;math&gt;2\pi = 360&lt;/math&gt; degrees. Wavenumber 2 has two ridges and two troughs around 360 degrees.

Wavenumber 0 corresponds to zonal (symmetric) flow. Wavenumbers 1–6 are called long waves and often synonymous in meteorological literature with the mid-latitude planetary [[Rossby waves]].
