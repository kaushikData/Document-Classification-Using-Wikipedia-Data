{{Motorsport season

| next = 1985
}}

The '''1984 European Rallycross Championship season''' was the ninth season of the [[FIA European Rallycross Championship]] under that name and the twelfth season overall since it began as the [[Embassy/ERA European Rallycross Championship]]. It was held across nine rounds starting at the [[Nordring]] in [[Austria]] on April 8 and ending at the [[Lyngås Motorbane]] in [[Norway]] on October 7.

The champions were [[Anders Norstedt]] (Division 1) and [[Martin Schanche]] (Division 2). Schanche won six of the nine rounds on the Division 2 schedule to guarantee himself the title. In Division 1 Norstedt had an equal number of wins to his closest title rival [[Lars Nyström]]. The highest placed driver with no wins in any class was [[Olle Arnesson]], the Division 2 third-placer.

'''''Art Bell's Dark Matter''''' was an American [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] hosted by [[Radio presenter|broadcaster]] and [[author]] [[Art Bell]]. ''Dark Matter'' primarily focused on [[paranormal]] and [[science|scientific]] topics. The program was exclusive to [[Sirius XM Radio]], a subscription-based [[satellite radio]] service. ''Dark Matter'' debuted on September 16, 2013 and aired live Monday through Thursday from 10 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] to 2 a.m. ET on Sirius XM Radio's Indie Talk Channel 104. ''Dark Matter'' was the first program hosted by Art Bell full-time since his departure from regularly hosting ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' in 2003. On November 4, 2013, Bell announced that he was abruptly ceasing the production and airing of ''Dark Matter'' following a dispute with Sirius XM Radio regarding Sirius XM customers experiencing technical difficulties [[Streaming media|streaming]] his show live via the [[Internet]].

==Background and development==
Art Bell was the creator and former host of the late night [[talk show|radio talk show]] ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]''; he ceased being its regularly scheduled host in 2003,&lt;ref name="Las Vegas Sun 1"&gt;{{cite news | last  = Lapan | first  = Tovin | date  = September 13, 2013 | title  = Live from Pahrump: Art Bell, master of the paranormal, makes radio return Monday | url  = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/sep/13/live-pahrump-art-bell-master-paranormal-makes-radi/ | newspaper  = [[Las Vegas Sun]] | location  = [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] | accessdate  = October 20, 2013 | deadurl  = no | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019110229/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/sep/13/live-pahrump-art-bell-master-paranormal-makes-radi/ | archivedate  = October 19, 2013 | df  =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently continued to host occasional shows of ''Coast to Coast AM'', although due to events in his family and conflicts with [[Premiere Networks]] and the show's management team, he undertook a series of hiatuses from the show.&lt;ref name = "Las Vegas Sun 1"/&gt; Bell's final appearance on ''Coast to Coast AM'' was in 2010 when he hosted the program's annual [[Halloween]] show, "Ghost to Ghost."&lt;ref name = "Las Vegas Sun 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 1"&gt;{{cite news | last  = Dickey | first  = Jack | date  = September 16, 2013 | title  = Art Bell, Radio’s Most Popular Weirdo, Returns: Conspiracy-minded host starts satellite show 10 years after retirement | url  = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/09/16/art-bell-radios-most-popular-weirdo-returns/ | newspaper  = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | location  = [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]], [[Nevada]] | accessdate  = October 20, 2013 | deadurl  = no | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023004215/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/09/16/art-bell-radios-most-popular-weirdo-returns/ | archivedate  = October 23, 2013 | df  =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated Press 1"&gt;{{cite news | last  = Bauder | first  = David | date  = July 30, 2013 | title  = Radio's Art Bell returning with Sirius XM show | url  = http://bigstory.ap.org/article/radios-art-bell-returning-sirius-xm-show | agency  = [[Associated Press]] | location  = [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] | accessdate  = October 20, 2013 | deadurl  = no | archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630192231/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/radios-art-bell-returning-sirius-xm-show | archivedate  = June 30, 2014 | df  =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his departure, Premiere Networks continues to rebroadcast archival shows of ''Coast to Coast AM'' hosted by Bell entitled ''Somewhere in Time with Art Bell'', albeit against Bell's wishes.&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt;

In early 2013, after nearly a decade since Bell's departure from hosting ''Coast to Coast AM'' full-time, Bell was contacted through [[social media]] by a [[Sirius XM Radio]] representative about developing a new [[satellite radio]] talk show, which was later entitled ''Art Bell's Dark Matter''.&lt;ref name = "Associated Press 1"/&gt; Following the show's formal announcement on July 30, 2013,&lt;ref name="Sirius XM Radio 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.siriusxm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=781252 |title=Legendary Radio Personality Art Bell to Launch Exclusively on SiriusXM |work=Sirius XM Radio Investor Relations |publisher=[[Sirius XM Radio]] |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |date=July 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021014859/http://investor.siriusxm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=781252 |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sirius XM Radio president and chief content officer [[Scott Greenstein]] remarked that Bell's ''Dark Matter'' program would be "uncensored, unrestricted, uncluttered and utterly unique."&lt;ref name = "Associated Press 1"/&gt;

==Format and subject matter==
''Dark Matter'' aired live Monday through Thursday from 10 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] to 2 a.m. ET on Sirius XM Radio's Indie Talk Channel 104.&lt;ref name = "Las Vegas Sun 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sirius XM Radio 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Huffington Post 1"/&gt; It was rerun immediately following its live broadcasts, and was rerun during its regularly schedule hours on Friday through Sunday.&lt;ref name = "Las Vegas Sun 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Huffington Post 1"/&gt; Bell requested that Sirius XM Radio not replay the program's show during the daytime and restrict its re-airings to nighttime when "the mood is right."&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt; As was customary during his tenure on ''Coast to Coast AM'', Bell opened the program's phone lines for listeners to call in to ''Dark Matter''.&lt;ref name = "Sirius XM Radio 1"/&gt;

According to Sirius XM Radio, ''Dark Matter'' primarily focused on topics including: "the [[paranormal]], [[near-death experience]]s, [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], [[extraterrestrial life]] and the unusual."&lt;ref name = "Sirius XM Radio 1"/&gt;

Bell hosted ''Dark Matter'' from a new studio built by Sirius XM Radio in a guest house at his rural residence in [[Pahrump, Nevada|Pahrump]], [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name = "Las Vegas Sun 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Associated Press 1"/&gt; Bell enlisted former ''Coast to Coast AM'' [[announcer]] [[Ross Mitchell]] to create the program's introduction and [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]] announcements.&lt;ref name = "Time 1"/&gt; The [[radio producer]] for ''Dark Matter'' was Paul Bowman.&lt;ref name="Paul Bowman 1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/prbowman | title = Paul Bowman Twitter profile | work = Paul Bowman Twitter profile | publisher = [[Twitter]] | accessdate = October 20, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131030233514/https://twitter.com/prbowman | archivedate = October 30, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's associate producer Evan Winkofsky operated the boards from [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="Evan Winkofsky 1"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/Winkofsky | title = Evan Winkofsky Twitter profile | work = Evan Winkofsky Twitter profile | publisher = [[Twitter]] | accessdate = October 20, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026211842/https://twitter.com/Winkofsky | archivedate = October 26, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dark Matter'''s closing theme song was "Midnight in the Desert," which was written and performed by [[Crystal Gayle]] for Art Bell.&lt;ref name = "Huffington Post 1"/&gt;

==Planned Return to Production==
In the spring of 2015 Art Bell announced that his program would return to production on July 20, 2015 reborn as '''''Midnight in the Desert'''.''&lt;ref name="Art Bell Home"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artbell.com/ | title = Art Bell Midnight in the Desert | work = Art Bell - Midnight in the Desert | publisher = [[Art Bell]] | accessdate = June 29, 2015 | date = n.d. | quote = ART BELL RETURNING | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626000107/http://artbell.com/ | archivedate = June 26, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not be broadcast by [[Sirius XM Radio]]; instead it would be [[Streaming media#Live streaming|streamed live]] from midnight to 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone]], Monday through Friday, via a link on his website  or via the [[TuneIn]] app on a smartphone or tablet.&lt;ref name="Show FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artbell.com/art-bells-new-show-faq/ |title=Art Bell's New Show FAQ |work=Art Bell - Midnight in the Desert |publisher=[[Art Bell]] |accessdate=June 29, 2015 |date=June 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723070432/http://artbell.com/art-bells-new-show-faq/ |archivedate=July 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program would also be broadcast live by AM, FM, and shortwave terrestrial radio stations&lt;ref name="Radio Stations"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artbell.com/radio-stations/ | title = Radio Stations | work = Art Bell - Midnight in the Desert | publisher = [[Art Bell]] | accessdate = June 29, 2015 | date = n.d. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723070629/http://artbell.com/radio-stations/ | archivedate = July 23, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; agreeing to his terms&lt;ref name="Terrestrial Affiliates"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://artbell.com/terrestrial-affiliates-inquire-here/ | title = Terrestrial Affiliates Inquire Here | work = Art Bell - Midnight in the Desert | publisher = [[Art Bell]] | accessdate = June 29, 2015 | date = May 29, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723070932/http://artbell.com/terrestrial-affiliates-inquire-here/ | archivedate = July 23, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; for relaying the Internet stream.
On December 11, 2015, Bell announced that he had permanently stepped down as host of Midnight in the Desert due to concerns about his family's safety (Bell had reported multiple instances of someone shooting firearms at and near his property in the Fall of 2015). The show Midnight in the Desert was then taken over by Heather Wade (Bell made occasional guest host appearances) for about 2 1/2 years.

Following the death of Art Bell on Friday April 13th, 2018 Heather Wade parted ways with the program and now Midnight In the Desert currently continues with new host Dave Schrader. (May 7, 2018- Current)

'''Astroŭna''' ({{lang-be|Астроўна}}, {{lang-ru|Островно}}, {{lang-pl|Ostrowno}}) is a village in [[Belarus]]. It is located in the [[Beshankovichy District|Beshankovichy Raion]] of [[Vitebsk Region]], 15&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Vitebsk]]. Astroŭna is a birthplace of [[Lew Sapieha]], statesman of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and creator of the [[Statutes of Lithuania#Third Statute|Third Lithuanian Statute]].

== History ==
[[File:Astroŭna. Астроўна (C. Faber du Faur, 1.08.1812).jpg|thumb|left|Near Astroŭna by [[Christian Wilhelm von Faber du Faur|C. Faber du Faur]], 1.08.1812 г.]]
The village was founded as a castle of Ivan Sapieha between years 1520 and 1530. At that time the land belonged to Palonnaja manor of Vitebsk paviet&lt;ref&gt;[[Вячаслаў Насевіч|Насевіч В.]] Віцебскі павет // {{Літаратура/ЭВКЛ|1к}} С. 455—456.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and was inherited by Ivan and his brother Janush from their mother, duchess Feodora Druck-Sakalinskaja. In 1546 a village was founded near the castle. For the next hundred years or so Astroŭna was a property of [[Sapieha|Sapieha family]].

In 1622 a Dominican monastery was founded by Alexander Sapieha. After his death part of the manor was inherited by his daughter Anna and her husband Stanislaw Narushevich.

After the first [[Partitions of Poland|partition of Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] Astroŭna became a part of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1812 [[Battle of Ostrovno]] took place on the outskirts of the village between French and Russian armies.

At the end of the 19th century there were about 70 houses in the village, in the beginning of the 20th century — about 120 houses. After the [[October Revolution]] Astroŭna became a part of [[Belarusian SSR]].

Now it's a village in Beshankovichy Raion, Belarus. In 2005 Astroŭna joined the state program for rural development and became an [[Agrotown (Belarus)|agrotown]].

'''''Back to Babylon''''' ({{lang-ar|العودة إلى بابل}}, {{lang-fr|Retour à Babylone}}) is a documentary film directed by the [[Iraq]]i-[[France|French]] film director [[Abbas Fahdel]].

==Synopsis==

Back in his home town of [[Babylon]] after a long exile, the Iraqi-born director [[Abbas Fahdel]] asks himself:  "''What has become of my friends?  What has life here made of them?  What would life here have made of me had I not decided to follow the course of destiny elsewhere''?" In his search and inquiries, his encounters with the friends of his youth, it is the situation today in Iraq that is revealed through the camera's eye:  the ravages of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s dictatorship, the after-effects of the [[Iran-Iraq war]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[embargo]] imposed by the [[United Nations]].

==Quotes==
Abbas Fahdel (voice-over): "''The past, with its overwhelming splendour and its scents of paradise lost, is too painful for Iraqis to bear. I recall my father reciting the poet Al-Rissafi: "We are not masters of our miserable present / On men of a foregone age / The face of time once smiled / But on seeing us, it darkened''."

'''Basque Workers' Solidarity''' (in [[Basque language|Basque]]: ''Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna'' (ELA), in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos''(STV)) is the most influential [[trade union]] in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], having been created, as ''Solidaridad de Obreros Vascos'', by members of the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] on June 10, 1911, in [[Bilbao]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskonews.com/0036zbk/efem3601.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
[[File:Ela-stv.jpg|right|thumb|ELA-STV publication from 1971]]
It was opposed to the influence of trade unions who appealed to a [[working class]] [[ethos]] ([[Socialist]] [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] and [[Anarchist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]), advocating instead a [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] outlook. Initially, ELA-STV was centered on projects of mutual assistance between its affiliates, as a vehicle for [[social security]]. It expanded with much more success in [[Guipúzcoa]] and [[Biscay]] than in [[Navarre]] and [[Álava]].

ELA-STV was caught in the fighting of the [[Spanish Civil War]], and banned by the [[Francoist State]]. It reemerged in 1976, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]]. Today, it has over 105,000 members.

In the 70's ELA abandoned its original [[christian democracy|social-christian]] ideology in favour of more [[Socialism|socialist]] positions, recognizing the importance and validity of the [[class struggle]], breaking with the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] and approaching [[LAB (Basque union)|LAB]].

In the General Congress of 1976 ELA-STV approved the new principles and rules of the union, which will become its identity: ELA was a [[Basque people|Basque]] national and [[Working class|class union]], independent from all political parties, open to all workers of [[Euskal Herria]], economic independence (funding only through membership fees, not accepting public money), incompatibility of positions, confederal basis, creating a common resistance fund, international solidarity, etc. This line will be ratified and will gain further in the coming Congress. During transition ELA was against to [[Pacts of La Moncloa]]. The pro-[[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]] and anti-socialist wing of the union split and formed [[Eusko Langillen Alkartasuna (Askatuta) – Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos (Independiente)]] (ELA (a)-STV (i)), which would disappear in 1990.

The '''Battle of the Hill of the Jews''' (named by [[Miguel de Castanhoso]] for a community of [[Beta Israel]] who lived there&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Whiteway, editor and translator, ''The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1441-1543'', 1902. (Nendeln, Liechtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1967), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;) was a battle fought in [[Ethiopia]] in August 1542 between the Portuguese forces of [[Cristóvão da Gama]] and the Adal [[Muslim]] followers of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]]. The Portuguese won the battle, capturing many horses that they could have used to exploit their victory in the previous [[battle of Jarte]]. 

The benefits of this victory were short-lived, for within the month da Gama was slain in [[Battle of Wofla|Wofla]] even before his soldiers escorting the captured animals could reach the Portuguese encampment at [[Lake Ashenge]].

The location of this battle is not known. Whiteway has argued that this place is identical with [[Amba Geshen]], located far to the south of the Portuguese camp.&lt;ref&gt;Whiteway, ''Portuguese Expedition'', pp. lvii-lxii&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, C.F. Beckingham has argued that the battle took place in the eastern [[Semien Mountains]] near the left bank of the [[Tekezé River]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckingham, "A Note on the topography of Ahmad Gragn's campaigns in 1542", ''Journal of Semitic Studies'', '''4''' (1959), pp. 362-373&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarinet Contrast''' was a [[clarinet]] ensemble with rhythm group led by clarinetist [[Theo Jörgensmann]].

The group, which included members from four countries, existed from 1975 to 1977 and had awakened the interest in the  contemporary jazzscene for the clarinet &lt;ref&gt;Festival-article by Ulrich Olshausen in ''Infoblatt [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]'', 1976&lt;/ref&gt; and was also one of the participants in the clarinet Renaissance in jazz and improvised music scene.&lt;ref&gt;The clarinet seems to be having a worldwide jazz revival. [[Joachim-Ernst Berendt]]; [[Down Beat]] 2/1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The band members were the clarinetists Theo Jörgensmann, [[Bernd Konrad]], [[Perry Robinson]], [[Hans Kumpf]], [[Michel Pilz]] so as [[Günter Lenz]], bass and [[Peter Giger]], drums. Occasionally the clarinetists [[Gunter Hampel]] and [[Willem Breuker]] performed with ''Clarinet Contrast''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7840">The '''Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars''' ('''CCAS''') was founded in 1968 by a group of graduate students and younger faculty as part of the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the American participation in the Vietnam War]]. They proposed a "radical critique of the assumptions which got us [The United States] into Indo-China and were keeping us from getting out".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cohen, ''Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past'' (New York, London:: Columbia University Press,  1984): p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The caucus was held at the [[Association for Asian Studies]] convention in Philadelphia, but was a radical critique of that professional association's values, organization, and leadership. The group was largely formed due to the Association for Asian Studies lack of public stance on the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=Baum /&gt; Most of the original members were graduate students or junior faculty in [[Area Studies]] programs at Harvard, Stanford, University of Michigan, University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University, although there were also [[independent scholar]]s and those with no affiliation in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Madsen, ''China and the American Dream: A Moral Inquiry'' (Berkeley: University of California Press,  1995): 153-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 1969, the group passed the following Statement of Purpose: 
: We first came together in opposition to the brutal aggression of the United States in Vietnam and to the complicity or silence of our profession with regard to that policy. Those in the field of Asian studies bear responsibility for the consequences of their research and the political posture of their profession. We are concerned about the present unwillingness of specialists to speak out against the implications of an Asian policy committed to ensuring American domination of much of Asia. We reject the legitimacy of this aim, and attempt to change this policy. We recognize that the present structure of the profession has often perverted scholarship and alienated many people in the field.

: The Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars seeks to develop a humane and knowledgeable understanding of Asian societies and their efforts to maintain cultural integrity and to confront such problems as poverty, oppression, and imperialism. We realize that to be students of other peoples, we must first understand our relations to them. CCAS wishes to create alternatives to the prevailing trends in scholarship on Asia, which too often spring from a parochial cultural perspective and serve selfish interests and expansionism. Our organization is designed to function as a catalyst, a communications network for both Asian and Western scholars, a provider of central resources for local chapters, and a community for the development of anti-imperialist research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criticalasianstudies.org/about-us/bcas-founding-statement.html BCAS Founding Statement 30 March, 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluations and debates==

Richard Madsen of the [[University of California at San Diego]] sees the CCAS as part of a long line of populist criticism of academia, in this case projecting their values onto Mao's China. As  graduate students, some of whom were in danger of being shipped off to Vietnam, "they identified themselves with the oppressed and saw the [[Cultural Revolution]] as a populist revolution expressing the aspirations of people like themselves." Their understandings of China, Madsen concludes, did not explain that cataclysmic event any more adequately than the social science theories they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Madsen, "The Academic China Specialists," in ''American Studies of Contemporary China'' (New York: ME Sharpe, 1993):  167-170. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=tIQOv2vnCFIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=jim+peck+harvard+and+imperialism&amp;ots=F-yYSggm-N&amp;sig=drM7dCn1m-4UmLTO3BQ0kbTSGS0#v=onepage&amp;q=jim%20peck%20harvard%20and%20imperialism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Baum of [[University of California at Los Angeles]] claimed that the CCAS anti-establishment stance had a polarizing effect on the field, that its early members promoted [[Maoist]] doctrine uncritically. He continued that CCAS made ludicrous claims such as all U.S.-government funded academic pursuits were being manipulated by the U.S. government if they were not outright forms of espionage, a stance quickly espoused by the P.R.C. which led to distrust and suspicion between P.R.C. representatives and academics.&lt;ref name=Baum&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Richard|title=China Watcher: Confessions of a Peking Tom|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle &amp; London|pages=236–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the song festival was born along with [[Estonian national awakening]]. The first national song festival was held in [[Tartu]] in the summer of 1869.&lt;ref name=celebrations /&gt; One of the organisers of the first song festival was [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]]. In the first three festivals only men's choirs and brass orchestras participated. 822 singers and 56 brass players participated in the first festival. Starting with the fourth festival, mixed choirs were also participating. Starting with the sixth festival in 1896, the festival tradition moved to Tallinn.

Starting from 1947, the Soviet authorities forced foreign songs into the repertoire. Every event was to include the [[Anthem of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|State Anthem of the Estonian SSR]], [[The Internationale]], and the [[State Anthem of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=celebrations /&gt; Because of the inclusion of children's and boys' choirs the total number of participants rose to 25,000 – 30,000 people. The Dance and Gymnastic Festival of the First Estonian Games started in 1934 became predecessors of later National Dance Festivals accompanying the song festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einst.ee/culture/I_MMIV/plakso.html Dance Festival – Invented Tradition?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610015943/http://www.einst.ee/culture/I_MMIV/plakso.html |date=10 June 2007 }} by Marika Plakso.

The '''Free City of Danzig''', sometimes referred to as the '''Republic of Danzig''', was a semi-independent [[city-state]] established by [[Napoleon]] on 9 September 1807, during the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] following the capture of the city in the [[Siege of Danzig (1807)|Siege of Danzig]] in May. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814/5, Danzig was re-incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

[[File:Duchy of Warsaw and Republic of Danzig.JPG|thumb|left|Free City of Danzig (yellow) on the Baltic coast, surrounded by Prussia, with Duchy of Warsaw to the south]]
Prussia had acquired the City of Danzig in the course of the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793. After the defeat of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] at the 1806 [[Battle of Jena–Auerstedt]], according to the Franco-Prussian [[Treaties of Tilsit|Treaty of Tilsit]] of 9 July 1807, the territory of the [[free state (government)|free state]] was carved out from lands that made up part of the [[West Prussia]] province. It consisted of the city of Danzig (now [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) along with its rural surroundings on the mouth of [[Vistula]] including [[Oliwa|Oliva]], together with the [[Hel Peninsula]] and its [[Lighthouse in Hel|lighthouse]] as well as the southern half of the [[Vistula Spit]] up to [[Narmeln]].

The Republic was officially proclaimed on 21 July 1807, after the [[First French Empire|French]] troops had handed over the city on May 27. Prussia and the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] under [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony|Frederick Augustus I]], also [[Duchy of Warsaw|Duke of Warsaw]], were appointed guarantee powers. Marshal [[François Joseph Lefebvre]], commander of the Danzig siege, received the honorific title of ''{{lang|fr|Duc de Danzig}}'' from the hands of Napoleon, however, the actual ruler of the city was the French governor General [[Jean Rapp]]. The citizens had to accommodate Napoleon's {{lang|fr|[[Grande Armée]]}} forces and to pay large tributes in the preparation of the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.

After the French retreat, the [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Russian]] forces [[Siege of Danzig (1813)|laid siege]] to the city from late January to 29 November 1813, and the remaining {{circa}} 40,000 French soldiers finally withdrew on 2 January 1814. Although the Prussian authorities made it the capital of West Prussia and the administrative centre of the {{lang|de|[[Danzig (region)|Regierungsbezirk Danzig]]}}, the autonomy of the city was significantly reduced.

'''Gjakova Airport AMIKO''' ({{lang-sq|Aeroporti i Gjakovës}}, {{lang-sr|Аеродром Ђаковица/}}''Aerodrom Đakovica'') is an [[airport]] in village Lugbunar, near [[Gjakova]] in western [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}}. The airport is expected to become public in the following years, to be used by [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] [[Airline|commercial airlines]] and [[Cargo airline|cargo flights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeroporti i Kosovës në Gjakovë për cargo, çmime të lira dhe trajnime për pilotë|url=http://old.zeri.info/artikulli/23276/aeroporti-i-kosoves-ne-gjakove-per-cargo-cmime-te-lira-dhe-trajnime-per-pilote|publisher=Zëri.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeroporti Gjakovë, news report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USrw8Ew5m_A|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The airport was built by the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) following the 1999 [[Kosovo War]], next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights. On 18 December 2013, the airport was handed over to the [[Government of Kosovo]] from the [[Italian Air Force]]. Under Italian Air Force operations, Gjakova Airfield handled more than 27,000 aircraft, 220,000 passengers and the carriage of more than 40,000 tons of cargo.&lt;ref name="Aeroporto AMIKO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/News/Pagine/Passaggiodiresponsabilit%C3%A0Autorit%C3%A0kosovareaeroportoAMIKO_191213.aspx |title=Aeroporto AMIKO: passaggio di responsabilità |publisher=Ministry of Defense, Republic of Italy |accessdate=18 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101022700/http://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/News/Pagine/Passaggiodiresponsabilit%C3%A0Autorit%C3%A0kosovareaeroportoAMIKO_191213.aspx |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local and national government plans to offer Gjakova Airport for operation under a public-private partnership with the aim of turning it into a civilian and commercial airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aktivitetet e Ministrisë së Tregtisë dhe Industrisë: Themelohet Ndërmarrja Publike "Aeroporti i Gjakovës"|url=http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|publisher=Ministria e Tregtisë dhe Industrisë|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227170445/http://www.mti-ks.org/sq/Aktivitetet-e-MTI-se/Themelohet-Ndermarrja-Publike-Aeroporti-i-Gjakoves-2882-2882|archivedate=2015-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, the airport is reported as closed by the Kosovo authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caa-ks.org/images/stories/docs/English/tjera/AIP/AIP%20AD%20072015.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

The Global Mayors’ Forum (GMF) is a three-day international conference held annually by the GMF Council on the topic of urban development.&lt;ref&gt;http://gb.cri.cn/18944/2008/04/23/882@2031110.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The forum focuses on issues related to [[sustainable development]] but also covers other issues including international cooperation, modern development practices, public relations, hosting large scale activities and other topics in the fields of [[urban planning]], [[economics]] and [[international relations]]. The Global Mayors’ Forum is divided into several conference sessions, forum sessions and meetings. These various sessions have different focuses but are all related to the theme of the GMF for that year. For each conference a new host city is selected by the GMF Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/1974765.htm Baidu Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Planning for the first Global Mayors’ Forum began in 2005 after many months of consideration.     The goal of the Global Mayors’ Forum was to transcend national and institutional barriers by bring together participants from the public and private sectors.  Additionally participants would be recruited from around the globe in order to bring together participants from disparate geographic areas. The GMF council met for the first time in 2008 to discuss and plan the GMF 2009.  The inaugural GMF was to be held in [[Hong Kong]] in 2009 but this conference was called off due to the [[H1N1|H1N1 epidemic]]. In 2010 Zhuhai's was named as  the host city for the 2011 and 2012 GMF conferences.

==Global Mayors' Forum 2011==

The theme for the GMF 2011 is “Road to Rio +20” in reference to the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]]. Like the Rio +20 conference, the GMF 2011 will be focused on sustainable development and the development of a [[green economy]]. The  GMF 2011 will be held in Zhuhai, China. This city was selected by the five organizing institutions to host the 2011 GMF for its unique history and sustainable development practices.  Zhuhai was one of the first Chinese cities to be designated a Special Economic Zone in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zhuhai.gov.cn/english/SurveyofRomanticZhuhai/DevelopmentofZhuhai/200708/t20070808_14736.htm Zhuhai Government website]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of embracing the challenges of modernization, Zhuhai has grown from a small village to a major economic and transportation hub. Zhuhai will host all sessions of the Global Mayors’ Forum 2011, including the China Sustainable Development Forum and the Six-Party Forum.

=== China Sustainable Development Forum ===
The GMF 2011 will begin with the China Sustainable Development Forum which is to be hosted by the Chinese Society for Sustainable Development (CSSD). The topic of this forum is sustainable development in the [[People’s Republic of China]]. One of the keynote speeches will be given by Madam [[Deng Nan]], former vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission and daughter of former Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]].

=== Six-Party Forum ===
The feature form of the GMF 2011 is the Six-Party Forum. The six parties refer to participants and attendees from six different fields, namely:
*government officials
*non-governmental officials 
*business leaders/entrepreneurs 
*scholars/academics
*student representatives 
*the global press. 
The six party forums is co-hosted by the [[International Mayor Communication Centre]] and the Chinese Society for Sustainable Development. Due to CSSD’s consultative status with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), the results of this forum will be reported to ECOSOC for consideration during the Rio +20 Conference in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

==Global Mayors' Forum 2012==
As part of Zhuhai's winning bid they also received the right to host the 2012 Global Mayors forum. This forum does not yet have an official theme or date. The Global Mayors' Forum 2012 will feature the Mayors' Forum.

=== Mayors’ Forum ===
The Mayors’ Forum was set up for all the mayors and governors attending the GMF 2011. The theme for this forum has not yet been decided. Mayors from all over the world will be given a platform to exchange ideas, policies and practices that they have invested in or are interested in.

=== Others ===
Other activities for attendees include a Roundtable Meeting to match mayors and governors with business leaders who can offer solutions the sustainable development challenges encountered by governments. Additionally, the GMF 2011 will feature City Promotion and Project Presentation sessions for city officials, investors and corporations.

[[Magyar Televízió|MTV]] chose 15 artists (out of 30) to perform their song on Hungarian National Final.
Every artists had to send the song in Hungarian and in English as well, so all of the songs in NF were in Hungarian, but the winner was sung in English in Serbia.

The hosts were [[Éva Novodomszky]] and [[Levente Harsányi]].

The jury gave 1 to 10 points to the songs, and the televoting also made a rank for the songs. The first song on each list got 15 points. The total score decided the winner. In case of a tie, the televotes decided.
The winner was [[Csézy]] with the song "Szívverés".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10449|title=Hungary decided: Csézy to Eurovision!|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2008-02-08|publisher=''EscToday.com''|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later the new English version "[[Candlelight (Csézy song)|Candlelight]]" was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/10485 |title=Hungary: Csézy to perform in English in Belgrade |last=Floras |first=Stella |date=2008-02-11 |publisher=''EscToday.com'' |accessdate=2010-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131123800/http://esctoday.com/news/read/10485 |archivedate=2010-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At Eurovision==
In previous years, if a country placed in the top 10 countries in the final they automatically qualified to the final of the next contest. Had this rule remained for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]], Hungary would have directly qualified for the final. However, a change in rules due to the large intake of countries participating in the contest meant that only five countries, the host country and the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Big 4|Big 4]] countries, would automatically qualify to the final. As such, Hungary were forced to compete in one of the two semi-finals of the 2008 contest in [[Serbia]].
She competed in the second semi-final on May 22, performing fifteenth. She placed nineteenth and last with six points, getting four points from [[Serbia]], one from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and one from [[Denmark]].

'''Intelsat III F-1''' was a [[communications satellite]] intended to be operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched towards [[geostationary orbit]] in 1968 it failed to achieve orbit.

[[Image:Delta-M launching Intelsat-3 satellite.jpg|thumb|left|caption|190px|Launch of Intelsat III F-1.]]
The first of eight [[Intelsat III]] satellites to be launched, Intelsat III F-1 was built by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]]. It was a {{convert|293|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft equipped with two [[transponder]]s to be powered by body-mounted solar cells generating 183&amp;nbsp;watts of power.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/intlsat3.htm|title=Intelsat 3|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a design life of five years and carried an [[SVM-2]] [[apogee motor]] for propulsion..&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-3.htm|title=Intelsat-3|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
Intelsat III F-1 was launched on the maiden flight of the [[Delta M]] rocket, flying from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The launch took place at 00:09:00 UTC on September 19, 1968, with the spacecraft bound for a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt;

Twenty seconds after liftoff a fault became apparent in the gyroscope used to monitor the rate at which the rocket [[pitch (aeronautics)|pitched]] over. Control of the rocket was subsequently lost, with it beginning to disintegrate around 102 seconds into the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/thorh9.html|title=Long Tank Thor-Delta|first=Ed|last=Kyle|work=Space Launch Report|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 108 seconds after launch the rocket was destroyed by [[range safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/thrfail.txt|title=Thor-Based Space Launch History|first=Ed|last=Kyle|work=Space Launch Report|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its basic objective was to decrease the loss of life, property destruction and social and economic disruption caused by [[natural disaster]]s, such as [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, [[droughts]], [[locust]] infestations, and other disasters of natural origin.

An International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, beginning on 1 January 1990, was launched by the [http://un.org/ United Nations], following the adoption of Resolution 44/236 (22 December 1989). The decade was intended to reduce, through concerted international action, especially in developing countries, loss of life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters. To support the activities of the decade, a Secretariat was established at the United Nations Office in Geneva, in close association with UNDRO.

"'''Jestem'''"  is a song sung, written and composed by [[Magdalena Tul]], who represented [[Poland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Poland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]] in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://esctoday.com/news/read/16772 Magdalena Tul is going to represent Poland in the ESC 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=9971 Poland Decided:  Magdalena Tul to Dusseldorf!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318055257/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=9971 |date=2011-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magdalena won the national final (Krajowe Eliminacje 2011) with 44.47%, a record in past years, leaving the second place with nearly half of her percentage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://escdaily.com/articles/12377 Magdalena Tul, wins!]&lt;/ref&gt; An English version of the song titled ''"First Class Ticket to Heaven"'' was announced as the version to enter Eurovision, but this decision was reversed and the Polish version competed. Later, another English version was released under the title ''"Present"''.

In Eurovision, "Jestem" placed last in the first semifinal, not qualifying for the final for the third consecutive year.

The '''Lincolnshire Poacher''' was a powerful [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] [[numbers station]] that transmitted from Cyprus from the mid-1970s to June 2008. The station gained its commonly known name as it uses [[Bar (music)|bars]] from the English folk song "[[The Lincolnshire Poacher]]" as an [[interval signal]].  The [[radio station]] was believed to be operated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and emanated from the island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="E03 The LincolnShire Poacher"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.numbers-stations.com/E03 |title=E03 The LincolnShire Poacher |accessdate=6 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur [[Radio Direction Finding|direction finding]] linked it with the [[Royal Air Force]] base at [[RAF Akrotiri|Akrotiri]], [[Cyprus]], where several [[HRS antenna|curtain antennas]] had been identified as being its transmitter.&lt;ref name="Numbers"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lincolnshire Poacher | publisher = Numbers and Oddities | url = http://www.numbersoddities.nl | accessdate = 2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of an electronically synthesised English-accented female voice reading groups of five numbers: e.g. '0-2-5-8-8'. The final number in each group was spoken at a higher pitch. It is likely that the station was used to communicate to undercover agents (spies) operating in other countries, to be decoded using a [[one-time pad]].&lt;ref name="simonmason"&gt;{{cite web | title =  The Lincolnshire Poacher | author = Simon Mason | url = http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page14.html | accessdate = 2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Asian numbers station of identical format is believed to have been broadcast from [[Australia]], and nicknamed "[[Cherry Ripe (numbers station)|Cherry Ripe]]". It uses several bars from the English folk song of the same name as its interval signal.&lt;ref name="simonmason" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spynumberscr"&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile of Cherry Ripe | publisher = Spynumbers | url = http://www.spynumbers.com/profiles/index.html?ENIGMA=E4 | accessdate = 2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry Ripe continued to be on-air until December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvni.net/radio/nsnl/nsnl147/nsnl147vs.html Hundred forty-seventh edition of the N&amp;O column / Spooks newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The precise date that the Lincolnshire Poacher began broadcasting is unknown; however, it is estimated that the broadcasts started around the early to mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonmason.karoo.net/page14.html|title=E3 Lincolnshire Poacher|last=Mason|first=Simon|date=30 October 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While numbers stations have existed since [[World War I]] (making them some of the earliest radio transmissions{{cn|date=September 2015}}) numbers stations such as Lincolnshire Poacher began appearing during the [[Cold War]], when nations such as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United Kingdom]] needed to send messages discreetly to their operatives in other countries.&lt;ref name="esq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/numbers-station-07-31-08|title=Secrets in the Static|last=Pepitone|first=Juilanne|date=31 July 2008|publisher=[[Esquire Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the Cold War, the number of numbers stations greatly decreased.&lt;ref name="esq"/&gt; The Lincolnshire Poacher remained operating after the end of the Cold War, and continued to be broadcast into the next two decades.&lt;ref name="simonmason"/&gt;
[[File:Map of Akrotiri-en.svg|thumb|left|220px|Akrotiri, Cyprus, the believed location of the Lincolnshire Poacher's broadcasts and radio antennas.]]

The Lincolnshire Poacher stopped broadcasting in July 2008. The last recorded transmission of the station was on 29 June 2008.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt; It is believed that the station's sister station, [[Cherry Ripe (numbers station)|Cherry Ripe]], began to send broadcasts that used to be intended to be sent over the Lincolnshire Poacher station.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt; This is believed to be true because the "Cherry Ripe" station used a very similar call signal, and broadcast its messages in 200 sets of five-number IDs.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt;  In 2013 ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' published an article suggesting the Lincolnshire Poacher had moved from radio to telephone, publishing a phone number registered in [[Aldershot]], and a recording of a call to the number which featured the distinctive interval signal followed by fifteen groups of five number sequences.&lt;ref name="Switched to the Telephone network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/features/report/4903/we-called-a-secret-mi6-phone-number/|title=We called a secret MI6 phone number|last=Cook|first=James|date=5 September 2013|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A follow up article was published a day later which highlighted the sudden removal of the communication system.  Instead of hearing two bars of the classic English folk tune, callers were instead relayed a message telling them to use “backup channel romeo x-ray three nine”, followed by “end”.  Text messages were received by the reporters stating the telephone number was restricted, asking them not to call it again.&lt;ref name="Phone Number Dead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/features/report/4947/did-we-take-out-mi6s-secret-line/|title=Did we take out MI6’s secret line?|last=Cook|first=James|date=6 September 2013|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location ===

Although the usage of numbers stations has not been confirmed by any world government, amateur enthusiasts have traced the location of the Lincolnshire Poacher's signal transmission to [[RAF Akrotiri]], a [[Royal Air Force]] base located on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref name="E03 The LincolnShire Poacher"/&gt; The station is believed to have been operated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service]] ([[MI6]]) and maintained by the Royal Air Force members that occupy the base in Cyprus.&lt;ref name="mason"/&gt;

==Broadcast schedule==
The Lincolnshire Poacher was broadcast several times throughout the day, and was transmitted seven days a week, at various times and on various shortwave frequencies. This schedule was accurate as of January 2006, which is the most recent update to the broadcast schedule. All times are [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), and all radio frequencies in [[megahertz]] (MHz).&lt;ref name="simonmason" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">'''Lower Slobbovia''' (also sometimes called '''Outer, Inner, Central, Upper''' or '''Lowest Slobbovia''') is a term used in conversation to denote a place which is underdeveloped, socially backward, remote, impoverished or unenlightened. First coined by [[Al Capp]] in 1946, the term has also been used by Americans to refer in an informal way to any foreign country of no particular distinction.

==Origin==
The term was created by cartoonist Al Capp to refer to a setting in his classic [[hillbilly]] [[comic strip]], ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' (1934–1977).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=bios.slobbovia "Biography" of Lower Slobbovia]&lt;/ref&gt; Making its first appearance on April 4, 1946, frigid, faraway Lower Slobbovia was fashioned as a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,778805,00.html Escape From Utopia - ''TIME'' Oct. 7, 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; The term, having entered the language, remains a contemporary reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&amp;#39;NY Times'&amp;#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1996-01-13 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Li'l Abner'', the hapless residents of Lower Slobbovia were perpetually waist-deep in snow, and icicles hung from every frostbitten nose. The favorite dish of the starving natives was raw polar bear (and vice versa). Lower Slobbovians spoke with [[burlesque]] [[pidgin]]-[[Russians|Russian]] accents; the miserable frozen wasteland of Capp's invention abounded in incongruous [[Yiddish]] humor. General Bullmoose or Senator Jack S. Phogbound—Capp's caricatures of ruthless business interests and corrupt political interests, respectively—were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of ''haves'' versus ''have-nots''.

Capp conceived Slobbovia as a large iceberg. As real icebergs at intervals have their larger subsea components erode away, causing genuine icebergs to invert, so Slobbovia periodically overturned, making Upper Slobbovia into Lower Slobbovia &amp; vice versa. Upper Slobbovia was the only habitat of the Schmeagles, birds who flew so fast they could not be seen.

Conceptually based on [[Siberia]], or perhaps specifically on [[Birobidzhan]], Capp's icy hellhole was ruled by King Stubbornovsky the Last (a.k.a. Good King Nogoodnik). The Slobbovian politicians were even more corrupt than their [[Dogpatch]] counterparts. Their monetary unit was the "Rasbucknik", of which one was worth nothing, and a large quantity was worth even less, due to the trouble of lugging them around. Conditions couldn't be worse, as tourists were readily assured by the miserable, highly vocal residents.

Besides biting political satire, Capp employed black humor, irony, social commentary, parody and slapstick in his Slobbovia stories; the series featured many memorable moments over the years. [[Basil Wolverton|Lena the Hyena]] was a resident of Lower Slobbovia, as was Slobbovian correspondent Quentin Rasputinreynolds (a parody of [[World War II]] journalist [[Quentin Reynolds]]). The local children were read harrowing tales from ''Ice-sop's Fables'', which were parodies of classic literary fables (with titles like "Goldilocks and the Three Bares" and "Liddle Blue Ridink Hood"), but with a darkly sardonic twist.

Liddle Noodnik, a local waif, was frequently employed to recite a farcical poem of greeting to visiting dignitaries, or sing the absurd Slobbovian national anthem:

{{quote|
We are citizens of Slobbovia&lt;br&gt;
(Oh, that this should be happening to us!)&lt;br&gt;
We are giving you back to the Indians&lt;br&gt;
(But they are refusing, of cuss!)

PTUI on you, Slobbovia!&lt;br&gt;
We are hating your icebound coast&lt;br&gt;
Of all the countries in the world&lt;br&gt;
WE ARE HATING SLOBBOVIA MOST!!}}

On August 13, 1950, the steamer '''''Mayakovsky''''' (named for Soviet poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]) sank at around 12:00 pm local time due to overloading of the vessel with too many people. ''Mayakovsky'' sank in the [[Daugava]] River that bisects [[Riga]], not more than {{convert|15|m}} from the present day site of the [[Stone Bridge, Riga|Stone Bridge]]. A total of 147 people died, including 48 children. It was the deadliest peacetime disaster in Soviet Latvian history.  At the time, Latvia was a republic within the Soviet Union, under the rule of Joseph Stalin, and news of the disaster was not put in the state-controlled press.  On August 19, 2011, almost 20 years after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Republic of Latvia regaining its independence, a memorial plaque was dedicated at the Stone Bridge (the ''Akmens tilts'') in memory of the victims.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfi.lv/reporter/news/witness/na-naberezhnoj-otkryt-memorial-v-pamyat-o-pogibshih-na-parohode-mayakovskij.d?id=40204997 "On the embankment a memorial was opened in memory of those who died on the steamer 'Mayakovsky'"] (Article on Delfi, August 20, 2011, about the erection of a memorial plaque)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Centre for Distance Education''' ('''''Centre national d'enseignement à distance''''' or '''Cned''' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[France|French]] public institution under the oversight of the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Department of Education]] dedicated to providing [[distance learning]] material.

It was created in 1939 and has been providing [[Internet|on-line]] material since the mid-1990s. The 3000 programs it offers range from [[Education in France|kindergarten]] to [[Education in France|university level]]. In 2006, about 350,000 students were registered, 30,000 living outside France. Of these, approximately 120,000 are higher education students ranging from polytechnic through to masters level. CNED offer the opportunity to study at a high level, while living in any country, or travelling around the globe. Students can study with books, or online (which is easier to carry when travelling).

The '''National Union for Democracy and Progress''' ({{lang-pt|União Nacional para a Democracia e o Progresso}}, UNDP) is a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The party was established on 5 December 1997 by [[Abubácar Baldé]].&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p403&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1999–2000|1999 general elections]] Baldé finished sixth in the presidential elections with 5% of the vote, whilst the party won a single seat in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]] with just under 1% of the vote.

Despite a slight increase of its vote share to 1.2% in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], the party lost its only seat in the Assembly. Baldé pulled out of the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]] two weeks before election day, claiming the election was "infected with vices" that undermined the "political and juridical guarantees of liberty, transparency and justice."&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

The party failed to win a seat in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]], receiving just 0.3% of the vote. It did not contest the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2009|2009]] or [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential elections]], but supported the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état|2012 military coup]].&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

'''Power Station''' ({{zh|t=動力火車|s=动力火车|p=Dònglì Huǒchē|first=t}}) is a [[Taiwan]]ese rock duo, composed of Yu Chiu-hsin and Yen Chih-lin, both of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] tribe of Taiwan's [[Pingtung County]]. Their music is characterized by their energetic rock ballads, as well as their electrifying rock anthems. Their looks and long hair stand out from the mainstream Taiwan pop scene because of their resemblance to western heavy metal musicians. In 2001, Power Station released their first album on the Grand Music label (later known as HIM International Music), ''Walking Along Zhongxiao East Road Nine Times''. The title track of that album (Chinese version of song from 1997 "Takie tango" by [[Budka Suflera]]) won the Silver Award for Best Mandarin Song at the 24th RTHK Top Ten Golden Song Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://ent.sina.com.cn/p/i/2002-01-18/70416.html 十大中文金曲揭晓 刘德华陈奕迅成大赢家(附名单)].

==Biography==
Yu Chiu-hsin and Yen Chih-lin graduated from Taiwan Adventist College in [[Nantou County]], and formed a band called "Virgin Choir" (處男合唱團) with some friends before changing to "Prominent Position" (突出部位) and disbanding.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin/Tíentsín''' (Latin:{{lang-la|Tienzinen(sis)}}, {{zh|s=天津|hp=Tiānjīn}}) is a [[suffragan]] [[diocese]] in the [[Ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing|Archbishop of Beijing]] in PR China.

Its [[cathedral]] episcopal see is Cathedral of St. Joseph (Laoxikai Church), in the city of [[Tianjin]], which also has the former cathedral: Our Lady of Victory Church (Wanghailou Church) ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|圣母得勝堂（望海樓天主堂）}}).

Data from 1950 indicated there are 50,000 registered Roman Catholics in Tianjin, occupying 1.4% of the total 3,600,000 population. Recent data from 2008 reflected a recovery of presumably 100,000 Catholics after years of persecution of which 40,000 are officially registered and 60,000 is the estimated number of underground faithful. Even that considered, it is still only a very tiny proportion of the current 15,000,000 population (0.7%).

The '''Social Democratic Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Social Démocratique}}, PSD) is a [[political party]] in the [[Central African Republic]].

==History==
Established in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-parties-seats-2005-national-assembly CAR: Parties with seats in the 2005 National Assembly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133858/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-parties-seats-2005-national-assembly |date=2015-04-02 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; the party won three seats in the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]] in the [[Central African Republic general election, 1993|1993 general elections]], whilst its presidential candidate, [[Enoch Derant Lakoué]], finished fifth out of eight candidates with 2.4% of the vote. In the [[Central African Republic parliamentary election, 1998|1998 parliamentary elections]] the PSD won six seats. Lakoué was the party's candidate again in the [[Central African Republic presidential election, 1999|1999 presidential elections]], finishing seventh out of ten candidates with 1.3% of the vote. The party subsequently recognised the victory of President [[Ange-Félix Patassé]], isolating itfrom the rest of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/CENTRALE/rca/rcapol/250abelgoumba.htm Le Pr Abel Goumba et le FPP suspendent leur participation au regroupement de l’opposition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828232137/http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/CENTRALE/rca/rcapol/250abelgoumba.htm |date=2008-08-28 }} ''Afrique Express'', N° 250, 24 May 2002 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Central African Republic general election, 2005|2005 general elections]] the party was part of the Consultation of Opposition Political Parties alliance. The alliance won 11 seats in the National Assembly, of which the PSD took five.

In 2010 the party joined the Presidential Majority alliance in preparation for the [[Central African Republic general election, 2011|2011 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journaldebangui.com/article.php?aid=565 Political agreement between the parties of the Presidential Majority] Journal de Bangui, 24 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The party nominated 41 candidates for the 105 seats in the National Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election CAR: Number of National Assembly candidates by party in the 2011 election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135656/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/car-number-national-assembly-candidates-party-2011-election |date=2015-04-02 }} EISA&lt;/ref&gt; and although the alliance won 11 seats, the PSD failed to win a seat..

The '''South American Datum''' ('''SAD''') is a regional [[geodesic datum]] for  [[South America]]. It was established in Brazil by SIRGAS 2000, and was made official in 2005.

== SAD69 ==
SAD was established as the regional geodetic datum for South America in 1969. This datum includes the  Brazilian Geodetic System (''Sistema Geodésico Brasileiro'', or SGB), and uses the [[geoid]] as defined by the ellipsoid of the Geodetic Reference System - [[Lucerne ellipsoid|SGR-67]] - accepted and recommended by the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] at [[Lucerne]] in 1967. This ellipsoid is defined from the parameters:
* Topocentric orientation:
** an axis of rotation parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation; plan meridian parallel to the [[Greenwich Meridian]]; 
* Topocentric orientation: considered planimetric datum, the Vertex Chuá chain triangulation of parallel 20° South, in [[Minas Gerais]]:
** geodetic latitude = 19° 45' 41.6527" S
** astronomical latitude = 19° 45' 41.34" S
** geodetic longitude = 48° 06' 04.0639" W
** astronomical longitude = 48° 06' 07.80" W
** Geodetic Azimuth = 271° 30' 04.05" SWNE; Astronomical Azimuth = 271° 30' 05.42" SWNE for VT-Uberaba
** geodetic undulation N = 0.0 meters 
* SGB Altimetry datum coincides with the equipotential surface that contains the mean sea level, defined by the tide gauge observations taken in [[Imbituba]], on the coast at [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]].

A '''United Nations Parliamentary Assembly''' ('''UNPA''') is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for greater participation and voice for Members of Parliament. The idea was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]]. The [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly|Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] (CEUNPA) was formed in 2007 by [[Committee for a Democratic UN|Democracy Without Borders]]&lt;ref&gt;Democracy Without Borders. https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Committee for a Democratic U.N.) to coordinate pro-UNPA efforts, which as of June 2017 has received the support of nearly 1,500 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from over 100 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/4027/the-committee-for-a-democratic-u-n-is-now-democracy-without-borders/|title=The Committee for a Democratic U.N. is now Democracy Without Borders|work=Democracy Without Borders|access-date=2017-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CUNPA, Supporters: http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/ Retrieved 7 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commission on Global Security, Justice and Governance]], chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] and former Nigerian Foreign Minister [[Ibrahim Gambari]], has called for the creation of a United Nations Parliamentary Network "to raise greater awareness and participation by strengthening the voices of legislators in global institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/06/16/united-nations-climate-change-peacekeeping-security-council-column/71258730/|title=World losing battle against terror, climate change &amp; cyberattacks: Albright|author1=Albright, Madeleine K.  |author2=Gambari, Ibrahim A. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=16 June 2015|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission proposes that this Network "would be similar in initial composition to the [[Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund]] and the [[Parliamentary Conference on the World Trade Organization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.globalsecurityjusticegovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Commission-on-Global-Security-Justice-Governance-Letter.pdf|page=86|chapter=Overcoming the UN’s Democratic Deficit Through a UN Parliamentary Network|title=Confronting the Crisis of Global Governance|publisher=Commission on Global Security, Justice &amp; Governance|date=June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305221415/http://www.globalsecurityjusticegovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Commission-on-Global-Security-Justice-Governance-Letter.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters have set forth possible UNPA implementations, including promulgation of a new treaty; creation of a UNPA as a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly; and evolution of a UNPA from the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] or another [[non-governmental organization]]. Several proposals for apportionment of votes have been raised to address disparities in UN members' population and economic power. CEUNPA advocates initially giving the UNPA advisory powers and gradually increasing its authority over the UN system. In 2018, CEUNPA's co-founders [[Jo Leinen]] and [[Andreas Bummel]] published a 420-pages book on the history, current relevance and future implementation of the idea titled "A World Parliament: Governance and Democracy in the 21st Century"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.democracywithoutborders.org/world-parliament-book/|title=A World Parliament by Jo Leinen and Andreas Bummel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Proposals for a parliamentary assembly in the global organization of nations date back to at least the 1920s, when [[League of Nations]] founders considered (and rejected) plans to include a people's assembly as part of the league's structure.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Bill (March 2005).

[[Wikisource]]. Retrieved 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, a people's world assembly was proposed by British politician [[Ernest Bevin]], who said in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that "There should be a study of a house directly elected by the people of the world to whom the nations are accountable."&lt;ref&gt;Zipp, Susan J.

On 16 October 1945, before the [[UN Charter]] had even entered into force, retired [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] [[Owen J. Roberts]] and former New Hampshire Governor [[Robert P. Bass]] held a conference in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]], which passed the Dublin Declaration. It stated that the UN Charter was inadequate to preserve peace and proposed the transformation of the [[U.N. General Assembly]] into a [[world government|world legislature]], opining, "Such a government should be based upon a constitution under which all peoples and nations will participate upon a basis of balanced representation which will take account of natural and industrial resources and other factors as well as population. It cannot be based on treaties...in which the states...act and vote as states".&lt;ref&gt;Declaration of the Dublin, N.H., Conference (16 October 1945).

According to Stefan Marschall, the post-World War II years, particularly the 1980s and 1990s, saw tremendous growth in [[International parliament|parliamentary assemblies]], with more than 40 established since 1949. About 42% of the world's parliamentary assemblies are formally affiliated with an [[intergovernmental organization]]; 32% are informally affiliated; and 26% are unaffiliated. The spread in parliamentary assemblies was spurred by acceptance of [[parliamentarism]] as a means of legitimizing decisions; initiatives for intergovernmental cooperation reaching a point at which stronger parliamentary backing was needed; and regional integration. However, many global organizations, such as the UN and WTO, still lack a parliamentary assembly and "have been heavily criticized for what is supposed to be an institutional deficit."&lt;ref&gt;Marschall, Stefan (13 June 2007).

== Implementation ==
There are five main options for creating a U.N. Parliamentary Assembly, according to various assessments.

[[Amendments to the UN Charter|Amending the UN Charter]], possibly through a Charter Review Conference under [[Article 109 of the UN Charter]], is a commonly cited possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060820023730/http://www.one-world-now.com/Blueprint.html Blueprint For an Article 109 Charter Review Conference], [[One World Now]].

(1958). ''World Peace Through World Law''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility is establishing the UNPA as a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly. The [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] has authority to do this under [[Article 22 of the UN Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;World Federalists Canada (1996).

The Committee for a Democratic UN also recommended the establishment of UNPA by Article 22 or by transformation of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] in its report, ''Developing International Democracy'', authored by [[Andreas Bummel]], co-founder and director of the UNPA campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Bummel, Andreas (May 2005).

Yet another option is to create the UNPA as a nongovernmental organization of democratically elected legislators. This would have the advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgaction.org/membership/eligibility-criteria.html PGA Membership Rules], [[Parliamentarians for Global Action]], 2007.

This is often accomplished in the form of a 'non-democratic' additional house in the parliamentary structure. Thus, in Britain, the necessity of compromise of the 'common people' with the powers and interests of the armed and titled nobility necessitated a bicameral system incorporating the [[House of Lords]], as well as the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The French Estates-General included similar power blocs as 'estates' or functional separate houses, and the United States Senate reflected a necessary compromise of the interests of less populous states hesitant to subject themselves to 'democratic inundation' by the more populous states."&lt;ref name="Asian"&gt;Sheppard, Robert (2000).

Herbert W. Briggs points out that while a UNPA could be established as a UNGA subsidiary body without any changes to [[international law]], granting it the power to pass binding legislation would require UN Charter amendment or a new treaty. The UNGA plays a role in admitting, suspending and expelling UN members, approving the budget, and electing members to other UN bodies, but its powers as set forth in [[Chapter IV of the UN Charter]] are mostly advisory in nature. These include the power to "discuss," "make recommendations," "consider," "call the attention of the Security Council to situations," "initiate studies," "receive...reports," etc., as well as "establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions." The Charter contains no provision allowing the UNGA to delegate any powers it does not itself possess. And while [[Article 25 of the UN Charter|Article 25]] states, "The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council," there is no requirement that members abide by the recommendations of the UNGA.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Herbert W. (1947). "The United Nations and International Legislation". ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 41, No. 2 (Apr. 1947), pp. 433–35.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Article 13(1)(a) of the Charter tasks the UNGA with "encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification."

According to [[Oscar Schachter]], there is some question as to whether the traditional international lawmaking process of state-by-state treaty ratification is adequate today: "The traditional case-by-case process of [[customary law]] cannot meet the necessity for common action to deal with the numerous problems raised by technological developments, demographic and environmental impacts, changing attitudes as to social justice, or the many requirements of international business. While all of these matters can be dealt with by multilateral treaties, the treaty processes are often complicated and slow, whereas UN resolutions can be more readily attained."&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, Oscar.

Proposals to give the UNGA legislative power–including the "[[binding triad]]" idea which would have made UNGA resolutions binding if passed by countries constituting a supermajority of the world's states, population, and economic production–have made little headway.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for War/Peace Studies.

Retrieved 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heinrich, once the UNPA is established, it will be easier to gather support for empowering it. The assembly's own members can be expected to play a major role in pushing for its evolution by seeking a UN Charter amendment to make it a "principal organ" in parallel with the General Assembly. With their political know-how, their access to the highest levels of their national governments, and their credibility with the
world public and the media, the politicians in the UN Parliamentary Assembly can be expected to become a strong and persistent political force for organizing the assembly's eventual transformation.&lt;ref name="Heinrich"/&gt;

[[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], argues in ''The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly'' that even an indirectly elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional [[checks and balances]] by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, [[globalization]] has tended to increase the power of the [[executive branch]] while marginalizing the [[legislative branch]]; for instance, [[U.S. President]]s since [[George H.

== Funding ==
Heinrich argues, "It is essential that the salary and travel costs of UN parliamentarians should be paid by the institution of the UN Parliamentary Assembly from its own budget (which would be part of the UN budget), and not by the national governments individually. This is both to assure the independence of the UNPA politicians in their service to the UN and to assure equality of participation."&lt;ref name="Heinrich"/&gt; [[Chapter IV of the UN Charter#Article 17|Article 17 of the UN Charter]] stipulates, "The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly."

A 1993 [[Parliamentarians for Global Action]] survey showed that a strong majority of parliamentary respondents thought that the public would support the idea of a UN Parliamentary Assembly, but they were less sure the public would be prepared to finance it. The analysis pointed out, "The possibility of a greater financial burden to support an enlarged UN is unlikely to evoke support unless it can be demonstrated that the return on investment is significant.

CEUNPA's response to this objection is that "it is true that a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations would be another player in the diplomatic scenery which governments and their executives in international organizations would have to take into account to a certain degree. On the other hand, being composed of elected parliamentarians, the assembly would be closer to the citizens and as such it would lend more credibility and legitimacy to international decisions in which it is involved. In this way, the parliamentary assembly actually would contribute to an increased efficiency of international action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uno-komitee.de/en/projects/unpa/faq.php?id=12 Wouldn’t international cooperation become even more complicated and ineffective if a UNPA would have a say?], CEUNPA.

== Direct election vs. appointment by national parliaments ==
A UNPA might begin as an [[inter-parliamentary institution]]–an assembly of parliamentarians from their respective countries' legislatures–and then change to a directly elected body. This would be similar to the evolution of the European Parliament. Beginning with the European Common Assembly's founding in 1952, [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] were appointed by each of the Member States' national parliaments; in 1979, direct election was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Wilhelm (January 2007). [http://www.europarl.eu.int/facts/1_3_1_en.htm The European Parliament: historical background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022921/http://www.europarl.eu.int/facts/1_3_1_en.htm |date=20 February 2006 }}, [[Europarl]], January 2007. Retrieved 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sen. Douglas Roche, O.C., in ''The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly'', analyzes the tradeoffs between the two choices. A UNPA based on existing parliamentarians may be easier to establish, because it avoids several hurdles, such as decisions on electoral cycles, a universally acceptable electoral body, legitimacy of elections, and so on: "A body comprising national parliamentarians has the 'stamp of approval' built-in. National parliamentarians can claim electoral legitimacy in their own right. Admittedly, the credibility of domestic franchised can be called into question, but the trend toward democracy has been strengthening rapidly."&lt;ref name="Heinrich" /&gt;

National parliamentarians also generally have staff and money, which could ease the funding issues associated with forming a new world parliamentary assembly. Delegates to a directly elected UNPA, on the other hand, would have more time to devote to the global assembly, since its members would not be occupied with duties relating to their membership in their national legislature.&lt;ref name=RocheCase/&gt; Heinrich points out strategic advantages of an indirectly elected UNPA: "Another advantage to basing representation in a UN Parliamentary Assembly on national parliaments is that it may engage parliamentarians as allies in the cause of getting the assembly established, and, later, helping to build the political will for its evolution. The experience of being a UN parliamentarian will galvanize many of these politicians into going home as advocates for the UN, including the need for strengthening and democratizing the UN Parliamentary Assembly itself."&lt;ref name="Heinrich"/&gt;

Heinrich also notes the possibility that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the [[U.S. Electoral College]] officially selects the president. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.&lt;ref name="Heinrich"/&gt;

A global parliamentary assembly could be structured to give populous states greater influence. The [[one state, one vote]] rule of the UN General Assembly gives small states a disproportionate amount of influence over the UN system. In ''Entitlement quotients as a vehicle for United Nations reform'', [[University of Minnesota]] professor emeritus [[Joseph E. Schwartzberg]] notes, "The sixty-four least populous members–enough to block a two-thirds majority vote–comprise less than one percent of the world's total population, and in theory, the 127 least populous members, accounting for barely eight percent of humanity, are enough to provide the two-thirds majority needed to pass a substantive resolution."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartzberg, Joseph E.

[[File:UNPA Allocation.png|right|400px|frame|none|Proportion of the total vote allocated to 5 countries under different voting systems]]

There are several alternate proposals for apportionment of votes among member nations:

[[Schwartzberg's weighted voting]] formula takes into account population (the democratic/demographic principle), contribution to the UN budget (the economic principle), and share of the total membership. The idea of weighting countries' votes according to their financial contribution to the organization is not unprecedented, as the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]] and other [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions use this method.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2007).

The [[Provisional People's Assembly]]'s methodology gives each nation Population Seats based on a calculation that combines the [[Penrose method]], which takes the [[square root]] of the millions of inhabitants of each country, Economic Seats equal to its portion of the world's total [[gross domestic product]], and classification as Free, Partially Free, or Unfree by [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesassembly.org/pa1/Main.aspx?doc=Methodology Methodology for Calculating Seats], [[Provisional People's Assembly]].

Under [[one person, one vote]], each country's number of votes is directly proportional to its population. This would be similar to how [[U.S. state]]s are represented in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In ''The Future of Sovereignty – Rethinking a Key Concept of International Relations'', Hasenclever et al. sum up the advantages and disadvantages of this system: "In a strict meaning of democracy based on individuals as subjects, every person's vote would have to have exactly the same weight. None of the known proposals, however, supports such a strict interpretation, because the inequality among the states' voting powers would be extreme with only four countries – China, India, the United States and the former USSR – disposing of an absolute majority."&lt;ref&gt;Hasenclever, Andreas; Mayer, Peter; Rittberger, Volker; Schimmelfennig, Frank; &amp; Schrade, Christina (1996).

[[Universität Tübingen]]. Retrieved 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A way to resolve the disparity in population between countries would be to apportion representation to ''regions'' instead of ''nations''. This would, for example, place Suriname and Brazil, the least and most populated South American countries, in a single South American voting bloc of [[List of South American countries by population|approximately 400 million people]], preserving the one person, one vote system while eliminating extreme disparities in population. This approach, however, is dependent upon elected officials being entrusted to represent said regions and not just their home countries, and could potentially leave some less populated countries with no representatives from their country if they are either outvoted by people in more populated countries in their assigned region or if the people in less populated countries vote in large numbers for candidates or political parties from other countries.

== Election standards ==

He proposes criteria that an election must meet to be considered valid, such as minimum participation rates that initially could be set as low as 20%, and gradually increased.
