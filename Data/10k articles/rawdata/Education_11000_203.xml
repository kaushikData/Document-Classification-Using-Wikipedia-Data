Today, AARNet is Australia's [[National research and education network]] (NREN). It forms the Australian component of the global advanced research and education Internet network.

'''AARNet Pty Ltd''', which owns and operates the AARNet, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares. The shareholders are 38&amp;nbsp;Australian universities and the Australian [[CSIRO]]. AARNet's services in addition to Internet connectivity include [[Eduroam]], voice, video and data storage services and a [[Mirror website|content mirror]].

==History==

[[File:AARNet Network 1993.png|thumb|350px|right|The AARNet network as at October 1993]]

AARNet was initially built between the [[University of Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]], where the international Internet feed initially landed, and university and CSIRO facilities in all [[Australian state]] capital cities and the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. AARNet was formed in 1989 by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC).

In 1989, [[Kevin Robert Elz]] established the first permanent Internet feed to Australia, at the University of Melbourne. Until this time, researchers within Australia had limited access to the [[ARPANET]], due to the high expense of providing communications between Australia and the United States. The national network infrastructure generally consisted of groups of hosts connected throughout the country exchanging mail and files on a periodic schedule using the [[MHSnet|SUN3]] software and protocols, with several international dial-up links around the country exchanging this information where required.

AARNet was initially built as a multi-protocol network, comprising [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) as well as [[DECnet]] and [[X.25]] so as to accommodate pre-existing [[ACSnet]] and [[SPEARnet]] systems then in current use. With the rapid subsequent growth in popularity of the Internet, AARNet soon evolved into an [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-only network. In 1988, there were a number of popular network protocols, such as [[IBM Systems Network Architecture|IBM SNA]] and [[X.25]], and the ARPANET's IP protocol was only beginning to become favoured. Australian National University staff members Geoff Huston and Peter Elford were seconded by the AVCC in 1989 and tasked with technical management and build of the new network.

AARNet introduced its 'value added reseller' program to allow [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to use its network, the first being [[Connect.com.au]] in May 1994.&lt;ref name=Virtual_Nation /&gt; AARNet gradually became a wholesale [[backbone network|backbone]] ISP, serving over 300 smaller ISPs by June 1995. At that point, about 20% of total AARNet traffic was from these other users, and AVCC decided to sell the AARNet commercial assets to [[Telstra]], who currently operates it under the name [[Telstra#Telstra Internet|Telstra Internet]].

In early 1997, AARNet2 went into service, a network that used [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] links and Internet services under a contract with Cable &amp; Wireless Optus (CWO), now [[Optus]]. AARNet became a separate company from the AVCC in 1999.

In 2001 AARNet deployed its own international capacity by acquiring 310&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s of capacity from Sydney via Hawaii to [[Seattle]]. As of 2006, the current network is known as AARNet3, and the backbone uses a [[dark fibre network]] provided by [[Nextgen Networks]].

==Chronology==

Major milestones in the development of AARNet include:&lt;ref name=AARNet20YearBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Xamax /&gt;&lt;ref name=APLReports&gt;{{cite web|title=AARNet Annual Reports|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/publications/annual-reports|publisher=AARNet|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre AARNet – pre Internet===
*1963: [[CSIRONET]] established by the CSIRO's Division of Computing Research
*1976: CSIRONET had grown to connect more than 50 computers spanning from [[Townsville]] to [[Hobart]] to Perth via a combination of dial-up and low speed leased line connections
*1979: [[ACSnet]] formed – used [[MHSnet]] to transfer [[Computer file|file]]s, email and [[netnews|newsgroups]] between computers in Australian universities and to the USA via low speed dialup connections
*1986: South Pacific Education and Research Network ([[SPEARnet]]) formed – used [[X.25]]-based [[Coloured Book protocols]] to interconnect 22 Australian and New Zealand universities
*1989: Internet brought to Australia via a [[NASA]]-subsidized 56&amp;nbsp;kbit/s dedicated satellite circuit between the [[University of Melbourne]] and the [[University of Hawaii]]

===The early years – building the Internet in Australia===
*1989: AARNet established by the [[Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee|AVCC]]
*1990: AARNet national backbone network built from Brisbane to Perth, each link initially at 48&amp;nbsp;kbit/s capacity, starring from a hub at the international Internet landing point at the University of Melbourne. AARNet national network was initially built as a multi-protocol [[layer 3]] network, comprising [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) as well as [[DECnet]] and [[X.25]] so as to accommodate the pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet networks. Connections to around 40 universities and CSIRO sites commissioned.
*1990–92: International capacity increased in several rapid increments from 56&amp;nbsp;kbit/s to 1.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, at an average 6&amp;nbsp;month doubling rate. In 1991, the national backbone links were upgraded to 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. By 1992, AARNet connected 40,000 computers.
*1991: 'Affiliate membership' programme and [[Acceptable use policy]] (AUP) established for government and research groups to join the network. By the end of 1993, AARNet provided services to over 300 government agencies and companies, including early Australian [[Internet Service Provider]]s (ISPs) [[Connect.com.au]], [[Pegasus Networks]] and [[Internode (ISP)|Internode]].
*1993: Local links to major customer sites progressively upgraded from low capacity carrier leased lines to microwave links for more capacity, typically 10&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, at lower costs
*1994: 'Value-Added Reseller' programme established and AARNet's AUP broadened to accommodate growing demand for Internet access from a wider range of users, including ISPs [[OzEmail]] and [[iiNet]]
*1995: The AVCC sold the then entire Australian Internet (AARNet1) as a going concern to [[Telstra]], including staff, infrastructure ([[router (computing)|routers]], etc.), intellectual property and the entire commercial customer base. Telstra then took over operating AARNet1 as its initial [[Telstra#Telstra Internet|Telstra Internet]].
*1996: AARNet2 tender awarded to [[Optus]], accelerating the build of Optus' [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) and Internet infrastructure, capabilities and services
*1997: AARNet2 [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]]-based national network commissioned

===Building the present AARNet===
*1998: AARNet Mirror site commissioned
*1998: AARNet Pty Ltd established as a separate company
*1999: Ownership of AARNet Pty Ltd transferred from the AVCC to Australia's universities and CSIRO
*1999: AARNet's [[VoIP]] service commissioned
*2000: AARNet telecommunications carrier license granted by [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACA]]
*2001: AARNet became the first research and education network to operate its own trans-oceanic optical-fibre capacity, initially comprising dual 155&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s links to Canada's [[CANARIE]] network
*2002: [[GrangeNet]] built as a separate demonstration next generation network, through which various in the sector obtained their first exposure to then next generation [[gigabit Ethernet]] and long-haul optical fibre transmission systems. Later, when user institutions had operational need to interconnect their AARNet and GrangeNet services they also gained experience with the complexities of asymmetric routing.
*2003: AARNet negotiated purchase from [[Southern Cross Cable]] of multi-gigabit 'SXTransPORT' trans-Pacific links via diverse paths
*2003: AARNet buys into [[Nextgen Networks]] ensuring its survival as an independent long-haul optical-fibre infrastructure provider
*2004: Dual 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s and dual 622&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s SXTransPORT trans-Pacific links commissioned
*2006: AARNet3 national network commissioned

===Up to the present===
*2007: [[Layer 1]] point-to-point 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s transmission services ('EN4R') introduced for high-end research data transfer applications between points reached by the AARNet3 national network
*2008: Direct link to Asia upgraded to 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s via diverse routes between Perth and Singapore, reducing [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] (delay) to Asia, cf much commercial Internet traffic between Australia and Asia still traverses the Pacific Ocean twice via the USA.
*2011: High-capacity [[Wave-division multiplexing]] (WDM) link built from Perth via [[Geraldton]] to the Australian site of the [[Square Kilometre Array]] (SKA) at the [[Shire of Murchison|Murchison]] Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO), and the various telescope facilities at the MRO in particular the initial [[Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder]] (ASKAP) telescope array at the site.
*2011: Second optical fibre path to Asia commissioned, from Sydney to Singapore via [[Guam]], increasing AARNet's direct capacity to Asia to 1.2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s
*2012: International capacity increased to a total of 90&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s trans-Pacific plus a further 3.1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s in two diverse routes to Asia
*2013: AARNet4 announced,&lt;ref name="AARNet4capacity"&gt;{{cite web|title=AARNet4 boosts capacity and reach for research and education|url=http://news.aarnet.edu.au/aarnet4-boosts-capacity-for-researchers/|publisher=AARNet|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's Academic and Research Network advances science, education and R&amp;D with Juniper Networks|url=http://news.aarnet.edu.au/australias-academic-and-research-network-advances-science-education-and-rd-with-juniper-networks/|publisher=AARNet|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is upgrading the AARNet [[Wave-division multiplexing|WDM]] national network capacity to multiple parallel 100&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s channels, ultimately 80&amp;nbsp;channels (total 8&amp;nbsp;[[Terabit|Tbit]]/s).

==AARNet Pty Ltd==
AARNet was established in 1989 originally as an activity under the auspices of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC).

AARNet was formed into a separate company on 22 December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASIC Search|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=n9308hg5u_4|publisher=[[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]]|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
AARNet Pty Ltd, ACN 084540518, ABN 54 084 540 518, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares.
The shareholders are 38 of Australia's universities and the Australian [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AARNet Shareholders|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/governance/shareholders|publisher=AARNet|accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AARNet Pty Ltd became a licensed telecommunications carrier ([[Telephone company|Telco]]) under the Australian Telecommunications Act on 27 November 2000, becoming Australian carrier number 61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of Licensed Carriers |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/~/media/Regulatory%20Reform%20and%20Carrier%20Infrastructure/Spreadsheet/Register%20of%20Licensed%20Carriers.XLSX |publisher=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005029/http://www.acma.gov.au/~/media/Regulatory%20Reform%20and%20Carrier%20Infrastructure/Spreadsheet/Register%20of%20Licensed%20Carriers.XLSX |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National network==

[[File:AARNet National Network.png|thumb|300px|AARNet national network as at October 2013]]

The AARNet4 national network comprises high capacity optical fibre transmission paths between switching centres in major cities from [[Cairns]] to [[Perth]] as well as branch lines to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and several other locations. Because optical fibre repair times are long, the backbone network follows two physically diverse paths. As at late 2013, capacity on each leg of the routed network was between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;[[gigabit]] per second (Gbit/s).&lt;ref name="NationalMap"&gt;{{cite web|title=AARNet National Network Map |url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/library/AARNetNationalMap_September_2013_Final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109003339/http://www.aarnet.edu.au/library/AARNetNationalMap_September_2013_Final.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 November 2013 |publisher=AARNet |accessdate=7 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with only 48&amp;nbsp;kbit/s national backbone capacity in 1990, this reflects a similarly rapid [[Exponential growth|exponential]] growth rate as for AARNet's international capacity.

The Network peers with external content providers and ISPs to increase performance and availability of the network. The organisation has a selective peering policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian National Peering Policy|url=https://www.aarnet.edu.au/images/uploads/resources/national_peering_policy.pdf|website=AARNet|publisher=AARNet Pty Ltd|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for peering with other providers. This policy applies to all requests for settlement-free interconnection with AARNet, either via dedicated connections or traffic via [[Internet exchange point|public internet exchanges]].

AARNet provides the Internet to several million end-user devices at Australian universities, CSIRO, various other research and educational institutions, and some hospitals. Customer site connections are mostly at 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s rates, with most end-user [[Ethernet]] services at 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s, and [[Eduroam]] services at available [[Wi-Fi]] performance levels.

AARNet's layer 3 services are usually delivered at the AARNet [[Point of presence|PoP]] sites. With the introduction of the AARNet3 optical fibre network (i.e. from 2006 onwards) AARNet progressively developed capability to extend services to customer sites in some locations, as well as providing layer&amp;nbsp;1 and layer&amp;nbsp;2 inter-campus connections in those areas. Prior to that, and at other locations, it is end-customer institutions' responsibility to extend services to site and to provision their own inter-campus network links. These are either operated directly by AARNet such as in [[Queensland]] or provided by companion networks such as [[SABRENet]] in South Australia and VERNet in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Summary of AARNet national IP network performance levels as at 2013:
* National backbone links: mostly 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s
* Customer site connections: mostly 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s
* End-user services: mostly 1&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s [[Ethernet]] and available Wi-Fi rates
* Continues to sustain traffic growth rates of '''50% per annum''' year on year over the preceding decade&lt;ref name=AARNet4capacity /&gt;

As at late 2014, AARNet operated a total capacity of 120&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s to North America and a further 5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AARNet International Network Map|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/images/uploads/resources/International_Map_May_2014.pdf|publisher=AARNet|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This equates to a '''2.2&amp;nbsp;million-fold''' increase over AARNet's initial trans-Pacific capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;kbit/s in 1990 and represents an average doubling time of aggregate international capacity of only '''14&amp;nbsp;months''' over the entire history of AARNet (cf. [[Moore's Law]]).

==Application services==
In addition to providing high capacity Internet transmission and routing services and a comprehensive range of core Internet services including [[BGP]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]], [[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] and [[IPv6]], AARNet also provides a variety of higher-layer network services including:
* [[Eduroam]] global federated authentication service, most often appearing as [[Eduroam]] Wi-Fi services on-campus and at associated locations
* [[VoIP]] IP telephony services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Debelle|first=Penelope|title=VoIP starts to talk the talk|url=http://www.theage.com.au/small-business/voip-starts-to-talk-the-talk-20090619-cpbo.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=13 September 2007|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* AUCX unified voice and video communications exchange&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/aucx Unified Communications Exchange], AARNet&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cloud services including CloudStor file storage service
* AARNet mirror site to reduce load on international links due to repeated downloads of the same material.
To further optimise network traffic loads, AARNet operates high capacity peering links with various major content providers including the Australian [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grubb|first=Ben|title=AARNet provides unmetered access to Akamai|url=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/157317,aarnet-provides-unmetered-access-to-akamai.aspx|publisher=iTnews|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=Roman|title=AARNet peers with Amazon's cloud|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/441177/aarnet_peers_amazon_cloud/|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout their life, a major driver for the very high capacities of advanced Research and Education Internet networks including AARNet has been to meet the needs of data-intensive research across a wide range of research disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. For example, to interconnect major research instruments such as [[synchrotron]]s and [[telescope]]s in remote locations to [[high performance computer]] systems and researchers around the world, such as astronomers in Europe viewing the southern sky using telescopes in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian astronomers give a Euro view |url=http://www.theage.com.au//national/australian-astronomers-give-a-euro-view-20071009-139u.html|work=The Age|date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829215511/http://www.theage.com.au/ |archivedate=29 August 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; or high resolution realtime video links between remote locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramadge|first=Paul|title=Fast data link for researchers|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/ultrafast-data-link-thrills-researchers/2008/01/16/1200419846497.html|work=The Age|date=16 January 2008|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, AARNet has built a 100&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s [[Wavelength-division multiplexing|WDM]] optical fibre transmission system&lt;ref name=NationalMap /&gt; from [[Perth]] to [[Geraldton]] and on to the [[Shire of Murchison|Murchison]] Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia in support of Australia's component of the international [[Square Kilometre Array]] project and the initial [[ASKAP]] telescope array at the MRO.

{{grading}}
'''[[Academic grading]] in [[Costa Rica]]''' is based on a 100-point scale. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mep.go.cr/DescargasHTML/boletines/boletin_90.pdf|title=Boletín Informativo 90|publisher=MEP - Ministerio de Educación Pública (Public Education Ministry)|page=1|language=Spanish|trans-title=Informational Bulletin 90|format=PDF|publication-place=Costa Rica|access-date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For primary school level, a score of 65 is good enough to pass, while in high school and further levels the pass grade is 70/100. Students who attain between 60 and the passing grade get the chance to take an extra test that reviews the whole year's [[curriculum]], and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a passing score.

Often high schools will raise the pass grade to 75 in order to push their students to achieve a higher grade. This only applies to the highest [[high school]] grades, which are 10th and 11th grade. This method is primarily focused on improving grades by encouraging a higher cumulative [[grade point average]] throughout both years, leading towards a set of [[final exam]]s in which this average grade becomes critically important.

'''Alan S. Kaufman''' (born April 1944) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychology]] professor known for his work on [[Intelligence quotient|intelligence testing]].

== Early life and career ==

Born in [[Brooklyn]] and raised on [[Long Island]], Kaufman earned his bachelor's degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1965; M.A. in [[Educational Psychology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1967; and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1970 (under [[Robert L. Thorndike]]), specializing in [[psychometrics]].

He has been married to psychologist [[Nadeen L. Kaufman]] since 1964. While Assistant Director at [[Harcourt Assessment|The Psychological Corporation]] from 1968 to 1974, he worked closely with [[David Wechsler]] on the revision of the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC) and supervised the standardization of the revised version ([[WISC-R]]). He also collaborated with [[Dorothea McCarthy]] in the development and standardization of the [[McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA)|McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities]]. He held positions at [[University of Georgia]] (1974–1979) and [[University of Alabama]] (1984–1995) before taking a position at [[Yale University]].

Both have been at [[Yale University]]'s Child Study Center in the School of Medicine since 1997.

== Development of Kaufman IQ scales ==

The research team that Kaufman and his wife supervised while at the [[University of Georgia]] in 1978-79 developed the original [[Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children]] (K-ABC) and several other psychological and educational tests, including the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (K-TEA/NU), Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT), and the second editions of both ( KTEA-II and KBIT-2). The Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS)  and the Cognitive/Language Profile of the Early Screening Profiles address the preschool level. The Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT), the Kaufman Short Neuropsychological Assessment Procedure (K-SNAP), and the Kaufman Functional Academic Skills Test (K-FAST) extend through the adult life span.&lt;ref name="boffey"&gt;Boffey, Philip M. (August 25, 1982). New tests for children hailed as gain in assessing intellect. ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004/2005, revised versions of the Kaufmans' tests were published, including the [[Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children|KABC-II]], KTEA-II, and KBIT-2.  The KABC-II integrates both the [[Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive|PASS]] and [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory|CHC]] theories of intelligence.

== Overview of Kaufman's tests==

'''Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT)'''

The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) is a brief, individually administered measure of verbal (vocabulary subtest) and non verbal (Matrices subtest) intelligence.  It can be used with those aged 4–90 years old and takes between 15–30 minutes to administer. It can be useful in a variety of settings including clinical, educational, vocational, and research settings. The original KBIT was published in 1990, the second edition followed in 2004.

The KBIT-2 generates three scores: Verbal, Non Verbal and an overall IQ composite. Theoretically the verbal subtests measure crystallised ability and the non verbal subtests measure fluid reasoning.

The Verbal portion of the KBIT-2 is made up of two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles. These measure verbal, school related skills by measuring an individuals word knowledge, verbal concept formation, reasoning ability and range of general information. The Non Verbal portion is made up of the Matrices subtest and measures the ability to solve new problems by assessing ability to perceive relationships and complete visual analogies.

'''Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA)'''

The KTEA provides an individually administered measure of educational achievement for those aged 4 years 6 months – 25 years (comprehensive form) and 4 years 6 months – 90+ (brief form). The test can be used to identify an individual’s strengths and weaknesses in three key domains: maths, written language and spoken language. It can also be used as part of a comprehensive psychological, psychoeducational or neuropsychological test battery which can enhance understanding of the individuals total functioning.

The current edition was published in 2004. Since its publication it has become a widely used measure of academic achievement in education. The test takes between 15–80 minutes to administer and there are two alternate forms which enables it to be used to monitor progress or response to intervention.

The Comprehensive Form consists of 14 subtests grouped into 4 domain composites, 4 reading-related composites, an overall Comprehensive Achievement Composite in addition to separate subtest scores.

The Brief Form is a curriculum-based instrument which provides norm-referenced assessment in the same three core achievement domains as the comprehensive form. There is no content overlap with the Comprehensive Form, it can be used for retesting and includes the following subtests:

* Reading—word recognition and reading comprehension
* Maths—computation and application problems
* Written Expression—written language and spelling.

The Brief Form provides a battery composite as well as subtest scores in reading, maths and spelling.

== Influence on other researchers ==

Widely regarded as a teacher and mentor, as well as a researcher, Kaufman's cadre of doctoral students at the University of Georgia has gone on to become a significant influence in the field as well. Kaufman mentored, among others, [[Cecil R. Reynolds]], Randy W. Kamphaus, Bruce Bracken, Steve McCallum, Jack A. Naglieri, and Patti Harrison, all of whom became Professors at major universities and authors of some of the most widely used psychological tests in the United States. Also Kaufman with his wife, Nadeen, supervised foreign doctoral students at the University of Alabama including  [[Toshinori Ishikuma]] and Soo-Back Moon, who became influential Professors in mother countries and translated and adopted the K-ABC for Japanese and Korean children, respectively.

'''Alma mater''' ({{Lang-la|[[Wikt:almus#Latin|alma]]|translation=nourishing|link=no}}, {{Lang|la|[[Wikt:mater#Latin|mater]]|translation=mother}}; pl. [rarely used] {{Lang|la|almae matres}}) is an [[allegory|allegorical]] Latin phrase for a [[university]], school, or [[college]] that one formerly attended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alma_mater?filter=dictionary&amp;query=Alma "alma"], oxforddictionaries.com. Retrieved October 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is variously translated as "nourishing mother", "nursing mother", or "fostering mother", suggesting that a school provides intellectual nourishment to its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayto |first=John |title=Word Origins |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |location=London |isbn=9781408101605 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsRISNLSSHAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=alma%20mater |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine arts will often depict educational institutions using a robed woman as a visual metaphor.

Before its current usage, ''alma mater'' was an [[epithet|honorific title]] for various Latin [[mother goddess]]es, especially [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] or [[Cybele]],&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Shorter [[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Catholicism for the [[Virgin Mary]]. It entered academic usage when the [[University of Bologna]] adopted the motto ''Alma Mater Studiorum'' ("nurturing mother of studies"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibo.it/en/university/who-we-are/our-history/our-history|title=Our history  – University of Bologna|website=Unibo.it|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to ''[[alumnus]]'', a term used for a university graduate that literally means a "nursling" or "one who is nourished".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cresswell |first=Julia |title=Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4i3zV4vnBAC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Legate John, Alma Mater Cantabrigia Emblem 1600 (Golden Chaine print).jpg|thumb|upright|John Legate's Alma Mater for Cambridge in 1600]]
Although ''alma'' (nourishing) was a common epithet for [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Cybele]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and other mother goddesses, it was not frequently used in conjunction with ''mater'' in classical Latin.&lt;ref name="Sollors"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sollors |first=Werner |authorlink=Werner Sollors |title=Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |isbn= 9780198020721 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', the phrase is attributed to Lucretius' ''[[De rerum natura]]'', where it is used as an epithet to describe an earth goddess:
&lt;poem lang="la" style="margin-left:1em; float:left;"&gt;Denique caelesti sumus omnes semine oriundi
omnibus ille idem pater est, unde alma liquentis
umoris guttas mater cum terra recepit (2.991–93)&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left:1em; float:left;"&gt;We are all sprung from that celestial seed,
all of us have same father, from whom earth,
the nourishing mother, receives drops of liquid moisture&lt;/poem&gt;{{Clear|left}}

After the [[fall of Rome]], the term came into Christian liturgical usage in association with the [[Virgin Mary]]. "[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]" is a well-known 11th century [[antiphon]] devoted to Mary.&lt;ref name="Sollors" /&gt;

The earliest documented use of the term to refer to a university in an English-speaking country is in 1600, when the [[University of Cambridge]] printer, John Legate, began using an emblem for the [[Cambridge University Press|university's press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Henry Paine |title=Cambridge stationers, printers, bookbinders, &amp;c. |year=1919 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Bowes &amp; Bowes |page=12 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cambridgestation00stokrich#page/12/mode/2up |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=S.

==Special usage==
Many historic European universities have adopted ''Alma Mater'' as part of the Latin translation of their official name. The [[University of Bologna]] Latin name, {{Lang|la|Alma Mater Studiorum}} (nourishing mother of studies), refers to its status as the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest continuously operating university in the world]]. Other European universities, such as the [[Leipzig University|Alma Mater Lipsiensis]] in Leipzig, Germany, or [[Jagiellonian University|Alma Mater Jagiellonica]], Poland, have similarly used the expression in conjunction with geographical or foundational characteristics. At least one, the [[Alma Mater Europaea]] in [[Salzburg]], Austria, an international university founded by the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2010, uses the term as its official name.

In the United States, the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], has been called the "Alma Mater of the Nation" because of its ties to the country's founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=William &amp; Mary – History &amp; Traditions|publisher=wm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], and the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, the main student government is known as the Alma Mater Society.

==Monuments==
[[File:Alma Mater, Lorado Taft.jpg|thumb|right|''Alma Mater'' (1929, Lorado Taft), [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]]]
The ancient Roman world had many statues of the Alma Mater, some still extant (e.g., at the [[Palatine Hill]] in Rome).

Modern sculptures are found in prominent locations on several American university campuses. For example, in the United States: there is a well-known bronze statue of ''[[Alma Mater (New York sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' by [[Daniel Chester French]] situated on the steps of Columbia University's [[Low Library]]; the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] also has an ''[[Alma Mater (Illinois sculpture)|Alma Mater]]'' statue by [[Lorado Taft]]. An altarpiece mural in Yale University's [[Sterling Memorial Library]], painted in 1932 by [[Eugene Savage]], depicts the ''Alma Mater'' as a bearer of light and truth, standing in the midst of the personified arts and sciences.

Outside the United States, there is an ''Alma Mater'' sculpture on the steps of the monumental entrance to the [[Universidad de La Habana]], in Havana, Cuba. The statue was cast in 1919 by [[Mario Korbel]], with Feliciana Villalón Wilson as the inspiration for ''Alma Mater'', and it was installed in its current location in 1927, at the direction of architect Raul Otero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cremata Ferrán|first1=Mario|title=Dos rostros, dos estatuas habaneras|url=http://www.opushabana.cu/index.php/articulos/36-articulos-casa-de-papel/4031-mario-cremata-ferran|website=Opus Habana|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Multiply value - place the product of the accumulator and the variable or immediate integer in the accumulator.
*Divide value - place the contents of the accumulator divided by the value in the accumulator.
*Halt - return control to console.

==Examples==

The following totals the integers in runtime data section until it encounters a negative value and prints the total.

         LOAD    0
 LOOP    STORE   TOTAL
         IN
         JINEG   DONE
         ADD     TOTAL

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3252">'''Charlotte White''' (b. July 13, 1782, d. December 25, 1863) was the first unmarried American woman missionary sent to a foreign country.  She was sponsored by the [[American Baptist Missionary Union|Baptist Board of Foreign Missions]] and arrived in British [[India]] in 1816.

==Early life==

Charlotte "Susanna" Hazen Atlee was born in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], the daughter of Judge [[William Augustus Atlee]] and Esther Bowes Sayre. She married Nathaniel Hazen White in 1803.  He died in 1804 and the couple's one child died in 1805. Charlotte White joined the First Baptist Church in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Edwin Atlee ''Genealogical Record of the Atlee Family'' Philadelphia: Wm. F. Fell &amp; Co, 1884, pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missionary to India==

White's application to become a missionary with the newly founded Baptist Board of Foreign Missions was controversial as many members of the Board believed that only ordained males should be appointed missionaries. White was accepted as a missionary in a restricted appointment as a helper and companion for the wife of George Henry Hough, a missionary printer being sent to India, and with her assurance that she would be sustained by her own resources.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Gerald H. ''Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions'' Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdman's Publishing Co., 1991, p. 727; ''Proceedings of the Baptist Convention for Missionary Purposes'', Philadelphia, 1814, pp. 65, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

White remained only briefly with the Houghs on arrival in [[Calcutta, India]], marrying a widower with three sons, Joshua Rowe (1781-1823), a missionary with the English [[Baptist Missionary Society]],(BMS) shortly after her arrival in 1816. Charlotte, now Mrs. Rowe, transferred to the BMS and the couple managed missionary schools in Digah, near [[Patna, India]]. Charlotte wrote a [[Hindustani language]] spelling book for children. In 1823, a letter from Charlotte was published, without her permission, accusing four prominent missionaries at [[Serampore College]] of expropriating property belonging to the Baptist Missionary Society.&lt;ref&gt;''The Reformer'', Vol. 4, April 2, 1823, pp. 73-79&lt;/ref&gt;    

Joshua and Charlotte Rowe had three children.  Rowe died in 1823.  Charlotte remained in India until 1826 before returning to the United States with her children, Charlotte (1818-1852), Esther (1818-1851), and Judson (1823-?).&lt;ref&gt;Brackney, William H ''The A to Z of Baptists'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 605; ''Missionary Herald'', 1827, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

White taught English, music, and drawing in an academy at [[Lowndesboro, Alabama]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 727&lt;/ref&gt; She died December 25, 1863 in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;"Charlotte H.

'''Clarence Irving Lewis''' (April 12, 1883 – February 3, 1964), usually cited as '''C. I.

Lewis in Focus: The Pulse of Pragmatism'', Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; First a noted [[logic]]ian, he later branched into [[epistemology]], and during the last 20 years of his life, he wrote much on [[ethics]].  ''[[The New York Times]]'' memorialized him as "a leading authority on symbolic logic and on the philosophic concepts of knowledge and value."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/04/clarence-i-lewis-philosopher-dies.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Lewis was born in [[Stoneham, Massachusetts]]. His father was a skilled worker in a shoe factory, and Lewis grew up in relatively humble circumstances. He discovered philosophy at age 13, when reading about the Greek [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]] in particular. The first work of philosophy Lewis recalled studying was a short history of [[Greek philosophy]] by Marshall.{{citation needed|reason=If possible, give a full citation of Marshall's work.|date=November 2016}} [[Immanuel Kant]] proved a major lifelong influence on Lewis's thinking. In his article "Logic and Pragmatism",{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Lewis wrote: "Nothing comparable in importance happened [in my life] until I became acquainted with Kant... Kant compelled me. He had, so I felt, followed scepticism to its inevitable last stage, and laid the foundations where they could not be disturbed."

In 1902, he entered [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;M. G. Murphey, ''C. I. Lewis: The Last Great Pragmatist'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Since his parents were not able to help him financially, he had to work as a waiter to earn his tuition.&lt;ref name=A/&gt; In 1905, [[Harvard College]] awarded Lewis the Bachelor of Arts ''[[Latin honors|cum laude]]'' after a mere three years of study, during which time he supported himself with part-time jobs. He then taught English for one year in a high school in Quincy, Massachusetts, then two years at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]]. In 1906, he married Mable Maxwell Graves. In 1908, Lewis returned to Harvard and began a Ph.D. in philosophy, which he completed in a mere two years. He then taught philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]], 1911–20, after which he returned again to Harvard, where he taught until his 1953 retirement, eventually filling the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy. His Harvard course on Kant's first ''Critique'' was among the most famous in undergraduate philosophy in the U.S. until he retired.

Lewis's life was not free of trials. His daughter died in 1930 and he suffered a heart attack in 1932.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Nevertheless, the publications of Lewis (1929) and Lewis and Langford (1932) attest to these years having been a highly productive period of his life. During this same period, he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1929, and in 1933, he presided over the [[American Philosophical Association]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Lewis accepted a visiting professorship at Stanford during 1957–58, where he presented his lectures for the last time. For the academic year 1959–60, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html wesleyan.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=2017-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to Menlo Park enabled him and his wife to spend his final years near their grandchildren.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Contributions to philosophy==

===Logic===
Lewis studied logic under his eventual Ph.D. thesis supervisor, [[Josiah Royce]], and is a principal architect of modern [[philosophical logic]]. In 1912, two years after the publication of the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', Lewis began publishing articles{{citation needed|reason=Give a few of them here.|date=November 2016}} taking exception to 
''Principia' ''s pervasive use of [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]], more specifically, to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s reading of ''a''→''b'' as "''a'' implies ''b''." Lewis restated this criticism in his reviews{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} of both editions of ''Principia Mathematica''. Lewis's reputation as a promising young logician was soon assured.

Material implication allows a true consequent to follow from a false antecedent. Lewis proposed to replace [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]] with [[strict implication]], such that a (contingently) false antecedent does not always strictly imply a (contingently) true consequent. This strict implication was not primitive, but defined in terms of [[negation]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], and a prefixed unary [[intensional statement|intensional]] [[modal operator]], &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is a formula with a classical bivalent [[truth value]], then &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;''X'' can be read as "''X'' is possibly true". Lewis then defined "''A'' strictly implies ''B''" as "&lt;math&gt;\neg \Diamond&lt;/math&gt;(''A''&lt;math&gt;\land \neg&lt;/math&gt;''B'')".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Lewis's strict implication is now a historical curiosity, but the formal [[modal logic]] in which he grounded that notion is the ancestor of all modern work on the subject. Lewis' &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; notation is still standard, but current practice usually takes its dual, &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; ("necessity"), as primitive and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt; as defined, in which case "''A'' strictly implies ''B''" is simply written as &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;(''A''→''B'').

His first logic text, ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'' (1918), went out of print after selling several hundred copies. At the time of its publication, it included the only discussion in English of the logical writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and only the second monograph, after Russell's of 1900, on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz'' (Cambridge: The University Press, 1900).&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[modal logic]] of ''A Survey'' was soon proved inconsistent,{{citation needed|reason=By whom? How?|date=November 2016}} Lewis went on to devise the modal systems S1 to S5, and to set these out in ''Symbolic Logic'' (1932) as possible formal analyses of the [[Alethic modality|alethic modalities]]. Lewis mildly preferred S2 over the others; the amended modal system of ''A Survey'' was S3, but it is S4 and [[S5 (modal logic)|S5]] that have generated sustained interest, mathematical as well as philosophical, down to the present day. S4 and S5 are the beginning of what is now called [[normal modal logic]]. On Lewis' strict implication and his modal systems S1-S5, see Hughes and Cresswell (1996: chapt. 11).

===Pragmatist but no positivist===
This section follows Dayton (2004) closely. Around 1930, American philosophy began to experience a turning point because of the arrival of logical empiricism, brought by European philosophers fleeing [[Nazi Germany]]. This new doctrine challenged American philosophers of a naturalistic or pragmatic bent, such as Lewis. In any event, logical empiricism, with its emphasis on scientific models of knowledge and on the logical analysis of meaning, soon emerged as a, and perhaps ''the'', dominant tendency in [[American philosophy]].

While many saw Lewis as kin to the logical empiricists, he was never truly comfortable in such company because he declined to divorce experience from cognition. Positivism rejected value as lacking cognitive significance, also rejecting the analysis of experience in favor of physicalism. Both rejections struck him as regrettable. Indeed, his growing awareness of the pragmatic tradition led him in the opposite direction. For Lewis, it is only within experience that anything can have significance for anything, and thus he came to see value as a way of representing the significance of knowledge for future conduct. These convictions led him to reflect on the differences between [[pragmatism]] and [[positivism]], and on the cognitive structure of value experiences.

Lewis agreed that [[pragmatism]] committed one to the [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peircean]] pragmatic test. But in a 1930 essay, "Pragmatism and Current Thought," he maintained that this commitment can be taken in either of two directions. One direction emphasises the subjectivity of experience. The other direction, and the one he took in 'his (1929), began with the Peirce's limitation of meaning to that which makes a verifiable difference in experience. Hence concepts are abstractions in which "the immediate is precisely that element which must be left out." But this claim must be properly understood. An operational account of concepts mainly eliminates the ineffable: "If your hours are felt as twice as long as mine, your pounds twice as heavy, that makes no difference, which can be tested, in our assignment of physical properties to things." Hence a concept is but a relational pattern. But it does not follow that one ought to discard the world as it is experienced:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In one sense, that of connotation, a concept strictly comprises nothing but an abstract configuration of relations. In another sense, its denotation or empirical application, this meaning is vested in a process which characteristically begins with something given and ends with something done in the operation which translates a presented datum into an instrument of prediction and control."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus knowledge begins and ends in experience, keeping in mind that the beginning and ending experiences differ. Knowledge of something requires that the verifying experience be actually experienced. Thus for the pragmatist, verifiability as an operational definition (or test) of the empirical meaning of a statement requires that the speaker know how to apply the statement, and when not to apply it, and be able to trace the consequences of the statement in situations both real and hypothetical.

Lewis firmly objected to the positivist conception of value statements as devoid of cognitive content, as merely expressive. For a pragmatist, all judgements are implicitly value judgements. Lewis (1946) sets out both his conception of sense meaning, and his thesis that valuation is a form of empirical cognition.

In his essay "Logical Positivism and Pragmatism," Lewis revealed his disagreement with verificationism by comparing it unfavorably with his preferred pragmatic conception of empirical meaning. From the outset, he saw both [[pragmatism]] and [[logical positivism]] as forms of [[empiricism]]. At first glance, it would seem that the pragmatic conception of meaning, despite its different formulation and its focus on action, very much resembles the logical positivist verification requirement. Nevertheless, Lewis argued that there is a deep difference between the two: pragmatism ultimately grounds meaning on conceivable experience, while positivism reduces the relation between meaning and experience to a matter of [[logical form]].

For Lewis, the positivist conception of meaning omits precisely what a pragmatist would count as empirical meaning. Specifying which [[observation sentence]]s follow from a given sentence helps us determine the empirical meaning of the given sentence only if the observation sentences themselves have an already understood meaning in terms of the specific qualities of experience to which the predicates of the observation sentences refer. Thus Lewis saw the logical positivists as failing to distinguish between "linguistic" meaning, namely the logical relations among terms, and "empirical" meaning, namely the relation expressions have to experience. (In the well-known terminology of [[Carnap]] and [[Charles W. Morris]], empirical meaning falls under [[pragmatics]], [[linguistic meaning]] under [[semantics]].) For Lewis, the logical positivist shuts his eyes to precisely that which properly confirms a sentence, namely the content of experience.

===Epistemology===
{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|date=November 2008}}
Lewis (1929), ''Mind and the World Order'', is now seen as one of the most important 20th century works in [[epistemology]]. Lewis is now included among the American [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], a belated assessment that is the major theme of Murphey (2005).

===Ethics and aesthetics===
{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|date=November 2008}}
Lewis's late writings on ethics include the monographs Lewis (1955, 1957) and the posthumous collection Lewis (1969). From 1950 until his death, he wrote many drafts of chapters of a proposed treatise on [[ethics]], which he did not live to complete. These drafts are included in the Lewis papers held at Stanford University.

Lewis (1947) contains two chapters on [[aesthetics]] and the [[philosophy of art]]. He was the first to employ the term "[[qualia]]", popularized by his student [[Nelson Goodman]], in its generally agreed modern sense.

===Legacy===
Lewis's work has been relatively neglected in recent years, even though he set out his ideas at length. He can be understood as both a late [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] and an early [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]], and had students of the calibre of [[Brand Blanshard]], [[Nelson Goodman]], and [[Roderick Chisholm]]. Joel Isaac, in his contribution to the 2006 ''Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society'' symposium referenced below, believes this neglect is justified.&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/article/200092&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's reputation is benefiting from the growing interest in the historical aspects of pragmatism and of American philosophy generally.{{vague|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The first CollegeWeekLive online college fair was in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-12-virtual-college-fair_N.htm |title=Registration open for 'virtual college fair' |website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company expanded the number and type of college admissions events offered each subsequent year. Each online college fair has featured 20–60 hours of live presentations from admissions experts. CollegeWeekLive makes this content available to audiences on demand if they are unable to attend the live show.&lt;ref name="collegeweeklive1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeweeklive.com/en_CA/Resources/College-Resources |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204072746/http://www.collegeweeklive.com/en_CA/Resources/College-Resources |archivedate=2013-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 the company announced the CollegeWeekLive Advisor Center,&lt;ref name="collegeweeklive1"/&gt; an online resource designed for high school guidance counselors that features lesson plans and videos tailored to aiding students in the college search process.

In January 2013 the company expanded its executive team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/idUSnGNXUWZRPa+1fe+GNW20130122 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924173428/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/22/idUSnGNXUWZRPa%201fe%20GNW20130122 |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 the company released the College Chat mobile application to the Google Play store, to lukewarm reviews, and an average rating of 2.9 stars out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegeweeklive.app |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140119094900/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.collegeweeklive.app |archivedate=2014-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2013, CollegeWeekLive becomes an approved credit provider through the National Board for Certified Counselors.  Counselors can now earn free credit contact hours toward their national certification on CollegeWeekLive for watching videos live or on demand.

In January 2014, CollegeWeekLive updated their website from a flash-based environment to an HTML5 environment.

September 2014, the Advisor center is replaced by High School Connect.

==Press==
CollegeWeekLive has been featured in the media including [[ABC News]], [[The Washington Post]], Fox 25 News, the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], [[Business Week]], [[USA Today]] and [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="CollegeWeekLive news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeweeklive.com/college-news |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706065301/http://www.collegeweeklive.com/college-news |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs''', (or '''CAAHEP'''), is an agency of [[accreditation]]  for the accredits postsecondary education programs in 28 health science fields.

Programmatic accreditation is granted after an education program is reviewed and it is determined that the program is in compliance with the profession's accreditation Standards.&lt;ref&gt;The profession's accreditation Standards designate what an entry-level health care employee in a particular field needs to know in order to be successful in that field&lt;/ref&gt; A not-for-profit organization, CAAHEP is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). It is based in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

== Members and leadership ==

*CAAHEP's members are organizations that represent the professions accredited by CAAHEP and/or the institutions that teach CAAHEP accredited programs.
*CAAHEP's leadership is composed of both a Commission and a Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caahep.org/Member-Organizations-and-Their-Commissioners/ CAAHEP Commissioners and Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals who serve as Commissioners are representatives from CAAHEP's sponsoring organizations, along with a recent graduate of a CAAHEP accredited program and members of the general public.  The Commissioners approve the organization's mission, vision, and bylaws, and decide which health science professions qualify to take part in the CAAHEP accreditation system.  CAAHEP is also led by a Board of Directors, whose members are elected from among the Commissioners.When an education program in a health science profession seeks CAAHEP accreditation, the program will work with that profession's Committee on Accreditation (CoA).&lt;ref&gt;It is the CoA that leads the program through accreditation process, reviewing the self-study, organizing the site visit of the program, and formulating the accreditation recommendation of the program for approval by the CAAHEP Board of Directors&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief History ==

In 1904, the [[American Medical Association]] established its Council on Medical Education (CME). The CME developed a rating system of medical schools in 1905, initiated inspections in 1906, and classified the institutions in 1907. The AMA then collaborated with the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study of the quality of medical education that resulted in the [[Flexner Report]] in 1910. These early efforts subsequently led to the development of specialized accreditation for the education of health professionals. It was also the precursor of accreditation activities for most other professional associations.

Early in the 1930s, several national bodies requested the collaboration of the AMA in establishing accreditation for education programs in their areas of interest. These early efforts established a basis and pattern for the role of the AMA in collaborating with other national associations for the accreditation of health sciences education programs. From 1935 through 1976, the recognized agency was the AMA Council on Medical Education. In 1976 the CME delegated to the newly formed Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) the responsibility and authority for health sciences education accreditation. In October, 1992 the AMA announced its intent to support the establishment of a new and independent agency to assume the accreditation responsibilities of CAHEA&lt;ref&gt;That new agency, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) was incorporated in May, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''École et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre''''' ({{lang-en|School and Observatory for Earth Sciences}}) is an institution under the supervisory authority of the University of Strasbourg and the CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research) in charge of education, research, observation in Earth Science and its diffusion.  Situated in two buildings located on the central campus of the University of Strasbourg, EOST consist of more than 150 permanent employees among its staff.

==History==

The School and Observatory for Earth Sciences was created by decree in 1997 from the fusion of the Geology and Earth Physics institutes of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Strasbourg. Interests in Earth Physics arose around 1880 in Germany with the birth of seismology and [[meteorology]]. The origin of the Geology Institute is even older and is linked to the French development of the University during the first half of the 19th century.
After the [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexation of Alsace by Germany]], the Imperial University pursued a policy of elitism, basing its excellence on fundamental research as practiced at the University of Wilhelm von Humboldt (early 19th century). The same model was used when the French Grandes Ecoles were built. 
Since 1920, the IPGS and the [[IPGP]] (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris) conducted research and geophysical observations non-stop, without interruption during the [[World War II|War]]. Between 1939 and 1945, the IPGS was relocated in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], were the Diplômes d'Ingénieurs were signed by Louis Cagnard, a famous French geophysicist.

==The school==

[[File:Ecole et observatoire des sciences de la terre-Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|Main building of the EOST and the IPGS]]
The EOST engineering school is a French [[Grande École]] specialized in Earth sciences and accredited to deliver European University degrees, such as the [[Licentiate (degree)|Licence]]/[[Master's degree in Europe|Master]]/[[Doctorate|Doctorat]], but also the French [[Diplôme d'Ingénieur]]. The school is a component of the [[University of Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;http://eost.unistra.fr/en/, Official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
Professors and researchers of the EOST are either affiliated with the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg&lt;ref name="unistra.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eost.unistra.fr/en/recherche/ipgs/|title=EOST - École et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre : Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg - UMR 7516 CNRS - Université de Strasbourg|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (IPGS) or with the Laboratoire d'Hydrologie et de Géochimie de Strasbourg&lt;ref name="unistra.fr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eost.unistra.fr/en/recherche/lhyges/|title=EOST - École et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre : Laboratory of Hydrology and Geochemistry of Strasbourg - Université de Strasbourg|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (LHyGeS). External keynote speakers from the industry and various research organisms also contribute extensively to teaching at the EOST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eost.unistra.fr/en/ecole-dingenieurs/cursus/enseignants-exterieurs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130902173544/http://eost.unistra.fr/en/ecole-dingenieurs/cursus/enseignants-exterieurs/ |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research units ==

EOST hosts two research units: the Institute of Physics of the Earth of Strasbourg &lt;ref name="unistra.fr"/&gt; IPGS and the Laboratory of hydrology and geochemistry of Strasbourg &lt;ref name="unistra.fr1"/&gt; LHyGeS.

=== Institute of Physics of the Earth of Strasbourg / Institut de physique du globe de Strasbourg===

Once dedicated to more general scientific topics, research at IPGS is currently focused on the comprehension of geological and geophysical phenomenon as well as applied sciences: environment, natural resources (energy, water) and hazards (seismic risks, landslides).

=== Laboratory of hydrology and geochemistry of Strasbourg / Laboratoire d'hydrologie et de géochimie de Strasbourg===

Since its beginning in 2009 by the gathering of 3 research teams, the LHyGeS is dedicated to the analysis and the understanding of hydrological and geochemical phenomenon in natural environments. This unit focuses on the construction of quantitative and predictive patterns, through an approach combining geosciences, environmental and engineering sciences.

EOST is the leader of the "laboratory of excellence" G-eau-thermie profonde project aiming to initiate a new research center for deep geothermal energy. Improving the knowledge of deep geothermal reservoirs and developing techniques are the main goals for the exploitation of this sustainable resource.

EOST is involved in the REALISE network (Réseau Alsacien des Laboratoires en Ingénierie et Sciences de l’Environnement) and also provides leadership and administration. This network sets out to structure regional environmental research.

==Observatories==

EOST is an Observatory of Universe Sciences ([http://www.insu.cnrs.fr/node/1128 OSU]) under the supervisory authority of the CNRS (French national center for scientific research) and the University of Strasbourg. Its missions are to contribute to the monitoring of natural phenomenon and to provide the scientific community with data. 
Earthquakes, magnetic fields, gravity force, water chemical composition, gravitational instability are some examples of the natural phenomenon observed by EOST. To understand operational mechanisms at different time and space scales require human and instrumental resources.
Observation is based on measuring devices relaying data to computer systems acquisition and processing. Maintenance and improvement of these tools are an important part of the mission of the observatories.
Data analysis and model building is part of the mission as well as providing the scientific community with data. It aims to the better understanding and prediction of natural phenomenon. 
Each year, a great amount of published scientific articles are based on data collected by EOST’s observational services, organized into themes: seismology, geodesy and gravimetry, magnetism, landslide processes, environment. 
EOST is the national coordinator (for the BCSF or OHGE) or active participant member of national networks (as the BCMT or RENAG). This network organization allows the sharing of means and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eost.unistra.fr/observatoires/|title=EOST - École et Observatoire des Sciences de la Terre : Présentation - Université de Strasbourg|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seismology ===
The record and analysis of seismic waves enable researchers to understand the earth dynamics and to improve knowledge of seismic hazard. 
EOST is in charge of measuring devices localized both in the North-East of France and abroad (Sénégal, Terres Austales et Antarctiques Françaises). They are integrated in national (Réseau large Bande Permanent RLBP, Réseau Accélérométrique Permanent,…) and international networks. 
EOST is the national coordinator of the RLBP as well as the Bureau Central sismologique Français (BCSF) and the Réseau national de surveillance sismique (RéNaSS).These last two centralize all earthquakes data located on the French territory. Instrumental data are completed by population enquiries: the BCSF gathers comments on earthquakes felt in France.

* Réseau large bande permanent (RLBP)
* Observatoire sismologique régional du Fossé Rhénan
* Géoscope (Terres australes, Antarctique, Sénégal et Alsace)

=== Geodesy and gravimetry ===

Geodesy and gravimetry allow the analysis of earth structure and strain. These methods are complementary to seismology.
The geodesic observational service of Strasbourg is part of the Réseau National de Géodésie RENAG (national geodesic network). EOST is responsible for 8 GPS stations located in the Rhénan area, assigned to study the tectonic strain of the North-East of France. 
EOST is also responsible for the Gravimetric observatory of Strasbourg. Through a supraconductive gravimeter, the observatory provides relative and continuous gravity field measurements. The observatory is part of the international project Global Geodynamics Project (GGP).
The project MIGA intends to create a new infrastructure based on quantum mechanics. This infrastructure will allow a better comprehension of terrestrial gravity variations and its implications.

* RENAG (Fossé rhénan)
* Observatoire gravimétrique de Strasbourg

=== Magnetism ===

Observation of magnetism aims to comprehend the origins of magnetic fields variations at different time scales. 
EOST runs six permanent magnetic stations located in the Terres Australes et Antarctiques Française and in Madagascar Island. They are part of the Bureau Central de magnétisme terrestre (BCMT) network, under the supervisory authority of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, and the international network INTERMAGNET (INTERnational Real-time MAGnetic observatory NETwork).
* BCMT (Terres australes, Antarctique et Madagascar)

=== Landslides processes ===

L’Observatoire multidisciplinaire des instabilités des versants OMIV (Multidisciplinary observatory for landsides processes) follows the evolution of several landslides in France through geophysics, geodesic, geochemical and hydrologic data. EOST is responsible for the Super-Sauze, La Valette (Southern Alps) and Villerville (Normandie) landslides as well as the coordination of the acquisition and the analysis of kinematics data.
* Observatoire multidisciplinaire des instabilités des versants

=== Environment: surfaces et interfaces continentales ===

The main study site of the Observatoire hydro-géochimique de l’environnement (OHGE) is a granitic catchment basin: the Strengbach. This site is located in the Vosgian massif between 800 and 1100 meters high. The ecosystems and its changes, linked to natural or anthropic disruption, have been studied and monitored for more than twenty-five years throughout a multidisciplinary approach.

* Observatoire hydrogéochimique de l’environnement

== Museums and collections ==

The [http://eost.unistra.fr/musees/musee-sismologie/ Museum of seismology and terrestrial magnetism], located in the former seismological station of Strasbourg, inaugurated on 1 July 1900, displays instruments for geophysical measurements and their evolution throughout history. 
The collection of the [http://eost.unistra.fr/musees/mms/ Museum of mineralogy] hosts more than 30 000 international samples of minerals and meteors. Many of the most beautiful pieces are frequently exposed in France and abroad. The museum is situated in a historical monument of EOST, built at the end of the 19th century.

{{For|the computer algebra system|Giac (software)}}
'''Global Information Assurance Certification''' (GIAC) is an information security certification entity that specialises in technical and practical certification as well as new research in the form of its GIAC Gold program. [[SANS Institute]] founded the certification entity in 1999 and the term GIAC is trademarked by [[The Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies]].

GIAC provides a set of vendor-neutral [[computer security]] certifications linked to the training courses provided by the [[SANS Institute|SANS]]. GIAC is specific to the leading edge technological advancement of [[Computer security|IT security]] in order to keep ahead of "[[Black hat hacking|black hat]]" techniques.  Papers written by individuals pursuing GIAC certifications are presented at the SANS Reading Room on GIAC's website.

Initially all SANS GIAC certifications required a written paper or "practical" on a specific area of the certification in order to achieve the certification. In April 2005, the SANS organization changed the format of the certification by breaking it into two separate levels. The "silver" level certification is achieved upon completion of a multiple choice exam. The "gold" level certification can be obtained by completing a research paper and has the silver level as a prerequisite.

As of January 21, 2017, GIAC has granted 89,827 certifications worldwide.&lt;ref name="www.giac.org"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giac.org/ | accessdate = 2012-06-18 | author =  | title = Global Information Assurance Certification | publisher = Global Information Assurance Certification | date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2350">'''Higher Education for American Democracy''' was a report to U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] on the condition of higher [[education]] in the [[United States]]. The commission to write this report was established on July 13, 1946, and it was chaired by [[George F. Zook]]. 

The report is significant not only for its six-volume size but for the fact that it marks the first time in United States history that a President establishes a commission for the purposes of analyzing the country's system of education, a task typically left to the states as prescribed by the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, John R. ''A History of American Higher Education''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins UP, 2004. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Such Presidential commissions are, today, relatively common. See, for example, President Ronald Reagan's,  [[A Nation at Risk]], and President George W. Bush's, "A Test of Leadership," sometimes known as [[Commission on the Future of Higher Education|The Spellings Report]]. 

The Truman Commission Report, as it is sometimes known, calls for several significant changes in postsecondary education, among them, the establishment of a network of public [[community college]]s, which would be free of charge for "all youth who can profit from such education".&lt;ref name="Presidency"&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=12802 Harry S. Truman: Statement by the President Making Public a Report of the Commission on Higher Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission helped popularize the phrase "community college" in the late 1940s and helped shape the future of two-year degree institutions in the  U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacc.nche.edu/AboutCC/history/Pages/significantevents.aspx AACC | Significant Events&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also calls for increased Federal spending in the form of "scholarships, fellowships, and general aid".&lt;ref name="Presidency"/&gt;

== Discussion ==
[[Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist)|Benjamin Ginsberg]] explains the connection between the increased ability to pay tuition and the increase in services provided in his book ''The Fall of the Faculty.'' According to Ginsberg, "there have been new sorts of demands for administrative services that require more managers per student or faculty member than was true in the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginsberg|first=Benjamin|title=The fall of the faculty : the rise of the all-administrative university and why it matters|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199782444|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Goldwater Institute]] echoes this sentiment with its findings that, "Between 1993 and 2007, the number of full-time administrators per 100 students at America's leading universities grew by 39 percent, while the number of employees engaged in teaching, research or service only grew by 18 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jay|first=Greene|title=Administrative Bloat at American Universities: The Real Reason for High Costs in Higher Education|url=http://goldwaterinstitute.org/article/administrative-bloat-american-universities-real-reason-high-costs-higher-education|publisher=Goldwater Institute|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed below, the "higher education bubble" is controversial and has been rejected by some economists. Indeed, many Americans still believe in the value of a college education, although they are unsure about its quality and affordability.  Data shows that the wage premium{{snd}} the difference between what those with a four-year college degree earn and what those with only a high school education earn{{snd}} has increased dramatically since the 1970s, but so has the 'debt load' incurred by students due to the tuition inflation.&lt;ref name = Simkovic&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941070 Risk-Based Student Loans] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Lemieux 2006"&gt;Thomas Lemieux, Postsecondary Education And Increasing Wage Inequality, 96 AM.

The data also suggests that, notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008–09, student [[Default (finance)|loan default]] rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Student loan default rates jump|date=12 September 2011|first=Justin|last=Pope|website=Phys.org|publisher=Science X network|url=http://phys.org/news/2011-09-student-loan-default.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/12/for-profit-colleges-student-loan-_n_959058.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Chris | last=Kirkham | title=Led By For-Profit Colleges, Student Loan Defaults At Highest Level In A Decade | date=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they are more expensive to employ (they earn higher wages).&lt;ref name="Education Pays"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm Education Pays]&lt;/ref&gt;  The global management consulting firm [[McKinsey and Company]] projects a shortage of college-trained workers, and a surplus of workers without college degrees, which would cause the wage premium to increase, and cause differences in unemployment rates to become even more dramatic.&lt;ref&gt;McKinsey Global Institute, [http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Labor_Markets/An_economy_that_works_for_US_job_creation An Economy that Works: Job Creation and America's Future], June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; What is also interesting is that the cost of tuition over last 4 years from 2009–12 has been increasing steadily over the years while wages have remained stagnant.
The inflation has been at really low levels in US in past 4 years and there are no explainable reasons why [http://studyn.us/2014/09/13/cost-masters-us-a-significant-rise-over-the-years%20 Cost of Masters / Graduation] is rising higher than inflation

In 1971, ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' ran an article "Education: Graduates and Jobs: A Grave New World," which stated that the supply of post-graduate students was around twice larger than the expected future demand in upcoming decades.&lt;ref name=north/&gt; In 1987, [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[William Bennett]] first suggested that the availability of loans may in fact be fueling an increase in tuition prices and an education bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Our Greedy Colleges|date=Feb 18, 1987|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/18/opinion/our-greedy-colleges.html|first=William J.|last=Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Bennett hypothesis" claims that readily available loans allow schools to increase tuition prices without regard to [[Price elasticity of demand|demand elasticity]]. [[College and university rankings|College rankings]] are partially driven by spending levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How U.S. News Calculates the College Rankings|year=2010|publisher=[[US News and World Report]]|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/08/17/how-us-news-calculates-the-college-rankings}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher tuition prices are correlated with increased public perceptions of {{linktext|prestige}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Estimating the Payoff to Attending a More Selective College: An Application of Selection on Observables and Unobservables|year=1999|publisher=Dale, S. B. and Krueger, A. B., NBER|url=http://www.irs.princeton.edu/pubs/pdfs/409.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past thirty years, demand has increased as institutions improved facilities and provided more resources to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Credits that Count: How Credit Growth and Financial Aid Affect College Tuition and Fees|year=2011|publisher=Ley, K. and Keppo, J., SSRN|ssrn=1766549|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1766549|last1=Ley|first1=Katharina|last2=Keppo|first2=Jussi|journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, schools tend to enroll fewer students as they improve student offerings and increase prices. This suggests that it is in schools' best interest to increase tuition prices as much as possible, so long as financial aid ensures an ability to pay on the part of students and parents.

A variation on the higher education bubble theory suggests that there is no general bubble in higher education{{snd}} that is, on average, higher education really does boost income and employment by more than enough to make it a good investment{{snd}} but that degrees in some specific fields may be overvalued because they do little to boost income or improve job prospects, while degrees in other fields may in fact be ''undervalued'' because students do not appreciate the extent to which these degrees could benefit their employment prospects and future income.  Proponents of this theory have noted that schools charge equal prices for tuition regardless of what students study, the interest rate on federal student loans is not adjusted according to risk, and there is evidence that undergraduate students in their first 3 years of college are not very good at predicting future wages by major.&lt;ref name="Simkovic"/&gt;

A 2011 article in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', related concern that new college graduates hiring rates are up by 10 percent and that attaining a secondary level education eventually pays off. It is also suggested that high school graduates are three times more likely to live in poverty than students with higher education degrees. A recent study from the Labor Department suggests that attaining a bachelor's degree "represents a significant advantage in the job market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/30/class-2011-hiring_n_942571.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Alexander | last=Eichler | title=Hiring Is Up For The Class Of 2011, But Previous Classes Still Struggle | date=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the article also claims that those who only have a high school education{{snd}} unemployment is slightly higher at a rate of 9.3 percent. The proponents of the article also claim that companies are most likely to hire an applicant straight from college rather than one who has been unemployed.

A 2010 article in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', suggest ten main benefits of obtaining a degree via higher education.  Also suggesting that a college degree pays off financially and intangibly for the graduate, and overall for society.

The view that higher education is a bubble is controversial. Most [[economist]]s do not think the [[rate of return|returns]] to college education are falling{{snd}} in fact, the data suggests the rate of return is increasing.&lt;ref name = Simkovic/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Lemieux 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Race Between Education and Technology|author=Claudia Goldin, Lawrence F.

In a [[financial bubble]], assets like houses are sometimes purchased with a view to reselling at a higher price, and this can produce rapidly escalating prices as people speculate on future prices. An end to the spiral can provoke abrupt selling of the assets, resulting in an abrupt collapse in price{{snd}} the bursting of the bubble. Because the asset acquired through college attendance{{snd}} a higher education{{snd}} cannot be sold (only rented through wages), there is no similar mechanism that would cause an abrupt collapse in the value of existing degrees. For this reason this analogy could be misleading. However, one rebuttal to the claims that a bubble analogy is misleading is the observation that the 'bursting' of the bubble are the negative effects on students who incur student debt, for example, as the [[American Association of State Colleges and Universities]] reports that "Students are deeper in debt today than ever before ... The trend of heavy debt burdens threatens to limit access to higher education, particularly for low-income and first-generation students, who tend to carry the heaviest debt burden. Federal student aid policy has steadily put resources into student loan programs rather than need-based grants, a trend that straps future generations with high debt burdens. Even students who receive federal grant aid are finding it more difficult to pay for college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Debt Burden, Volume 3, Number 8, August 2006 | first=Nick|last=Hillman | publisher=[[American Association of State Colleges and Universities]] | year=2006 | url=http://www.aascu.org/media/pm/pdf/v3n8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this analogy, the increased inability of students to pay for their debt would represent the crash or bubble bursting, thus causing the tax payers to bail out the government for giving out bad loans -as the ratio of the aggregate debt compared to the aggregate earning potential grows to the tipping point, due to the finite amount of high paying positions, the limiting factor in this analogy.

However, the data actually show that, notwithstanding a slight increase in 2008–2009, student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkham"/&gt;  And even during the recession, those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed, even though they earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Education Pays"/&gt;

[[Ohio University]] economist [[Richard Vedder]] has written in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that:

{{quote|A key measure of the benefits of a degree is the college graduate's earning potential{{snd}} and on this score, their advantage over high-school graduates is deteriorating. Since 2006, the gap between what the [[median]] college graduate earned compared with the median high-school graduate has narrowed by $1,387 for men over 25 working full time, a 5% fall. Women in the same category have fared worse, losing 7% of their income advantage ($1,496). A college degree's declining value is even more pronounced for younger Americans. According to data collected by the [[College Board]], for those in the 25-34 age range the differential between college graduate and high school graduate earnings fell 11% for men, to $18,303 from $20,623. The decline for women was an extraordinary 19.7%, to $14,868 from $18,525. Meanwhile, the cost of college has increased 16.5% in 2012 dollars since 2006, according to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]' higher education tuition-fee index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vedder|first=Richard|last2=Denhart|first2=Christopher|title=How the College Bubble Will Pop|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|date=8 January 2014|url=http://www.aei.org/article/education/how-the-college-bubble-will-pop/|accessdate=12 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nader Habibi, who runs the website overeducation.org, writing in [[The New Republic]], cited this evidence:

{{quote|In a 2014 study, two economists affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that since 1990 at least 30 percent of all workers (aged 22 to 65) with college degrees have been consistently employed in jobs that do not require a college degree for the required tasks, even ten years after graduation. Not surprisingly, the percent of recent college graduates (aged 22 to 27) with such jobs has been much higher than the figure above and has ranged from 38 percent to 49 percent since 1990. ... The Obama administration recently created a valuable online database called College Scorecard to offer a more realistic picture of income prospects with a college degree. One of the indicators in this database shows that more than half of graduates at hundreds of colleges are earning less than the average income of someone holding a high school degree ($25,000 a year) ten years after enrollment. Ideally, this ratio should be zero. A large number of unemployed and underemployed graduates are also burdened with high student loan debts—more than $100 billion in 2013 alone—they have trouble paying back. We should not forget the billions that federal, state and local governments spend on higher education through subsidies and financial aid—$157.5 billion in 2014. The portion of this spending that supports the education of underemployed graduates could be used more effectively for job creation or training of students in vocational skills which are more in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Habibi|first1=Nader|title=America Has an Overeducation Problem|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/124943/america-overeducation-problem|website=New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Alternatives to bubble theory ===
A different proposal for the cause of rising tuition is the reduction of state and federal appropriations to colleges, making them rely more on student tuition. Thus, it is not a bubble, but a form of [[cost-shifting|shifting costs]] away from state and federal funding over to students.&lt;ref name="24tuition"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/education/24tuition.html Public Universities Relying More on Tuition Than State Money]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' 2011/01/24&lt;/ref&gt; This has mostly applied to public universities which in 2011 for the first time have taken in more in tuition than in state funding,&lt;ref name="24tuition" /&gt; and had the greatest increases in tuition.&lt;ref name="DeltaCost" /&gt; Implied from this shift away from public funding to tuition is [[privatization]], although ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that such claims are exaggerated.&lt;ref name="24tuition" /&gt;

Another proposed cause of increased tuition is [[U.S. Congress]]' occasional raising of the 'loan limits' of student loans, in which the increased availability of students to take out deeper loans sends a message to colleges and universities that students can afford more, and then, in response, institutions of higher education raise tuition to match, leaving the student back where he began, but deeper in debt. Therefore, if the students are able to afford a much higher amount than the [[free market]] would otherwise support for students without the ability to take out a loan, then the tuition is 'bid up' to the new, higher, level that the student can now afford with loan subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Federal Student Loans: Patterns in Tuition, Enrollment, and Federal Stafford Loan Borrowing Up to the 2007–08 Loan Limit Increase | publisher=gao.gov| year=2011 | url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-470R}}&lt;/ref&gt; One rebuttal to that theory is the fact that even in years when loan limits have not risen, tuition has still continued to climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kargar|first1=Mahyar|last2=Mann|first2=William|title=Financial Aid and College Pricing: Estimates from the PLUS Program|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814842|website=SSRN|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that may not disprove this proposed cause: It may instead mean that other factors besides 'loan limit' increases played a part in the increases in tuition.

A third theory claims that as a result of federal law that severely restricts the ability of students to discharge their federally guaranteed student loans in bankruptcy, lenders and colleges know that students are on the hook for any amount that they borrow, including late fees and interest (which can be capitalized and increase the principal loan amount), thus removing the incentive to only provide students loans that the students can be reasonably expected to repay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Jane|title=Student Loans: Time to Reform the Law That Treats Debtors Like Crooks|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loans-time-to-reform-the-law-that-treats-debtors-like-crooks/|accessdate=6 January 2018|agency=CBS News|date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weissman|first1=Jordan|title=How the Bush Administration Pointlessly Screwed Over Student Borrowers|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/04/16/student_loans_in_bankruptcy_how_the_bush_administration_pointlessly_screwed.html|website=Slate|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As proof of this theory, it has been shown that returning bankruptcy protections (and other Standard Consumer Protections) to Student Loans would cause lenders to be more cautious, thereby causing a sharp decline in the availability of student loans, which, in turn, would decrease the influx of dollars to colleges and universities, who, in turn, would have to sharply decrease tuition to match the lower availability of funds.&lt;ref name="Why College Prices Keep Rising"&gt;{{cite web | title=Why College Prices Keep Rising | publisher=Forbes.com| year=2012 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2012/03/19/why-college-prices-keep-rising}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this theory, if student loans did not have the ability to file for bankruptcy, it would be more profitable for the lender if the student defaulted (due to the increases in the amount of the loan after fees and interest are capitalized), and thus there is no [[free market]] pressure-type motive for the lender or the college to help the student avoid default. This is especially true because the government, if it is the lender or guarantor of the loan, has the ability to garnish the borrower's wages, tax return, and Social Security Disability income without a court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Student Loan Debt Surpasses Credit Card Debt-What to Do?| first=Howard| last=Dvorkin| publisher=foxbusiness.com| year=2010| url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/09/20/student-loan-debt-surpasses-credit-card-debt| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826033005/http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/09/20/student-loan-debt-surpasses-credit-card-debt/| archivedate=2011-08-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have called the Federal Government 'predatory' for making loans which will have such a high default rate, since the default rate for Student Loans is projected to reach 46.3% of all federal dollars disbursed to students at for-profit colleges in 2008 (Budget lifetime default rate, loan default rate only 18.6%, meaning that 18.6% of all loans contain 46.3% of all dollars loaned out).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=46 Percent Of Federal Loans Paid To For-Profit Institutions Will Go Into Default | publisher=huffingtonpost.com/AOL.com| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/23/46-percent-default-rate-o_n_800283.html | first=Danielle | last=Wienerbronner | date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Subject: Default Rates for Cohort Years 2004–2008 | first=Katrina|last=Turner | publisher=ifap.ed.gov| year=2010 | url=http://ifap.ed.gov/eannouncements/122010CDRlifetimerate2010.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic and social commentator [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] has remarked at [[LewRockwell.com]] that "To speak of college as a bubble is silly. A bubble does not pop until months or years after the funding ceases. There is no indication that the funding for college education will cease."&lt;ref name=north&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north975.html|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]|accessdate=November 15, 2011|author=[[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]]|title=College: Why It Is Not a Bubble|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azar Nafisi]], [[Johns Hopkins University]] professor and bestselling author of ''[[Reading Lolita in Tehran]]'', has stated on the ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' that a purely economic analysis of a higher education bubble is incomplete:

{{quote|Universities become sort of like canaries in the mine for a culture. They become the sort of standard of where a culture is going.

And universities represent all the different areas and fields within a society. And the students and faculty come from all these fields.

And there was a mention of our universities being the best in the world.&lt;ref name=newshour&gt;{{cite news|title=Is a College Diploma Worth the Soaring Student Debt?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june11/college_05-27.html|publisher=''[[PBS NewsHour]]''|date=May 27, 2011|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Recommendations ===
Based on the available data, recommendations to address rising tuition have been advanced by experts and consumer and students' rights advocates:

* Because schools are assured of receiving their fees no matter what happens to their students, they have felt free to raise their fees to very high levels, to accept students of inadequate academic ability, and to produce too many graduates in some fields of study. Therefore, schools should be penalized when their graduates default on their student loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Harmful Effects of Federal Student Aid: Dollars, Cents, and Nonsense| publisher =Center for College Affordability and Productivity| date =25 June 2014| url =http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/research/studies/harmful-effects-of-federal-student-aid/| accessdate = 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Reflections on the underemployment of college graduates| publisher = Teachers College at Columbia University| date =25 June 2014| url =http://educationbythenumbers.org/content/underemployment-college-grads_1589/| accessdate = 18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Regulatory or legislative action to lower or freeze the tuition, such as [[Canada]]'s [[tuition freeze]] model, should be enacted by federal lawmakers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Commission Calls for "Reduced Debt Burden" -- Time for Education Department to Act | publisher=ProjectOnStudentDebt.org | year=2006 | url=http://projectonstudentdebt.org/update_81806.vp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential downsides to tuition-freezing guarantees are evident, being offered by only a few dozen colleges. Under the guarantees, the student's tuition does not change for the extent of their education. Each year's freshmen pay a higher rate, which is then guaranteed through their years in college.&lt;ref name="LAT2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Freezing tuition: It's not such a hot idea. | publisher= Los Angeles Times | year=2012 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/06/opinion/la-ed-tuition-freeze-20120706}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 1 in 3 college students transfers to another school at some point. If tuition freezes become the default model for colleges, students would feel less able to change schools because they would be entering at a new, probably higher tuition.&lt;ref name="LAT2012" /&gt;
** More research should be done: Recognised financial expert, Mark Kantrowitz, issued the following recommendations:&lt;ref name="finaid.org"/&gt;
:* "The National Center for Education Statistics should increase the frequency of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study to annual, from triennial, in order to permit more timely tracking of the factors affecting tuition rate increases. Likewise, NCES (National Center for Education Statistics) should take steps to improve the efficiency of the data collection and publication for the Digest of Education Statistics, so that all tables will include more recent data. The most recent data listed in some tables is five years old."
:* "The US Department of Education should study the relationship between increases in average EFC (Expected Family Contribution) figures and average tuition rates. In addition, it would be worthwhile to examine how historical average EFC figures have changed relative to family income when measured on a current and constant dollar basis for each income quartile."
* Other popular ways to address the rising tuition problems faced by students include completing your general education requirements at a community college, which is much cheaper than initially going to a university, obtaining scholarships and other financial aid, as well as looking for ways to pay in-state tuition.&lt;ref name=Cutting&gt;{{cite web | last=Kantrowitz | first=Mark | title=Cutting College Costs|publisher=FinAid|year=2013|url=http://www.finaid.org/questions/cuttingcollegecosts.phtml|accessdate= 24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lastly, in order to cope with the rising cost of tuition, many students have started working part-time.&lt;ref name="Cutting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How to Cope with Rising Tuition Costs|publisher=Global Campus For Students|year=2011|url=http://www.gcstudent.org/how-to-cope-with-rising-tuition-costs|accessdate= 22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to getting a job after college, to further cope with the rising costs of tuition, some experts have suggested that the best move might be to get a job while in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Bruce|title=How to Go to College Without Going Broke (and Yes, You Still Should)|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/11/03/how-to-go-to-college-without-going-broke-and-yes-you-still-sho|publisher=Daily Finance|date=3 November 2011| accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate these recommendations, some colleges help students in job searches and job placement after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Job Placement Colleges: INFORMATION AND TIPS ON INTERNSHIPS AND PAID INTERNSHIP|publisher=CollegeTips.com| year=2011|url=http://www.collegetips.com/college-money/college-job-placement.php|accessdate= 22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8894">'''Independent study''' is a form of [[education]] offered by many high schools, colleges, and other educational institutions.&lt;ref name="HendersonNathenson1984" /&gt; It is sometimes referred to as ''directed study'', and is an educational activity undertaken by an individual with little to no supervision.&lt;ref name="Moore2009" /&gt; Typically a student and professor or teacher agree upon a topic for the student to research with guidance from the instructor for an agreed upon amount of credits.&lt;ref name="Winebrenner2012" /&gt; Independent studies provide a way for well-motivated students to pursue a topic of interest that does not necessarily fit into a traditional academic curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Study|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/ah/programs/graduate/independent-study.html|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a way for students to learn specialized material or gain research experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacker|title=Using a Blog in an Independent Study|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/using-a-blog-in-an-independent-study/35486|publisher=Chronicles of Higher Learning|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Independent studies provide students opportunities to explore their interests deeper and make important decisions about how and where they will direct their talents in the future.&lt;ref name=Fetterman1988 /&gt; Another way to understand independent study is to understand [[Distance education|learning from a distance]]. Learning from a distance is a theory in which the student is at a physical or a mental distance from his or her teacher. The student and the teacher are connected by something such as a worksheet, an essay, or through a website on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Michael Grahame|title=Toward a theory of independent learning and teaching.|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1973|pages=661–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent study programs==

For elementary and junior high, independent study is sometimes a Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program, where the student must research the topic and formulate and answer questions.&lt;ref name="Fetterman1988" /&gt; At the end, they develop and present a product, although not all GATE systems participate in this.&lt;ref name="knight2006" /&gt;

Many charter schools in the US provide independent study and [[homeschooling]] in a variety of formats: online, in-person or a hybrid of online/in-person interaction.&lt;ref name="English1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2013" /&gt; These independent study programs are particularly helpful for those who find a traditional classroom setting to be unsatisfactory. For example, independent study is ideal for those who have children, health issues, intense work schedules, or gifted academic ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Study|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/eo/is/|publisher=California Department of Education|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often students with high scholastic standing are encouraged to take independent studies to try to learn without attendance in a class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littleton|first=A.C.|author-link=Ananias Charles Littleton |title=The Accounting Exchange|date=June 1933|pages=160|jstor=238320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent study is also useful for self-directed learning activities that allow the student to be self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Empey|first=Donald W.|title=Independent Study|journal=The Clearing House|year=1968|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A program titled "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates" (REU) has been founded by the National Science Foundation which provides funding for undergraduates to engage in different areas of research outside of the classroom. Groups are formed of graduates, undergraduates, and faculty to work on a specific research project.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first=James|title=Doing Research with Undergraduates|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Doing-Research-With/128613/|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate= 19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality types==

Studies have shown that personality can influence whether a person enjoys an independent study project, rather than lectures. People that believe the teacher should be authoritarian did not perform well in independent studies. However, there is evidence to suggest that personality should not solely dictate who is allowed to receive independent study.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Kathryn|author2=W.J. McKeachie|title=Personality and Independent Study|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=June 1959|volume=50|issue=3|doi=10.1037/h0041286 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-03-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not afforded the same attention as individual personality on behalf of the potential student, some interest should be given to the teachers and or professor's ability to relate to the distance learner. Breaking the mold of in-class instruction versus the distance learner can be a difficult task to undertake by the instructor. They are not the same environment and changes and or accommodations should be made while keeping integrity of the overall class.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Institute of Philosophy''' of the [[University of Warsaw]] (Polish ''Instytut filozofii Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego'') is a research institution located in Warsaw, part of the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology of the University of Warsaw. It is renowned mainly for its contribution to the development of modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] ([[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]] - [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]]) and to [[history of ideas]] ([[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] - [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Maria Ossowska]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Adam Schaff]]). Provides master's degree studies, doctor's degree studies and postgraduate studies in philosophy both in Polish and in English.

== The 18th and 19th century ==

The main centre of the medieval and early modern [[History of philosophy in Poland|Polish philosophy]] was [[Kraków]] - history of philosophy in Warsaw begins in the 18th century. In the pre-partition Varsovian institutions, the [[Collegium Nobilium (Warsaw)|Collegium Nobilium]] and the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Szkoła Rycerska]] to the lecturers of philosophy belonged [[Antoni Wiśniewski]] and [[Marcin Nikuta]]. In the 19th century, after the foundation of the University of Warsaw in 1815, due to [[russification]] of the schools Polish philosophy, both idealist and positivist, developed mainly outside universities. Among main Polish philosophers connected with the 19th century University of Warsaw were [[Adam Zabellewicz]] and  [[Henryk Struve]].

== Interwar period ==

After 1918, when Poland regained independence, University of Warsaw was reorganized. Chairs of philosophy were held by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] and [[Stanisław Schayer]].

Initially, philosophical education were organized in the Faculty of Historical-Philosophical Studies (1915–16), soon transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1916–27), and then into the Faculty of the Humanities (Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and Schayer) and the Faculty of Mathematical Studies and Physics (Łukasiewicz, Leśniewski and Ajdukiewicz).

Other important philosophers teaching in Warsaw were [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Henryk Elzenberg]], [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]]. Worldwide renown in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] was enjoyed by the Warsaw School of Logic, part of the philosophical movement of [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]].

During the German occupation of Warsaw secret courses of philosophy were conducted by Łukasiewcz, Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and others.

== History after 1945 ==

After 1945, during the stalinist era, due to political predominance of marxist philosophy in Poland some professors were partially prohibited from pursuing didactic activity. After the [[Polish October]] (1956) a separate Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1954–65) emerged from the Faculty of Arts and many leading philosophers were allowed to teach. It was subsequently transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical-Sociological Studies (1965–68).

In the 50. and 60. [[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] emerged. To this informal group of non-analytical philosophers belonged mainly former marxists (called "revisionist"), inspired to some extent by the ideas of Tatarkiewicz and Ossowskis. After the [[1968 Polish political crisis|Polish March]] (1968), when many "revisionist" Polish philosophers and sociologists (for example [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], [[Adam Schaff]]) participated in the events, philosophy at Warsaw University was subjected to a thorough reorganization. Chairs were renamed to departments and the Faculty of Philosophical Studies were forcibly joined with the Faculty of Sociology, within which the Institute of Philosophy was established.

In the post-war period the tradition of Lvov-Warsaw School was also continued. To the most important philosophers and logicians of the post-war period connected with the University of Warsaw belong [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Zdzisław Augustynek]], [[Bronisław Baczko]], [[Marek Fritzhand]], [[Henryk Jankowski]], [[Andrzej Kasia]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Władysław Krajewski]], [[Tadeusz Kroński]], [[Jan Legowicz]], [[Stefan Morawski]], [[Elżbieta Pietruska-Madej]], [[Marian Przełęcki]], [[Adam Schaff]], [[Marek Siemek]], [[Adam Sikora]], [[Roman Suszko]], [[Klemens Szaniawski]] and [[Bogusław Wolniewicz]].

{{Politics sidebar|Disciplines}}
'''International relations''' ('''IR''') or '''international affairs''' ('''IA''') — commonly also referred to as '''international studies''' ('''IS'''), '''global studies''' ('''GS'''), or '''global affairs''' ('''GA''') — is the study of interconnectedness of [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on a global level. Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of [[political science]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field similar to [[global studies]], or an entirely independent academic [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] in which students take a variety of internationally focused courses in [[social science]] and [[humanities]] disciplines. In all cases, the field studies relationships between ''political entities'' ([[polity|polities]]) such as [[sovereign state]]s, [[international organization|inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[international non-governmental organization]]s (INGOs), other [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), and [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs), and the wider [[world-system]]s produced by this interaction. International relations is an [[academic]] and a [[public policy]] field, and so can be [[Positive statement|positive]] and [[Normative statement|normative]], because it analyses and formulates the [[foreign policy]] of a given state.

As political activity, international relations dates from the time of the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] ({{circa|460–395 BC}}), and, in the early 20th century, became a discrete academic field (no. 5901 in the [[4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature]]) within political science. In practice, international relations and international affairs forms a separate academic program or field from political science, and the courses taught therein are highly interdisciplinary.&lt;ref&gt;"International Relation", ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' (1993) pp.000–0000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, international relations draws from the fields of [[politics]], [[economics]], [[international law]], [[communication studies]], [[history]], [[demography]], [[area studies|geography]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[criminology]], [[psychology]], and [[gender studies]]. The scope of international relations encompasses issues such as [[globalization]], [[diplomatic relations]], [[Sovereign state|state sovereignty]], [[international security]], [[ecological]] [[sustainability]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[nationalism]], [[economic development]], [[global finance]], [[terrorism]], and [[human rights]].

==History==
{{see also|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)}}
The history of international relations can be traced back to thousands of years ago; [[Barry Buzan]] and Richard Little, for example, consider the interaction of ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-states, starting in 3,500 [[Anno Domini|BC]], as the first fully-fledged international system.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Richard Little. International Systems in World History: Remaking the Study of International Relations. published 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French Spanish and Polish fashion.jpg|thumb|The official portraits of King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] dressed according to [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and Polish fashion reflects the complex politics of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]

The history of international relations based on [[sovereign states]] and many more types are often traced back to the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, a stepping stone in the development of the modern state system. Prior to this the European medieval organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Beaulac: "The Westphalian Model in defining International Law: Challenging the Myth", ''Australian Journal of Legal History'' Vol. 9 (2004), [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2004/9.html]; Krasner, Stephen D.: "Westphalia and all that" in Judith Goldstein &amp; Robert Keohane (eds): ''Ideas and Foreign Policy'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993), pp.235-264&lt;/ref&gt; More than the Peace of Westphalia, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders.

The centuries of roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of the independent, sovereign [[Sovereign state|states]], the institutionalization of [[diplomacy]] and armies. The [[French Revolution]] added to this the new idea that not princes or an oligarchy, but the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, should be defined as sovereign. Such a state in which the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a [[nation-state]] (as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state). The term [[republic]] increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. (In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.)

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via [[colonialism]] and the "standards of civilization". The contemporary international system was finally established through [[decolonization]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered "modern", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed "pre-modern".

Further, a handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered "post-modern". The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. "Levels of analysis" is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.

What is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after [[World War I]], and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other [[social science]]s. The use of capitalizations of the "I" and "R" in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (6th century BC), [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (5th century BC), [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' providing further elaboration.

Similarly, [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]] draws upon the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of [[democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/|publisher=Stanford press|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under [[natural law]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[John Locke]] offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the 20th century, in addition to contemporary theories of [[liberal internationalism]], [[Marxism]] has been a foundation of international relations.

===Study of international relations===
[[File:UN Members Flags2.JPG|thumb|Flags of the member states of the [[United Nations]]]]
International relations as a distinct field of study began in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. IR emerged as a formal [[academic discipline]] in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at [[Aberystwyth]], [[University of Wales]] (now [[Aberystwyth University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/|title=Aberystwyth University - Department of International Politics|website=www.aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold by [[Alfred Eckhard Zimmern]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abadía|first=Adolfo A.|date=2015|title=Del liberalismo al neo-realismo. Un debate en torno al realismo clásico |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278025848|journal=Telos. Revista de Estudios Interdisciplinarios en Ciencias Sociales|language=es|volume=17|issue=3|pages=438 – 459|issn=1317-0570}}&lt;/ref&gt; and endowed by [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]]. [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] is the oldest international relations faculty in the [[United States]], founded in 1919. In the early 1920s, the [[London School of Economics]]' department of international relations was founded at the behest of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Philip Noel-Baker]]: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at universities in the US and in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The creation of the posts of [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]] at LSE and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE developed a focus on the history of IR in the [[early modern]], [[History of colonialism|colonial]] and [[Cold War]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter Carlsnaes et al eds.|first=|title=Handbook of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0uVHo4ZLc4C&amp;pg=PA5|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=1–28|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9781446265031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] (now the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]), which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Committee on International Relations (University of Chicago)|Committee on International Relations]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was the first to offer a [[graduate degree]], in 1928. [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], a collaboration between [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard]], opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher History. http://fletcher.tufts.edu/About/Fletcher-History &lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Glendon College]] and the [[Norman Paterson School of International Affairs]] were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively. In 2012, [[Ramon Llull University]] initiated the first International Relations degree in [[Barcelona]],the favourite city 
fully in English.

==Theory==
{{Main article|International relations theory}}

===Normative theory===
In the academic discipline of international relations, Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens (2008) make the case that the [[normative]] position or [[normative theory]] is to make the world a better place, and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of [[Tacit assumption|implicit assumptions]] and [[explicit assumption]]s that constitute a non-normative position and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], political [[idealism]] and political [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9780199297771}}, Fourth edition, pp.2-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemological theory===
IR theories are roughly divided into one of two [[epistemology|epistemological]] camps: "positivist" and "post-positivist". Positivist theories aim to replicate the methods of the natural sciences by analysing the impact of material forces. They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of military forces, balance of powers etc. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an objective and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as [[rational choice theory]], on the grounds that the scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a "science" of IR is impossible.

A key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by "power"; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under "traditional" IR as positivist theories make a distinction between "facts" and normative judgments, or "values".

During the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third "Great Debate" (Lapid 1989).

===Positivist theories===

====Realism====
[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]] focuses on state security and power above all else. Early realists such as [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morganthau|first=Hans|title=Politics Among Nations: The struggle for Power and Peace|year=1978|location=New York|pages=4–15|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). Similarly, any act of war must be based on self-interest, rather than on idealism. Many realists saw [[World War II]] as the vindication of their theory.

Realists argue that the need for survival requires state leaders to distance themselves from traditional morality. Realism taught American leaders to focus on interests rather than on ideology, to seek peace through strength, and to recognize that great powers can coexist even if they have antithetical values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0|location=|pages=86–87|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thucydides]], the author of [[History of the Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]] is considered to be the founding father of the realist school of political philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Cochrane, Charles|title=Thucydides and the Science of History|date=1929|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of more complex political message within Thucydides' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebow|first=Richard Ned|date=2001|title=Thucydides the Constructivist|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3118232|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=547–560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst others, philosophers like [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]] are considered to have contributed to the Realist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baylis|first=John|title=The globalization of world politics : an introduction to international relations|date=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0198782636|page=149|edition=2.|author2=Smith, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists in this sense. [[Political realism]] believes that politics, like society, is governed by objective laws with roots in [[human nature]]. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.

Placing realism under positivism is far from unproblematic however. E. H. Carr's "What is History" was a deliberate critique of positivism, and [[Hans Morgenthau]]'s aim in "Scientific Man vs Power Politics" was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically. Morgenthau's belief in this regard is part of the reason he has been classified as a "classical realist" rather than a realist.

Major theorists include [[E. H. Carr]], [[Robert Gilpin]], [[Joanne Gowa]], [[Charles Kindleberger]], [[Stephen Krasner]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Kenneth Waltz]].

====Liberalism====
{{Main|Liberalism (international relations)}}
{{See also|Liberal internationalism}}

According to liberalism, individuals are basically good and capable of meaningful cooperation to promote positive change. Liberalism views states, nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations as key actors in the international system. States have many interests and are not necessarily unitary and autonomous, although they are sovereign. Liberal theory stresses interdependence among states, multinational corporations, and international institutions. Theorists such as [[Hedley Bull]] have postulated an international society in which various actors communicate and recognize common rules, institutions, and interests. Liberals also view the international system as anarchic since there is no single overarching international authority and each individual state is left to act in its own self-interest. Liberalism is historically rooted in the liberal philosophical traditions associated with [[Adam Smith]] and Immanuel Kant that posit that human nature is basically good and that individual self-interest can be harnessed by society to promote aggregate social welfare. Individuals form groups and later, states; states are generally cooperative and tend to follow international norms.&lt;ref name="Mingst, Karen A. 2011"&gt;Mingst, Karen A., &amp; Arreguín-Toft, Ivan M. (2011). Essentials of International Relations (5th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberal international relations theory]] arose after World War I in response to the inability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Norman Angell]], who argued that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|title=History Learning site|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/woodrow_wilson.htm|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by [[E. H. Carr]]. A new version of "idealism" that focused on [[human rights]] as the basis of the legitimacy of [[international law]] was advanced by [[Hans Köchler]].

Major theorists include [[Montesquieu]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Robert Keohane]], [[Michael W. Doyle]], [[Francis Fukuyama]], and [[Helen Milner]].&lt;ref&gt;Mingst, Karen A., &amp; Snyder, Jack L. (2011). Essential Readings in World Politics (4th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neoliberalism====
{{Further|Complex interdependence}}
[[neoliberalism in international relations|Neoliberalism]] seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that [[non-state actor]]s (NSAs) and [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs) matter. Proponents argue that states will cooperate irrespective of [[relative gains]], and are thus concerned with [[absolute gains]]. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any [[international organization]]s blocking a nation's right to [[sovereignty]]. Neoliberal institutionalism, an approach founded by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, emphasize the important role of international institutions in maintaining an open global trading regime.

Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are [[Christina Davis (academic)|Christina Davis]], [[Judith L. Goldstein]], [[G. John Ikenberry]], [[Robert Keohane]], [[Lisa Martin]], and [[Joseph Nye]].

====Regime theory====
[[Regime theory]] is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.

While [[realism (international relations)|realism]] predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and [[collective security]] among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from [[Stephen Krasner]], who defines regimes as "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue-area".&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, Stephen D., ed. 1983. "Structural Causes and Regime Consequences: Regimes as Intervening Variables." In ''International Regimes'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like [[Joseph Grieco]] have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation ''never'' happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).

===Post-positivist/reflectivist theories===

====International society theory (the English school)====
{{Main|English school of international relations theory}}
International society theory, also called the English School, focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and [[public international law|international law]]. Unlike neo-realism, it is not necessarily positivist. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Robert H. Jackson]] are perhaps the best known pluralists.

====Social constructivism====
{{Main|Constructivism (international relations)}}
[[Radical constructionism|Social constructivism]] encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of [[ontology]], such as the [[structure and agency|structure-and-agency]] debate, as well as questions of [[epistemology]], such as the "material/ideational" debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a [[social theory]] which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.

[[Constructivism in international relations|Constructivism in IR]] can be divided into what [[Ted Hopf]] (1998) calls "conventional" and "critical" constructivism. Common to all varieties of constructivism is an interest in the role that ideational forces play. The most famous constructivist scholar, [[Alexander Wendt]], noted in a 1992 article in ''[[International Organization]]'' —and later in his 1999 book ''Social Theory of International Politics—''that "anarchy is what states make of it". By this he means that the anarchical structure that neo-realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.

For example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a "Hobbesian" anarchy) then the system will be characterized by warfare. If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a "Lockean" anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist. Anarchy in this view is constituted by state interaction, rather than accepted as a natural and immutable feature of international life as viewed by neo-realist IR scholars.

Prominent social constructivist IR scholars are [[Rawi Abdelal]], [[Michael N. Barnett|Michael Barnett]], [[Mark Blyth]], [[Martha Finnemore]], [[Peter A. Hall]], [[Ted Hopf]], [[Margaret Keck]], [[Elizabeth Kier]], [[Kathleen McNamara]], [[Kathryn Sikkink]] and [[Alexander Wendt]].

====Feminism====
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
Feminist IR considers the ways that international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). From its inception, feminist IR has also theorized extensively about men and, in particular, masculinities. Many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article "Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals" Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinized culture within the defence establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.

Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline - often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.

Prominent scholars include [[Carol Cohn]], [[Cynthia Enloe]], [[Charlotte Hooper]], [[Sara Ruddick]], [[J. Ann Tickner]] and [[Jacqui True]].

====Marxism====
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and Neo-Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, [[colonialism]] brought in sources for raw materials and [[captive markets]] for exports, while [[decolonialization]] brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.

A prominent derivative of Marxian thought is [[critical international relations theory]] which is the application of "[[critical theory]]" to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] which followed Marx's concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions.  Their emphasis on the "critical" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as [[Andrew Linklater]], [[Robert W. Cox]] and [[Ken Booth (academic)|Ken Booth]] focus on the need for human [[freedom (political)|emancipation]] from the nation-state. Hence, it is "critical" of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric.

Further linked in with Marxist theories is [[dependency theory]] and the [[Core-periphery|core–periphery model]], which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence.

Marxist theories receive little attention in the United States. It is more common in parts of Europe and is one of the more important theoretic contributions of Latin American academia to the study of global networks.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Leadership theories===

====Interest group perspective====
[[Interest group]] theory posits that the driving force behind state behaviour is sub-state interest groups. Examples of interest groups include political [[lobbyists]], the military, and the corporate sector. Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power.

====Strategic perspective====
Strategic perspective is a theoretical{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} approach that views individuals as choosing their actions by taking into account the anticipated actions and responses of others with the intention of maximizing their own welfare.

====Inherent bad faith model====
{{Further|Bad faith|inherent bad faith model}}
The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = Douglas   | last2 = Starr | first2 = Harvey | year = 1981 | title = The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 1–33 | jstor = 3791139 | doi = 10.2307/3791139 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref&gt;"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent...", ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, [[Susan T. Fiske]], Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent", The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-structuralist theories===
[[Post-structuralism (international relations)|Post-structuralist theories of IR]] developed in the 1980s from [[Postmodernism (international relations)|postmodernist studies in political science]]. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as "power" and "agency") and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of "narratives" plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis; for example, [[Post-structural feminism|feminist poststructuralist]] work has examined the role that "women" play in global society and how they are constructed in war as "innocent" and "civilians". (See also [[Feminism (international relations)|feminism in international relations]].) Rosenberg's article "Why is there no International Historical Sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Justin|date=2006|title=Why is There No International Historical Sociology?|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=307–340|doi=10.1177/1354066106067345|issn=1354-0661}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a key text in the evolution of this strand of international relations theory. Post-structuralism has garnered both significant praise and criticism, with its critics arguing that post-structuralist research often fails to address the real-world problems that international relations studies is supposed to contribute to solving.

==Levels of analysis&lt;!--'Levels of analysis in international relations' and 'Levels of Analysis in international relations' redirect here--&gt;==

===Systemic level concepts===
International relations are often viewed in terms of '''levels of analysis'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The ''systemic level'' concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterized by [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]]. Focusing on the systemic level of international relations is often, but not always, the preferred method for neo-realists and other structuralist IR analysts. 

====Sovereignty====
{{main article|Westphalian sovereignty}}
Preceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. Described in [[Jean Bodin]]'s "Six Books of the Commonwealth" in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign's "own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;p. 13, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: [[Carolina Academic Press]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a foundation of sovereignty permits, is indicated by a sovereign's obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to Decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the [[Iraq War]], there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations.

====Power====
{{main article|Power (international relations)}}
The concept of Power in international relations can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]], hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering [[economics]], [[diplomacy]] and [[culture|cultural]] influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.

====National interest====
Perhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, [[national interest]] is a state’s action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. National interest, whether aspirational or operational, is divided by core/vital and peripheral/non-vital interests. Core or vital interests constitute the things which a country is willing to defend or expand with conflict such as territory, ideology (religious, political, economic), or its citizens. Peripheral or non-vital are interests which a state is willing to compromise. For example, in the German annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in 1938 (a part of Czechoslovakia) under the [[Munich Agreement]], Czechoslovakia was willing to relinquish territory which was considered ethnically German in order to preserve its own integrity and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;p. 17-20, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-state actors====
In the 21st century, the status-quo of the international system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to the international system. Whether it is [[transnational corporations]], [[liberation movements]], [[non-governmental agencies]], or [[international organizations]], these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any international transaction. Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. [[Al-Qaeda]], as an example of a non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 14-15, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power blocs====
The existence of power blocs in international relations is a significant factor related to [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]]. During the [[Cold War]], the alignment of several nations to one side or another based on ideological differences or national interests has become an endemic feature of international relations. Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Soviet blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. Leaders like U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] under the [[Truman Doctrine]] believed it was necessary to spread democracy whereas the [[Warsaw Pact]] under Soviet policy sought to spread communism. After the Cold War, and the dissolution of the ideologically homogeneous Eastern bloc still gave rise to others such as the [[South-South Cooperation]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 15-16, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Polarity=====
{{main article|Polarity (international relations)}}
Polarity in international relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from bipolarity during the [[Cold War]], with the international system dominated by the conflict between two [[superpower]]s, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as '''multipolar''', with power being shared among [[Great powers]].

[[File:World empires and colonies around World War I.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Empires of the world in 1910]]
The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had led to unipolarity, with the United States as a sole superpower, although many refuse to acknowledge the fact. [[People's Republic of China|China's]] continued rapid economic growth (in 2010 it became the world's second-largest economy), combined with the respectable international position they hold within political spheres and the power that the Chinese Government exerts over their people (consisting of the largest population in the world), resulted in debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future. However, China's strategic force unable of projecting power beyond its region and its nuclear arsenal of 250 warheads (compared to 7700 of the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;) mean that the unipolarity will persist in the policy-relevant future.

Several theories of international relations draw upon the idea of [[polarity (power)|polarity]]. The [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the [[First World War]], the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the [[Cold War]], being a central mechanism of [[Kenneth Waltz]]'s Neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.

[[Robert Gilpin]]'s [[Hegemonic stability theory]] also draws upon the idea of polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. [[Hegemony]] is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by [[Kenneth Waltz]], stating that the end of the [[Cold War]] and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.

The case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz's article titled "The Stability of a Bipolar World" &lt;ref&gt;Daedalus, 93/3: (1964), 881-909&lt;/ref&gt; was followed in 1999 by [[William Wohlforth]]'s article titled "The Stability of a Unipolar World"&lt;ref&gt;International Security, 24/1: (1999), 5-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Waltz's thesis can be expressed in [[power transition theory]], which states that it is likely that a [[great power]] would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, [[A. F. K. Organski]], argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese, and Dutch hegemony.

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing [[globalization]], particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.

====Dependency====
[[File:ISAF soldier looking for enemy positions in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[Dependency theory]] is a theory most commonly associated with [[Marxism]], stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).

====Systemic tools of international relations====
* [[Diplomacy]] is the practice of communication and '''negotiation''' between representatives of states. To some extent, all other tools of international relations can be considered the failure of diplomacy. Keeping in mind, the use of other tools are part of the communication and negotiation inherent within diplomacy. Sanctions, force, and adjusting trade regulations, while not typically considered part of diplomacy, are actually valuable tools in the interest of leverage and placement in negotiations.
* [[International sanctions|Sanctions]] are usually a first resort after the failure of diplomacy, and are one of the main tools used to enforce treaties. They can take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions and involve the cutting of ties and imposition of barriers to communication or trade.
* [[War]], the use of force, is often thought of as the ultimate tool of international relations. A popular definition is that given by [[Clausewitz]], with war being "the continuation of politics by other means". There is a growing study into "new wars" involving actors other than states. The study of war in international relations is covered by the disciplines of "[[War Studies|war studies]]" and "[[strategic studies]]".
* The mobilization of international shame can also be thought of as a tool of international relations. This is attempting to alter states' actions through '[[name and shame|naming and shaming]]' at the international level. This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as [[Amnesty International]] (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a "Gulag"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL10/014/2005/en%3E|title=Error - Amnesty International|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Human Rights Watch]]. A prominent use of was the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] 1235 procedure, which publicly exposes state's human rights violations. The current [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] has yet to use this mechanism
* The allotment of economic and/or diplomatic benefits such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement policy]]; candidate countries are only allowed to join if they meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]].
* The mutual exchange of ideas, information, art, music and language among nations through [[cultural diplomacy]] has also been recognized by governments as an important tool in the development of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgkDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cultural+diplomacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAmeT22rbeAhUCc98KHaLzCW4Q6AEIVzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20diplomacy&amp;f=false ''Music, Art and Diplomacy East-West cultural Interactions and the Cold War'' Editors: Siom Mukkonen &amp; Pekka Suutari.

===Unit-level concepts in international relations===
As a level of analysis the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.

====Regime type====
It is often considered that a state's form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international relation.

[[Democratic peace theory]] is a theory that suggests that the nature of [[democracy]] means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.

[[Communism]] justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.

====Revisionism/status quo====
States can be classified by whether they accept the international [[status quo]], or are revisionist—i.e., want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. [[Japan]] is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.

====Religion====
Religion can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system. Different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. One dramatic example is the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48) that ravaged much of Europe. Religion is visible as an organizing principle particularly for [[Islamic state]]s, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the [[liberal international relations theory]]. Events since the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, the role of [[Islam]] in [[terrorism]], and the strife in the [[Middle East]] have made it a major topic. There are many different types of religions. One being Confucianism, which is China's major world view (Alexander, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder, ed.|first=Jack|title=Religion and International Relations Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZfrWuXy77sC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=1–23|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9780231153386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual or sub-unit level concepts===
The level beneath the unit (state) level can be useful both for explaining factors in international relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.
* Psychological factors in international relations{{spaced ndash}}Evaluating psychological factors in international relations comes from the understanding that a state is not a "black box" as proposed by [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], and that there may be other influences on foreign policy decisions. Examining the role of personalities in the decision making process can have some [[explanatory power]], as can the role of misperception between various actors. A prominent application of sub-unit level psychological factors in international relations is the concept of [[Groupthink]], another is the propensity of policymakers to think in terms of analogies.
* Bureaucratic politics{{spaced ndash}} Looks at the role of the [[bureaucracy]] in decision making, and sees decisions as a result of bureaucratic in-fighting, and as having been shaped by various constraints.
* Religious, ethnic, and secessionist groups{{spaced ndash}} Viewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to [[ethnic conflict]]s, [[religious wars]], transnational [[diaspora]] ([[diaspora politics]]) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. This is particularly useful in the context of the pre-modern world of weak states.
* Science, technology and international relations{{spaced ndash}} How science and technology impact global health, business, environment, technology, and development.
* [[International political economy]], and economic factors in international relations&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006. [[Donald Markwell]], ''Keynes and International Economic and Political Relations'', Trinity Paper 33, Trinity College, University of Melbourne.

==Institutions in international relations==
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|right|The [[United Nations Secretariat Building]] at the [[United Nations headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]
[[International organization|International institutions]] form a vital part of contemporary international relations. Much interaction at the system level is governed by them, and they outlaw some traditional institutions and practices of international relations, such as the use of [[war]] (except in self-defence).

===Generalist inter-state organizations===

====United Nations====
{{Main article|United Nations}}
The [[United Nations]] (UN) is an [[international organization]] that describes itself as a "global association of [[governments]] facilitating co-operation in [[international law]], [[international security]], [[economic development]], and social equity"; It is the most prominent international institution. Many of the legal institutions follow the same organizational structure as the UN.

====Organisation of Islamic Cooperation====
{{Main article|Organisation of Islamic Cooperation}}
The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organization]] consisting of 57 member states. The organisation attempts to be the collective voice of the [[Muslim world]] (Ummah) and attempts to safeguard the interests and ensure the progress and well-being of [[Muslims]].

'''Katherine Rebecca Pettit''' (February 23, 1868 – September 3, 1936) was an American [[educator]] from [[Kentucky]] who contributed to the [[settlement school]] movement of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125927/Katherine-Pettit| title =Katherine Pettit| publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica online| accessdate =2008-03-26|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Born the child of Benjamin Pettit on a prosperous farm in [[Fayette County, Kentucky]], Pettit attended two years at [[Sayre School]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. A member of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs]] and the [[Daughters of the American_Revolution]], she became a [[progressivism|progressive]] educator.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wik"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.womeninkentucky.com/site/education/K_Pettit.html |title= Educators: Katherine Pettit |publisher= Women in Kentucky |accessdate= 2008-03-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement schools==

Under the auspices of by the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs beginning in 1899, Katherine Pettit and [[May Stone (educator)|May Stone]] spent three summers in social settlement work in Kentucky at Camp Cedar Grove, Camp Industrial (which later became the [[Hindman Settlement School]]), and Sassafras Social Settlement. Their journals, filled with words to local ballads and idiomatic expressions of their students and families from homes nearby, describe in detail their classes in health and homemaking, as well as teacher training.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Quare Women's Journals: May Stone &amp; Katherine Pettit's Summers in the Kentucky Mountains and the Founding of the Hindman Settlement School'', Jess Stoddart, ed. Ashland, Ky.: Jesse Stuart Foundation, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A local elder Solomon Everage watched the two women—"quare fotched-on women from the level land,"&lt;ref&gt;Tabler, Dave. "Kentucky's fotched-on women," (September 8, 2010) Appalachian History: Stories, quotes and anecdotes. Accessed December 12, 2010. [http://www.appalachianhistory.net/2010/09/kentuckys-fotched-on-women.html www.appalachianhistory.net/2010/09/kentuckys-fotched-on-women.html]&lt;/ref&gt;—for some time and eventually asked them to establish a permanent industrial school in the Troublesome Creek area.

===Hindman Settlement School===
In 1902 with financing from the Women's Christian Temperance Union, Katherine Pettit and [[May Stone (educator)|May Stone]] co-founded [[Hindman Settlement School]] in [[Knott County, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="wik"/&gt; Pettit said that the goal of Hindman was "to know all we can and teach all we can."&lt;ref name="hindman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindmansettlement.org/about_us/mission.html |title=Mission &amp; History |publisher=Hindman Settlement School |accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519200245/http://www.hindmansettlement.org/about_us/mission.html |archivedate=2008-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kentucky WCTU sponsored the school until 1915, when it was formally incorporated as a private, non-profit, non-sectarian, and non-denominational corporation.

May Stone remained at Hindman as principal until 1936. Many of the graduates remained in the area. [[Carl Perkins]], a native of Hindman who served thirty-six years in the United States House of Representatives, was a graduate of the settlement school.

===Pine Mountain Settlement School===
In 1913, Pettit co-founded [[Pine Mountain Settlement School]] with [[Ethel de Long Zande|Ethel deLong Zande]] in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]]. At Pine Mountain, Pettit directed outdoor work while Zande directed academics.&lt;ref name="wik"/&gt;

Founding Pine Mountain as an example of the [[settlement movement]], Pettit and deLong modeled the school after [[Hull House]].&lt;ref name="berea"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.berea.edu/hutchinslibrary/specialcollections/saa10.asp| title =Southern Appalachian Archives: Guide to Pine Mountain Settlement School Collection| publisher =Berea College| accessdate =2008-03-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Berea College]]'s Southern Appalachian Archives,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Pettit and deLong] hoped that their modern ideas about health, nutrition, work efficiency, farm management, and the cultural value of indigenous crafts would permeate the surrounding communities -- both through the children, and through direct contact with adults.&lt;ref name="berea"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pine Mountain Settlement School is a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Kentucky|National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="pmss about"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.pinemountainsettlementschool.com/about.php| title =About PMSS| publisher =Pine Mountain Settlement School| accessdate =2008-03-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appalachian culture==
Katherine Pettit labored to preserve and encourage the teaching of [[Appalachia]]n culture through arts, [[folk music|folk songs]], and [[tradition|customs]].&lt;ref name="wik"/&gt;

Her teachings on [[natural dye|natural vegetable dyeing]] were recorded in [http://toto.lib.unca.edu/findingaids/books/booklets/viner_katherine_pettit_dye_book/default_viner_pettit_dye_book.htm The Katherine Pettit Book of Vegetable Dyes]. Wilmer Stone Viner, who had worked at Pine Mountain Settlement School, published this in 1946 after moving from Kentucky to [[Saluda, North Carolina|Saluda]], [[North Carolina]]. Consequently, Pettit's recipes have influenced craft practices in western North Carolina.&lt;ref name="hunter pettit"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://wcudigitalcollection.cdmhost.com/u?/p4008coll2,3946| title =Katherine Pettit| publisher =Hunter Library Digital Collections| accessdate =2008-03-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book, dedicated to the memory of Katherine Pettit, quotes a memorial tablet in the Pine Mountain Settlement School Chapel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Katherine Pettit, 1869 - 1936, [[American pioneer|pioneer]] and trail-breaker. Forty years she spent creating opportunity for mountain children here and elsewhere. In life, she ever refused praise. In death, she is too great for it.&lt;ref name="vegetable"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://wcudigitalcollection.cdmhost.com/u?/p4008coll2,3849| title =The Katherine Pettit Book of Vegetable Dyes| publisher =Hunter Library Digital Collections| accessdate =2008-03-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Lobsang Sangay''' ({{bo |t = བློ་བཟང་སེང་གེ་}}, "kind-hearted lion"; born September 5, 1968) is the current [[president]] of Tibetan-government-in-exile officially known as [[Central Tibetan Administration]] (CTA), and a Harvard University educated international law and democracy expert.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npc.org.au/speakers/dr-lobsang-sangay/ Dr Lobsang Sangay], National Press Club of Australia website&lt;/ref&gt; He has been chief executive of the [[Tibetan Government-in-Exile]] since 8 August 2011. Following the election, at the request of the [[14th Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan parliament-in-exile amended the organisation's bylaws to remove the Dalai Lama's role as ceremonial head of state, making Lobsang Sangay its highest leader. In 2012, to reflect this change, Lobsang Sangay's title as chief executive was changed from ''kalön tripa'' ("prime minister") to ''[[sikyong]]'' ("ruler" or "regent"). Sangay holds American citizenship&lt;ref name="RaphAhr"&gt;Raphael Ahren, [https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-1st-israel-visit-a-tibetan-leader-quietly-seeks-support-hails-jews-return/ In 1st Israel visit, a Tibetan leader quietly seeks support, hails Jews’ return], ''The Times of Israel'', June 25, 2018: "Sangay, who spent many years in the US and holds American citizenship."&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Early life and education==
Sangay was born in a refugee community in [[Darjeeling]], [[India]] in 1968, with a typical Shichak (settlement) background amidst fields, cows and chickens, fetching wood in the forest and helping his parents' small business, including selling winter sweaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.facebook.com/ourkatri.lobsangsangay?sk=info |title = Lobsang Sangay facebook page |website = facebook.com |accessdate = December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lobsang"&gt;Toomey, Christine ''Meet the Heir to the Dalai Lama'' The Globe and Mail, August 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the Tibetan school in Darjeeling, Sangay received his [[Bachelor's degree#Honours Degrees and academic distinctions|B.A. (Hons)]] and [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] degrees from the [[University of Delhi]] in India. In 1995, the then Kashag offered a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] spot to him at [[Harvard Law School]] for his role in Chushi Gangdruk affairs, where he subsequently received his [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]] degree the same year.&lt;ref name="News &amp; Events"&gt;{{cite news |author = Harvard Law School |work = News &amp; Events |title=Lobsang Sangay LL.M. '96 S.J.D.

==Academic career ==
In 2003, Sangay organized five conferences between Chinese and Tibetan scholars, including a meeting between the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] and thirty-five Chinese scholars at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/Lobsang-Sangay.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013035541/http://www.oslofreedomforum.com/speakers/Lobsang-Sangay.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, he became the first Tibetan to earn a [[Doctor of Juridical Science|S.J.D.]] degree from Harvard Law School and was a recipient of the 2004 Yong K. Kim' 95 Prize of excellence for his dissertation ''Democracy in Distress: Is Exile Polity a Remedy? A Case Study of Tibet's Government-in-exile''.&lt;ref name="News &amp; Events" /&gt; In 2006, Sangay was selected as one of the twenty-four Young Leaders of Asia by the [[Asia Society]], a global organization working to strengthen relationships and promote understanding among the people, leaders and institutions of Asia and the United States. Funded by Hao Ran foundation, Sangay was a Senior Fellow at the East Asian Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School through 2011. He is an expert in Tibetan law and [[international human rights law]].

==Governmental career==
On 10 March 2011, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] proposed changes to the exile charter to remove his position of authority within the organisation and devolve his political power to the elected leader, thus making the Kalön Tripa (or Chief Minister) the highest-ranking officeholder. These changes were ratified on 29 May 2011,[6] even though, according to Sangay, there was "a high level of anxiety among Tibetans" over the Dalai Lama's decision to relinquish his own political authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Interview: Dr. Lobsang Sangay |url = http://thediplomat.com/author-spotlight/2012/09/04/meet-the-diplomat-writers-28/ |work=The Diplomat |accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vienna 2012-05-26 - Europe for Tibet Solidarity Rally 158 Lobsang Sangay.jpg|thumb|left|L. Sangay in Vienna, Austria, in&amp;nbsp;2012.]]
On 27 April 2011 Sangay was elected Kalön Tripa of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]].&lt;ref name="KalonTripa2011-LobsangSangay"&gt;{{cite web |last=Staff |title=Lobsang Sangay - Candidate |publisher=''Kalon Tripa 2011'' |year=2009 |url = http://kalontripa.org/endorse/see-all-nominees/76.html |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.thetibetpost.com/en/news/international/1638-dr-lobsang-sangay-is-the-new-political-leader-of-tibet |publisher=''The Tibet Post International''|first = Cornelius |last = Lundsgaard |accessdate=2011-04-29 |date=2011-04-27|title=Dr. Lobsang Sangay is the New Political Leader of Tibet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13205481 |publisher = [[BBC News]] |date = 2011-04-27 |accessdate = 2011-04-29 |title = Lobsang Sangay elected Tibetan exile leader}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sangay won 55% of the votes, defeating [[Tenzin Tethong]] (37.4%) and [[Tashi Wangdi]] (6.4%). 83,400 [[Tibet]]ans were eligible to vote and 49,000 ballots were cast.&lt;ref name="2011BBC" /&gt; On 8 August 2011, Sangay took the oath of office, succeeding Lobsang Tenzin as Kalön Tripa. In a statement at the time, the Dalai Lama referred to Lobsang Sangay as ''Sikyong''; and the title was officially changed from ''Kalön Tripa'' to [[Sikyong]] in September 2012.

In his role as Sikyong, Sangay has emphasized the importance of seeking a peaceful, non-violent resolution of the Tibet issue. He has supported the Dalai Lama's call for a so-called "Middle Way" approach "that would provide for genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of Chinese constitution." Noting that China has established "one country, two systems" mechanisms in Hong Kong and Macau, he has argued that it makes no sense for China to continue to resist a similar solution for Tibet, which, he emphasizes, would be a "win-win" result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tibetan leader Lobsang Sangay: Congress needs to hold China to account on Tibet |url = http://thehill.com/blogs/global-affairs/guest-commentary/297903-tibetan-leader-lobsang-sangay-congress-needs-to-hold-china-to-account-on-tibet |work=The Hill |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, he gave the first annual lecture of the Indian Association of Foreign Affairs Correspondence. Expressing concern about the possible ripple effects of recent acts of armed rebellion in west Asia, he called for the international community to strengthen its endorsement of non-violent approaches to oppression. "If non-violence is the right thing to do," he emphasized, "we ought to be supported by the international community." Noting the media attention given to armed Syrian "freedom fighters," he said: "Tibetans have been democratic and non-violent for the last so many decades, how come we don't receive similar support and attention?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Arora |first = Kim |title = International community must support non-violent methods: Lobsang Sangay |url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-03/india/36720993_1_lobsang-sangay-tibetan-prime-minister-indian-democracy|work=The Times of India |accessdate = May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sangay made a statement on 10 March 2013, the 54th anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day, in which he paid tribute to the "yearning for freedom" that inspired "the epochal events of March 10, 1959," and dedicated the anniversary of those events "to all the self-immolators and those who have died for Tibet." He also restated his dedication to the "Middle Way Approach," expressing hope that a "speedy resolution" by China of the Tibet issue could "serve as a model for other freedom struggles" and "be a catalyst for moderation of China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The statement of Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay on the 54th anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising Day|url=http://www.savetibet.org/media-center/ict-news-reports/statement-sikyong-dr-lobsang-sangay-54th-anniversary-tibetan-national-uprising-day|work=International Campaign for Tibet|accessdate=May 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512171459/http://www.savetibet.org/media-center/ict-news-reports/statement-sikyong-dr-lobsang-sangay-54th-anniversary-tibetan-national-uprising-day|archivedate=May 12, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, outgoing US ambassador to India, [[Richard Verma]], hosted Lobsang Sangay for a dinner along with an Indian minister and [[Richard Gere]], an event that angered China.&lt;ref name="Asianage_@017"&gt;{{Citation

==Personal life==
Sangay has been married for 13 years to Kesang Yangdon Shakchang, whose parents were from the Lhokha and Phare area. They have a three-year-old daughter.

His father died in 2004.

Lobsang Sangay holds a United States passport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-02-08-sas-tibet-problem-an-interview-with-chinas-public-enemy-number-two-lobsang-sangay/|title=SA's Tibet Problem: An interview with China's public enemy number two, Lobsang Sangay|quote=Unfortunate too, perhaps, that Sikyong Lobsang Sangay, who travels on a United States passport, can't be so easily denied}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which means he holds American citizenship.&lt;ref name="RaphAhr" /&gt;

==Awards and honors==

Sangay was awarded Presidential Medal award by Salisbury U, Maryland, USA on 13 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=36612&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the Gold Medal of the College Historical Society of Trinity College Dublin for Outstanding Contribution to Public Discourse by the Auditor of the Society, Ms Ursula Ni Choill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tibetswiss.ch/news-fullpage-reader/items/kalon-tripa-awarded-gold-medal-at-trinity-college-dublin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penpa Tsering Controversy==
On 7 November 2017, the Kashag (the CTA's executive, which Sangay heads) dismissed a long-serving Tibetan diplomat, Mr. Penpa Tsering, from the important post of Representative at the Office of Tibet in Washington DC. The former education minister, Ngodup Tsering was appointed to take the position effective 1 December 2017. No clear justification for the dismissal and replacement was initially provided by the Kashag.&lt;ref&gt;http://tibet.net/2017/11/kashag-appoints-kalon-ngodup-tsering-as-new-representative-of-north-america/&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 November 2017 the Kashag released a 10-point statement of clarification detailing their reasons for dismissing Penpa Tsering.&lt;ref&gt;http://tibet.net/2017/11/kashags-clarification-on-decision-to-replace-the-north-america-representative&lt;/ref&gt; A New York-based Tibetan man writing under the pseudonym "Mila Rangzen" called for a mass protest against the Tibetan exile government on 27 November 2017 to demand justice for the ousted diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2017/11/11/tibetan-unity-in-peril-call-for-massive-street-protest-in-dharamshala&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement officer of Dharamsala released a statement urging peace in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ezspk.co.uk/2017/11/14/dharamshala-tibetan-settlement-officer-appeals-for-peace/&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on 27 November 2017, a protest took place in Dharamsala near the CTA offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay addressed an audience at Samast Bharat Excellence Award, 2018 on May 24, 2018 at Devdar hotel in Khanyara, Dharamshala.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_XYNAQ2YOA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Massad F. Ayoob''' (born July 20, 1948) is an American firearms and self-defense instructor. He has taught police techniques and civilian [[self-defense]] to both [[law enforcement officers]] and private citizens since 1974. He was the director of the Lethal Force Institute in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] from 1981 to 2009, and now operates his own company.&lt;ref name="MassadAyoobGroup_dot_com_page_id_165"&gt;[http://massadayoobgroup.com/?page_id=165 MassadAyoobGroup.com page discussing LFI and MAG.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215001818/http://massadayoobgroup.com/?page_id=165 |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayoob has appeared as an [[expert witness]] in several trials. He served as a part-time police officer in New Hampshire since 1972 and retired in 2017 with the rank of Captain from the [[Grantham, New Hampshire]], police department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granthamnh.net/police_department.htm Grantham NH Police Department website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525180445/http://www.granthamnh.net/police_department.htm |date=2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Ayoob has authored several books and more than 1,000 articles on firearms, combat techniques, self-defense, and legal issues, and has served in an editorial capacity for ''[[Guns (magazine)|Guns Magazine]]'', ''[[American Handgunner]]'', ''Gun Week'', ''[[Guns &amp; Ammo]]'' and ''Combat Handguns''. Since 1995, he has written self-defense and firearms related articles for ''[[Backwoods Home Magazine]]''. He also has a featured segment on the television show ''Personal Defense TV'', which is broadcast on the [[Sportsman Channel]] in the US.

While Ayoob has been in the courtroom as a testifying police officer, expert witness, and police prosecutor, he is not an attorney; he is, however, a former Vice Chairman of the Forensic Evidence Committee of the [[National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers]] (NACDL), and is believed to be the only non-attorney ever to hold this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recguns.com/Sources/XI2.html|title=About Massad Ayoob, Popular Firearms Author|first=Patrick|last=Casey|publisher=recguns.com|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="envisage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Massad Ayoob joins the ENVISAGE Advisory Board |url=http://www.envisagenow.com/press_ayoob.asp |date=2006-05-09 |accessdate=2008-06-23 |publisher=ENVISAGE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818131605/http://envisagenow.com/press_ayoob.asp |archivedate=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His course for attorneys, titled "The Management of the Lethal Force/Deadly Weapons Case", was, according to Jeffrey Weiner: "the best course for everything you need to know but are never taught in law school."&lt;ref name="envisage"/&gt;

Ayoob has also designed two [[fighting knife#Tactical knife|tactical knives]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About custom knives|url=http://backwoodshome.com/blogs/MassadAyoob/2009/06/06/about-custom-knives%E2%80%A6/|publisher=[[Backwoods Home Magazine]]|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 a [[sheath knife]] for ''Master of Defense'' (currently [[Vista_Outdoor#List of Vista Outdoor brands|BLACKHAWK!]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Razorback TROCAR Knife|url=https://www.officer.com/home/article/10248380/razorback-trocar-knife|website=Officer|accessdate=3 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven Supreme Sequels - MOD Knives|url=http://www.tactical-life.com/tactical-knives/seven-supreme-sequels/|publisher=[[Harris_Publications#Guns|Tactical Life Magazine]]|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2001 a [[Pocketknife#Tactical folding knife|folding knife]] for [[Spyderco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kertzman|first1=Joe|title=Sporting Knives 2002|date=2001|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=9780873492669|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JDkRYBAqdjIC&amp;dq=massad+ayoob+spyderco&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=massad+ayoob+|accessdate=3 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spyderco Massad Ayoob - Spyderco, Inc.|url=http://spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=685|website=spyderco.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10855">The {{nihongo|'''National Center Test for University Admissions'''|大学入試センター試験|Daigaku Nyūshi Sentā Shiken}} is a type of [[standardized test]] used by public and some private [[University|universities]] in [[Japan]]. It is held annually during a weekend in mid-January over a period of two days.  Since the test is held in the middle of winter, snow can delay the exam in some regions, but typically the test starts and ends near the same exact time throughout the entire nation.

The Center Test has become something of a national phenomenon in Japan, with [[television]] coverage and [[newspaper]]s publishing test questions. To many test-takers in Japan, the test is the difference between college entrance and one year's study for the next year's exams as a ''[[Rōnin (student)|rōnin]]''. Since the test is only administered annually and entrance to top-ranked universities and colleges is so competitive in Japan, the test has become the subject of scrutiny by many.  In addition, rules for tardiness and absences are extremely strict and always results in the forfeit of taking the exams as there are no "makeup" sessions or re-takes offered except in cases such as delays caused by broken train signals.

The test is administered by [[National Center for University Entrance Examinations]], an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] (IAI). The National Center Test superseded the [[Common first-stage exam]] (共通一次, ''kyōtsū ichiji''), which was administered from 1979 to 1989, letting private universities use the test scores as a criterion for admissions decisions.

In 2012, the test was held on 14 and 15 January, with around 555,500 students participating (down by 3,400 students from 2011). The test was held at 709 locations across the country and will be used by 835 public universities, private universities and junior colleges to grade applicants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/two-day-university-entrance-examinations-begin-across-japan Retrieved 2012-2-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, on 19 and 20 January, 560,672 students participated at 693 centers.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As in previous years, there were a few glitches. Heavy snow made some students late in the Hokuriku region, while a disruption to the JR Tokaido shinkansen caused some students to miss the tests in Shizuoka, TBS reported. Trouble was also reported with audio-visual devices for English exam takers in some centers."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/2-day-college-entrance-exams-held-across-japan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designation ==
The official name in Japanese is {{nihongo|'''Daigaku Nyugakusha Senbatsu Daigaku Nyushi Center Shiken'''|大学入学者選抜大学入試センター試験|Daigaku Nyūgakusha Senbatsu Daigaku Nyūshi Sentā Shiken|literally "University Candidate Selection University Admissions Center Test"}}, but this designation is rarely used. It is often called {{nihongo|'''Center Shiken'''|センター試験|Sentā Shiken}}, or simply {{nihongo|'''Center'''|センター|Sentā}} by test-takers and teachers.

== Function ==
Some universities decide on successful candidates using only the National Center Test, but most prestigious universities require the candidate to take another, institution-specific exam, which is often more difficult than the National Center Test.

The function of the Center Test depends on the institution, but most can be categorised into the following three:
* '''Center Test only''': Universities that require only the Center Test results and solely use them for admissions decisions. Mostly used by private universities alongside normal (using institution-specific exams) admission.
* '''Center Test and secondary exam''': Universities using the Center Test and a secondary exam (their own test, or an [[essay]] or [[interview]]) for their decisions. Used by most national universities.
* '''Center Test as primary decision''': Universities using the Center Test as a primary decision, after which the successful candidates are placed on an even plane and are given a secondary, institution-specific exam that decides admission. Used by the most prestigious universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto University]], but not seen much elsewhere.

=== Checking scores ===
Because candidates do not know their Center Test scores before applying to universities, most write their answers on the question sheets (which can be taken home) and check their answers using rubrics published by [[cram school]]s.

A number of cram schools and other companies have services to which candidates can send their scores and learn their overall position relative to other users of the service, called {{nihongo|'''''Center Research'''''|センターリサーチ|Sentā Risāchi}}. Candidates can use this information to see how they fared as compared with other test-takers and make their final application decisions (in Japan, candidates may be unable to apply to all their desired universities, such as in the [[United States]], mainly because the secondary exams are scheduled on or near the same day).

== Tests ==
[[Image:Booklets of questions (National Center Test for University Admissions).JPG|thumb|Booklets of questions given to test takers.]]

There are separate tests for each subject, and each is [[multiple choice]]. The tests follow the curriculum guidelines published by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]].

There are a total of 29 tests in six subjects. Candidates take the subjects specified by their university. As an exception, however, candidates for the [[English language|English]] (written) exam must take the English (listening).

== Listening exam and IC player ==
[[Image:ICplayer2007 (National Center Test for University Admissions).JPG|thumb|right|IC player used in 2007]]
A listening exam was introduced in 2006 for candidates of the English (written) exam. An [[Integrated Circuit|IC]] player was handed out to all candidates of the exam, and a whole 30 minutes of testing time was devoted to the explanation of usage of this device.

There was some controversy surrounding the introduction of this exam, and critics doubted the reliability of this device. In 2006, there were 497 (about 0.09%) cases in which candidates had to be given re-tests because of device failure.&lt;ref&gt;NikkeiBP.jp センター試験のICプレーヤ誤作動，3つの検査をすり抜ける (IC players malfunction in Center Shiken, passing through 3 tests [unnoticed]) http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/NEWS/20060123/112571/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the IC players could be taken home, candidates around Japan disassembled the devices at home, finding that the players used [[Sony]]'s [[Memory Stick]] for storage of the exam. Although no note of the manufacturer was made in either the media or on the device itself, the use of this storage format led most to believe that Sony was the manufacturer.

The memory stick from a sample device provided to an examination supervisor prior to the 2007 examinations, containing a full sample audio test, contained four files with the .bin file extension. A cursory attempt to extract the content of these files failed and changing the file extension to common audio formats, such as .wav, .mp3, and .wma also did not result in playable files. The total size of all four files was 4.63MB, and the total listening time of 30 minutes makes it obvious that the audio tracks are highly compressed.

Additionally, the non-intuitive sequence of buttons needed to operate the player raises concern over the possibility of candidates having difficulty operating the player under test conditions. The inability to stop and restart the audio tracks seems probably due to a wish to ensure that all candidates complete all the listening within the test period. Of even more concern is that the memory stick on the sample player was exposed and could be removed by candidates, leaving open the possibility that candidates may inadvertently remove the memory stick during the test and render the player inoperable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24522">The '''National Middle School Science Bowl''' is a [[middle school]] academic competition, similar to [[Quiz Bowl]], held in the [[United States]]. Two teams of four students each compete to answer various [[science]]-related questions. In order to determine which student has the right to answer the question, a [[buzzer|buzzer system]] (or "lockout system") is used, similar to those seen on popular television [[game show]]s such as ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. The '''National Middle School Science Bowl''' (" NMSSB") has been organized and sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] since the competition's inception in 2002.

==Subject areas==
Questions are asked in the categories of [[Physical Science]], [[Life Science]], Earth and Space Science, [[Energy]], and [[Mathematics]]. Although they are not subcategorized, the questions fall into the subcategories of [[Chemistry]], [[Algebra]], [[Computer Science]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Astronomy]], [[Geometry]], and [[news|Current Events]]. The newest addition was a category specially made for the 2006 National competition: a group of about 5 questions asked through graphics and models projected onto computer screens and as hard copies distributed to competing teams. These were only used in semi-finals and championship rounds.

Before the 2010 year, there was no Energy category, and Earth and Space Science was called [[Earth Science]]. The [[General Science]] category was dropped in 2017.

==Regional competitions==
Each year, in late April or early May, the National Science Bowl competition is held in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]] in the National 4-H Youth Conference Center.

The winning team of each regional Science Bowl competition is invited to participate in the National Science Bowl all expenses paid. There are a number of regional competitions all over the United States; the exact amount changes from year to year.

Typically, any middle school that meets the eligibility rules of the National Middle School Science Bowl competition is permitted to register for any regional competition in the country, but no middle school or student group may compete in multiple regionals. In addition, some regional competitions permit schools to register up to three teams. Teams composed entirely of [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] students are also permitted to enter.

==Rules==
This section is concerned with the rules of the national competition. The rules of regional competitions vary greatly. There are very few prescribed rules for regional competitions. Some regionals are run nearly identically to the national competition, while others use variations of the rules or different methods of scoring.

===General rules===
A team consists of four or five students from a single middle school (unless the team is composed entirely of home schooled students). Only four students play at any one time, while the fifth is designated as the "alternate." Substitutions may be made during the two-minute "halftime" and between rounds.

Two teams compete against each other in each match. Each match has exactly 25 questions (that is, 25 toss-ups and 25 bonuses in corresponding categories). The match is over when all the toss-up questions have been read, or after two eight-minute halves have elapsed (ten-minute at the national competition), whichever occurs first. The team with the most points at this time is the winner.

===Toss-ups===
Every match begins with a toss-up question. The moderator announces the subject of the question (see "Subject Areas" above), as well as its type (Multiple Choice or Short Answer). Once the moderator completes the reading of the question, students have five seconds to buzz in and give an answer. Students may buzz in at any time after the category has been read — there is no need to wait for the moderator to finish. However, there is a penalty for interrupting the moderator and giving an incorrect answer. Once a student from a team has buzzed in, that team may not buzz in again on that question. Conferring between members of a team is not allowed on toss-up questions; if conferring occurs on a question, the team is disqualified from answering that question. The rules regarding conferring are typically very strict: excessive noise, eye contact, or even noticeable shifts in position can be considered conferring, as they convey information to teammates.

The moderator rules an answer given by a student correct or incorrect. On short answer questions, if the answer given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to challenge by the competitors). On multiple-choice questions, the answer given by the student is only correct if it matches the official answer ''exactly''. Alternatively, the student may give the letter choice that corresponds to the correct answer. The letters W, X, Y and Z are used in lieu of A, B, C and D to avoid confusion between similar-sounding letters.

The decision to require multiple-choice answers to be exact has been a controversial one, but experience has shown that it is the best way to avoid complicated disputes during matches.

===Bonuses===
If a student answers a toss-up question correctly, that student's team receives a bonus question. The bonus question is always in the same category as the corresponding toss-up question. Since ''only'' that team has the opportunity to answer the bonus question, there is no need to buzz in to answer it. After the moderator finishes reading the question, the team has twenty seconds to answer. Conferring between team members is permitted, but the designated team captain must give the team's final answer. Teams are given a 5-second warning after 15 seconds of the time allotted have elapsed.

Even if the clock runs out (either for the half or the round), a team that has correctly responded to a toss-up before the expiration of time still receives a bonus. The moderator/scientific judge ignores the timer and proceeds to read the question in its entirety, and the team receives the full 20 seconds of allotted response time. The half/round is completed as soon as the team's answer has been given and no more questions are read to either team.

The same rules apply to the judging of responses to bonus questions as apply to responses to toss-up questions. Once the team's answer has been ruled right or wrong, the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

If neither team answers the toss-up question correctly, the bonus question is not read, and the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

===Scoring===
The scoring at NMSB is similar to scoring for Quiz Bowl, although with different numbers.

Correct responses to toss-up questions are worth 4 points each, and correct responses to bonus questions are worth 10 points each.

If a student buzzes in on a toss-up question before the moderator has completely read the question ("interrupting" the question) and responds ''incorrectly'', then 4 points are awarded to the opposing team, and the question is re-read in its entirety so that the opposing team has an opportunity to buzz in.

Note the difference between interrupt scoring in Science Bowl and in Quiz Bowl: the interrupt penalty in Quiz Bowl is -5 to the interrupting team, while in Science Bowl it is +4 to the non-interrupting team.

Also, if a team "blurts" (shouts out the answer after buzzing but without recognition), the question is treated as an incorrect interrupt. If the judges rule that a team has conferred amongst themselves before buzzing in on a toss-up, that team is disqualified from answering the question and no points are awarded to either side.

==Competition format==
This section is concerned with the format of the national competition only. As is the case with competition rules, the competition format varies greatly among the different regional competitions.

The national competition always consists of two stages: round robin and double elimination.

===Round robin===
All competing teams are randomly arranged into several [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] groups of six teams each. Every team plays every other team in its group once, receiving 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, or zero points for a loss. The top 16 teams across all divisions make it into double elimination; however, it is done so that the same number of teams (or as close as possible to this) in each division make double elimination.

====Tiebreaks====
In the event that two or more teams are tied for one of the top two spots in a round robin group, there are several tiebreak procedures, applied in the following order:

# The head-to-head record of all the tied teams is compared. The team(s) with the best record against the other tied teams win(s) the tiebreak.
# The team(s) with the fewest losses win(s) the tiebreak.
# If the top two teams still cannot be determined, the following procedures are used:
#* If more than two teams are still tied, each team is placed in a separate room and is read five toss-up questions. The number of questions answered correctly minus the number answered incorrectly determines each team’s score. The team(s) with the highest score win(s) the tiebreak.
#* If exactly two teams are still tied, the two teams compete head-to-head, receiving five toss-up questions (no bonus questions are used). All the usual toss-up rules are in effect, including the interrupt penalty. The team with the higher score wins the tiebreak.

If a tie still exists after the third tiebreak step, the third step is reapplied until the tie is resolved.

===Double elimination===
Approximately 16 teams advance from the round robin (depending on the number of round robin divisions). The competition then proceeds like a typical [[double elimination]] [[tournament]] [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]]. Unlike in the round robin, a match in double elimination cannot be tied. If a match is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods of five questions each are played until the tie is broken.

As each team is eliminated from the original bracket, they proceed to the "Challenger's Bracket" for the second chance. By the end of the competition, this system produces a champion from each bracket. The two championship teams face off in the final round to determine the first and second place winners.

==Sponsors==
Several companies and organizations sponsor the National Middle School Science Bowl competition, the most prominent being the [[United States Department of Energy]]. The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] sponsors NMSB, and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] is also a regular sponsor of the event and has in recent years sponsored the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car competition held at NMSB, where teams compete to build the fastest or most powerful [[fuel cell]]-powered miniature car.

{{nihongo|'''Numazu Military Academy'''|沼津兵学校|Numazu heigakkō}} was one of the first schools organized along western lines in Japan, and was located in [[Numazu, Shizuoka]]. Although the academy operated only from December 1868 to 1871, it made a major contribution to the development of [[public education]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen. ''Japan in Transition''. Page 206&lt;/ref&gt; It was later merged into the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]]

==History==
During the [[Bakumatsu period]], the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] belatedly attempted to modernize its military forces with the assistance of [[French military mission to Japan (1867–68)|French military advisors]]. The attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, and following the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji restoration]], the [[Tokugawa clan]], formerly masters of the country with revenues of over eight million ''[[koku]],'' were reduced to 700,000 ''koku'', spread across the provinces of [[Suruga Province|Suruga]], [[Tōtōmi Province|Tōtōmi]] and [[Mikawa Province|Mikawa]], with the head of the clan, [[Tokugawa Iesato]], moving to reside at Numazu. At this time, a group of ''[[hatamoto]],'' led by [[Ebara Soroku]], Abe Kuninosuke and Yatabori Keizō returned from studies in the Netherlands, and decided to establish a military academy along western lines within the grounds of [[Numazu Castle]] in December 1868.

The curriculum of the academy included English and French language and conversation, physics and chemistry, geography, astronomy, world history and economic theory. The curriculum was also weighed towards mathematics, particularly geometry and trigonometry, where were regarded as essential military subjects due to their usage in navigation, artillery targeting and surveying. The first head of the academy was [[Nishi Amane]], who was a driving force behind the creation and elementary school associated with the military academy, which is now regarded as Japan’s first western-style elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;Platt. ''Burning and Building: Schooling and State Formation in Japan, 1750-1890''. Page 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, the first Japanese textbook on [[military engineering]] was published by the Numazu Military Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels. ''Rich Nation, Strong Military.'' Page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 1871 the academy came under the direct control of the [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|Ministry of War]] and in 1872, it was closed, and moved to Tokyo, where it was merged with the new [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]].

Although in existence for only four years, its 210 academy graduates and 150 elementary school graduates included many who went on to serve as generals in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], admirals in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] or as noted educators or politicians. Its elementary school served as a model for other elementary schools which were soon established throughout Japan.

The Numazu Military Academy was also the subject of the first film of director [[Tadashi Imai]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1939/bo000810.htm] Japanese movie database {{ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">==About==
The '''Overseas Association of College Admissions Counselors''' (OACAC) was founded in 1991.  The association began when a group of primarily European counselors met and approached the [[National Association of College Admissions Counseling]] (NACAC) about the creation of an affiliate regional organization that would represent overseas counselors. OACAC became a chartered regional association.

Membership is a privilege made available to eligible institutions, organizations, agencies and individuals as defined in the association’s Bylaws. OACAC is a not-for-profit organization (taxpayer ID 141-82-7265).  The membership is made up of nearly 600 professionals from around the world who advise students as they make choices about pursuing postsecondary education.

OACAC members can be primary and secondary school counselors, independent counselors, college admission and financial aid officers, enrollment managers, and organizations engaged in guiding students through the secondary to higher education transition process.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.oacac.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The conception of Overseas ACAC began with Gene Wallach, Counselor at the International School of Geneva. In the early 1970s, the [[European Council of International Schools]] (ECIS) was a small organization but colleges in the US were beginning to realize that students in ECIS schools were well qualified potential applicants. There was already a steady flow of students going to the US and recruitment staff from American universities were already visiting ECIS schools.

At the NACAC conference in St. Louis in the early 1980s a meeting was held to find a solution.&lt;ref&gt;http://new.oacac.com/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although there was continued interest and Frank Burtnett, the new Executive Director of NACAC attended an ECIS conference in Amsterdam to continue the dialogue, there seemed to be no solution to the difficulty posed by the NACAC by-laws denying membership to proprietary schools. The idea was on the point of being abandoned when a representative of the [[US State Department]] encouraged the members to continue and introduced them to Joyce Smith who was asked to help progress the issue.

The group continued to grow as more counselors from Europe began to attend NACAC conferences. At the NACAC National Conference in New York City a small group of international counselors met together to discuss common concerns. 

With Joyce Smith’s strong support and encouragement, the project moved ahead and at the 1992 conference in Los Angeles, Regina Manley, President of NACAC that year,  proposed the amendment admitting proprietary schools to NACAC with the condition that the schools were accredited.  The Amendment was approved and Overseas ACAC was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42026">'''Peer mentoring''' is a form of [[mentorship]] that usually takes place between a person who has lived through a specific experience (peer mentor) and a person who is new to that experience (the peer mentee). An example would be an experienced student being a peer mentor to a new student, the peer mentee, in a particular subject, or in a new school. Peer mentors are also used for health and lifestyle changes. For example, clients, or patients, with support from peers, may have one-on-one sessions that meet regularly to help them recover or rehabilitate. Peer mentoring provides individuals who have suffered from a specific life experience the chance to learn from those who have recovered, or rehabilitated, following such an experience. Peer mentors provide education, recreation and support opportunities to individuals. The peer mentor may challenge the mentee with new ideas, and encourage the mentee to move beyond the things that are most comfortable. Most peer mentors are picked for their sensibility, [[confidence]], [[social skills]] and [[wikt:reliability|reliability]].&lt;ref name="BozemanFeeney2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bozeman |first1=B. |last2=Feeney |first2=M.

''Review of Educational Research,'' 1991; 61:505-532.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budge"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budge |first1=Stephanie |date=2006 |title=Peer mentoring in postsecondary education: implications for research and practice. |journal=J Coll Reading Learning |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=71–85 |url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/61/4/505.abstract |doi=10.3102/00346543061004505 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of peer mentoring insist that little is known of the nature of peer mentoring relationships and that there are few consistent studies indicating the outcomes of peer mentoring beyond good feelings among peers and the development of friendships. Peer mentoring led by senior students may discourage [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and prevent critical analysis of the higher education system.

==Program design characteristics==
The frequency with which peer mentors and mentees meet varies according to the particular mentoring program. Some pairs may make contact once a month, while others may meet 3-4 times per month or more. It is usually advised that mentors and mentees meet more often in the beginning of the relationship in order to establish a good foundation. Mentors and mentees may maintain contact through email, telephone or in-person meetings. Peer mentoring organizations may also set up social events for those participating in the program. These events provide good opportunities for increased [[social interaction]] between mentors and mentees.&lt;ref name="Daloz"&gt;{{cite book | title=Effective Teaching and Mentoring| author=Daloz, L. A. | year=1990 | publisher=Jossey Bass | location=San Francisco | pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Interpersonal compatibility|compatibility]] of mentor and mentee is a factor that should be taken into consideration when choosing pairs. Mentors and mentees may benefit from having similar backgrounds, interests and life experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aas.sagepub.com/content/40/5/465.full.pdf+html Barry Bozeman Mary K. Feeney, "Mentor Matching A "Goodness of Fit" Model," ''Administration &amp; Society,'' Volume 40 Number 5, September 2008; pp. 465-482.]&lt;/ref&gt; Age, gender, ethnicity, language preferences, and education may be taken into consideration when pairing mentors with mentees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theibsc.org/uploaded/IBSC/Conference_and_workshops/Toronto_Workshops/Grbac_Handout.pdf Steve Grbac, "How to implement a ‘Peer Support’ program in a P-6 School," Scotch College Junior School, Melbourne Australia, June 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6WMN-45CWX8B-T-1&amp;_cdi=6939&amp;_user=650596&amp;_pii=S0001879199917347&amp;_origin=search&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F2000&amp;_sk=999429998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkzV&amp;md5=1f9be57be073b6920dc35ed91a7c0d64&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf Sosik JJ, Godshalk VM.

The quality of the peer mentoring relationship is important for mentees to experience positive results.&lt;ref name=Sanchez&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=R. J. |last2=Bauer |first2=T. N. |last3= Paronto |first3= M. E. |year=2006 |title=Peer-mentoring freshman: Implication for satisfaction, commitment, and retention to graduate |journal=Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=25–37 |doi=10.5465/AMLE.2006.20388382}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mentor relationship is more successful when the mentor cares for the whole person and not just the academic or career side of a person.&lt;ref name=Cramer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cramer |first1=R. J. |last2=Prentice-Dunn |first2=S. |year=2007 |title=Caring for the whole person: Guidelines for advancing undergraduate mentorship |journal=College Student Journal |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=771–778}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful mentors tend to be available, knowledgeable, educated in [[cultural diversity|diversity]] issues, [[empathy|empathic]], personable, encouraging, supportive, and passionate.&lt;ref name=Cramer/&gt; Although this is not an exhaustive list of qualities, they have been shown to be important for successful mentoring relationships.&lt;ref name=Cramer/&gt; It is important to keep qualities like this in mind when recruiting and training mentors.

The [[Goal|objectives]] of a peer mentoring program should be well-defined and [[measurable]]. The effectiveness of the program should be monitored to ensure that the objectives are being met. One way to monitor the effectiveness of a program is to administer evaluations to the mentors and mentees.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, M. (1991). ''Beyond the myths and the magic of mentoring: How to facilitate an effective mentoring program.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
Peer mentoring in education was promoted during the 1960s by educator and theorist [[Paulo Freire]]:
:"The fundamental task of the mentor is a liberatory task. It is not to encourage the mentor’s goals and aspirations and dreams to be reproduced in the mentees, the students, but to give rise to the possibility that the students become the owners of their own history. This is how I understand the need that teachers have to transcend their merely instructive task and to assume the ethical posture of a mentor who truly believes in the total autonomy, freedom, and development of those he or she mentors."&lt;ref&gt;Paulo Freire, "Mentoring the mentor: a critical dialogue with Paulo Freire," ''Counterpoints: Studies in the Postmodern Theory of Education,'' Vol 60, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8204-3798-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer mentors appear mainly in [[secondary school]]s where students moving up from [[primary schools]] may need assistance in settling into the new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life, however peer mentoring can occur at the grade school level, the [[undergraduate]] level, and the [[graduate school]] level. The goals of the program may vary according to the level, the educational institution or the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Cowie, Patti Wallace, ''Peer Support in Action: From Bystanding to Standing By,'' Sage Publications Ltd; 1st edition February 2001; {{ISBN|0-7619-6353-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer mentors in secondary schools aid in the transition of younger students from primary school to secondary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = S. | last2 = Cowen | first2 = E. L. | year = 1985 | title = The effects of peer teaching on student perceptions of class environment, adjustment and academic performance | url = | journal = American Journal of Community Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 417–433 | doi=10.1007/bf00911217}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may assist mentees with their school work and study skills, [[peer pressure]] (such as pressure to use drugs or have sex), issues with attendance and behavior, and typical family problems.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Hazouri, Miriam Smith McLaughlin, ''Peer listening in the middle school: training activities for students.'' Educational Media Corp., 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-932796-34-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Youth mentoring|Youth mentors]] are persons for children or adolescents to spend time with, often to compensate for absent family members or an inadequate home environment.&lt;ref name="Kate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/learningmentors/mentoring.htm |title=mentoring and young people |accessdate=2005-11-16 |last=Philip |first=Kate |date=August 2000 |work=the encyclopedia of informal education |publisher=infed |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentoring programs for youth can be especially useful for students who are suffering from a lack of [[social support]], and who therefore may be susceptible to [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]].

Peer mentors for undergraduates may assist newly admitted students with time management, study skills, organizational skills, [[curriculum]] planning, administrative issues, test preparation, term paper preparation, goal setting, and grade monitoring.  Additionally, such mentors may provide other forms of social support for the student, such as friendship, networking, and aiding the student's adjustment to college life.&lt;ref&gt;Parsloe, E.; Wray, M.

A peer mentor at the graduate school level may assist new students in selecting an advisor, negotiating the advisor/advisee relationship, preparation for major examinations, publishing articles, searching for jobs, and adjusting to the rigors of graduate school life.&lt;ref&gt;Grant-Vallone, Elisa J., Ensher, Ellen A., "Effects of Peer Mentoring on Types of Mentor Support, Program Satisfaction and Graduate Student Stress: A Dyadic Perspective."

=== In higher education ===
Peer mentoring in [[higher education]] has enjoyed a good name and is seen favorably by both educational administrators and students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~weinreic/GRN670/Allen.pdf Allen TD, McManus SE, Russell JEA. "Newcomer socialization and stress: Formal peer relationships as a source of support." ''Journal of Vocational Behavior'' 1999;54(3); pp. 453-470.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decade, peer mentoring has expanded and is found in most colleges and universities, frequently as a means to outreach, retain, and recruit [[minority group|minority]] students.&lt;ref name="Daloz"/&gt;
Peer mentoring is used extensively in higher education for several reasons:
* Benefits attributed to ''classical mentoring'' (when an older adult mentors a younger person) can translate to peer mentoring relationships, mainly when the peer mentor and the mentee have similar backgrounds;
* The lack of [[role model]]s or volunteers forces administrators and student leaders to use students as peer mentors of other students—usually first year students, ethnic minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thile | first1 = EL | last2 = Matt | first2 = GE | year = 1995 | title = The Ethnic Mentor Undergraduate Program: A Brief Description and Preliminary Findings | url = | journal = [[Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 116–26 | doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.1995.tb00605.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bizzari | first1 = J.C. | year = 1995 | title = Women, role models, mentors, and career | url = | journal = Educational Horizons | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 145–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—in order to guide, support, and instruct junior students;
* Because peer mentoring programs require a low budget for administration and/or development, they become a cheap alternative to support students perceived as likely to fail.

===Advantages in education===
Peer mentoring may help new students adapt to a new academic environment faster. The relationship between the mentor and mentee gives the mentee a sense of being connected to the larger community where they may otherwise feel lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/305031839 Stoltz AD. "The relationship between peer mentoring program participation and successful transition to high school." (Dissertation). University of California, Davis, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; Mentors are chosen because they are academically successful and because they possess good communication, social and leadership skills. As a consequence, mentors serve as positive role models for the students, guiding them towards academic and social success. Mentors provide support, advice, encouragement, and even friendship to students. Peer mentoring may improve student retention rates.&lt;ref&gt;Twomey, J.L. (1991). "Academic performance and retention in a peer mentor program at a two-year campus of a four-year institution. Research report." Alamagordo, NM: New Mexico State University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED443133.pdf Lahman MP. "To What Extent Does a Peer Mentoring Program Aid in Student Retention?" Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the National Communication Association. Chicago, 1999:12.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mentors also stand to benefit from the mentor/mentee relationship. Mentors develop friendships through their participation in mentoring programs and usually derive satisfaction from helping a younger student, and possibly shaping his or her life in a positive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clinard | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Ariav | first2 = T. | year = 1998 | title = What mentoring does for mentors: A cross-cultural perspective | url = | journal = European Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 91–108 | doi=10.1080/0261976980210109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentors may also be paid, and they may receive other benefits such as prioritized registration, course credit, and references.

In higher education tutorial settings, the benefits of peer mentoring programs also extend to class [[tutor]]s. Using [[grounded theory]] techniques, Outhred and Chester found that five themes underlie their experiences: role exploration, sharing responsibility, regulation of the peer-tutored groups, harnessing the peer tutors’ role, and community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ro.uow.edu.au/ajpl/vol3/iss1/3 Outhred, T, &amp; Chester, A. (2010). The Experience of Class Tutors in a Peer Tutoring Programme: A Novel Theoretical Framework, Australasian Journal of Peer Learning, 3(1), 12-23.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===

Peer mentoring programs usually target ethnic minorities, people with [[disabilities]] and women. This approach tends to be conceived out of the "deficiency model" where multi-ethnic students, women and students with disabilities are perceived as being in need of help and unlikely to succeed unless senior students or successful adults help them.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, C.D. (1996). "Black peer mentors, cooperative advocacy beneficial to morale." ''Black Issues in Higher Education,'' pp. 13, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main criticisms of peer mentoring is the lack of research to show how peer mentoring relationships work, how they develop, and what their outcomes are.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, J.L. (1994). "The death of mentoring." ''Hospitals &amp; Health Networks,'' pp. 68, 19, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the nature of being either a mentor or mentee and at the same time a peer can make the relationship a dual one where other [[identity (social science)|identities]] also converge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = M | year = 1994 | title = Mentoring as identity exchange: conflicts and connections | url = | journal = Feminist Teacher | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 112–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some peer mentoring programs promote [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] among ethnic minority students because of the use of student role models who are perceived as successful in social and educational environments characterized by majority students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adh.sagepub.com/content/7/4/540.full.pdf+html Thomas KM, Hu C, Gewin AG, Bingham K, Yanchus N. "The roles of protégé race, gender, and proactive socialization attempts on peer mentoring." ''[[Advances in Developing Human Resources]],'' 2005;7(4):540.]&lt;/ref&gt; These role models then become the people that peer mentees strive to imitate or emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosenkis | first1 = S.L. | year = 1994 | title = The real mentoring trap | url = | journal = Library Journal | volume = 119 | issue = 2| page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more subtle criticism of peer mentoring refers to their lack of supervision and structure: most peer mentoring programs led by undergraduate students rarely have direct supervision of full-time university staff.

Given the fact that students are led by other students who serve as peer mentors, critics say that university staff may free themselves from their responsibility to listen and help first year students classified as peer mentees, the group with the largest [[attrition rate]] in higher education. Without extensive training and supervision, senior students who serve as mentors may offer unreliable guidance to peer mentees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merriam | first1 = S | year = 1983 | title = Mentors and proteges: A critical review of the literature | url = | journal = Adult Education Quarterly | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 161–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little research on what happens within peer mentoring relationships. Maryann Jacobi, in an extensive meta-analysis of mentoring research, concludes by asking, "Does mentoring help students succeed in college? If so, how? Both theoretical and empirical answers to these questions are lacking.”&lt;ref name="Jacobi"/&gt;  Stephanie Budge states:
:"The concept of mentoring has become increasingly popular over the past few decades. Mentoring has been advertised as necessary in order for students and employees to flourish in their environment. However, the lack of research concerning peer mentoring programs in particular is surprising. While there is an abundance of articles on the topic of mentoring in the educational setting, authors must be held to more stringent research standards and more definitional consistency. In addition to higher quality research, the fundamental flaws within peer mentoring programs need to be corrected before these programs can reach their full potential on college campuses."&lt;ref name="Budge"/&gt;

Peer mentoring in higher education usually focuses on social, academic, and cultural skills that can help students graduate from  colleges and universities, and how the educational system works (e.g. how to apply for [[Student financial aid|financial aid]], how to register for classes, how to write papers, how to choose a major, etc.). The knowledge students receive usually comes from senior students who serve as peer mentors.

Although peer mentoring programs are appealing to most people and seem easy to implement and develop, there is little research to suggest that peer mentoring gives the same results as classical mentoring.

===Versus classical mentoring===
{{main|Mentorship}}

Morton-Cooper and Palmer distinguish between ''classical mentoring'' (also known as ''primary mentoring'') and ''contract or facilitated mentoring''.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Morton-Cooper, Anne Palmer ''Mentoring, preceptorship and clinical supervision: a guide to professional roles in clinical practice.'' Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 2000; {{ISBN|0-632-04967-7}}, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical mentoring is characterized as an informal, often spontaneous enabling relationship between an older mentor and a younger mentee, based on a shared wish to work together, usually for a long period, without financial compensation for the mentor.&lt;ref name="Kate"/&gt;

Peer mentoring differs from classical mentoring in two aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=883068&amp;show=abstract Linda Holbeche, (1996) "Peer mentoring: the challenges and opportunities", ''Career Development International,'' Vol. 1 No. 7, pp. 24 - 27.]&lt;/ref&gt; First, in peer mentoring mentors and mentees are close in age, experience, educational level, and they may also overlap in their personal identities, which are usually the criteria for matching, but this may leave junior students vulnerable to peer pressure and unsupervised rivalry.&lt;ref name="Pompper2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pompper |first1=D. |last2=Adams |first2=J. |title=Under the microscope: Gender and mentor-protege relationships |journal=Public Relations Review |issue=32 |pages=309–315 |publisher=Science Direct |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2006.05.019 |volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, peer mentoring programs are semi-structured planned programs with specific guidelines and frequently with a set number of meetings and activities within a predetermined amount of time. Students who enroll in peer mentoring programs tend to be matched mostly according to major, gender, language of preference, and ethnic background, and those students who share the largest number of similarities tend to become peers in the peer mentoring relationship. Little research is available to know what happens between peer mentors and peer mentees who have different characteristics.

=== Cross-age ===

The [https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=TtdR-GCYOw4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;ots=RClnzh3QMw&amp;sig=O0Ufdvbh3MYZuT-5POpFri_0BOw#PPP1,M1 Handbook of Youth Mentoring] provides the following definition of cross-age peer mentoring:
:"Peer mentoring involves an interpersonal relationship between two youths of different ages that reflects a greater degree of hierarchical power imbalance than is typical of a friendship and in which the goal is for the older youth to promote one or more aspects of the younger youth's development. Peer mentoring refers to a sustained (long-term), usually formalized (i.e. program-based), developmental relationship. The relationship is "developmental" in that the older peer's goal is to help guide the younger mentee's development in domains such as interpersonal skills, self-esteem and conventional connectedness and attitudes (e.g. future motivation, hopefulness)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Cross-age mentoring can be distinguished from peer mentoring by the fact that the mentor is in a higher grade level and/or is older than the mentee, whereas in peer mentoring students of the same age are paired together based on varying levels of achievement. Karcher (2007) also notes:
:"Cross-age peer mentoring programs utilize structure, meet for more than ten meetings, do not focus primarily on deficit or problem reduction, and require an age span of at least two years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentoring.org/downloads/mentoring_388.pdf Michael Karcher (2007) "Cross-age Peer Mentoring," ''Research in Action,'' Issue 7, 2007, MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, Alexandria, VA, p. 8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages====
In general, cross-age mentoring programs can involve a tutoring or teaching component, personal [[mentorship]] and guidance, or both, and they incorporate many of the advantages of other forms of peer mentorship. Because student mentors are closer in age, knowledge, authority and [[cognitive development]] than adult mentors, mentees often feel freer to express ideas, ask questions, and take risks. These similarities also make it easier for mentors to understand personal and academic problems that the mentee may be experiencing, and present solutions in a more understandable and relevant way. Furthermore, unlike same-age peer mentoring, cross-age programs can prevent feelings of inferiority on the part of the mentee when they are mentored or tutored by a student of the same age or status. Thus, mentors who are slightly older than their mentees can take advantage of the higher status provided by their age difference while enjoying increased [[Interpersonal compatibility|compatibility]] with their students. The specific benefits of cross-age mentoring/tutoring are numerous, and are briefly described here in three main categories: increased academic achievement, improved interpersonal skills, and [[personal development]].&lt;ref name="ED354608"&gt;Gaustad, Joan. [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED354608 Peer and Cross-Age Tutoring. ERIC Digest, Number 79.] ERIC #:ED354608 Publication Date: 1993-03-00&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalkowski"&gt;Kalkowski, Page. ''Peer and Cross-Age Tutoring.'' School Improvement Research Series. NWREL. March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-age mentorship, and tutoring programs in particular, support the academic achievement and learning process of both the mentor and the mentee. Mentees benefit from increased personalized attention in a one-on-one setting and can work at their own pace. Sessions are customized for the mentee's individual questions, needs, and learning styles, and mentees gain a greater mastery of the material and concepts while developing [[creativity]] and critical thinking skills. The mentor may also gain a deeper understanding of the material or subject that they are teaching, as this relationship often encourages a deeper dedication to their own studies so that they may more effectively communicate what they’ve learned. The mentor gains a deeper sense of responsibility, dedication, and pride in being able to help a peer, while both students take pride in mutual accomplishments and successes. Ultimately, cross-age mentorship programs may increase [[student retention|retention]] and graduation rates, especially among minority students.&lt;ref name="ED354608"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalkowski"/&gt;

In addition to improved learning and transmission of information, the mentorship process allows both students to develop more effective [[interpersonal communication]] skills. Mentees learn how to effectively form and pose questions, seek advice, and practice [[active listening]] and concentration. Similarly, the mentors gain valuable practice in effective teaching strategies. This format fosters increased [[self-esteem]], [[empathy]] and patience in both participants, potentially creating new friendships and breaking down social barriers for students struggling to adjust to a new academic setting. Often the mentor will serve as an important role-model, and can model academic skills and work habits as well as personal values (e.g. dedication to service, empathy, and internal motivation). This relationship can be pivotal for the success of new or underserved students in academia by providing an opportunity for peers to discuss academic issues, career choices, research ideas, and personal matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED438267.pdf Gensemer P. "Effectiveness of Cross-Age and Peer Mentoring Programs." (Monograph) 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitoring and evaluation====
Cross-age mentoring programs require careful consideration of the goals, objectives and the available human, physical and financial resources in order to ultimately assess the progress made by the participants and the overall usefulness of the program.  Frequent assessment is important as it gives valuable insight into how well the cross-age mentoring curriculum is organized and implemented, and provides positive reinforcement for both the mentor and mentee. Mentors should be pre-screened according to their academic proficiency and attitudes to ensure that they will be able to meet the needs of a mentee. Moreover, mentors will also benefit from ongoing training, supervision and psychological support by teachers, administrators, parents and other members of the community.&lt;ref name="ED354608"/&gt;

=== Examples in schools ===

====Sudbury schools (PreK-12 democratic free schools)====
{{Further|Sudbury school}}
Because [[Sudbury school]]s are completely age-mixed from ages 4 thru 18, with no grades or age-segregated classrooms, it is common for students to engage in peer mentoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Peter|title=The Special Value of Children’s Age-Mixed Play|journal=The Journal of Play|date=2011|volume= 3| issue = 4|pages=500–522|url=http://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/3-4-article-gray-age-mixed-play.pdf|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program====
One established cross-age mentoring program is the [http://www.idra.org/Coca-Cola_Valued_Youth_Program.html/ Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program (VYP)], which originated in [[San Antonio, Texas]] through the [http://www.idra.org/ Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA)].  In an effort to decrease [[truancy]], the need for disciplinary actions and drop-out rates of students, this program paired up “at-risk” middle school students to tutor “at-risk” elementary school students, both primarily of [[Hispanic]] origin with [[limited English proficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idra.org/page,shop.product_details/flypage,shop.flypage/product_id,75/category_id,1/manufacturer_id,0/option,com_virtuemart/Itemid,301/ "Continuities – Lessons for the Future of Education from the IDRA Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program," Intercultural Development Research Association, San Antonio, Texas, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the tutors who participated were not only rewarded by getting paid and receiving course credit, but also by receiving recognition for their service and by improving their own academic and tutoring skills through special tutoring classes.  These VYP program benefits, in turn, resulted in a positive impact on school success and lowered the dropout rates of these tutors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncset.org/publications/essentialtools/dropout/part3.3.04.asp Cardenas, Jose A., et al.

====The University of Massachusetts Peer Mentor Program====
The Peer Mentor [http://www.housing.umass.edu/hr/pm_position.html program] at UMass Amherst offers undergraduate students the chance to be live-in, part-time staff members for freshman residents within residential life. This is a paid position. The Peer Mentor's "job" is to assist freshman students with their transition from high school to college. UMass Peer Mentors offers academic support within the first year hall and are responsible for connecting the residents to campus resources throughout the academic year. Peer mentors follow a curriculum that includes but are not limited to: assisting in New Student Orientation (NSO), academic mentoring (which includes references to [http://www.umass.edu/lrc/ tutoring centers], deans, and [http://ualc.umass.edu/advising/ undergraduate advising]), connecting faculty with the students, and hosting various academic success workshops.

==In health care==
{{main|Peer education}}
Peer mentoring has been shown to increase resistance to stress-related anxiety and depression in patients, or clients, affected by chronic illness or mental health issues. Mental health peer mentors and peer support groups help clients change their lifestyle and adhere to a more productive healthy lifestyle by adjusting habits and helping them realize helpful ways of coping and taking on personal responsibility. Peer mentors can also help patients prepare for medical and surgical procedures and adhere to treatment regimes.

pfeg ('''Personal Finance Education Group''') is part of [[Young Enterprise]]. pfeg merged into Young Enterprise is 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Young Enterprise » pfeg|url = http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/about-us/pfeg/|website = www.young-enterprise.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; pfeg was founded in 2000 and supports teachers and others involved in educating young people about money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About pfeg|url = http://www.pfeg.org/about-us/about-pfeg|website = pfeg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity provides the secretariat for the [[All Party Parliamentary Group]] on Financial Education for Young People, which in December 2011 published a report&lt;ref&gt;Financial Education in the Curriculum, http://www.pfeg.org/sites/default/files/Doc_downloads/APPG/Financial%20Education%20%26%20the%20curriculum%20-%20Final%20report%20-%20APPG%20on%20fin%20ed%20for%20YP%20-%20Dec%2011.pdf, APPG on Financial Education for Young People, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; calling for financial education to be included in the national curriculum. The report played an important role in helping to ensure the introduction of statutory financial education on the secondary national curriculum in England from September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = APPG Primary and Secondary Schools Strand|url = http://www.pfeg.org/policy-campaigning/pfeg-and-parliament/appg-primary-and-secondary-schools-strand|website = pfeg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''portable classroom''' (also known as a '''demountable''' or '''relocatable classroom''', '''portables'''), is a type of [[portable building]] installed at a [[school]] to temporarily and quickly provide additional [[classroom]] space where there is a shortage of capacity.&lt;ref name="NZminedu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/Schools/PropertyToolBox/StateSchools/Funding/RelocatableBuildings.aspx |title= Relocatable buildings |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed so they may be removed once the capacity situation abates, whether by a permanent addition to the school, another school being opened in the area, or a reduction in student population.&lt;ref name="NZminedu" /&gt; Such buildings would be installed much like a [[mobile home]], with utilities often being attached to a main building to provide light and heat for the room.  Portable classrooms may also be used if permanent classrooms are uninhabitable, such as after a fire or during a major refurbishment.

Sometimes, the portable classrooms are meant to be long-lasting and are built as "portapacks". A portapack combines a series of portables and connects them with a hallway. Portapacks are usually separated from the main building but can connect to the school. In most cases, portapacks are accompanied with a few separate portables.

Portable classrooms are also colloquially known as bungalows, t-shacks, trailers, terrapins, huts, t-buildings, portables, or relocatables.  In the UK those built during 1945-50 were known as [[HORSA]] huts after the name of the Government's post-war building programme, "Hutting Operation for the Raising of the School-leaving Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/wirrals-last-temporary-post-war-horsa-3366638|title=Wirral’s last ‘temporary’ post-war Horsa school hut to be bulldozed to allow Overchurch Infants revamp|first=Ben|last=Turner|date=1 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J4o7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;lpg=PT62&amp;dq=who+provided+horsa+huts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NPbRLRQLhv&amp;sig=ktS0t-qACGPNTd-c3kUgi6-3ydI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinqcmdkcXMAhUqDcAKHQrXDNo4ChDoAQg2MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=who+provided+horsa+huts&amp;f=false|title=The Best Days of Our Lives: School Life in Post-War Britain|first=Simon|last=Webb|date=1 February 2013|publisher=History Press|accessdate=24 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the UK are often known as 'prattens' or 'Pratten huts' after the former [[Prattens]] company that supplied many of them after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-320000-135000/page/3|title=BBC - Error 404 : Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522221309/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-320000-135000/page/3|archive-date=2017-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getschool.php?id=1030|title=My Page &lt;!-- Title --&gt;|first=Wiltshire Council|last=Webmaster|website=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationandtraining.org.uk/schools/school/pratten-hut-st-dunstan-school/|title=Pratten Hut – St Dunstan School, Calne, Wiltshire - UK Schools|website=www.educationandtraining.org.uk|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmyschool.co.uk/schooldetails.aspx?id=79918|title=School website for The Rainbow Pre-School Learning Centre Warminster with Ofsted inspection report|website=www.findmyschool.co.uk|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupant health and building durability issues ==
Portable classrooms are frequently criticized for presenting mold, moisture, comfort and unhealthy environment issues. 
However, when portable classrooms are properly set up and operated, experience has shown that they can present a very long useful life, low maintenance, and healthy, comfortable environments for all occupants.

In the United States, there are approximately 300,000 portable classrooms in use. About half of those are school-owned and of unknown age.  The other half are owned by modular leasing companies and are between 5 and 6 years old on average.

If properly installed and maintained, a portable can have a useful life of approximately 30 to 50 years.  Certain factors impact useful life, including capital improvements and the number of times a unit is relocated.

A portable classroom can be any number of modular sections wide and typically has only a single level, but can be more than two stories high.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3892">A '''range-finder painting''', sometimes called '''range-finding painting''',&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; is a large [[landscape painting]] produced as a training device to help gunners improve their accuracy. Historically, the best-documented use of such paintings was in the United States during [[World War I]].

==History==
During World War I, some military gunnery training was carried out indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; While it is relatively simple to train gunners in [[Rangefinder|range-finding]] (that is, estimating the correct distance for their shots) outdoors, it is difficult to train them in long-range gunnery indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; To solve this problem, the British&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; and U.S. militaries tested the use of large landscape paintings showing distant sites for range-finding and target-sighting in indoor gun ranges.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; These so-called range-finder paintings proved so successful that a program was organized in the United States to produce them in larger numbers.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; They were also used to teach soldiers how to draw military maps in the field and how to identify points of military importance such as zones of good cover.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

In 1918, the [[Salmagundi Club]] in New York spearheaded the effort to produce range-finder paintings for the U.S. military, providing canvas and painting materials.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; The program resulted in dozens of landscape paintings of various French and Belgian sites that were roughly {{convert|50|x|70|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; Most showed towns and villages in the near or middle distance, along with other militarily important features such as roads, bridges, canals, fields, forests, and hills.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; 

The painter [[Ernest L. Blumenschein]] helped to draft and organize artists across the United States for this effort, especially in his home town of [[Taos, New Mexico]], and nearby [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; In Taos alone, 15 such range-finder paintings of landscapes in France were produced in 1918.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt; Some of these were sent to [[Camp Cody (military camp)|Camp Cody]] in southern New Mexico and to [[Camp Funston]] in Kansas.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

Artists who participated besides Blumenschein included [[Gustave Baumann]], [[O.E. Berninghaus]], [[Harriet Blackstone]], [[Paul Burlin]], Ethel Coe, [[E. Irving Couse]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Leon Gaspard]], Burt Harwood, Lee Hersch, J.T. Hunter, Sheldon Parsons, [[Bert Geer Phillips]], J.H. Sharp, [[Walter Ufer]], [[Cordelia Wilson]], and Jay Young-Hunter.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

The '''Science, Mathematics, And Research For Transformation (SMART) Defense Scholarship Program''' was tested as a program in 2005 under the Air 
Force Office of Scientific Research.  SMART was fully established by the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for fiscal year 2006, and was assigned to the [[Naval Postgraduate School|Navy Postgraduate School]] [[Naval Postgraduate School|(NPS)]] as the managing agency in late 2005-early 2006.

The SMART Scholarship-for-Service Program is a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) workforce development program created to address the growing gap between America and the rest of the world in the [[STEM fields|Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics]] (STEM) disciplines.  SMART facilitates this goal by recruiting and retaining some of the best and brightest STEM candidates in the nation.

SMART is a DoD civilian scholarship-for-service program which is a part of the [[National Defense Education Program]] (NDEP).  Like other NDEP programs, SMART is funded through the [[Secretary of Defense|Office of the Secretary of Defense]].

== Requirements ==
The program is open to current and prospective students, including current DoD employees who meet the following requirements:
* U.S. citizen (exceptions include: UK, New Zealand, Australia and Canada)
* Minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale
* Pursuing a degree in one of the 21 STEM disciplines
* Able to participate in summer internships
* Able to accept post-graduation employment within the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]]
* Able to obtain and maintain a [[Security clearance|SECRET clearance]]

''While these are the minimum requirements, the average GPA is well over 3.0, with the current 2017 cohort year averaging 3.7 on a 4.0 scale.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=TheSmartForum.org|date=2009-11-27| url=http://thesmartforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Students who are accepted receive the following benefits:
* Full tuition at any accredited college or university within the U.S.
* Cash awards paid at a rate of $25,000 – $38,000 per year depending on prior educational experience
* Health insurance allowance of $1,200 per academic year
* Book allowance of $1,000 per academic year
* Mentoring by a [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] sponsoring facility
* Post-graduation employment placement within the DoD

Students are required to pay back the scholarship by working with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] in a 1-1 year ratio. This work is a paid position within a specific DoD agency.  Any changes to the original contract agreement made between the DoD and the award recipient may result in a longer duration of required employment.  Multi-year recipients are also required to complete internships during the summers at their sponsoring facility at no additional compensation.

In the event that a recipient chooses to leave the program or fails to meet the program requirements, the recipient will be required to pay back in full all moneys that have been paid on their behalf to the DoD.  At $25000-$38000 per year, plus orientation expenses, plus book and health insurance allowances, plus all tuition and fees, this amount can be very high. This payback amount is prorated depending on how long the recipient decides to stay in their post-graduation employment. As an example, if you are required to work for the government for two years and only complete one and want to leave the job at that time, you will be required to pay back approximately half of what was given to you during your Phase 1 educational time. Applicants are encouraged to soberly consider this scholarship for service contract prior to accepting. 

Applicants are also highly encouraged to speak with their sponsoring facility (the ones that are offering you the job) to determine what the recipient's job duties will be after they graduate. This is necessary to fully understand what role you will be required to serve once the Phase 1 Educational Requirements are satisfied.

== History ==
Since SMART was officially established in 2006, the program has grown each year.  Below are the combined numbers of students awarded scholarships as well as the funding history.

'''Sistema Uniforme de Mejora Académica''' ('''SUMA''', "The Uniform System of Academic Improvement") is a privately developed system of formative evaluations and remedial assignments, developed for students in Mexico. The [[exam]]s are intended to take place beginning in the last year of [[pre-school]], and continue through [[primary school]], [[secondary school]], and the ''[[Bachelor's degree|bachillerato]]'' (a phase of education between secondary school and [[university]]).  As of 2007, the system had been implemented at private schools in 23 Mexican cities, covering a total of 100,000 students.

SUMA was developed by [[Ingeniat]], as a private initiative to raise the academic level of basic and intermediate education through the continuous and constant monitoring of academic standards, identifying opportunities for each student to improve.  The SUMA system also includes evaluations during the school year for all grades and remedial assignments to be assigned in accord with each student's needs.  SUMA covers the most critical areas of the school curriculum; the use of the English and Spanish languages, reading for comprehension, and all areas of mathematics. The evaluations and assignments are intended to monitor the development of both factual knowledge and broader skills.

'''St. Paul's Catholic Seminary''' is a [[Ghana]]ian [[Roman Catholic]] [[seminary]] located in [[Sowutuom]], [[Greater Accra Region]].

It is in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Accra]] and is dedicated to the philosophical training of seminarians for the [[ecclesiastical province]]s of the Roman Catholic Archdioceses of Accra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Location|first1=St. Paul's Seminary, Accra|title=St. Paul's Catholic Seminary|url=http://www.allghanadata.com/?id=2103-632-10&amp;t=St.-Paul%27s-Catholic-Seminary|website=All Ghana Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Coast|Cape Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Formation of seminarians|first1=Archdiocese of Cape Coast|title=Vocations Office|url=http://www.archcapeghana.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=11|website=Archdiocese of Cape Coast, Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kumasi|Kumasi]].

The seminary is affiliated with the [[University of Ghana]] in [[Legon]], Greater Accra Region.&lt;ref name="Affiliation with U.G"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institutional|first1=Affiliations|title=Institutional Affiliations|url=https://www.ug.edu.gh/about/institutional-affiliations|website=University of Ghana}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also admits seminarians from the [[Society of African Missions]] and neighbouring countries.

Since it was founded in 1988, the seminary has produced more than 500 priests.

==History==

The idea of setting up St. Paul’s was conceived in 1983 by the Bishops of the erstwhile [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Coast|Ecclesiastical Province of Cape Coast Diocese]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cape Coast]]&lt;/ref&gt; comprising the then Archdiocese and the dioceses of the southern belt of Ghana. The aim was to separate the philosophy department of St. Peter's Regional Seminary, Pedu, Cape Coast, from that of Theology. This was necessary as there was pressure on the facilities of St. Peter's at the time, due to increasing numbers of seminarians. There was also the need to initiate a spiritual year programme in response to the promptings of  [[Pope John Paul II]]. The idea came to fruition when on January 15, 1988, the first batch of seminarians (48 young men) arrived to start the Spiritual Year Programme. Msgr. Rudolph Apietu was appointed the first Rector. Msgr. Michael Obosu became the first Spiritual Director. Sr. Charles Luanga, HDR, and Sr. Alexandrina, HDR, served as matrons.To begin the philosophy programmes, Frs. Stephen Acheampong, John Martin Darko, and Miachael Barima Apau joined the staff. Rev. John Martin Darko was later appointed the first Vice Rector. Frs. Augustine Abizi and Paul Bebodu commuted from Pedu as adjunct professors. Frs. Irvin Yangouru and Joseph Osei Bonsu also joined the staff from the University of Ghana. When in 1992 Msgr. Apietu’s tenure was over, Fr. Francis Abuah Quansah was appointed the 2nd Rector of the seminary. Ten years later, he was succeeded by the then vice rector, Fr. Raphael Osei Soadwah, who was succeeded in 2009 by Fr. Francis Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stpaulscsem.com/brief-history|title=Brief History|website=St. Paul's Catholic Seminary|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual activities==

===Benefactors' Day celebrations===
In the second semester of every academic year, the seminary organizes the Benefactors' Day celebrations to celebrate all those who made contributions. The occasion is always  attended by a bishop who is a member of the Governing Council of the Seminary. Funds are also raised to support developmental projects in the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiccommgh.org/index.php/st-paul-major-seminary-holds-benefactors-day St Paul Major Seminary holds Benefactors-Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613233401/http://www.catholiccommgh.org/index.php/st-paul-major-seminary-holds-benefactors-day |date=13 June 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school caters for students in Years 7–10 from mainstream schools in the Sydney area and who have behavioural or emotional problems or who are otherwise at risk of not completing their education.

Berne shares a large campus (formerly St Thomas Boys High School) with 2 other small schools: the Catholic Intensive English Centre and a small satellite school of [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar]] (pre Kindergarten–Year 2).

The school opened on 28 April 1998, with a staff of five teachers and two support staff. The initial enrolment consisted of 28 students. It replaced the Benedict Community School, which had been in operation since 1976.

Berne is a registered special school and founding member of the Association of Catholic Special School Services (ACSSS). It provides an education to those young people who are at risk of not completing their [[School Certificate]] (the basic level of qualification in [[New South Wales]]). [[Mainstreaming in education|Mainstream]] classes are unsuitable for most of the students because of behavioural, emotional, and familial reasons.

The John Berne School is owned and operated by the [[Marist Brothers]], an order founded in France during the early 19th century by St Marcellin Champagnat.

==Culture==
The school caters for students who may be experiencing problems due to physical, psychological, emotional and/or familial reasons. They may also have [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] and/or disorders. Their placement at Berne could be short term, where the aim is to work on the student’s behavioural or emotional issues in order to reintegrate them back into their mainstream school, or long term, where the aim is to continue to educate them through to the School Certificate.

The school’s culture has been designed to defuse a lot of the behavioural triggers the students were experiencing in mainstream schools. For example, there is no uniform and there is no set homework.

The student-teacher relationship is unusual compared to mainstream schools. Students address staff by their first name, and even eat meals together. All staff are expected to get involved in all school activities, such as camps, excursions and personal development activities.

There is a strong focus on reducing the derailing effects of learning difficulties and disorders by having small class sizes (of about five or six students per class), and by streaming students based on ability. The lower ability classes are purposefully even smaller, usually having only two or three students per teacher.

==Special features==
The school is unusual in its very high staff-to-student ratio. It is also distinctive in providing a number of special programs:&lt;ref name=Annual2011&gt;{{cite book

==Recognition==
In 2006, the John Berne School received a "Highly Commended National Achievement in School Improvement" award from the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership.

==Pete’s Place campus==

The John Berne School has since 2010 operated a second campus, called ''Pete's Place School'', at Blacktown. Pete's Place operates in a different way from the main campus of the John Berne School: it has a smaller number of students (15 approximately) and the instruction, provided by three full-time teachers and one part-time teacher’s aide, is more individual.&lt;ref name=News-2-2012&gt;{{Citation

The '''Think Before You Speak''' campaign is a television, radio, and magazine advertising campaign launched in 2008 and developed to raise awareness of the common use of derogatory vocabulary among [[youth]] towards [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]]/[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) people.&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt; It also aims to "raise awareness about the prevalence and consequences of anti-LGBTQ bias and behaviour in America’s schools."&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-Homophobia Campaign Slaps Gamers: You've got to admit, it's got a point." Super Players On-line Gamebase (''SPOnG News''), August 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As LGBTQ people have become more accepted in the mainstream culture more studies have confirmed that they are one of the most targeted groups for harassment and bullying. An "analysis of 14 years of hate crime data" by the [[FBI]] found that gays and lesbians, or those perceived to be gay, "are far more likely to be victims of a violent hate crime than any other minority group in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splcs-intelligence-report-gays-targeted-for-hate-crimes SPLC’s Intelligence Report: Gays Targeted for Hate Crimes Far More Than Any Other Minority in America], November 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irmp"&gt;Mark Potok, [http://splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/winter/under-attack-gays-remain-minority-mos "Gays Remain Minority Most Targeted by Hate Crimes"], ''Intelligence Report'', Winter 2010, Issue Number: 140.&lt;/ref&gt; “As Americans become more accepting of LGBT people, the most extreme elements of the anti-gay movement are digging in their heels and continuing to defame gays and lesbians with falsehoods that grow more incendiary by the day,” said Mark Potok, editor of the Intelligence Report. “The leaders of this movement may deny it, but it seems clear that their demonization of gays and lesbians plays a role in fomenting the violence, hatred and bullying we’re seeing.”&lt;ref name="irmp"/&gt; Because of their [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]/expression, nearly half of LGBTQ students have been physically assaulted at school.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Biglow, "LGBT activists say: 'That's so gay' is so very passe", ''The Corsair'', May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuarte"/&gt; The campaign takes positive steps to counteract hateful and anti-gay speech that LGBTQ students experience in their daily lives in hopes to de-escalate the cycle of hate speech/harassment/bullying/physical threats and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Greenblatt, ''Serving LGBTIQ Library and Archives Users: Essays on Outreach, Service, Collections and Access'', McFarland, 2010, {{ISBN|0-7864-4894-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4894-4}}, pages 71-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A U.S. government study, titled ''Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide'', published in 1989, found that [[LGBT]] youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED334503&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED334503 Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide]&lt;/ref&gt; This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to [[Minority Stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10851 |title=Definition of Bisexual suicide risk |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meyer IH |title=Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: conceptual issues and research evidence |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=5 |pages=674–97 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12956539 |pmc=2072932 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] and drug use among LGBT people have both been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/3/452 |title=The Impact of Institutional Discrimination on Psychiatric Disorders in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: A Prospective Study by Mark L.

(ed.), Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, United States Government Printing Office, {{ISBN|0-16-002508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/15/lgbt-students-harassed-at_n_717992.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Danielle | last=Wienerbronner | title=LGBT Students Harassed At Colleges Nationwide, New Report Says | date=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year." &lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts About Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101035436/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination."&lt;ref name="Herald 2010"&gt;{{cite news|author=The Miami Herald |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2010/09/college-study-reveals-chilly-campus-climate-toward-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-people.html |title=Steve Rothaus' Gay South Florida |publisher=Miamiherald.typepad.com |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that “Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBTQ students, faculty and staff experience a ‘chilly’ campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities."&lt;ref name="Herald 2010" /&gt;

Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to [[bullying]]. As seen in the nine LGBTQ youth suicides in September 2010, severe bullying can lead to extremities such as [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Badash |url=http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/septembers-anti-gay-bullying-suicides-there-were-a-lot-more-than-5/discrimination/2010/10/01/13297 |title=September's Anti-Gay Bullying Suicides - There Were A Lot More Than 5 |publisher=Thenewcivilrightsmovement.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not always have to be physical, but it can be emotional, viral, sexual, and racial, too. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other [[verbal abuse]]. Viral, or [[cyber bullying]], involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other [[social media]] networks. Sexual bullying is unwanted touching, lewd gestures or jokes, and racial bullying has to do with [[stereotypes]] and [[discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |title=Students learn about bullying |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901182900/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying is often dismissed as a "[[rite of passage]]", but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. "Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals", and "almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)", according to [[GLSEN]]'s ''Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools''.&lt;ref name="thetrevorproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101035436/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues have become more mainstream in the 2000s (decade), and even more so in the months of September and October 2010 when a series of suicides got national attention. In August 2010 the [[US Department of Education]] (DOE) hosted the first-ever [[National Bullying Summit]].&lt;ref name="cnnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/03/10/obama.bullying/index.html |first=Shawna |last=Shepherd |title=White House conference tackles bullying |publisher=CNN |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] has posted an "It Gets Better" video on [[The White House]] website as part of the [[It Gets Better Project]], it became the second most-viewed video on the White House YouTube channel.&lt;ref name="cnnn"/&gt;

"More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year," making it "the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers."&lt;ref name="thetrevorproject.org"/&gt; In 2004, 1,985 American adolescents under the age of twenty committed suicide, an increase of 18% from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-02-05-kids-suicides_x.htm | work=USA Today | first=Lindsey | last=Tanner | title=Kids' suicides rise, CDC report finds | date=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of [[suicide among LGBT youth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html "Sexual Orientation and Youth Suicide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104141541/http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html |date=2006-01-04 }} by Dr. Gary Remafedi, October 6, 1999, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_146_37/ai_89942832 "Youth suicide risk and sexual orientation - Statistical Data Included"] by Rutter, Philip A &amp; Soucar, Emil, Summer 2002, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gaysuic.htm Articles Relating to Suicide by GLB Youth], retrieved 3 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

GLSEN spent approximately $2 million dollars to produce the campaign, which was released along with GLSEN's ''2007 School Climate Survey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinkisthenewblog.com/home/2008/10/think-before-you-speak/|title=Think Before You Speak |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes three television [[public service announcement]]s (PSAs), six print PSAs and three radio PSAs.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M.

In researching the possibility that [[public service directors]], who decide which pro bono campaigns their media outlet will run, they found only a "very small percentage" who would not run the campaign but mainly due to their audience was much older.&lt;ref name="stuarte"/&gt; They also tested how to deliver the messages to "tough and media savvy" kids "that speaks to young people in a tone they do not deem patronizing or condescending."&lt;ref name="stuarte"/&gt; Their goal became "to show the situation in a new light [...] to point out this language can be hurtful and let the kids make their own decisions."&lt;ref name="stuarte"/&gt;

After the first year of the campaign had been reached, the second harder-hitting phase addressing the consequences, "sometimes life-or-death", of anti-gay language was launched.&lt;ref name="SDFY"&gt;[http://sdgln.com/causes/2009/12/15/significantly-more-teens-think-thats-so-gay-wrong-glsens-ad-council-campaign-enter "Significantly more teens think 'That's so gay' is an inappropriate phase"], GLSEN Newswire, December 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rampu"&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6711368.html GLSEN Ramps Up 'ThinkB4YouSpeak' Campaign Against Anti-Gay Language in Schools], ''School Library Journal'', December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase focussed on showing the television PSAs to get young people to see how their language can be hurtful, the ads combined for "more than $9 million worth of media exposure for the campaign's message since its launch in October 2008."&lt;ref name="SDFY"/&gt; The second phase will be more [[viral marketing|viral]] and enable people to embed banners and materials on websites and in their [[social media]] use.&lt;ref name="SDFY"/&gt; All the materials are downloadable from the campaign site.&lt;ref name="rampu"/&gt; The Ad Council reports a high recognition of the television spots among teens (41% of teens aged 13–16 nationwide reporting that they have seen or heard at least one PSA) and a recent survey conducted by the Council shows "significant shifts in key attitudes and behaviors regarding the use of anti-LGBTQ slurs."&lt;ref name="SDFY"/&gt; Another downloadable feature is a meter that tracks the occurrence of common LGBTQ slurs such as "[[faggot (slang)|fag]]" and "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]" "in real time—on the popular micro-blogging site [[Twitter]]."&lt;ref name="rampu"/&gt;

The '''University of California, Santa Barbara''' (commonly referred to as '''UC Santa Barbara''' or '''UCSB''') is a public [[research university]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]].  It is one of the 10 campuses of the [[University of California]] system. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the nation. Tracing its roots back to 1891 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the University of California system in 1944 and is the third-oldest general-education campus in the system.

UCSB is one of America's [[Public Ivy]] universities, a designation that recognizes top public research universities in the U.S. The university is a comprehensive doctoral university, and is organized into five colleges and schools offering 87 undergraduate degrees and 55 graduate degrees. UCSB was ranked 30th among "National Universities", fifth among U.S. public universities, and 37th among Best Global Universities by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' 's 2019 rankings.&lt;ref name="US News"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ucsb-1320/overall-rankings|title=''U.S. News'' 2016 Best Colleges Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was also ranked 48th worldwide for 2016-17 by the ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'',&lt;ref name=THE&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-of-california-santa-barbara?ranking-dataset=589595 |title=World University Rankings 2016–2017 |publisher=The Times Higher Educational Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 45th worldwide by the ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref name="ShanghaiRanking.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017.html |title=''Academic Ranking of World Universities'' – 2017 |publisher=ShanghaiRanking Consultancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world-class faculty also includes two Academy and Emmy Award winners, and recipients of a [[Millennium Technology Prize]], an [[IEEE Medal of Honor]], a [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation ]] and a [[Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]].

The [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]] compete in the [[Big West Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]. The Gauchos have won NCAA national championships in men's soccer and men's water polo.

==History==
{{Main article|History of the University of California, Santa Barbara}}
UCSB traces its origins back to the '''Anna Blake School''', which was founded in 1891, and offered training in home economics and industrial arts.&lt;ref&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara, 1975–76 General Catalog Issue, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A note on histories of SBCC, UCSB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbsdk12.org/schools/history/SBCC-UCSB.shtml |title=A note on histories of SBCC, UCSB |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322233059/http://www.sbsdk12.org/schools/history/SBCC-UCSB.shtml |archivedate=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the '''Santa Barbara State Normal School''', which then became the '''Santa Barbara State College''' in 1921. 

In 1944, intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara led by [[Thomas Storke]] and [[Pearl Chase]] persuaded the State Legislature, Gov. [[Earl Warren]], and the [[Regents of the University of California]] to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system. The [[California State University|State College system]] sued to stop the takeover, but the governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed in 1946 to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses.&lt;ref name="stadtman"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stadtman, Verne |title=The University of California, 1868–1968, page 346|publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1970 |page=594 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerth8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerth|first1=Donald R.|title=The People's University: A History of the California State University|date=2010|publisher=Berkeley Public Policy Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780877724353|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1944 to 1958, the school was known as '''Santa Barbara College of the University of California''', before taking on its current name. When the vacated Marine Corps training station in Goleta was purchased for the rapidly growing college, [[Santa Barbara City College]] moved into the vacated State College buildings.&lt;ref name="Baker, Gayle, p. 83"&gt;Baker, Gayle, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the regents envisioned a small, several thousand–student liberal arts college, a so-called "[[Williams College]] of the West", at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa. The availability of a {{convert|400|acre|ha|sing=on}} portion of the land used as [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]] until 1946 on another seaside mesa in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], which the regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. 

Originally, only 3000–3500 students were anticipated, but the post-WWII [[baby boom]] led to the designation of general campus in 1958, along with a name change from "Santa Barbara College" to "University of California, Santa Barbara," and the discontinuation of the industrial arts program for which the state college was famous. A [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]], Samuel B. Gould, was appointed in 1959. All of this change was done in accordance with the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]].

In 1959, UCSB professor Douwe Stuurman hosted the English writer [[Aldous Huxley]] as the university's first visiting professor.&lt;ref name="The 50th Anniversary of Aldous Huxley’s UCSB Lecture Series"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2009/mar/24/50th-anniversary-aldous-huxleys-ucsb-lecture-serie/ |title=The 50th Anniversary of Aldous Huxley's UCSB Lecture Series |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley delivered a lectures series called "The Human Situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0701121432 |title=The Human Situation: The Lectures Given at Santa Barbara: Aldous Huxley, Piero Ferrucci: 9780701121433: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late '60s and early '70s, UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti–Vietnam War activity. A bombing at the school's faculty club in 1969 killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp. In the spring 1970, multiple occasions of [[arson]] occurred, including a burning of the [[Bank of America]] branch building in the student community of [[Isla Vista]], during which time one male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynexus.com/2010-02-25/forty-years-ago-a-mob-of-students-stormed-the-bank-of-america-building/ |title=Forty years ago, a mob of students stormed the Bank of America building |publisher=Dailynexus.com |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCSB's anti-Vietnam activity impelled then-Gov. [[Ronald Reagan]] to impose a [[curfew]] and order the [[California National Guard|National Guard]] to enforce it. Armed guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this time.

In 1995, UCSB was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]], an organization of leading research universities, with a membership consisting of 59 universities in the United States (both [[State university system (United States)|public]] and [[private university|private]]) and two universities in Canada.

On May 23, 2014, [[2014 Isla Vista killings|a killing spree]] occurred in [[Isla Vista, California]], a community in close proximity of the campus. All six people killed during the rampage were students at UCSB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/us/shooting-victims-drawn-to-california-campus-from-near-and-from-far.html?_r=0 |title=Rampage Victims Drawn to California Campus From Near and From Far |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murderer was a former Santa Barbara City College student who lived in Isla Vista.

[[California State University#Former campuses|Santa Barbara State College]] was under the supervision of a president, but in 1944, when it became a campus of the [[University of California]], the title of the chief executive was changed to [[Provost (education)|provost]]. In September 1958, the [[Regents of the University of California]] established Santa Barbara as a general university campus, and the official title of the chief executive was changed to [[chancellor]]. UCSB's first provost was thus [[Clarence L. Phelps]], while UCSB's first chancellor was [[Samuel B. Gould]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~ucalhist/general_history/campuses/ucsb/officers.html |title=University of California History Digital Archives |publisher=Sunsite.berkeley.edu |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510074527/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~ucalhist/general_history/campuses/ucsb/officers.html |archivedate=May 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCSB is located on cliffs directly above the Pacific Ocean. UCSB's campus is completely autonomous from local government and has not been annexed by the city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], and thus is not part of the city.&lt;ref name="annex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facm.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/2006_NW_Campus_LRDPA/UCSB%20_90%20LRDP%20text%20with%20_06%20N%20and%20W%20Campus%20Amend.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615013014/http://facm.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/2006_NW_Campus_LRDPA/UCSB%20_90%20LRDP%20text%20with%20_06%20N%20and%20W%20Campus%20Amend.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 15, 2007|title=UCSB Long Range Development Plan – 1990 |accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|year=1990|author=University of California, Santa Barbara|work=Page 16|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ellwood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://facilities.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/ucsb_lrdp.asp|title=Open Space Habitat Management Plan for the Ellwood-Devereux Coast: Reports and Documents |accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=University Of California Santa Barbara|year=1990|author=University Of California Santa Barbara |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811154530/http://facilities.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/ucsb_lrdp.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it appears closer to the recently formed city of [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of "city" through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. The campus is divided into four parts: Main (East) Campus {{convert|708|acre|ha}}, which houses all academic units, plus the majority of undergraduate housing; Storke Campus; West Campus; and North Campus. The campuses surround the unincorporated community of [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]].

UCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on two sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline, its own lagoon, and the rocky extension, [[Goleta Point]], which is also known as "Campus Point". The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach. It owns and manages Coal Oil Point nature preserve on the West Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coaloilpoint.ucnrs.org/|title=Coal Oil Point Reserve, UCSB|website=coaloilpoint.ucnrs.org|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the campus's early architecture was designed by famed architect [[William Pereira]] and his partner [[Charles Luckman]], and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings.

The lagoon is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat, and is fed by a combination of runoff and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus it's a unique combination of fresh and salt water. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer facilities. 

The [[UCSB Libraries]], consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than three million bound volumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/nov/09/uscb-library-celebrates-3-millionth-book/ |title=The Santa Barbara Independent UCSB Library Celebrates 3 Millionth Book |publisher=Independent.com |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of [[microform]]s, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. Situated at the center of campus, the UCSB Library will break ground on a significant addition and renovation project in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucsb.edu/building/ |title=Library Addition and Renovation |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402173101/http://www.library.ucsb.edu/building |archivedate=April 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 862 seats. It's also the main venue for the UCSB Arts &amp; Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community.

[[Storke Tower]], completed in 1969, is the tallest building in [[Santa Barbara County]]. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. It is home to a five-octave, 61-bell [[carillon]]. [[KCSB 91.9FM Santa Barbara|KCSB 91.9]] and the ''[[Daily Nexus]]'' have headquarters beneath Storke Tower.

The UCSB Family Vacation Center, founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors.

===Layout===
The university (itself termed a campus of the University of California) is divided into two physical campuses: West Campus and East Campus. The vast majority of university facilities, including all lecture halls and laboratories, are in the East Campus. The two campuses are connected by a large strip (known as the North and Storke Campuses) to the north which contain university housing and athletic fields. Thus, the university surrounds Isla Vista on three sides. West Campus, aside from a few buildings dedicated to faculty housing, has largely been leased out to private organizations, and includes a school for the disabled (part of the [[Devereux Foundation]]) and a large nature preserve, the Coal Oil Point Reserve. The largest sand dunes on the south-facing coast of the Santa Barbara Channel are located here.

The East Campus centers around two [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s, separated from each other by the main library and bus circle, and the life sciences buildings. In the East side of Campus, the Davidson Library was recently renovated. The Library construction finished November 2015 and opened to the school January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.library.ucsb.edu/building&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the western quad are Storke Plaza and buildings housing the various arts, social sciences, and humanities departments. The Student Resource Building and the [[UC Santa Barbara Events Center|Events Center]] are also located along this quad. Surrounding the wider, park-like eastern quad are buildings housing the physical sciences departments and the College of Engineering. Directly to the south of, but not adjacent to, the eastern quad are the life sciences and psychology departments, as well as most of the on-campus housing. The southernmost section of the campus is dominated by the lagoon. The peninsula extending from the beach into the lagoon contains a labyrinth.

===Bicycles===
UCSB is known for its extensive biking system. A recent survey says that 53% of UCSB students get around by cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bridges|first1=Andie|title=UCSB Bikes |url=http://www.independent.com/news/2013/oct/08/ucsb-bikes/|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles [[Segregated cycle facilities#Bikeways that use independent rights-of-way|have exclusive right of way]] on a series of specifically designated paths throughout East Campus. [[Bicycle stand]]s and [[bicycle locker|lockers]] are ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tap.tps.ucsb.edu/bicycle.aspx |title=Transportation Alternatives Program |publisher=UC Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.ucsb.edu/cso/bicycle-program |title=Bicycle Program |publisher=UC Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, UCSB [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel]] offers a space for UCSB's large Jewish population and a place for Jewish students to come together in a unique building in Isla Vista. Students socialize at the [[UCSB Arbor|Arbor]], the [[UCSB UCen|UCen]], the Coral Tree Cafe, the Courtyard Cafe, and for a special lunch, the Faculty Club.

UCSB is also known for its annual free music festival, [[Extravaganza (Music Festival)|Extravaganza]]. It is held at Harder Stadium in the spring and generally attracts around 8,000 people. Past performers have included [[Nas]], [[T.I.]], [[E-40]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake,]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], among many others.

The Nu chapter of [[Phrateres]], a non-exclusive nonprofit social-service club, was installed here in 1939. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America.

===Housing===
[[File:De La Guerra dining common, UCSB.jpg|thumb|250px|De La Guerra dining commons]]

There are eight [[residence halls]] at UCSB, seven of which are located at the main campus. One, Santa Catalina, is located near the entrance to West Campus north of Isla Vista.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hchoices/reshalls-descriptions.htm |title=Residence Halls Descpritions |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040614103918/http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hchoices/reshalls-descriptions.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Catalina has its own dining commons, Portola Dining Commons, as well as a heated swimming pool, two lounges, numerous study rooms, two recreational rooms, a gym, as well as tennis courts and an expansive lawn. Because Santa Catalina is nearly {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} off-campus, it has its own campus police station, as well as housing offices and Res-Net support center.

The Main Campus residence halls are found in two different locations. On the east end of campus are the residence halls named after five of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]]: [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Santa Cruz Island|Santa Cruz]], [[Anacapa Island|Anacapa]], [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]] and [[San Nicolas Island|San Nicolas]]. There are two dining commons located near the Channel Islands residence halls. The Ortega Dining Commons is located between San Miguel and the University Center [[UCSB UCen|(UCen)]], and the De La Guerra Dining Commons is located between Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and San Nicolas.

The two other residence halls, San Rafael and [[Manzanita Village]], are located on the west side of campus and primarily house continuing and transfer students. The Carrillo Dining Commons is located in [[Manzanita Village]], right next to San Rafael Hall. Manzanita Village was completed in 2002, and is the newest residence hall on campus.

[[File:San Clemente Villages.jpg|thumb|left|San Clemente Villages in April 2009]]
In addition, the university also has four housing complexes for graduate students and their families: San Clemente Villages for single graduate students, Santa Ynez Apartments, El Dorado Apartments, Westgate Apartments, and family student housing: West Campus Apartments and the Storke Apartment complexes. There is also faculty housing at the West Campus Point and new construction underway at the North Campus. The Sierra Madre Villages, located by the West Campus Apartments, was completed in September 2015 and was the first residential complex certified as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] platinum throughout the entire UC system.&lt;ref name='smleed'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2016/016255/going-platinum |title=Going Platinum |last=Fernandez |first=Sonia |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC Santa Barbara is the only campus in the UC system with any "LEED for Homes" certifications.&lt;ref name='smleed'/&gt;

Private residence halls are also available to UCSB students. Tropicana Del Norte, located directly adjacent to the Main Campus, houses UCSB students in 51 furnished suites, and has an on-site dining hall and heated pool.

Students may also choose to rent housing in the bordering community of Isla Vista. An estimated average for rent costs is $500 to $800 a month to share a bedroom, and includes trash pickup and water utilities. Low-cost housing is limited, with the cheapest source being the [[Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative]].

Other sources of housing include the Greek system, and outlying communities (i.e., Goleta, Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, Montecito). Some students live in Isla Vista, which is immediately adjacent to campus. Since the early '60s, Isla Vista has had a reputation of being a party environment. UCSB is also affiliated with the [[Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative]] in Isla Vista, which seeks to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation, thereby influencing the community to eliminate prejudice and discrimination in the community.

===Services===
There are a number of academic resources offered by the university, including a [[writing center]], open [[computer lab]]s, a [[machining|machine shop]], a career and counseling center, and drop-in academic advising.

The UCSB Recreation Center provides classes and facilities for students and faculty. The center has swimming pools, [[racquetball]] courts, a rock wall, and exercise machines. The University Center has facilities for meetings and presentations, and also contains a bookstore, restaurants, and a cashier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/ |title=sa.ucsb.edu |publisher=sa.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCSB has a health clinic. Students with ailments or seeking medical assistance may consult a physician at the clinic. The clinic also offers basic healthcare, and provides emergency medicine and contraceptives. The university is the only UC campus with its own paramedic rescue unit. It's staffed by full-time professional paramedics and part-time undergraduate [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s.

SexInfo, which was started in 1976 by professors John and Janice Baldwin, is run by students doing advanced course work and research on [[Sexology|sexuality]] through UCSB's [[Sociology]] Department. The site is dedicated to providing accurate information about sexuality in a way that is both informative and personal. SexInfo answers questions sent in by readers from all over the world, as well as regularly updates and posts articles on various topics related to human sexuality. This program helps students getting their degree in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Snedden |first=Megan | title= A.S.

==Athletics==
{{main article|UC Santa Barbara Gauchos}}
The mascot of UCSB is the [[Gaucho]] and the school colors are blue and gold. UCSB's sports teams compete in the [[Big West Conference]], with the exception of the men's water polo, men's and women's swimming, and the men's volleyball teams, which are in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]]. Santa Barbara is best known for its men's swimming and [[UCSB soccer|men's soccer]] teams. In 2006, UCSB won their first NCAA men's soccer title and its second overall NCAA championship (1979 water polo) in school history.&lt;ref name="ncaas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaasports.com/soccer/mens/recaps/d1_1203_517049/2006|title=UC Santa Barbara 2, UCLA 1|accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=NCAA sports.com|year=2006|author=NCAA sports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/sports/soccer/04soccer.html|title=Santa Barbara Rides Its Revival All the Way to the Championship|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 29, 2008|last=Eligon|first=John|date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are some 400 students in ICA, there are over 700 in club sports teams, including [[Alpine skiing|Alpine racing]], cycling, [[fencing]], [[Field Hockey|field hockey]], [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's lacrosse|lacrosse]], [[Roller Hockey|roller hockey]], [[Rugby union|rugby]], sailing, soccer, [[triathlon]], [[Ultimate Frisbee|ultimate frisbee]], [[Water Ski|water ski]], and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Many of these teams are highly regarded and compete against Intercollegiate teams from across the U.S. For example, [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] has produced several national team members including nine-time National Rowing Team member Amy Fuller, winner of several Olympic and World Championship medals, and currently head of the [[UCLA]] Rowing Program. The UCSB cycling team has also produced several national team members, Olympians, and members of numerous U.S. and international professional teams.

Hundreds of students participate in a large intramural program consisting of badminton, basketball, bowling, flag football, golf, floor hockey, indoor and outdoor soccer, racquetball, squash, running, softball, tennis, table tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, inner-tube water polo, and kickball.

Surfing also draws many students to UCSB. The on-campus beaches include a number of decent surfing sites, including "Poles," "Campus Point," "Depressions" and "Sands" and "Devereaux Point" on West Campus.  Because Campus Beach actually faces south and east, and is shielded by the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, the surf is usually quite small. However, a large north or west swell can wrap in to create great waves that are typically very clean and good for surfing. UCSB has a surf team that competes in [[National Scholastic Surfing Association]] competitions and is generally considered one of the best in the nation. They continued their reputation by winning a record 14th national title at the college level in 2010's finals.

'''Wayne M. Brasler''' (born October 28, 1940, in St. Louis, Missouri) was, for half a century, the journalism adviser for the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]]' school paper, The Midway&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uhighmidway.com/|title=U-High Midway – The Student News Site of University of Chicago Laboratory High School|website=uhighmidway.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalism.missouri.edu/honor-medal/winners-2007.html&lt;/ref&gt; and yearbook, U-Highlights.

==Awards==
Brasler is a celebrated journalism teacher who has won many awards including the National High School Journalism Teacher of the Year award, awarded by the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund, along with the Gold Key award, given by the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] and the Pioneer Award, from the [[National Scholastic Press Association]]{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}. He also recently won the prestigious Gold Medal from the University of Missouri School of Journalism for his defense of student journalists' press rights and the Charles O'Malley Award for outstanding teaching and advising from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association. In 2001 he began an alumni association newspaper for Normandy High in St. Louis, a large, full-color publication which so far has been one-of-a-kind.{Information verified by Wayne Brasler}

==Early life==
Brasler grew up in [[Normandy, Missouri]] and attended [[Normandy High School (Missouri)|Normandy High School]], outside of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He attended [[Harris–Stowe State University|Harris Teachers College]] and Junior College for two years, becoming managing editor of the campus newspaper his sophomore year.  He proceeded to the University of Missouri School of Journalism]], where he was copy editor of the student newspaper the Maneater, earning a [[Bachelor of Journalism|BJ]] degree there before taking a job at the Jewish Post and Opinion in St. Louis.  He later earned a Masters in Language Arts at [[Northeastern Illinois University]] taking night and summer classes while still working six days and 80 hours a week.  As a child in St. Louis, Brasler hung out at T.V. and radio stations as soon as he could ride streetcars alone and appeared on a children's radio show on KXLW in suburban Clayton. His mentor was the host of the show, who also taught kindergarten at his grade school.  He originally planned a career in radio and television but at Normandy High decided he wanted to be a journalist and journalism teacher. He also had an extensive career as a singer, under the stage name Jim Andrews.

==Recent years==
In 1996 the National Scholastic Press Association named a new high school journalism award after Brasler, the Brasler Prize, given to the most outstanding piece of work published in a high school newspaper every year.  Recently the University of Missouri School of Journalism awarded him its prestigious Gold Medal for his highly vocal defense of student press rights and his history in scholastic journalism. Besides teaching journalism and advising publications for nearly half a century, Brasler has remained a working journalist.  He also has written program notes for dozens of C.D. releases, edited several best-selling music books and music biographies, and wrote a soon-to-be-published autobiography and a biography for the singer Joni James.  He formed a Joni James fan club in 1955 and still publishes the Joni James Newsletter, a full-color magazine.  He is regarded as an expert on American popular music of the 20th century and has been consulted on numerous recording projects.   He also is an expert on St. Louis County streetcar lines (his father was once a streetcar motorman) and has written numerous articles on them.  In January 2015 he retired after 51 years at the University of Chicago Lab Schools to devote full-time to the publications he does for the Normandy Alumni Association in Normandy, Missouri; a magazine he does for the singer Joni James, a publication he started while in high school; and a monthly newsletter he does for a friend's transmission business, all of these projects for profit.
