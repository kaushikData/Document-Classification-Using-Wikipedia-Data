'''Airspace Action on Smoking and Health''' (formerly ''Airspace Non-smokers' Rights Society'') is a volunteer-based anti-tobacco organization in the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]].

Airspace Non-smokers' Rights Society was initially founded in Victoria in the late 1970s and successfully lobbied for one of Canada's first ever smoking control by-laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Smoke-Free: How One City Successfully Banned Smoking in All Indoor Areas'', by Barbara McLintock, Granville Island Publishing, 2004, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dale Jackaman (Canadian politician)|Dale Jackaman]], then Secretary of the Victoria organization, moved to Vancouver in 1984. He and Norm Gillan founded the Vancouver branch of Airspace, and Jackaman was its first Executive Director. Jackaman then amalgamated both the Victoria and Namaimo organizations (run by [[Errol Povah]]) and formed what is now the province-wide Airspace organization.

The Presidents and Executive Directors of Airspace include Jackaman, Deborah Wotherspoon, [[Jerry Steinberg]], [[Robert Broughton (activist)]], Heather Mackenzie, and Povah, respectively.

One aspect of the Airspace organization was its early adoption of computer technology to facilitate its activist activities. Airspace was probably the first organization of its kind to adopt a modem based [[bulletin board system]] (BBS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbslist.textfiles.com/604/oldschool.html 604 Area Code BBSes Through History]&lt;/ref&gt; Airspace was also one of the first organizations of this nature to have a web site. Some screen shots from an early version of the site turned up in internal documents from [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmdocs.com/PDF/2047549852_9854_0.PDF Document 2047549852/9854]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [http://www.pmdocs.com/PDF/2084063121_3130_0.PDF Document 2084063121/3130]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's public persona is the [[grim reaper|Grim Reaper]], used it to create a form of [[street theatre]] at tobacco promotions.

In 1993, the New Democratic Party government of the day announced regulations to prevent the sale of cigarettes to children. Airspace organized a "compliance check" (or "kiddie sting"). Ten Airspace volunteers escorted five youths aged 12 to 16 who attempted to purchase cigarettes. They visited a total of 65 tobacco retailers, and 43% of them were willing to sell cigarettes to the underaged person. This effort got significant press attention, and Burnaby-Edmonds MLA Fred Randall pressed for stronger regulations, such as stiffer fines and suspensions. The provincial government started doing compliance checks of its own to measure the effectiveness of this effort.

During the early 1990s, Airspace staged regular protests in front of Imperial Tobacco's Vancouver office. These protests included an annual "Modified Christmas Caroling", using "[http://airspace.bc.ca/airspace-resources-mainmenu-55/72-resources/27-carols Clean Air Carols]". These protests came to an end when Imperial Tobacco (the Canadian branch of BAT) closed the Vancouver office and moved their Western Canada operations to Calgary.

'''Alison Gopnik''' (born June 16, 1955) is an American [[professor]] of [[psychology]] and affiliate professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. She is known for her work in the areas of [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and [[language development]], specializing in the effect of language on thought, the development of a [[theory of mind]], and causal learning. Her writing on psychology and cognitive science has appeared in [[Science (magazine)|''Science'']], ''[[Scientific American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Alison, "Making AI More Human:  Artificial intelligence has staged a revival by starting to incorporate what we know about how children learn", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp.&amp;nbsp;60–65.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[New Scientist]]'', [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alison Gopnik |url=http://www.cla.auburn.edu/cla/littleton-franklin/alison-gopnik/ |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=24 March 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728004139/http://www.cla.auburn.edu/cla/littleton-franklin/alison-gopnik/ |archive-date=2012-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body of work also includes four books and over 100 journal articles.

She has frequently appeared on TV and radio including [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|''The Charlie Rose Show'']] and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. ''Slate'' writes of Gopnik, "One of the most prominent researchers in the field, Gopnik is also one of the finest writers, with a special gift for relating scientific research to the questions that parents and others most want answered. This is where to go if you want to get into the head of a baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bloom |first=Paul |title=What's Inside a Big Baby Head? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2009/08/whats_inside_a_big_baby_head.html |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gopnik is a columnist for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', sharing the Mind &amp; Matter column with [[Robert Sapolsky]] on alternating Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gopnik |first=Alison |title=Why Are Our Kids Useless?

==Academic career==
Gopnik received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], majoring in psychology and philosophy, from [[McGill University]] in 1975. In 1980, she received a [[D.Phil.]] in [[experimental psychology]] from [[Oxford University]]. She worked at the [[University of Toronto]] before joining the faculty at [[UC Berkeley]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=CurriculumVitae&gt;{{cite web |title=Alison Gopnik, Ph.D.  Curriculum Vitae |url=http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/agopnik_cv.pdf |accessdate=26 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316235637/http://psychology.berkeley.edu/faculty/profiles/agopnik_cv.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gopnik has done extensive work with applying [[Bayesian networks]] to human learning and has published and presented numerous papers on the topic.&lt;ref name=CurriculumVitae /&gt; Gopnik says of this work, "The interesting thing about Bayes nets is that they search out causes rather than mere associations. They give you a single representational structure for dealing both with things that just happen and with interventions--things you observe others doing to the world or things you do to the world. This is important because there is something really special about the way we treat and understand human action. We give it a special status in terms of our causal inferences. We think of human actions as things that you do that are designed to change things in the world as opposed to other events that just take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What every baby knows |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17823955.400-what-every-baby-knows.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judea Pearl]], developer of Bayesian networks, says Gopnik was one of the first psychologists to note that the mathematical models also resemble how children learn. Gopnik's work at Berkeley's Child Study Center seeks to develop mathematical models of how children learn. These models could be used to develop better algorithms for [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tung |first=Stephen |title=Tables turned: UC Berkeley researchers study kids to make computers smarter |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_20617266/tables-turned-uc-berkeley-researchers-study-kids-make?IADID=Search-www.mercurynews.com-www.mercurynews.com |publisher=[[MercuryNews.com]] |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2013, Gopnik was inducted into [[The American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Abdelghaffar |first=Seif |title=10 campus professors inducted into American Academy of Arts and Sciences |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/04/25/10-campus-professors-inducted-into-american-academy-of-arts-and-sciences/ |publisher=The Daily Californian |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is, as of 2014, a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows of the Cognitive Science Society |url=http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_awards_fellows.html |accessdate=14 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716115712/http://cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_awards_fellows.html |archivedate=16 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable publications==
Gopnik is an authority on the [[philosophy of mind]] and a preeminent [[developmental psychologist]]. Gopnik is known for advocating the "[[theory theory]]" which postulates that the same mechanisms used by scientists to develop scientific theories are used by children to develop causal models of their environment.&lt;ref name=Remmel&gt;{{cite web |last=Remmel |first=Ethan |title=Brainstorming Babies |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/brainstorming-babies |publisher=[[American Scientist]] |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "theory theory" was explored in "''Words, Thoughts, and Theories''," co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=publisher description |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=7611 |publisher=[[The MIT Press]] |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913113106/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=7611 |archive-date=2006-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gopnik co-authored with Andrew N. Meltzoff and Patricia K. Kuhl "''The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us About the Mind''." The book posits that the cognitive development of children in early life is made possible by three factors: innate knowledge, advanced learning ability, and the evolved ability of parents to teach their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lerman |first=Kristina |title=The Scientist in the Crib |url=http://www.isi.edu/~lerman/etc/ScientistIntheCrib.pdf |publisher=[[Information Sciences Institute]] |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Causal Learning: Psychology, Philosophy, and Computation''," edited with Laura Schulz, explores [[causal learning]] and the interdisciplinary work done in furthering the understanding of learning and reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=publisher description |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Psychology/Developmental/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195176803# |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book "''The Philosophical Baby: What Children’s Minds Tell Us about Truth, Love, and the Meaning of Life''," Gopnik explores how infants and young children cognitively develop by using processes similar to those used by scientists, including experimenting on their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Jascha |title=MIND Reviews: The Philosophical Baby: What Children's Minds Tell |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=mind-reviews-philosophical-baby |work=Recommendations from Scientific American MIND |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explains how an environment maximized for an infant's cognitive development is one that is safe to explore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Book Offers Philosophical Insights into Babies' Thinking |url=http://ls.berkeley.edu/arts-ideas/archive/alison-gopnik-offers-philosophical-insights-babys-thinking |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716113145/http://ls.berkeley.edu/arts-ideas/archive/alison-gopnik-offers-philosophical-insights-babys-thinking |archive-date=2015-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also explores what babies can tell us about love, imagination and identity, as well as considering the broader philosophical significance of care-giving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reiter |first=Amy |title=Alison Gopnik: The Philosophical Baby author decodes your child's brain |url=http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-development/alison-gopniks-philosophical-baby-and-child-development/ |publisher=[[Babble.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The Philosophical Baby''" has been recognized as a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times Extended List Bestseller]], a [[San Francisco Chronicle]] Bestseller, and an Independent Bookstores Bestseller.&lt;ref name=ThePhilosophicalBaby&gt;{{cite web |title="The Philosophical Baby" book site |url=http://www.alisongopnik.com/ThePhilosophicalBaby.htm |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also received acclaim on the New York Times Editor's Choice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editors' Choice |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/books/review/EdChoice-t.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=10 April 2012 |date=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; list, the San Francisco Chronicle Editors Choice list, and as one of Babble's 50 Best Parenting Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=50 Best Parenting Books |url=http://www.babble.com/products/mom-products/top-books-parenting-help-raising-children-development-the-philosophical-baby/ |publisher=[[Babble.com]] |accessdate=10 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404125436/http://www.babble.com/products/mom-products/top-books-parenting-help-raising-children-development-the-philosophical-baby/ |archive-date=2012-04-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been recognized as recommended reading by Scientific American.&lt;ref name=ThePhilosophicalBaby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wong |first=Kate |title=Recommended: The Philosophical Baby |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=recommended-sept-09 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Gopnik published a paper in ''Hume Studies'' arguing that the historical record regarding the circumstances around [[David Hume]]'s authoring of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' are wrong. Gopnik argued that Hume had access to the library of the [[Prytanée National Militaire|Royal College at La Flèche]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] institution that had been founded by Henri IV. At the time Hume was living nearby and working on the ''Treatise'', La Flèche was home to a Jesuit missionary named [[Charles François Dolu]], a learned man who was an expert on different world religions who had visited the French embassy in Siam. In addition, Dolu had met [[Ippolito Desideri]], another Jesuit missionary who had visited Tibet from 1716–1721. Gopnik argues that because of his exposure to [[Theravada Buddhism]], Dolu may form the source of the Buddhist influence on Hume's ''Treatise''. Gopnik cites a number of letters from Hume that mention his time at La Flèche and his meeting with Jesuits from the college. It is from this Buddhist connection through the learning of the Jesuit college that Hume is influenced to deny the ontological reality of the self—which Gopnik links to the Indian Buddhist idea of ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' (Emptiness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Alison |title=Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism?

The feature-length documentary film ''[[The Singularity (film)|The Singularity]]'' by independent filmmaker Doug Wolens (released at the end of 2012), showcasing Gopnik's work in cognitive development as it relates to computer learning, has been acclaimed as "a large-scale achievement in its documentation of futurist and counter-futurist ideas" and "the best documentary on the Singularity to date."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/olson20130301 |title=The Singularity: A Documentary by Doug Wolens |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/video/archive/2013/01/pondering-our-cyborg-future-in-a-documentary-about-the-singularity/266873/ |title=Pondering Our Cyborg Future in a Documentary About the Singularity – Kasia Cieplak-Mayr von Baldegg |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3376">'''American Hypnosis Society (AHS)''' existed from 1965 until 2001 for the purpose of educating interested individuals and mental health professionals in the proper practice of [[hypnosis]].  The Society’s stated objective was “..to advance understanding of, and research into, the beneficial use of properly practiced [[hypnotherapy]] and to dispel myths regarding its possible misuses.”&lt;ref&gt;AHS Membership Guide, Rev. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was founded by [[New York City]]-based psychiatrist Michael Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D., whose practice was focused on the treatment of aberrant behavior, and the reintegration of social outcasts with their community.

Using a local training methodology, matching students with experienced instructors on a one-on-one basis the Society's hands on approach gained it quick acceptance in New York and eventually throughout the country .  This, coupled with quarterly classroom based training, allowed Society members to learn hypnosis through personal interaction with subjects and knowledgeable professionals.

The Society offered certification and training recognizing successful students as hypnotists after 200 hours of training and examination and as hypnotherapists after 800 hours of training and 120 hours of supervised client interaction (which time could be accounted against the 800 hours of training).  Related class work from a properly accredited institution, such as a college, could be used to offset up to 500 hours of the required class material, if approved by the accreditation panel, but only actual client interaction by a previously certified hypnotherapist could be used for the 120-hour client requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Certification Requirements, American Hypnosis Society, As Published 1992, pp3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Submission to examinations and demonstrations of accumulated knowledge were required by students at regular intervals during the education process.

At its apex, the Society had a membership consisting of over 750 hypnotherapists and mental health professionals, most on the Eastern half of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;American Hypnosis Society, Report to the Membership, June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was eventually disbanded when, on behalf of the Board of Trustees, Secretary Edward J. Herman announced that the Board had discovered that the Treasurer, Patricia O’Neal had embezzled the majority of the Society’s operating capital in the eighteen (18)  months after Dr. Goldstein’s death in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;American Hypnosis Society, Report to the Membership, May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the dissolution of the Society, the majority of its former members have migrated to the Society For Psychological Hypnosis (division 30 of the American Hypnosis Society),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apadivisions.org/division-30/membership/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the National Guild of Hypnotists,&lt;ref&gt;http://ngh.net/&lt;/ref&gt; or to Dr. Milton Erickson's American Society of Clinical Hypnosis &lt;ref&gt;http://www.asch.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aswan Dam''', or more specifically since the 1960s, the '''Aswan High Dam''', is an [[embankment dam]] built across the [[Nile]] in [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]], between 1960 and 1970. Its significance largely eclipsed the previous [[Aswan Low Dam]] initially completed in 1902 downstream. Based on the success of the Low Dam, then at its maximum utilization, construction of the High Dam became a key objective of the government following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]; with its ability to control flooding better, provide increased water storage for irrigation and generate [[hydroelectricity]] the dam was seen as pivotal to Egypt's planned [[industrialization]]. Like the earlier implementation, the High Dam has had a significant effect on the [[Economy of Egypt|economy]] and [[culture of Egypt]].

Before the High Dam was built, even with the old dam in place, the annual [[flooding of the Nile]] during late summer had continued to pass largely unimpeded down the valley from its [[East Africa]]n [[drainage basin]]. These floods brought high water with natural [[nutrient]]s and [[mineral]]s that  annually enriched the fertile [[soil]] along its [[floodplain]] and [[Nile delta|delta]]; this predictability had made the Nile valley ideal for farming since [[Ancient Egypt|ancient times]]. However, this natural flooding varied, since high-water years could destroy the whole [[crop]], while low-water years could create widespread [[drought]] and associated [[famine]]. Both these events had continued to occur periodically. As [[Demographics of Egypt#Population|Egypt's population]] grew and technology increased, both a desire and the ability developed to completely control the flooding, and thus both protect and support [[Arable land|farmland]] and its economically important [[cotton]] crop. With the greatly increased [[reservoir]] storage provided by the High Aswan Dam, the floods could be controlled and the water could be stored for later release over multiple years.

The Aswan Dam was designed by the Moscow-based [[Hydroproject Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jean Edward|title=Eisenhower in War and Peace|date=2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780679644293|page=694|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jO2gLXNNa2wC&amp;pg=PA694|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history==
The earliest recorded attempt to build a dam near Aswan was in the 11th century, when the Arab polymath and engineer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known as ''Alhazen'' in the West) was summoned to Egypt by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding of the Nile]], a task requiring an early attempt at an Aswan Dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Rashed |first=Roshdi|title=Portraits of Science: A Polymath in the 10th Century|pages=773|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science magazine]] |date=2002-08-02 |year=2002b |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5582/773|accessdate=2008-09-16|pmid=12161634|doi=10.1126/science.1074591|journal=Science|volume=297|issue=5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; His field work convinced him of the impracticality of this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Corbin|first=Henry|author-link=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy, Translated by Liadain Sherrard, [[Philip Sherrard]] |publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies|date=1993|orig-year=French 1964|isbn=0-7103-0416-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aswan Low Dam, 1898–1902===
{{Main|Aswan Low Dam}}
The British began construction of the first dam across the Nile in 1898. Construction lasted until 1902, and the dam was opened on 10 December 1902. The project was designed by Sir [[William Willcocks]] and involved several eminent engineers, including Sir [[Benjamin Baker (engineer)|Benjamin Baker]] and Sir [[John Aird (engineer)|John Aird]], whose firm, [[John Aird &amp; Co.]], was the main contractor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectstocks.com/egyptbond.html Egypt bond] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513224447/http://www.collectstocks.com/egyptbond.html |date=May 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Roberts|first=Chalmers|date= December 1902|title=Subduing the Nile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoDNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2861|journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]]|volume=V|pages=2861–2870|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aswan High Dam prelude, 1954–1959===
In 1952, the Greek-Egyptian engineer Adrian Daninos began to develop the plan of the new Aswan Dam. Although the Low Dam was almost overtopped in 1946, the government of [[King Farouk]] showed no interest in Daninos's plans. Instead the Nile Valley Plan by the British hydrologist [[Harold Edwin Hurst]] to store water in Sudan and Ethiopia, where evaporation is much lower, was favored. The Egyptian position changed completely with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|overthrow of the monarchy]], led by the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] including [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The Free Officers were convinced that the Nile Waters had to be stored in Egypt for political reasons, and within two months, the plan of Daninos was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Robert O. |chapter=In Search of the Nile Waters, 1900–2000|title=The Nile: Histories, Cultures, Myths. Edited by Haggai Erlich and Israel Gershoni |date=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner|pages=255–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] were interested in helping the development of the dam, but this movement happened in the midst of the [[Cold War]], as well as of growing [[Arab Cold War|intra-Arab rivalries]].

In 1955, Nasser was trying to portray himself as the leader of [[Arab nationalism]], in opposition to the traditional monarchies, especially the [[Hashemite]] [[Kingdom of Iraq]] following its signing of the 1955 [[Baghdad Pact]]. At that time the U.S. feared that [[communism]] would spread to the Middle East, and it saw Nasser as a natural leader of an [[Anticommunism|anticommunist]] [[capitalist|procapitalist]] [[Arab League]]. America and Britain offered to help finance construction of the High Dam, with a loan of $270 million, in return for Nasser's leadership in resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. While opposed to communism, capitalism, and [[imperialism]], Nasser presented himself as a [[Non-Aligned Movement|tactical neutralist]], and sought to work with both the U.S. and the USSR for Egyptian and Arab benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Aswan Decision in Perspective |first=James E. |last=Dougherty |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=74 |number=1 |date=March 1959 |pages=21–45 |publisher=The Academy of Political Science |doi=10.2307/2145939|jstor=2145939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 106|particularly criticized]] raid by Israel against Egyptian forces in Gaza in 1955, Nasser realized that he could not legitimately portray himself as the leader of [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab nationalism]] if he could not defend his country militarily against Israel. In addition to his development plans, he looked to quickly modernize his military, and he turned first to the U.S.

[[File:Gamal-002.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian President [[Nasser]] and Russian leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at the ceremony to divert the Nile during the construction of the Aswan High Dam on 14 May 1964. At this occasion [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] called it "[[Eighth Wonder of the World|the eighth wonder of the world]]".]]
The American Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and the American President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] told Nasser that the U.S. would supply him with weapons only if they were used for defensive purposes and accompanied by American military personnel for supervision and training. Nasser did not accept these conditions, but then he looked to the USSR for support. Although Dulles believed that Nasser was only bluffing and that the USSR would not aid Nasser, he was wrong— the USSR promised Nasser a quantity of arms in exchange for a deferred payment of Egyptian grain and cotton. On 27 September 1955, Nasser announced [[Egyptian-Czech arms deal|an arms deal]], with [[Czechoslovakia]] acting as a middleman for the Soviet support.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of attacking Nasser for turning to the Soviets, Dulles sought to improve relations with him. This explains the later offer of December 1955, in which the U.S. and Britain pledged $56 and $14 million respectively towards the construction of the dam.&lt;ref name="Dougherty, Page 22"&gt;Dougherty, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasser observing Aswan Dam construction.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] observing the construction of the dam, 1963]]

Though the Czech arms deal actually increased the American willingness to invest at Aswan, [[Great Britain]] cited the deal as a reason for reversing its promise of funds. What angered Dulles much more was Nasser's [[diplomatic recognition]] of [[China]], which was in direct conflict with Dulles's policy of [[containment]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; There are several other reasons why the U.S. decided to withdraw its offer of funding. Dulles believed that the USSR would not fulfill its commitment to help the Egyptians. He was also irritated by Nasser's neutrality and attempts to play both sides of the [[Cold War]]. At the time, other western allies in the Middle East, including Turkey and Iraq, were irritated and jealous that Egypt, a persistently neutral country, was being offered so much aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Charles D. |title=Palestine and the Arab–Israeli Conflict |edition=Sixth |location=Boston/New York |publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's. |year=2007 |isbn=0-312-43736-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1956, the Soviets offered Nasser $1.12 billion at 2% interest for the construction of the dam. On 19 July the [[U.S. State Department]] announced that American financial assistance for the High Dam was "not feasible in present circumstances."&lt;ref name="Dougherty, Page 22"&gt;Dougherty, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 1956, with wide Egyptian acclaim, Nasser announced [[Suez Crisis|the nationalization of the Suez Canal]] as well as fair compensation for the [[Suez Crisis#Background|former owners]]. Nasser planned on the revenues generated by the canal helping to fund construction of the High Dam. When the [[Suez War]] broke out, the United Kingdom, France, and Israel seized the canal and the Sinai, but pressure from the U.S. and the [[USSR]] at the [[United Nations]] and elsewhere forced them to withdraw.

In 1958, the USSR went ahead in providing support for the High Dam project.

In the 1950s, archaeologists began raising concerns that several major historical sites, including the famous temple of [[Abu Simbel]] were about to be under water. A rescue operation began in 1960 under [[UNESCO]] (for details see below under Effects).

===Construction and filling, 1960–1976===

The Soviets also provided technicians and heavy machinery. The enormous [[Dam#Rock-fill dams|rock]] and clay dam was designed by the Soviet [[Hydroproject Institute]] along with some Egyptian engineers. 25,000 Egyptian engineers and workers contributed to the construction of the dams.

On the Egyptian side, the project was led by [[Osman Ahmed Osman]]'s [[Arab Contractors (company)|Arab Contractors]]. The relatively young Osman underbid his only competitor by one-half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909474,00.html Osman the Efficient]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aswan High Dam is {{convert|4000|m}} long, {{cvt|980|m}} wide at the base, {{cvt|40|m}} wide at the crest and {{cvt|111|m}} tall. It contains {{convert|43,000,000|m3|cuyd}} of material. At maximum, {{convert|11000|m3/s}} of water can pass through the dam. There are further emergency spillways for an extra {{convert|5000|m3/s}}, and the [[Toshka]] Canal links the reservoir to the Toshka Depression. The reservoir, named [[Lake Nasser]], is {{cvt|550|km}} long and {{cvt|35|km}} at its widest, with a surface area of {{convert|5250|km2}}. It holds {{convert|132|km3|cuyd}} of water.

==Irrigation scheme==
{{See also|Water resources management in modern Egypt}}
[[File:Egypt sat.png|thumb|left|Green irrigated land along the Nile amidst the desert]]
[[File:NileBalance.JPG|thumb|Water balances]]
[[File:NileCanals.JPG|thumb|Main irrigation systems (schematically)]]
Due to the absence of appreciable rainfall, Egypt's agriculture depends entirely on [[Surface irrigation|irrigation]]. With irrigation, two crops per year can be produced, except for [[sugar cane]] which has a growing period of almost one year.

The high dam at Aswan releases, on average, {{convert|55|km3|acre.ft}} water per year, of which some {{convert|46|km3|acre.ft}} are diverted into the irrigation canals.

In the Nile valley and delta, almost {{convert|336000

|km2}} benefit from these waters producing on average 1.8 crops per year. The annual crop consumptive use of water is about {{convert|38|km3|acre.ft}}. Hence, the overall irrigation efficiency is 38/46 = 0.82 or 82%. This is a relatively-high irrigation efficiency. The field irrigation efficiencies are much less, but the losses are reused downstream. This continuous reuse accounts for the high overall efficiency.

The following table shows that the equal distribution of irrigation water over the branch canals taking off from the one main irrigation canal, the Mansuriya Canal near Giza, leaves much to be desired:&lt;ref&gt;''Impacts of the Irrigation Improvement Projects in Egypt''.

The salt concentration of the water in the Aswan reservoir is about {{convert|0.25|kg/m3}}, a very low salinity level. At an annual inflow of {{convert|55|km3|acre.ft}}, the annual salt influx reaches 14 million tons. The average salt concentration of the drainage water evacuated into the sea and the coastal lakes is {{convert|2.7|kg/m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian Drainage Research Institute, DRI, yearbook 1995/1996&lt;/ref&gt; At an annual discharge of {{convert|10|km3}} (not counting the {{convert|2|kg/m3|disp=sqbr}} of salt intrusion from the sea and the lakes, see figure "Water balances"), the annual [[Dissolved load|salt export]] reaches 27 million ton. In 1995, the output of salt was higher than the influx, and Egypt's agricultural lands were [[Leaching (agriculture)|desalinizing]]. Part of this could be due to the large number of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]] projects executed in the last decades to [[Watertable control|control the water table]] and [[Soil salinity control|soil salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;M.S.Abdel-Dayem, 1987.

[[Drainage]] through subsurface drains and drainage channels is essential to prevent a deterioration of crop yields from [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] and [[soil salinity|soil salinization]] caused by irrigation. By 2003, more than {{convert|20000|km2}} have been equipped with a subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] and approximately {{convert|7.2|km2}} of water is drained annually from areas with these systems. The total investment cost in agricultural drainage over 27 years from 1973 to 2002 was about $3.1 billion covering the cost of design, construction, maintenance, research and training. During this period 11 large-scale projects were implemented with financial support from World Bank and other donors.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects, Drainage Research Institute, 2006: [http://www.csdwand.net/data/sheet.asp?cn=Egypt&amp;fn=LA0648 ''The National Drainage and Drainage Water Reuse Programs, Egypt'']{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Local Actions at the 4th World Water Forum, 2 March 2007, accessed 28 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Environmental and cultural issues}}Effects==
The High Dam has resulted in protection from [[floods]] and [[drought protection|droughts]], an increase in agricultural production and employment, electricity production, and improved navigation that also benefits tourism. Conversely, the dam flooded a large area, causing the relocation of over 100,000 people. Many archaeological sites were submerged while others were relocated. The dam is blamed for coastline erosion, soil salinity, and health problems.

The assessment of the costs and benefits of the dam remains controversial decades after its completion. According to one estimate, the annual economic benefit of the High Dam immediately after its completion was [[Egyptian pound|E£]]255 million, $587 million using the exchange rate in 1970 of $2.30 per E£1): £140 million from agricultural production, £100 million from hydroelectric generation, £10 million from flood protection, and £5 million from improved navigation. At the time of its construction, total cost, including unspecified "subsidiary projects" and the extension of electric power lines, amounted to £450 million. Not taking into account the negative [[environmental issues in Egypt|environmental and social effects]] of the dam, its costs are thus estimated to have been recovered within only two years.&lt;ref&gt;Abul-Ata, Abdel Azim, "Egypt and the Nile after the Construction of the High Aswan Dam", Ministry of Irrigation and Land Reclamation, Cairo, 1978, quoted by Asit Biswas and Cecilia Tortajada, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; One observer notes: "The impacts of the Aswan High Dam (...) have been overwhelmingly positive. Although the Dam has contributed to some [[environmental issues in Egypt|environmental problems]], these have proved to be significantly less severe than was generally expected, or currently believed by many people."&lt;ref name="Biswas"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Asit K. |last=Biswas |url=http://www.inwent.org/E+Z/zeitschr/de602-11.htm |title=Aswan Dam Revisited: The Benefits of a Much-Maligned Dam |journal=Development and Cooperation |number=6 |date=November–December 2002 |pages=25–27 |access-date=2018-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615032505/http://www.inwent.org/E+Z/zeitschr/de602-11.htm |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another observer disagreed and he recommended that the dam should be torn down. Tearing it down would cost only a fraction of the funds required for "continually combating the dam's consequential damage" and 500,000 hectares of fertile land could be reclaimed from the layers of mud on the bed of the drained reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Fouad Ibrahim, an Egyptian geoscientist teaching in Germany in a 1982 article quoted by Peter Wald:"25 Years Later:The Aswan High Dam Has Proven its Worth", Development and Cooperation 2/96, p.20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic floods and droughts have affected Egypt since ancient times. The dam mitigated the effects of floods, such as those in 1964, 1973, and 1988. Navigation along the river has been improved, both upstream and downstream of the dam. Sailing along the Nile is a favorite tourism activity, which is mainly done during the winter when the natural flow of the Nile would have been too low to allow navigation of cruise ships.{{clarify|the sentence seems to be missing a word of be inverted|date=May 2017}} A new fishing industry has been created around Lake Nasser, though it is struggling due to its distance from any significant markets. The annual production was about 35 000 tons in the mid-1990s. Factories for the fishing industry and packaging have been set up near the Lake.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"/&gt;

===Drought protection, agricultural production and employment===
[[File:Egyptian Countryside R03.jpg|thumb|left|The Egyptian countryside benefited from the Aswan High Dam through improved irrigation as well as electrification, as shown here south of Luxor.]]
The dams also protected Egypt from the droughts in 1972–73 and 1983–87 that devastated East and West Africa. The High Dam allowed Egypt to reclaim about 2.0 million [[feddan]] (840,000 hectares) in the [[Nile Delta]] and along the Nile Valley, increasing the country's irrigated area by a third. The increase was brought about both by irrigating what used to be desert and by bringing under cultivation of 385,000 ha that were previously used as flood retention basins.&lt;ref name="Schamp"/&gt; About half a million families were settled on these new lands. In particular the area under rice and sugar cane cultivation increased. In addition, about 1 million feddan (420,000 hectares), mostly in Upper Egypt, were converted from flood irrigation with only one crop per year to perennial irrigation allowing two or more crops per year. On other previously irrigated land, yields increased because water could be made available at critical low-flow periods. For example, wheat yields in Egypt tripled between 1952 and 1991 and better availability of water contributed to this increase. Most of the 32&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of freshwater, or almost 40 percent of the average flow of the Nile that were previously lost to the sea every year could be put to beneficial use. While about 10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the water saved is lost due to evaporation in Lake Nasser, the amount of water available for irrigation still increased by 22&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"&gt;M.A. Abu-Zeid &amp; F. Z. El-Shibini: "[http://www.ci.uri.edu/ciip/FallClass/Docs_2006/UrbanWaterfronts/Abu-Zeid%20and%20El-Shibini.pdf Egypt's High Aswan Dam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720101000/http://www.ci.uri.edu/ciip/FallClass/Docs_2006/UrbanWaterfronts/Abu-Zeid%20and%20El-Shibini.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}", ''Water Resources Development'', Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 209–217, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates put evaporation from Lake Nasser at between 10 and 16 cubic km per year.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Mosalam Shaltout, T.

===Electricity production===
[[File:Aswan Dam.jpg|thumb|Power plant of the Aswan High Dam, with the dam itself in the background.]]
The dam powers twelve generators each rated at {{convert|175|MW}}, with a total of {{convert|2.1|GW}}. Power generation began in 1967. When the High Dam first reached peak output it produced around half of Egypt's production of electric power (about 15 percent by 1998), and it gave most Egyptian villages the use of electricity for the first time. The High Dam has also improved the efficiency and the extension of the Old Aswan Hydropower stations by regulating upstream flows.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"/&gt;

===Resettlement===
[[File:Sudan Wadi Halfa RR Hotel From Garden 1936.jpg|thumb|left|A picture of the old [[Wadi Halfa]] town that was flooded by Lake Nasser.]]
Lake Nasser flooded much of lower [[Nubia]] and 100,000 to 120,000 people were resettled in Sudan and Egypt.&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;{{citation |first1=Thayer |last1=Scudder |first2=John |last2=Gay |contribution-url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~tzs/50%20Dam%20Survey.pdf |contribution=A comparative survey of dam-induced resettlement in 50 cases |editor-first=Thayer |editor-last=Scudder |title=The Future of Large Dams: Dealing with Social, Environmental, Institutional and Political Costs |year=2005 |isbn=1-84407-155-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WadiHalfa,center.jpg|thumb|right|View of New Wadi Halfa, a settlement created on the shore of Lake Nasser to house part of the resettled population from the Old Wadi Halfa town.]]
In Sudan, 50,000 to 70,000 Sudanese [[Nubians]] were moved from the old town of [[Wadi Halfa]] and its surrounding villages. Some were moved to a newly created settlement on the shore of Lake Nasser called New Wadi Halfa, and some were resettled approximately 700 kilometres south to the semi-arid Butana plain near the town of Khashm el-Girba up the [[Atbara River]]. The climate there had a regular rainy season as opposed to their previous desert habitat in which virtually no rain fell. The government developed an irrigation project, called the [[New Halfa Scheme|New Halfa Agricultural Development Scheme]] to grow cotton, grains, sugar cane and other crops. The Nubians were resettled in twenty five planned villages that included schools, medical facilities, and other services, including piped water and some electrification.

In Egypt, the majority of the 50,000 Nubians were moved three to ten kilometers from the Nile near [[Kom Ombo]], 45 kilometers downstream from Aswan in what was called "New Nubia". Housing and facilities were built for 47 village units whose relationship to each other approximated that in Old Nubia. Irrigated land was provided to grow mainly sugar cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Thayer |last=Scudder |url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~tzs/Aswan%20High%20Dam%20case.pdf |title=The Aswan High Dam Case |year=2003 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stock |first=Jill Kamil ; photographs by Michael |title=Aswan and Abu Simbel: history and guide |year=1993 |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-321-8 |pages=141–142 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nZGrBnInneIC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=aswan+dam+new+nubia#v=onepage&amp;q=aswan%20dam%20new%20nubia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological sites===
[[File:Abusimbel.jpg|thumb|The statue of Ramses the Great at the Great Temple of Abu Simbel is reassembled after having been moved in 1967 to save it from being flooded.]]
22 monuments and architectural complexes  that were threatened by flooding from Lake Nasser, including the [[Abu Simbel temples]], were preserved by moving them to the shores of the lake under the [[UNESCO]] Nubia Campaign.&lt;ref name="UNESCO_Nubia_Campaign"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=24168&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO project site about Nubia Campaign.&lt;/ref&gt; Also moved were [[Philae]], [[Kalabsha]] and [[Amada]].&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"/&gt;

These monuments were granted to countries that helped with the works:
* The [[Temple of Debod|Debod temple]] to Madrid
* The [[Temple of Dendur]] to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York
* The [[Temple of Taffeh]] to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] of [[Leiden]]
* The [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]]

These items were removed to the garden area of the [[Sudan National Museum]] of [[Khartoum]]:&lt;ref&gt;Reis, Michael (1999), Who is who in Ancient Egypt, p.48 {{ISBN|0-415-15448-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining archaeological sites, including the [[Buhen]] fort or the cemetery of [[Fadrus]] have been flooded by Lake Nasser.

===Loss of sediments===
[[Image:Lake Nasser.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lake Nasser]] behind the Aswan dam displaced more than 100,000 people and traps significant amounts of sediment.]]
Before the construction of the High Dam, the Nile deposited [[sediment]]s of various particle size – consisting of fine sand, [[silt]] and [[clay]] – on fields in Upper Egypt through its annual flood, contributing to soil fertility. However, the nutrient value of the sediment has often been overestimated. 88 percent of the sediment was carried to the sea before the construction of the High Dam. The nutrient value added to the land by the sediment was only 6,000 tons of [[potash]], 7,000 tons of [[phosphorus pentoxide]] and 17,000 tons of nitrogen. These amounts are insignificant compared to what is needed to reach the yields achieved today in Egypt's irrigation.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.A. |last=Abu Zeid |title=Environmental impacts of the High Dam |journal=Water Resources Development |volume=5 |number=3 |date=September 1989 |page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the annual spread of sediment due to the Nile floods occurred along the banks of the Nile. Areas far from the river which never received the Nile floods before are now being irrigated.&lt;ref name="Biswas and Tortajada"&gt;{{citation |first1=Asit K. |last1=Biswas |first2=Cecilia |last2=Tortajada |url=http://www.app-wm.org/liberary/DownloadFiles.aspx?did=407278&amp;dt=1 |title=Hydropolitics and Impacts of the High Aswan Dam |publisher=Third World Centre for Water Management |location=Mexico |date=March 2004 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more serious issue of trapping of sediment by the dam is that it has increased coastline erosion surrounding the Nile Delta. The coastline erodes an estimated {{Convert|125|-|175|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Schwartz |editor-first=Maurice L. |title=Encyclopedia of coastal science |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=1-4020-1903-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VWnxpAxp6TMC&amp;pg=PA358&amp;dq=aswan+dam+coastline+erosion#v=onepage&amp;q=aswan%20dam%20coastline%20erosion&amp;f=false |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterlogging and increase in soil salinity===
Before the construction of the High Dam, groundwater levels in the Nile Valley fluctuated 8–9&amp;nbsp;m per year with the water level of the Nile. During summer when evaporation was highest, the groundwater level was too deep to allow salts dissolved in the water to be pulled to the surface through [[capillary action]]. With the disappearance of the annual flood and heavy year-round irrigation, groundwater levels remained high with little fluctuation leading to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]]. Soil salinity also increased because the distance between the surface and the groundwater table was small enough (1–2&amp;nbsp;m depending on soil conditions and temperature) to allow water to be pulled up by evaporation so that the relatively small concentrations of salt in the groundwater accumulated on the soil surface over the years. Since most of the farmland did not have proper subsurface drainage to lower the groundwater table, salinization gradually affected crop yields.&lt;ref name="Schamp"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Heinz |last=Schamp |title=Sadd el-Ali, der Hochdamm von Assuan (Sadd el-Ali, the High Dam of Aswan) |journal=Geowissenschaften in unserer Zeit |volume=1 |year=1983 |number=2 |pages=51–85 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drainage]] through sub-surface drains and drainage channels is essential to prevent a deterioration of crop yields from [[soil salinity|soil salinization]] and waterlogging. By 2003, more than 2.0 million have been equipped with a subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] at a cost from 1973 to 2002 of about $3.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation, Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects, Drainage Research Institute, 2006: ''The National Drainage and Drainage Water Reuse Programs, Egypt'', Local Actions at the 4th World Water Forum, March 2, 2007. Retrieved April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
[[File:Schistosomiasis itch.jpeg|thumb|left|Skin vesicles: a symptom of schistosomiasis. A more common symptom is blood in the urine.]]
Contrary to many predictions made prior to the Aswan High Dam construction and publications that followed, that the prevalence of [[schistosomiasis]] (bilharzia) would increase, it did not.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. F. DeWolfe et al. Schistosomiasis in Rural Egypt. 1978. United States Environment Protection Agency. EPA – 600/1-78-070.&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption did not take into account the extent of perennial irrigation that was already present throughout Egypt decades before the high dam closure. By the 1950s only a small proportion of Upper Egypt had not been converted from basin (low transmission) to perennial (high transmission) irrigation. Expansion of perennial irrigation systems in Egypt did not depend on the high dam. In fact, within 15 years of the high dam closure there was solid evidence that biharzia was declining in Upper Egypt. S. haematobium has since disappeared altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Baraket, R. Epidemiology of Schistosomiasis in Egypt: Travel through Time: Review. Journal of Advanced Research (2013) 4, 425–432&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested reasons for this include improvements in irrigation practice. In the Nile Delta, schistosomaisis had been highly endemic, with prevalence in the villages 50% or higher for almost a century before.  This was a consequence of the conversion of the Delta to perennial irrigation to grow long staple cotton by the British. This has changed. Large scale treatment programmes in the 1990s using single dose oral medication contributed greatly to reducing the prevalence and severity of S. mansoni in the Delta.

===Other effects===
Sediment deposited in the reservoir is lowering the water storage capacity of Lake Nasser. The reservoir storage capacity is 162&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, including 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; dead storage at the bottom of the lake below 147&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, 90&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; live storage, and 41&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of storage for high flood waters above 175m above sea level. The annual sediment load of the Nile is about 134 million tons. This means that the dead storage volume would be filled up after 300–500 years if the sediment accumulated at the same rate throughout the area of the lake. Obviously sediment accumulates much faster at the upper reaches of the lake, where sedimentation has already affected the live storage zone.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid 1989"/&gt;

Before the construction of the High Dam, the 50,000&amp;nbsp;km of irrigation and drainage canals in Egypt had to be dredged regularly to remove sediments. After construction of the dam, aquatic weeds grew much faster in the clearer water, helped by fertilizer residues. The total length of the infested waterways was about 27,000&amp;nbsp;km in the mid-1990s. Weeds have been gradually brought under control by manual, mechanical and biological methods.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"/&gt;

[[File:Sardin from sardegna 1.jpg|thumb|right|The catch of sardines in the Mediterranean off the Egyptian coast declined after the Aswan Dam was completed, but the exact reasons for the decline are still disputed.]]
Mediterranean fishing and brackish water lake fishery declined after the dam was finished because nutrients that flowed down the Nile to the Mediterranean were trapped behind the dam. For example, the [[sardine]] catch off the Egyptian coast declined from 18,000 tons in 1962 to a mere 460 tons in 1968, but then gradually recovered to 8,590 tons in 1992. A scientific article in the mid-1990s noted that "the mismatch between low primary productivity and relatively high levels of fish production in the region still presents a puzzle to scientists."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Sayed |last1=El-Sayed |first2=Gert L. |last2=van Dijken |url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/Quarterdeck/QD3.1/Elsayed/elsayed.html |title=The southeastern Mediterranean ecosystem revisited: Thirty years after the construction of the Aswan High Dam |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concern before the construction of the High Dam had been the potential drop in river-bed level downstream of the Dam as the result of erosion caused by the flow of sediment-free water. Estimates by various national and international experts put this drop at between 2 and 10 meters. However, the actual drop has been measured at 0.3–0.7 meters, much less than expected.&lt;ref name="Abu Zeid and Shibini"/&gt;

The red-brick construction industry, which consisted of hundreds of factories that used Nile sediment deposits along the river, has also been negatively affected. Deprived of sediment, they started using the older alluvium of otherwise arable land taking out of production up to 120 square kilometers annually, with an estimated 1,000 square kilometers destroyed by 1984 when the government prohibited, "with only modest success," further excavation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Thayer |last=Scudder |url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~tzs/Aswan%20High%20Dam%20case.pdf |title=The Aswan High Dam Case |year=2003 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source, bricks are now being made from new techniques which use a sand-clay mixture and it has been argued that the mud-based brick industry would have suffered even if the dam had not been built.&lt;ref name="Biswas and Tortajada"/&gt;

Because of the lower turbidity of the water sunlight penetrates deeper in the Nile water. Because of this and the increased presence of nutrients from fertilizers in the water, more algae grow in the Nile. This in turn increases the costs of drinking water treatment. Apparently few experts had expected that water quality in the Nile would actually decrease because of the High Dam.&lt;ref name="Schamp"/&gt;

'''Biodosimetry''' is a measurement of biological response as a [[Surrogate endpoint|surrogate]] for radiation dose.  The [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] and [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] have issued guidance on performing biodosimetry and interpreting data.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.ncrponline.org/PDFs/NCRP%20Composite%20Glossary.pdf NCRP Composite Glossary.]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (reports published during the period 1991 to 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">'''Canada's Health Care Providers, 2007''' is a reference on the country's [[health care]] workforce. It looks at how the health provider landscape has evolved, examines the complexities of [[Health Human Resources|health human resources]] planning and management in the current environment and provides the latest information on supply trends for various health professions.

== Health care workforce ==
* Size: In 2006, just over 1,000,000 people in Canada worked directly in [[Health profession|health occupations]]; this represented 6% of the total Canadian workforce.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"&gt;Canadian Institute for Health Information, Canada.s Health Care Providers, 2007(Ottawa: CIHI, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Growth: From 1996 to 2005, growth of health professions varied; for example, dental hygienists experienced a growth of 45%, pharmacists 29% and [[medical laboratory]] technologists 6%.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"/&gt;
* Age and sex: Women make up the majority of the health workforce (77% compared to 47% in the general workforce). The health workforce is also slightly older than the general working population, at an average age of 41.9, compared to a Canadian average of 39.6 in 2005.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"/&gt;

== Health of the workforce ==
* Health: Those working in health care report levels of good health (96%) similar to the general Canadian workforce (94%). In 2003, 1.1% of health care workers versus 3.8% of the general [[Labor force|labour force]] reported being injured at work.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"/&gt;
* Absenteeism: Despite reporting that they are in good health, health care workers have had a higher average number of [[lost work]] days when compared to the rest of the working population over the last 20 years. On average in 2006, the typical [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health care]] worker aged 25 to 54 missed almost 12 days of work due to his or her own illness or disability. This compares to an average of seven days of work missed for all employed Canadians.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"/&gt;

== Work environment ==
* [[Part time|Part-time]] work: In 2005, more members of the health care workforce (24%) than the Canadian labour force (18%) worked part-time. Midwives, dieticians and nutritionists, audiologists, psychologists, RNs and [[Occupational therapy|occupational therapists]] all had a higher proportion of their workforce that worked part-time when compared with all health occupations.&lt;ref name="CIFHI"/&gt;

'''Cannabis in Norway''' is illegal for all purposes except medical purposes, for which it has been available through special approval since November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legemiddelverket.no/nyheter/behandling-med-medisinsk-cannabis-innenfor-dagens-regelverk|title=Behandling med medisinsk cannabis innenfor dagens regelverk|last=|first=|date=|website=Statens Legemiddelverk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decriminalization==
In December 2017, the Norwegian Parliament announced the nation would decriminalize personal drug use, including cannabis, providing medical treatment to users rather than fines and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/rusmidler/historisk-i-stortinget-slutt-paa-straff-for-rusmisbrukere/a/24209948/ Historisk i Stortinget: Slutt på straff for rusmisbrukere - Rusmidler - VG.no, 13.12.2017&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Up to 15 grams is considered an amount for personal use, and is punished with a fine in the case of first-time offenders; possessing more is punished more harshly. Repeat offenders or dealers can face prison charges. The type of fine given for drug offences are of the more serious category, and will appear on a criminal record. Young first-time offenders are routinely compelled to consent to regular drug testing to avoid prosecution.&lt;ref name="Norway1"&gt;{{cite news |title = Bergen kommune skeptisk til frivillige ruskontrakter |url =

If the amount is larger, the limit is 10 years. Amounts over 80 kilos are punished with sentences of 3 to 15 years, and in very serious cases up to 21 years is permitted.&lt;ref name="Norway2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Straffeloven § 162 |url =

The '''contraceptive sponge''' combines [[barrier contraception|barrier]] and [[Spermicide|spermicidal]] methods to prevent [[fertilisation|conception]].

Three brands are marketed: Pharmatex, Protectaid and Today. Pharmatex is marketed in [[France]] and the province of [[Quebec]]; Protectaid in the rest of [[Canada]] and [[Europe]]; and Today in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="CBAS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponges |work=Cervical Barrier Advancement Society |year=2004 |url=http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm |accessdate=2006-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114062634/http://www.cervicalbarriers.org/information/sponges.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponges work in two ways. First, the sponge is inserted into the vagina, so it can cover the [[cervix]] and prevent any sperm from entering the [[uterus]]. Secondly, the sponge contains  [[spermicide]].&lt;ref name=pp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-sponge-today-sponge-4224.html|title=Bith Control Sponge|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109010052/http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-sponge-today-sponge-4224.html|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponges are inserted [[vagina]]lly prior to intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective.
Sponges provide no protection from [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.  Like condoms, sponges are single-use only.

==Effectiveness==
The manufacturer of the Today sponge reports effectiveness for prevention of pregnancy of 100% when used correctly and consistently. When packaging directions are not followed for every act of intercourse, effectiveness rates of 84% to 89% are reported.&lt;!--

==Use==
To use the Today sponge, it must be run under water until thoroughly wet, about 2 tablespoons.&lt;ref name="mfg" /&gt; The water is used as a mechanism to activate the spermicide inside the sponge.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/contraceptive-sponge/MY00989/DSECTION=what-you-can-expect Mayo Clinic.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012173753/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/contraceptive-sponge/MY00989/DSECTION%3Dwhat-you-can-expect |date=2010-10-12 }} (2010). Retrieved February 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; No extra spermicide is needed.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"/&gt; The Protectaid&lt;ref name=CBAS /&gt;
and Pharmatex&lt;ref name="GHO" /&gt; sponges come ready to use.

The sponge can be inserted up to 24 hours before intercourse. It must be left in place for at least six hours after intercourse. It should not be worn for more than 30 hours in a row.&lt;ref name=pp /&gt;

The sponge should never be reused once it has been removed after having sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"/&gt;

==History==
The devices have had periods of unavailability in some markets since being introduced. All three brands are currently available outside their normal marketing areas through internet retailers.

===Today sponge===
{{main|Today sponge}}
The Today Sponge was developed beginning in 1976 and introduced in the United States in 1983. Today was removed from the market in 1994 due to manufacturing problems. Following several delays, the Today brand became available again in Canada in March 2003, and in the U.S. in September 2005. After the manufacturer's parent company declared bankruptcy in 2007, production was shut down again, until the new manufacturer, Mayer Laboratories Ltd., reintroduced Today to the U.S. market in 2009.

===Pharmatex sponge===
The Pharmatex sponge was introduced in France and the Canadian province of Quebec in 1984.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menard F |title=The health of women and contraception in Quebec | journal = Planned Parenthood in Europe regional information bulletin | volume = 13 | issue = 1 |pages=18–20 |year=1984 | pmid = 12178356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protectaid sponge===
The Protectaid sponge was introduced in Canada in 1996, and in Europe in 2000.&lt;ref name=CBAS /&gt;

==Spermicide==
Sponges are a physical barrier, trapping sperm and preventing their passage through the cervix into the reproductive system. The [[spermicide]] is an important component of pregnancy prevention; each brand offers a different formula.

The Today sponge contains 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[milligram]]s (mg) of [[nonoxynol-9]].&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Best |first=Kim |title=New Devices May Be Easier to Use | journal = Network | volume = 20 | issue = 2|publisher=Family Health International |year=2000 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/6read/6issues/6network/v20-2/nt2023.html |accessdate=2006-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protectaid contains 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg of the F-5 gel, with three active ingredients (6.25&amp;nbsp;mg of nonoxynol-9, 6.25&amp;nbsp;mg of [[benzalkonium chloride]], and 25&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium cholate).&lt;ref name="GHO" /&gt; Pharmatex contains 60&amp;nbsp;mg of benzalkonium chloride.&lt;ref name=CBAS /&gt;

==Side effects==
Some people are allergic to the spermicide used in the sponge. Women who use contraceptive sponges have an increased risk of [[yeast infection]] and [[urinary tract infection]]. Improper use, such as leaving the sponge in too long, can result in [[toxic shock syndrome]].

The Today sponge contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, which may contain certain risks for those using the sponge multiple times a day, or for those at risk for HIV. In these cases, nonoxynol-9 can irritate the tissue, which leads to an increased risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=pp/&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Shortly after they were taken off the U.S. market, the sponge was featured in an episode of the [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' titled "[[The Sponge (Seinfeld episode)|The Sponge]]". In the episode, [[Elaine Benes]] conserves her remaining [[Today sponge]]s by choosing to not have [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] unless she is certain her partner is "sponge-worthy".&lt;ref name="lavery2006"&gt;Lavery, David and Sara Lewis Dunne (2006). ''Seinfeld, master of its domain: revisiting television's greatest sitcom'', p. 247. Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1803-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later revisited in the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|series finale]] when the pharmacist testifies against Elaine and her morality for buying a whole case of the sponges.
*The film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' features a scene where the characters [[List of Clueless characters#Dionne Davenport|Dionne]] and [[List of Clueless characters#Tai Frasier|Tai]] are discussing sex and Dionne is heard to ask Tai if the sponge would still work if the user has sex in water.
*On the TV series ''[[My So-Called Life]]'', the doctor tells Angela to use a sponge if she's thinking of having sex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12643">'''Corporate Accountability''' (formerly INFACT, Corporate Accountability International) is a non-profit organization, founded in 1977. Their campaign headquarters are in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and they have offices in [[Oakland, California]], [[Seattle, Washington]], and [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. Currently, their most prominent campaign is their climate campaign to kick Big Polluters out of climate policy.

== History ==
Since 1977 Corporate Accountability has waged a number of high-profile campaigns to protect [[public health]], the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[democracy]] from abuse by [[transnational corporation]]s.

From 1977 to 1986 the Infant Formula Campaign and [[Nestlé boycott|Nestlé Boycott]] brought about significant reforms in the life-threatening marketing of infant formula in developing countries. The work of Corporate Accountability International and allies contributed to the passage of the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] in 1981.

From 1984 to 1993 the Nuclear Weaponmakers Campaign and [[General Electric]] (GE) [[Boycott]] helped push industry leader GE out of the [[nuclear weapons]] business and exposed the human and environmental costs of the corporation's nuclear weapons production and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;  The international boycott of GE products cost the company over $19 million in lost medical equipment sales and $100 million in overall sales.&lt;ref&gt;Zheutlin, Peter (November 1990).

==Current campaigns ==
In 1994 Corporate Accountability launched the Challenging Big Tobacco Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corporateaccountability.org/tobacco/ |title=Tobacco &amp;#124; Corporate Accountability International |publisher=corporateaccountability.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, years of campaigning culminated in the adoption of the world's first public health and corporate accountability treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;—the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]].  
They spent the fall of 2005 working alongside other organizations to get a number of African countries to ratify the treaty and also gained notice for their attempts to get the US to ratify the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Challenging Big Tobacco Campaign is currently focused on expanding implementation and enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.

In 2004 Corporate Accountability launched the Think Outside the Bottle Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkoutsidethebottle.org |title=Corporate Accountability International |publisher=Think Outside the Bottle |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote, protect and ensure public funding for public water systems and challenge corporations who undermine public confidence in [[tap water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corporateaccountability.org/water/ |title=Think Outside the Bottle &amp;#124; Corporate Accountability |publisher=CorporateAccountability.org |date= |accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Corporate Accountability’s Think Outside The Bottle Campaign has garnered international notice.  The campaign has been supported by [[Salt Lake City]] mayor [[Rocky Anderson]], who has also begun his own “Knock Out Bottled Water” website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;
The campaign also played a major role in the July 2007 decision by [[PepsiCo]] to change the label on their [[Aquafina]] bottled water to more plainly state it is sourced from public water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; On [[World Water Day]] March 22, 2010 Corporate Accountability released the film [http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/video/story-bottled-water Story of Bottled Water] with the [[Story of Stuff]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/story-of-bottled-water |title=The Story of Bottled Water |publisher=Stopcorporateabuse.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Corporate Accountability launched the Value [The] Meal Campaign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valuethemeal.org |title=Value [the&amp;#93; Meal Food [NEW&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Corporate Accountability International |publisher=Valuethemeal.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging [[corporate abuse]] of food by the [[fast food industry]].  The campaign demands to the fast food industry include: stop [[fast food marketing]], promotion and sponsorship that appeals to children and teenagers; stop manipulating public health policy and nutrition science; and provide complete, accurate and non-promotional information about the health risks of fast food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corporateaccountability.org/food/ |title=Value [the&amp;#93; Meal Food [NEW&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Corporate Accountability |publisher=CorporateAccountability.org |date= |accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a similar tack, in April 2010 the nonprofit began calling for the 'retirement' of [[Ronald McDonald]], saying the venerable mascot fuels childhood obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2014, Corporate Accountability launched its climate campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.corporateaccountability.org/who-we-are/history/ |title=Value [the&amp;#93; History [NEW&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Corporate Accountability |publisher=CorporateAccountability.org |date= |accessdate=Jan 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It began to organize with people around the world to hold fossil fuel corporations accountable and remove them from the policymaking process. Corporate Accountability's climate campaign has turned what was once an untouchable subject — the fossil fuel industry’s conflicts of interest in climate policy — into a hotly debated issue at the U.N. climate treaty negotiations and in national policymaking &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

. Corporate Accountability has also supported policymakers from former President Obama to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to take decisive action on climate change and hold the fossil fuel industry accountable.

'''Dana Paul Goldman''' is the Leonard D. Schaeffer Chair and director of the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy &amp; Economics|Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics]] and Professor of Public Policy, Pharmacy, and Economics at the [[USC Sol Price School of Public Policy]] and [[USC School of Pharmacy]]. He is also an adjunct professor of health services and radiology at [[UCLA]], and a managing director and founding partner, along with [[Darius Lakdawalla]] and [[Tomas J. Philipson]], at [[Precision Heath Economics]], a health care consulting firm. Previously held positions include the director of the Bing Center for Health Economics, RAND Royal Center for Health Policy Simulation, and UCLA/RAND Health Services Research Postdoctoral Training Program.

Goldman's professional interests include the innovation of health technology, the future of America's elderly population, the design of insurance, and disparities in health outcomes. More recently, his work has focused on medical innovation and regulation, comparative effectiveness and outcomes research, and patient-reported outcomes in emerging markets

Goldman is also the founding co-editor of the Forum for Health Economics and Policy and has been on the editorial board of Health Affairs, B.E. Journals of Economic Analysis and Policy, and the RAND Journal of Economics, among others. He is a health policy advisor to the Congressional Budget Office and, in 2009, was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine. He is also the 2009 recipient of the Eugene Garfield Economic Impact Prize, in recognition of his outstanding research on how medical research impacts the economy.

He received his B.A. ''summa cum laude'' from [[Cornell University]] and a Ph.D. in Economics from [[Stanford University]].

Goldman’s 1997 article, "Redistributional Consequences of Community Rating"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1070170 | pmid=9108805 | volume=32 | title=Redistributional consequences of community rating | journal=Health Serv Res | pages=71–86 | last1 = Goldman | first1 = DP | last2 = Leibowitz | first2 = A | last3 = Buchanan | first3 = JL | last4 = Keesey | first4 = J | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses a study done in California where health insurance premiums were based on community ratings. The [[Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act]] (PPACA) has been passed through [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] and implementation has commenced in the U.S. healthcare system.  [[Community rating]] systems will be the basis for health care premiums in the future exchange system.&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 3590 – 111th Congress: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (2009) §2701&lt;/ref&gt;  These ratings, pool people in to demographic groups and charge all members a constant rate. The goal of this system is to prevent [[medical underwriting]] and decrease the inequities that occur for clients with higher risks of increased medical utilization present in a risk adjusted system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldman | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Leibowitz | first2 = A. Buchanan | last3 = Keesey | first3 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Redistributional Consequences of Community Rating | journal = Health Services Research | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 71–86 | pmc=1070170 | pmid=9108805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman et al. conducted a study in California that trialed such clusters of insured clients by pooling at the state level, regional level, and metropolitan level.  Results from California’s experiment with such a system conclude that the larger the areas pooled, the greater the transfer of costs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another challenge to community based rating systems is that lower income neighborhoods with lower healthcare utilization subsidize the healthcare cost of higher income communities that tend to have higher healthcare expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Dubay, L.C., Lebrun, L.A., (2012) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23367796 Health, behavior, and health care disparities: disentangling the effects of income and race in the United States.] Int j Health Serv. 42(4):607–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The health exchange system will not be the only place where community rating systems are utilized.  [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) (CMS) plans to initiate a modified rating system starting in January 2014,&lt;ref&gt;Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan. (Nov 20, 2012). [http://www.bcbsm.com/content/microsites/health-care-reform/en/reform-alerts/cms-issues-proposed-rule-modified-community-rating.html CMS issues rule: modified community rating.]&lt;/ref&gt; this may lead other insurance companies following suit.

Due to the results of the California experiment and the widespread use of community based rating systems being initiated, it is imperative that some kind of subsidies be used for low income families. Otherwise, these families may be more likely to avoid insurance due to higher premium costs.&lt;ref&gt;Grau, J., Giesa, K., (2009, December). [http://www.oliverwyman.com/media/YBS009-11-28_PPACA120309.pdf Patient Protection and Affordable Care act on costs in the individual and small-employer health insurance markets.] Oliver Wyman.&lt;/ref&gt; This result would be counter intuitive to the goals of implementing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in the U.S. healthcare system.

==Use of drugs for chronic illness when co-payments are doubled==
Data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) revealed that [[chronic illness]] affected 133 million people in the United States and accounted for seven out of ten deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chronic diseases. The power to prevent, the call to control: at a glance 2009. Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In relationship to these numbers, the American Society of Health System Pharmacists  say Americans spent $307.5 billion on pharmaceuticals in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.ajhp.org/DocLibrary/Advocacy&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Goldman, Joyce, Escarce, Pace, Soloman, Laouri, Landsman, and Teutsch (2001) studied the purchasing behavior of drugs used to treat eight chronic illnesses: diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, depression, allergies, arthritis, and stomach ulcers. This retrospective study presents a strong correlation between co-payment levels and medication use for these chronic illnesses. The study illustrated the change in consumption behaviors based on plan generosity and structure such as coinsurance rates and mandatory generic substitution.&lt;ref name="Goldman, D. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldman | first1 = D. | last2 = Joyce | first2 = G. | last3 = Escarce | first3 = J. | last4 = Pace | first4 = J. | last5 = Soloman | first5 = M. | last6 = Laouri | first6 = M. | last7 = Landsman | first7 = P. | last8 = Teutsch | first8 = S. | year = 2001 | title = Pharmacy benefits and the use of drugs by the chronically ill | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 291 | issue = 19| pages = 2344–2350 | doi=10.1001/jama.291.19.2344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study by Goldman et al. (2001) predicts there would be a significant decrease in medication utilization in all of the chronic disease categories examined when co-payments were doubled. However, of note, the researchers discovered that patients respond discriminatorily to changes in co-payment and are less likely to reduce consumption of disease specific medications and will reduce pharmacy spending in other medications.&lt;ref name="Goldman, D. 2001"/&gt;
Goldman, et al. (2001) exposed the largest decrease in drug spending when co-payments were doubled were in medications to treat arthritis and allergies.

The study revealed that patients with diabetes decreased their purchase of diabetes drugs the most compared to the other chronic illnesses examined when their co-payments doubled.&lt;ref name="Goldman, D. 2001"/&gt;

The research by Goldman et al. (2001) reveals two points that could inform public policy related to pharmaceutical expenditures. One, consumption of over-the-counter drugs to treat allergies and arthritis are highly influenced by out of pocket spending. Two, diabetes patients may choose lifestyle behavior changes when faced with higher drug costs.&lt;ref&gt;Folland, S, Goodman, A., and Stano, M. (2010). The economics of health and health care. (6th ed). Boston, MA. Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

Before changing payment structures, more research will be needed to examine adverse health consequences in the chronically ill if pharmaceutical interventions are limited by increasing out of pocket expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Soumerai, S. and Ross-Degnan. (1999, March 4). Inadequate prescription-drug coverage for medicare enrollees – a call to action. New England Journal of Medicine. 340. 722–728&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, emergency department utilization could rise in response to these changes.

The results of the study by Goldman et al. (2001) could inform public policy on ways to decrease excess drug usage when the benefits are less than the cost of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lexchin | first1 = J. | last2 = Grootendorst | first2 = P. | year = 2004 | title = Effects of prescription drug user fees on drug and health services use and on health status in vulnerable populations: a systematic review of the evidence | url = | journal = International Journal of Health Services | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 101–122 | doi=10.2190/4m3e-l0yf-w1td-ekg0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a '''previous [[caesarean section]]''' a subsequent [[pregnancy]] can be planned beforehand to be [[childbirth|delivered]] by either of the following two main methods:
*'''Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)'''
*'''[[Elective surgery|Elective]] repeat caesarean section (ERCS)'''

Both have higher risks than a vaginal birth with no previous caesarean section. There are many issues which affect the decision for planned vaginal or planned abdominal delivery. There is a slightly higher risk for uterine rupture and [[perinatal death]] of the child with VBAC than ERCS, but the absolute increased risk of these complications is small, especially with only one previous low transverse caesarean section.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt; 60–80% of women planning VBAC will achieve a successful vaginal delivery, although there are more risks to the mother and baby from an unplanned caesarean section than from an ERCS.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"/&gt; Successful VBAC also reduces the risk of complications in future pregnancies than ERCS.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"/&gt;

==Technique==
Where the woman is labouring with a previous section scar (i.e. a planned VBAC in labour), depending on the provider, special precautions may be recommended. These include intravenous access (a cannula into the vein) and continuous fetal monitoring (cardiotocography or CTG monitoring of the fetal heart rate with transducers on the mother's abdomen). Most women in the UK should be counselled to avoid induction of labour if there are no medical reasons for it, as the risks of uterine rupture of the previous scar are increased if the labour is induced. Other intrapartum management options, including analgesia/anesthesia, are identical to those of any labour and vaginal delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/syntheses/printView.aspx?id=25231 |title=Guideline Synthesis: Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=National Guideline Clearinghouse |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320064948/http://www.guideline.gov/syntheses/printView.aspx?id=25231 |archive-date=2012-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ERCS, the choice of skin incision should determined by what seems to be most beneficial for the present operation, regardless of the choice of the previous location as seen by its scar, although the vast majority of surgeons will incise through the previous scar to optimise the cosmetic result. Hypertrophic (very thick or unsightly) scars are best excised because it gives a better cosmetic result and is associated with improved [[wound healing]]. On the other hand, keloid scars should have their margins left without any incision because of risk of tissue reaction in the subsequent scar.&lt;ref name="LanneauMuffley2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lanneau|first1=Grainger S.|last2=Muffley|first2=Patrick|last3=Magann|first3=Everett F.|title=Cesarean Birth: Surgical Techniques|journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine|year=2009|issn=1756-2228|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
The choice of VBAC or ERCS depends on many issues: medical and obstetric indications, maternal choice and availability of provider and birth setting ([[hospital]], [[birthing center]], or home). Some commonly employed criteria include:&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"/&gt;

According to the American Pregnancy Association, 90% of women who have undergone caesarean deliveries are candidates for planned VBAC because there are no obvious antenatal reasons for them as individuals why planned ERCS is safer.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |title=Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) |publisher=American Pregnancy Association |accessdate=2012-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621050450/http://www.americanpregnancy.org/labornbirth/vbac.html |archivedate=2012-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors favoring VBAC===
*If the previous caesarean(s) involved a low transverse incision there is less risk of uterine rupture than if there was a low vertical incision, classical incision, T-shaped, inverted T-shaped, or J-shaped incision.
*A previous successful vaginal delivery (before or after the caesarean section) increases the chances of a successful VBAC.
*The indication for the previous caesarean section should not be present in the current pregnancy.
*Location at an institution equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care.&lt;ref name=acogguide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374#s23 |title=Guideline on Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery: Major Recommendations |publisher=guideline.gov |author=American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115203439/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374#s23 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors favoring ERCS===
*The more caesarean sections that a woman has had, the less likely she will be eligible for VBAC. VBAC after two or more prior lower uterine segment transverse CS is controversial. The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] recommends that women with a prior history of even two previous uncomplicated low transverse Caesarean sections, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy at term, with no contraindication for vaginal birth, may be considered suitable for planned VBAC.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;
*The presence of [[twins]] may reduce the chance of successful VBAC, but if the leading twin is head first (cephalic presentation) and there are no other reasons to recommend caesarean section, VBAC should be offered.
*VBAC may be discouraged if there are other medical complications but this will require an individualised assessment and discussion between the woman and her obstetrician.

According to ACOG guidelines, the following criteria may reduce the likelihood of VBAC success but should NOT preclude a trial of labour: having two prior caesarean sections, suspected [[fetal macrosomia]] at term (fetus greater than 4000-4500&amp;nbsp;grams in weight), gestation beyond 40 weeks, twin gestation, and previous low vertical or unknown previous incision type, provided a classical uterine incision is not suspected.&lt;ref&gt;ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 115, August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria where ERCS should be performed===
The presence of any of the following practically always mean that ERCS will be performed - but this decision should always be discussed with a senior obstetrician:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Queensland Maternity |author2=Neonatal Clinical Guidelines Program |title=Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Clinical Guideline: Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC)| date=November 2009 |url=http://www.health.qld.gov.au/qcg/documents/g_vbac5-1.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Maternal request for elective repeat CS after counselling
*Maternal or fetal reasons to avoid vaginal birth in current pregnancy
*Previous uterine incision other than transverse segment including classical (longitudinal). The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] recommends that women with a prior history of one classical (longitudinal) caesarean section should give birth by elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS).&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt; 
*Unknown previous uterine incision
*Previous uterine rupture
*Previous hysterotomy or myomectomy where the uterine cavity was breached

==VBAC versus no previous Caesarean section==
VBAC, compared to vaginal birth without a history of Caesarean section, confers an increased risks for [[placenta previa]], [[placenta accreta]], prolonged labor, [[antepartum hemorrhage]], [[uterine rupture]], [[preterm birth]], [[low birth weight]], and [[stillbirth]]. However, some risks may be due to confounding factors related to the indication for the first caesarean, rather than due to the procedure itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennare R, Tucker G, Heard A, Chan A | title = Risks of adverse outcomes in the next birth after a first cesarean delivery | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 109 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 270–6 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17267823 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000250469.23047.73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes in VBAC versus ERCS==
VBAC and ERCS differ in outcomes on many end-points.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) states that VBAC is associated with decreased [[maternal morbidity]] and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies than ERCS.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"&gt;{{cite journal|last=American Congress of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=ACOG Practice bulletin no. 115: Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=Aug 2010|volume=116|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=450–63|pmid=20664418|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uterine rupture===
A caesarean section leaves a scar in the wall of the [[uterus]] which is considered weaker than the normal uterine wall. A VBAC carries a risk of [[uterine rupture]] of 22–74/10,000. There is virtually no risk of uterine rupture in women undergoing ERCS (i.e. a section before the onset of labour).&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt; If a uterine rupture does occur, the risk of perinatal death is approximately 6%.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt; Mothers with a previous lower uterine segment cesarean are considered the best candidates for VBAC, as that region of the uterus is under less physical stress during labor and delivery.

===Risks to the child===
A VBAC carries a 2–3/10,000 additional risk of birth-related [[perinatal death]] when compared with ERCS.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt; The absolute risk of such birth-related perinatal loss is comparable to the risk for women having their first birth.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt; Planned VBAC carries an 8/10,000 risk of the child developing [[hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy]], but the long-term outcome of the infant with HIE is unknown and related to many factors.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;

On the other hand, attempting VBAC reduces the risk that the child will have respiratory problems after birth such as [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]] (IRDS), as rates are estimated at 2–3% with planned VBAC and 3–4% with ERCS.&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;

===Conversion from planned VBAC to Caesarean===
Of the women who have previously had a Caesarean, only about 8% of them will opt for a VBAC. However, of the 8% that opt for a VBAC, between 75%-80% will successfully give birth vaginally, which is comparable to the overall vaginal delivery rate in the United States in 2010.&lt;ref name="americanpregnancy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mayoclinic"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vbac/VB99999 Vaginal birth after C-section (VBAC) guide], [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db35.htm#ref1 |title=NCHS Data Brief: Recent Trends in Cesarean Delivery in the United States Products |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chance of having a successful VBAC is decreased by the following factors:&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;
*[[Labor induction]]
*No previous vaginal birth
*[[Body mass index]] greater than 30
*Previous caesarean for [[obstructed labour]] 
*No [[epidural anaesthesia]]
*Previous preterm caesarean birth
*[[Cervical dilation]] at admission to labour ward less than 4&amp;nbsp;cm
*Less than 2 years from previous caesarean birth
*[[Advanced maternal age]]
*Non-white ethnicity
*Short stature 
*Male infant
*Support from hospital, care provider, and staff
When the first four factors are present, successful VBAC is achieved in only 40% of cases. In contrast, in women with a previous caesarean section who have had a subsequent vaginal birth, the chance of a successful vaginal birth again is estimated at 87–90%.&lt;ref name=rcog2007&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |title=Birth After Previous Caesarean Birth, Green-top Guideline No. 45 |date=February 2007 |website= |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207031819/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg4511022011.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risks in future pregnancies===
ERCS, as compared to VBAC, further increases the risks of complications in future pregnancies. Complications whose risks significantly increase with increasing number of repeated caesarean sections include:&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;
*[[Placenta accreta]], estimated to be present in 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 2.1%, 2.3% and 6.7% of women undergoing their first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth or more caesarean sections, respectively. According to the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, "Abnormal placentation has been associated with both maternal and neonatal morbidity including need for antepartum hospitalization, preterm delivery, emergent caesarean delivery, [[hysterectomy]], blood transfusion, surgical injury, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and fetal and maternal death and may be life-threatening for mother and baby."&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"/&gt;
*[[Hysterectomy]], estimated to be performed in 0.7%, 0.4%, 0.9%, 2.4%, 3.5% and 9.0% of women undergoing their first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth or more caesarean sections, respectively
*Injury to [[urinary bladder|bladder]], bowel or [[ureter]]
*Ileus
*The need for postoperative ventilation
*[[Intensive care unit]] admission
*[[Blood transfusion]] requirement, estimated at 7%, 8% and 14% with a history of two, three and five caesarean births, respectively.
*Duration of operative time and hospital stay.

===Other===
Aside from uterine rupture risk, the drawbacks of VBAC are usually minor and identical to those of any vaginal delivery, including the risk of [[perineal tearing]]. Maternal morbidity, [[Neonatal intensive care unit|NICU]] admissions, length of hospital stay, and medical costs are typically reduced following a VBAC rather than a repeat caesarean delivery.

A VBAC, compared with ERCS, carries around 1% additional risk of either [[blood transfusion]] (mainly because of [[antepartum hemorrhage]]), postpartum haemorrhage or [[endometritis]].&lt;ref name=rcog2007/&gt;

==Society and culture==
While vaginal births after caesarean (VBAC) are not uncommon today, the rate of VBAC has declined to include less than 10% of births after previous caesarean in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Priorcesareanbirths_1134/Profile/Data |title=Cesarean births, repeat (percent)—Health Indicators Warehouse |publisher=Healthindicators.gov |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Childbirth Connection 2008"&gt;[http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/cesarean-section-trends.pdf "Rates for Total Cesarean Section, Primary Cesarean Section and Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Section (VBAC), United States, 1989–2006."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217122109/http://www.childbirthconnection.org/pdfs/cesarean-section-trends.pdf |date=February 17, 2013 }} [http://www.childbirthconnection.org/aboutus.asp Childbirth Connection], 2008. Retrieved 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although caesarean deliveries made up only 5% of births overall in the USA until the mid-1970s, it was commonly believed that for women with previous caesarean sections, "Once a Caesarean, always a Caesarean". A consumer-driven movement supporting VBAC changed medical practice and led to soaring rates of VBAC in the 1980s and early 1990s, but rates of VBAC dramatically dropped after the publication of a highly publicized scientific study showing worse outcomes for VBACs as compared to repeat caesarean and the resulting medicolegal changes within obstetrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McMahon MJ, Luther ER, Bowes WA, Olshan AF | title = Comparison of a Trial of Labor with an Elective Second Cesarean Section | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 335 | issue = 10 | pages = 689–695 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8703167 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199609053351001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology all released statements in support of increasing VBAC access and rates.&lt;ref name="consensus.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/vbacuptp.htm |title=Vaginal Birth After Cesarean: New Insights: Structured Abstract |publisher=Ahrq.gov |date=16 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/press_releases/nr07-21-10-1.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723112411/http://www.acog.org/from_home/publications/press_releases/nr07-21-10-1.cfm |date=July 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=26 |title=Maternal, Infant, and Child Health—Healthy People |publisher=Healthypeople.gov |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trends in the United States===
Although caesarean sections made up only 5% of all deliveries in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00036845.htm#00001044.htm |title=Rates of Cesarean Delivery - United States, 1993 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; among women who did have primary caesarean sections, the century-old opinion held, "Once a caesarean, always a caesarean." Overall, cesarean sections became so commonplace that the caesarean delivery rate climbed to over 31% in 2006.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"/&gt;  A mother-driven movement supporting VBAC changed standard medical practice, and rates of VBAC rose in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, a major turning point occurred in 1996 when one well publicized study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' reported that vaginal delivery after previous caesarean section resulted in more [[Childbirth#Maternal complications|maternal complications]] than a repeat caesarean delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparison of a trial of labor with an elective second cesarean section |journal=New England Journal of Medicine | date=September 1996 |pages=689–95 |pmid=8703167 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199609053351001 |volume=335 |issue=10 |vauthors=McMahon MJ, Luther ER, Bowes WA, Olshan AF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology subsequently issued guidelines which identified VBAC as a high-risk delivery requiring the availability of an [[anesthesiologist]], an [[obstetrician]], and an operating room on standby.&lt;ref&gt;Int J Gyn Obs; 1999; vol 66, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Logistical and legal (professional liability) concerns led many hospitals to enact overt or de facto VBAC bans. As a result, the rate at which VBAC was attempted fell from 26% in the early 1990s to 8.5% in 2006.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Priorcesareanbirths_1134/Profile/Data |title=Cesarean births, repeat (percent) |publisher=Health Indicators Warehouse |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[National Institutes of Health]] met to consolidate and discuss the overall up-to-date body of VBAC scientific data and concluded, "Given the available evidence, trial of labor is a reasonable option for many pregnant women with one prior low transverse uterine incision.".&lt;ref name="consensus.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consensus.nih.gov/2010/vbacstatement.htm |title=NIH Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) Conference - Panel Statement |publisher=NIH Consensus Development Program |date=March 8–10, 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] reported that VBAC is a reasonable and safe choice for the majority of women with prior caesarean and that there is emerging evidence of serious harms relating to multiple caesareans.&lt;ref name="ahrq.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/vbacuptp.htm |title=Vaginal Birth After Cesarean: New Insights |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) similarly revised their own guidelines to be less restrictive of VBAC, stating, "Attempting a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is a safe and appropriate choice for most women who have had a prior cesarean delivery, including for some women who have had two previous cesareans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2010/Ob_Gyns_Issue_Less_Restrictive_VBAC_Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; and this is also the current position of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK.

Enhanced access to VBAC has been recommended based on the most recent scientific data on the safety of VBAC as compared to repeat caesarean section, including the following recommendation emerging from the NIH VBAC conference panel in March 2010, "We recommend that hospitals, maternity care providers, health care and professional liability insurers, consumers, and policymakers collaborate on the development of integrated services that could mitigate or even eliminate current barriers to trial of labor."&lt;ref name="consensus.nih.gov"/&gt; The U.S Department of Health and Human Services' [[Healthy People|Healthy People 2020]] initiative includes objectives to reduce the primary caesarean rate and to increase the VBAC rate by at least 10% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/objectiveslist.aspx?topicId=26 |title=2020 Topics &amp; Objectives: Maternal, Infant, and Child Health |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |date= |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) modified the guidelines on vaginal birth after previous Caesarean delivery in 1999, 2004, and again in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374 |title=Guideline on Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery |publisher=guideline.gov |author=American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115203439/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, this modification to the guideline included the addition of the following recommendation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because uterine rupture may be catastrophic, VBAC should be attempted in institutions equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care.&lt;ref name=acogguide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374#s23 |title=Guideline on Vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery: Major Recommendations |publisher=guideline.gov |author=American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) |accessdate=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115203439/http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?view_id=1&amp;doc_id=6374#s23 |archive-date=2008-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 2010, ACOG modified these guidelines again to express more encouragement of VBAC, but maintained it should still be undertaken at facilities capable of emergency care, though patient autonomy in assuming increased levels of risk should be respected (ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 115, August 2010).

The recommendation for access to emergency care during trial of labor has, in some cases, had a major impact on the availability of VBACs to birthing mothers in the US. For example, a study of the change in frequency of VBAC deliveries in California after the change in guidelines, published in 2006, found the VBAC rate fell to 13.5% after the change, compared with 24% VBAC rate before the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zweifler J, Garza A, Hughes S, Stanich MA, Hierholzer A, Lau M | title = Vaginal birth after cesarean in California: before and after a change in guidelines | journal = Ann Fam Med | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–34 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16735524 | pmc = 1479438 | doi = 10.1370/afm.544 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new recommendation has been interpreted by many hospitals as indicating a full surgical team must be standing by to perform a Caesarean section for the full duration of a VBAC woman's labor. Hospitals that prohibit VBACs entirely are said to have a 'VBAC ban'. In these situations, birthing mothers are forced to choose between having a repeat Caesarean section, finding an alternate hospital in which to deliver their babies or attempting delivery outside the hospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-08-23-csection-battle_x.htm |title=Battle lines drawn over C-sections |publisher=USA Today |author=Rita Rubin |accessdate=2008-02-09 | date=24 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, enhanced access to VBAC has been recommended based on updated scientific data on the safety of VBAC as compared to repeat caesarean section, including the following recommendation emerging from the NIH VBAC conference panel in March 2010, "We recommend that hospitals, maternity care providers, health care and professional liability insurers, consumers, and policymakers collaborate on the development of integrated services that could mitigate or even eliminate current barriers to trial of labor."&lt;ref name="consensus.nih.gov"/&gt; The U.S Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative includes objectives to reduce the primary cesarean rate and to increase the VBAC rate by at least 10% each.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"/&gt;

=== Position statements ===
ACOG recommends that obstetricians offer most women with one prior cesarean section with a low-transverse incision a trial of labor (TOLAC) and that obstetricians should discuss the risks and benefits of VBAC with these patients.&lt;ref name="American Congress of Obstetricians and 450–63"/&gt;

[[File:Facebow.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Skull model fitted with a face bow]]
A '''face-bow''' is a dental instrument used in the field of [[prosthodontics]]. Its purpose is to transfer functional and aesthetic components from patient's mouth to the dental [[articulator]]. Specifically, it transfers the relationship of maxillary arch and temporomandibular joint to the casts. It records the upper model's (maxilla) relationship to the External Acoustic Meatus, in the hinge axis. It aids in mounting maxillary cast on the articulator.

== Parts of Face-bow ==
'''U-shaped frame''' - forms the main part of the frame with remaining components attached to it by clamps. Frame extends from the region of TMJ or external acoustic meatus to a distance of 2-3 inches in front of the face&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987028410|title=Concise Prosthodontics- E Book : Prep Manual for Undergraduates|last=Vijay|first=Prakash,|others=Gupta, Ruchi|isbn=9788131249338|edition=2nd|oclc=987028410}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Condylar rods''' – are positioned 13 mm anterior to the auditory meatus on the Canto-Tragal line. This placement generally locates the rods within 5 mm of the true centre of the opening hinge axis of the jaw&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Bite fork''' – consist of stem and prongs. Wax material is usually attached to the bite fork, and the bite fork is held in contact with maxillary jaw or mandibular jaw in kinematic face-bow&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Locking device''' – helps to attach the bite fork to the U-shaped frame&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

'''Orbital pointer with clamp''' – used as a third reference point. The pointer tip is placed in the contact with infraorbital notch which is 43 mm above the incisal edge of the right incisors&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Types==

* Kinematic Face-bow - It orients jaw to actual hinge axis
* Arbitrary Face-bow - It orients maxilla on an arbitrary hinge axis
** Facia Type (With orbital indicator)
** Ear Piece Type (With nasal relator)
** Hanau face-to-face (spring bow) 
** Slidematic (Denar) {{clarify |date=October 2017 |reason= it is not clear what "Denar" means here}}
** Twirl bow
** Whipmix

==History==
[[George B. Snow]] is credited as the inventor of face-bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wongsen|first1=Thure|title=The face-bow, its significance and application|journal=The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry|date=Sep 1953|volume=3|issue=5|pages=618–630|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0022391353900572/1-s2.0-0022391353900572-main.pdf?_tid=6c8d5012-b189-11e4-9dc9-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1423616631_4941b09de3b99b2ab087cf1fd51b5e05|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his version of face-bow, he positioned the plaster cast in the articulator in respect to distance of median incisal point from the condyles and all the other points on the occlusal plane. Snow attempted to give the occlusal plane an individual position also in this third dimension : and in order to achieve this he set about as follows. He fixed his bite-fork in the upper occlusion rim in such away that the handle, when the rim was placed in the patient’s mouth. was parallel with a plane extending from the bottom of the glenoid fossa and passing through the anterior nasal spine. This plane cannot be determined directly on a living person; but it approximately corresponds with a line drawn from the upper part of the tragus to the lower edge of the nostril. In American literature, this plane is known as the [[Bromell plane]], in Europe as the [[Camper plane]]. Snow then placed the bite-fork horizontally when the casts were mounted in the articulator.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The '''Finnish Red Cross''' ('''FRC''', {{lang-fi|Suomen Punainen Risti}}, {{lang-sv|Finlands Röda Kors}}) is an independent member of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], which is one of the biggest and best-known international organisations in the world and in the field of [[humanitarian aid]]. FRC has over 90,000 members and around 45,000 active [[volunteering|volunteers]] in [[Finland]]. FRC consists of 12 regional chapters and 550 local branches throughout the country. The current [[Secretary General|General Secretary]] is Ms. Kristiina Kumpula. At the end of 2006, the FRC employed 1,168 people, of which 136 worked at the headquarters in [[Helsinki]].

The Finnish Red Cross is based on [[volunteering]] and has branches in almost every [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]] in Finland. The [[organisational structure]] has three layers: local branches, regional chapters, and the national headquarters. [[volunteering|Volunteers]] are important decision-makers at every level.  At the local level, the activities of the branches are determined to a large part by how dedicated their members are.

==History of the Finnish Red Cross==

Finnish Red Cross was founded on May 7, 1877 to care for the wounded and sick soldiers of the [[Guard Jaeger Regiment|Finnish Guard]] in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo–Turkish War]]. The FRC was recognized by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] in 1920 and became a member of [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]] in 1922, when [[Finland]] ratified the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/Pays?ReadForm&amp;c=FI| title=  ICRC – International Humanitarian Law – Treaties &amp; Documents – Finland| year= 2005 | publisher= International Committee of the Red Cross| accessdate= 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 the FRC took the operational responsibility of the [[blood transfusion]] services in [[Finland]], which had been operated by the [[The Guides and Scouts of Finland|Finnish Scouts]] since 1935. The FRC transfusion service is a legally independent organization.

==Domestic operations==
The Blood Transfusion Service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veripalvelu.redcross.fi/asp/system/empty.asp?P=161&amp;VID=default&amp;SID=287256813915995&amp;S=0&amp;C=23366 Veripalvelu.redcross.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; complements the [[health care|national health services]] and is at the same time an important component of FRC's overall structure.

The FRC also runs a national [[AIDS]] helpline and organises [[civil society campaign|campaigns]]. In addition, it trains and finds support persons for [[HIV infection|HIV infected]] and their families.

Finnish Red Cross [[Drug]] and [[Alcohol]] programme includes prevention work and early intervention. FRC has [[volunteering|volunteers]] who act as [[rehabilitation counseling|counsellors]] in schools and other communities in their own expertise. At the summertime they will be on call almost at hundred of festivals discussing intoxicant use.

The FRC holds a [[fundraiser]] known as Hunger Day&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.fi/ajankohtaista/kampanjatjakeraykset/nalkapaiva/ Nälkäpäivä Redcross.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; every autumn, usually in September. The [[civil society campaign|campaign]] has an annual theme; in 2006 people were reminded how [[desertification]], [[flood]]ing and [[storms]] most affect the children under five years of age. On the day volunteer fundraisers can be seen in front of [[grocery stores]] and other public places. In schools [[school dinner|school meals]] can be reduced and served, for example, without [[salad]], [[bread]] or [[milk]].

The FRC trains over 80,000 people yearly on the [[first aid]] and [[CPR]] courses for the [[general public]] and [[company|companies]]. FRC has more than 550 [[first aid]] groups around the country with more than 8,000 volunteers. These groups are on duty daily in the majority of public events in [[Finland]]. They can also help in [[search and rescue]] when requested by the authorities. FRC also coordinates the Voluntary Rescue Service which is formed by over 40 [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|civic organisations]] and over 30,000 volunteers.

The FRC has a national emergency group of psychologists which organises and coordinates psycho-social support in situations they are needed, for example after the [[Jokela school shooting]].

FRC's Disaster Relief Fund is used to give assistance in accidents and due to social reasons. Domestic aid was about [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 3.6 million (USD 955,000) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.redcross.fi/en_GB/| title=  Finnish Red Cross – From People to People| year= 2007 | publisher= The Finnish Red Cross| accessdate= 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finnish Red Cross youth==
The organisation also has youth programs and youth based operations. Members between 13–29 years of age compose 10% of all members and operate on all levels of the organisation. 
It was decided in the Finnish Red Cross 2008 national meeting that youth work will be supported also in the future, and that the goal for 2011 is to gain 5% more youth members.

==International operations==

On left, a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[squad]] training (part of the activities of National Defence Training Association of Finland, on the right, a joint exercise of the voluntary rescue organization and the Finnish Red Cross with the police and [[fire department]]s.]]

The Finnish Red Cross gives [[humanitarian aid|international aid]] – [[personnel]], [[funds]], material – in response to appeals from the [[IFRC|International Movement]]. There are two main sources for funds: FRC's Disaster Relief Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.fi/lahjoita/katastrofirahasto/en_GB/disasterrelieffund/ Redcross.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Finnish government]]. In recent years, the [[European Union]] has also provided funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.redcross.fi/en_GB/| title=  Finnish Red Cross – From Disaster Relief and Development Cooperation| year= 2007 | publisher= The Finnish Red Cross| accessdate= 2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disaster relief is given to victims of [[war]], [[War|conflict]] and [[natural disasters]]. Development cooperation improves the capacities and [[disaster preparedness]] of newly established sister [[societies]] or those with fewer resources. The FRC maintains its own [[Logistics]] Centre and International [[Personnel]] Reserve in [[Finland]]. The Disaster Relief Fund provides [[funds]] when needed. [[Funds]] are collected continuously and preferably as non-[[Earmark (finance)|earmarked]].

FRC's International [[Personnel]] Reserve comprises about 600 [[professionals]] trained on FRC's basic and further training courses. Approx. 100 of them work in international assignments every year.

FRC is also a member organisation of the [[European Council on Refugees and Exiles|European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE)]] and [[Reuters|Reuter's AlertNet]] network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">Health in Anguilla is managed by the [[Health Authority of Anguilla]], an agency of the [[Government of Anguilla]].

==Storm damage==
Health facilities were devastated in 2017 as a result of [[Hurricane Irma]]. Immediate medical support was provided by the [[Pan American Health Organization]] and [[Direct Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hurricane Irma: One Year Later |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/anguilla/hurricane-irma-one-year-later |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Reliefweb |date=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government and charitable donations have contributed towards the rebuilding program.  [[Tim Foy]] says "The United Kingdom government is committed to the full rehabilitation of the [[Princess Alexandra Hospital (Anguilla)|Princess Alexandra Hospital]]".

==Healthcare==
In November 2018 it established a charitable foundation, the Health Authority of Anguilla Foundation, which is to be registered in [[Delaware]] as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] which will allow tax-free contributions from donors in the USA.  This is intended to help close "the gap between the health needs and desires of the community and the capacity to meet these needs and desires".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Authority of Anguilla lays out purpose and goals of its Foundation |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82450-health-authority-of-anguilla-lays-out-purpose-and-goals-of-its-foundation |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People on the island often use health facilities on [[St. Maarten]].  Their access to the British [[NHS]] is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Video: Fergusson Speaks To British Committee |url=http://bernews.com/2018/10/video-fergusson-speaks-to-british-committee/ |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=BerNews |date=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are concerns about the effect of [[Brexit]] on access to medicine and medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cluff in Anguilla for opening of maternity ward at hospital |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82878-cluff-in-anguilla-for-opening-of-maternity-ward-at-hospital |accessdate=29 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Health and Social Development]] employed Dr. Olufunmike Banks-Devonish as a Clinical Psychologist in November 2018, the first full-time [[clinical psychologist]] to be employed by the [[Anguilla Public Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministry of Health welcomes clinical psychologist to its staff |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82283-ministry-of-health-welcomes-clinical-psychologist-to-its-staff |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water==
Water supply is the responsibility of the [[Water Corporation of Anguilla]], which entered into a 10 year contract with Seven Seas Water, a subsidiary of [[AquaVenture Holdings Limited]] in October 2018 for the supply of  500 thousand gallons per day, due to expand to 750 thousand gallons per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seven Seas Water Announces Execution of Water Agreement in Anguilla |url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seven-seas-water-announces-execution-of-water-agreement-in-anguilla-300724818.html |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=PR Newswire |date=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing of water on the island is done by the  [[St. Maarten]] Laboratory Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SLS is preparing to extend food analysis |url=https://www.thedailyherald.sx/islands/82562-sls-is-preparing-to-extend-food-analysis |accessdate=14 November 2018 |publisher=Daily Herald |date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hearing level''' is the [[sound pressure]] level produced by an [[audiometer]] at a specific frequency. It is measured in [[decibel]]s with reference to audiometric zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Audiogram|url=http://www.vanasch.school.nz/pdfs/audiogram.pdf|publisher=VanAsh Deaf Education Center|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing of speech is considered to be impaired   when the hearing level is shifted 25 dB or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truax|first=Barry|title=Hearing level|url=https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Hearing_Level.html|work=Handbook for acoustic ecology|publisher=SFA|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue-light hazard==
'''Blue-light hazard''' is defined as the potential for a [[photochemical]]ly-induced [[retina]]l injury resulting from electromagnetic [[Non-ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] at wavelengths primarily between 400 and {{nowrap|450 nm.}} This study has not been done in humans, only inconclusively in some rodent, primate, and in vitro studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=American National Standard Institute/ Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|title=ANSI/IESNA RP-27.1-05: Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety for Lamp and Lamp Systems – General Requirements|date=10 June 2007|url=https://www.iesna.org/shop/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815023605/https://www.iesna.org/shop/|archivedate=15 August 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms for photochemically-induced retinal injury are caused by the absorption of light by [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the eye. Under normal conditions when light hits a photoreceptor, the cell bleaches and becomes useless until it has recovered through a metabolic process called the [[visual cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Williams TP, Howell WL |title=Action spectrum of retinal light-damage in albino rats |journal=Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=285–7 |date=March 1983 |pmid=6832904 |url=http://www.iovs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6832904 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525164412/http://www.iovs.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6832904 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1990.tb01972.x |vauthors=Pautler EL, Morita M, Beezley D |title=Hemoprotein(s) mediate blue light damage in the retinal pigment epithelium |journal=Photochem.

Absorption of blue light, however, has been shown in rats and a susceptible strain of mice to cause a reversal of the process where cells become unbleached and responsive again to light before they are ready. At wavelengths of blue light below 430&amp;nbsp;nm this greatly increases the potential for oxidative damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Grimm C, Wenzel A, Williams T, Rol P, Hafezi F, Remy C |title=Rhodopsin-mediated blue-light damage to the rat retina: effect of photoreversal of bleaching |journal=Invest.

"1-2 min of 408 nm and 25 minutes of 430 nm are sufficient to cause irreversible death of photoreceptors and lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. ... The action spectrum of light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells was found to peak at approximately 450 nm, a range with lower damage potential, yet not completely outside the damaging range."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Remy C|title=Blue Light and the Retina: Good and Bad?|journal=Soc Light Treatment Biol Rhythms|volume=Abstracts 2005, 17:46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study found that [[LED]]s cause retinal damage even in settings where they are used indirectly, such as household light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Tim |last=Lougheed |title=Hidden Blue Hazard?

An unpublished and non peer-reviewed 2013 in vitro study financed by skin care company [[Lipo Chemicals]] using shorter blue band spectrum LED lights claims that prolonged exposure may permanently damage the pigment epithelial cells of the retina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcimagazine.com/marketstrends/segments/suncare/Liposhield-HEV-Melanin-Protection-from-the-adverse-effects-of-High-Energy-Visible-HEV-Light-202523581.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a specialist, the test conditions were the equivalent of staring at a blue light equivalent to a 100 watt incandescent source from {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} for 12 hours, which is not deemed to be a realistic light exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/22749/led-lighting-damages-eyes-says-spanish-investigator LED lighting damages eyes, says Spanish investigator]. thinkSPAIN (10 May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032134/http://www.ozgled.com/en/displaynews.html?newsID=69834 Specialists question validity of LED eye damage study]. ozgled.com (27 Oct 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;.

A recent study has given more insight about the Blue light hazard: permanent damage to the eye cells, as reported by a research made by a team from Toledo University [https://www.wired.it/scienza/medicina/2018/08/09/luce-blu-danni-vista/], especially for children, who are big users of LED screen (smartphones,tablets...). However, the conclusion that  LED technology  would be more dangerous for retina than Tungsten lamp and fluorescent lamp is  debated, as the LED spectrum does not contain potentially retinotoxic violet light (to which a child's lens is highly transparent)  in contrary to spectra of fluorescent and incandescent lamps which are rich in violet light&lt;ref&gt; https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/features/blue-light-and-young-children-are-leds-more-harmful-than-other-lamp-technologies/ &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Blue-light therapy==

The '''history of medicine in the United States''' encompasses a variety of periods and approaches to [[health care in the United States]] from colonial days to the present, ranging from early folk remedies to the increasing professionalization and [[managed care]] of modern medicine.

==Colonial era==
Colonial era health care was based primarily on traditional medicines and traditional cures.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, ''Medicine in America: A short history'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 1991). pp 3-20&lt;/ref&gt; Professionalization was very slow before 1750, by which time there were a handful of cities of more than 20,000 population, each of which had physicians trained in England and Scotland, as well as a growing number of locally trained men. [[Cotton Mather]] of Boston was the first significant figure in American medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Otho T. Beall and Richard Harrison Shryock, ''Cotton Mather, first significant figure in American medicine'' (Johns Hopkins U.P. 1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease environment===
{{main|Disease in colonial America}}
Mortality was very high for new arrivals, and high for children in the colonial era.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Jo Tannenbaum, ''Health and Wellness in Colonial America'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Viets, "Some Features of the History of Medicine in Massachusetts during the Colonial Period, 1620-1770," ''Isis'' (1935), 23:389-405&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Malaria]] was deadly to many new arrivals. The disease environment was very hostile to European settlers, especially in all the Southern colonies. Malaria was endemic in the South, with very high mortality rates for new arrivals. Children born in the new world had some immunity—they suffered mild recurrent forms of malaria but survived.  For an example of newly arrived able-bodied young men, over one-fourth of the Anglican missionaries died within five years of their arrival in the Carolinas.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford J. Wood, "'A Constant Attendance on God's {{Not a typo|Alter}}': Death, Disease, and the Anglican Church in Colonial South Carolina, 1706-1750," ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'' (1999) 100#3 pp. 204-220 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27570385 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortality was high for infants and small children, especially from [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]], and malaria.  Most sick people turn to local healers, and used folk remedies. Others relied upon  the minister-physicians, barber-surgeons, apothecaries, midwives, and ministers; a few used colonial physicians trained either in Britain, or an apprenticeship in the colonies.  There was little government control, regulation of medical care, or attention to public health.  By the 18th century, Colonial physicians, following the models in England and Scotland, introduced modern medicine to the cities.  This allowed some advances in vaccination, pathology, anatomy and pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Shryock, "Eighteenth Century Medicine in America," ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'' (Oct 1949) 59#2 pp 275-292. [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44807198.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a fundamental difference in the human infectious diseases present in the indigenous peoples and that of sailors and explorers from Europe and Africa. Some viruses, like [[smallpox]], have only human hosts and appeared to have never occurred on the North American continent before 1492. The indigenous people lacked genetic resistance to such new infections, and suffered overwhelming mortality when exposed to smallpox, [[measles]], malaria, [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases.  The depopulation occurred years before the European settlers arrived in the vicinity and resulted from contact with trappers.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Crosby, "Virgin soil epidemics as a factor in the aboriginal depopulation in America." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1976): 289-299 [http://personal.tcu.edu/gsmith/GraduateCourse/Colonial%20PDF%20Articles/Crosby-Virgin.pdf online]; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1922166 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James D. Rice, "Beyond 'The Ecological Indian' and 'Virgin Soil Epidemics': New Perspectives on Native Americans and the Environment." ''History Compass'' (2014) 12#9 pp: 745-757.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical organization===
The city of New Orleans, Louisiana opened two hospitals in the early 1700s. The first was the Royal Hospital, which opened in 1722 as a small military infirmary, but grew to importance when the Ursuline Sisters took over the management of it in 1727 and made it a major hospital for the public, with a new and larger building built in 1734.  The other was the Charity Hospital, which was staffed by many of the same people but was established in 1736 as a supplement to the Royal Hospital so that the poorer classes (who usually could not afford treatment at the Royal Hospital) had somewhere to go.&lt;ref&gt;John Salvaggio, ''New Orleans' Charity Hospital: A Story of Physicians, Politics, and Poverty'' (1992) pp. 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most of the American colonies, medicine was rudimentary for the first few generations, as few upper-class British physicians emigrated to the colonies. The first medical society was organized in Boston in 1735.  In the 18th century, 117 Americans from wealthy families had graduated in medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, but most physicians learned as apprentices in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Miller, "A Physician in 1776," ''Clio Medica,'' Oct 1976, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 135-146&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia, the Medical College of Philadelphia was founded in 1765, and became affiliated with the university in 1791.  In New York, the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|medical department of King's College]] was established in 1767, and in 1770, awarded the first American M.D. degree.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed. ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (3 vol 1992) 1:214&lt;/ref&gt;

Smallpox inoculation was introduced 1716-1766, well before it was accepted in Europe. The first medical schools were established in Philadelphia in 1765 and New York in 1768. The first textbook appeared in 1775, though physicians had easy access to British textbooks.  The first pharmacopoeia appeared in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) pp 399-400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ola Elizabeth Winslow, ''A destroying angel: the conquest of smallpox in colonial Boston'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  The European populations had a historic exposure and partial immunity to smallpox, but the Native American populations did not, and their death rates were high enough for one epidemic to virtually destroy a small tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelton, ''Cherokee Medicine, Colonial Germs: An Indigenous Nation's Fight Against Smallpox, 1518–1824'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicians in port cities realized the need to quarantine sick sailors and passengers as soon as they arrived.  Pest houses for them were established in Boston (1717), Philadelphia (1742) Charleston (1752) and New York (1757). The first general hospital was established in Philadelphia in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Morris ''Encyclopedia of American History'' (1976) p 806.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness: The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) p 401&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women==
[[File:NYinfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|The Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. [Announcement, 1868-69].]]
In the colonial era, women played a major role in terms of healthcare, especially regarding midwives and childbirth. Local healers used herbal and folk remedies to treat friends and neighbors.  Published housekeeping guides included instructions in medical care and the preparation of common remedies.  Nursing was considered a female role.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Jo Tannenbaum, ''The Healer's Calling: Women and Medicine in Early New England'' (Cornell University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Babies were delivered at home without the services of a physician well into the 20th century, making the midwife a central figure in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Barrett Litoff,  "An historical overview of midwifery in the United States." ''Pre-and Peri-natal Psychology Journal'' 5.1 (1990): 5+ [https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1386989071/an-historical-overview-of-midwifery-in-the-united online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judy Barrett Litoff,  "Midwives and History." In Rima D. Apple, ed., ''The History of Women, Health, and Medicine in America: An Encyclopedic Handbook'' (Garland Publishing, 1990) covers the historiography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The professionalization of medicine, starting slowly in the early 19th century, included systematic efforts to minimize the role of untrained uncertified women and keep them out of new institutions such as hospitals and medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Morantz-Sanchez, ''Sympathy and science: Women physicians in American medicine'' (2005). pp 1-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctors===
In 1849 [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]  (1821–1910), an immigrant from England, graduated from Geneva Medical College in New York at the head of her class and thus became the first female doctor in America.  In 1857, she and her sister Emily, and their colleague Marie Zakrzewska, founded the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, the first American hospital run by women and the first dedicated to serving women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_36.html |title=Changing the Face of Medicine &amp;#124; Dr. Emily Blackwell |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;     Blackwell viewed medicine as a means for social and moral reform, while a younger pioneer [[Mary Putnam Jacobi]] (1842-1906) focused on curing disease. At a deeper level of disagreement, Blackwell felt that women would succeed in medicine because of their humane female values, but Jacobi believed that women should participate as the equals of men in all medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Morantz, "Feminism, Professionalism and Germs: The Thought of Mary Putnam Jacobi and Elizabeth Blackwell," ''American Quarterly'' (1982)  34:461-478. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2505415 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nursing===
{{main|History of nursing in the United States}}

Nursing became professionalized in the late 19th century, opening a new middle-class career for talented young women of all social backgrounds.  The School of Nursing at [[Harper University Hospital|Detroit's Harper Hospital]], begun in 1884, was a national leader.  Its graduates worked at the hospital and also in institutions, public health services, as private duty nurses, and volunteered for duty at military hospitals during the Spanish–American War and the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Schmeling, "Missionaries of Health: Detroit's Harper Hospital School of Nursing, ''Michigan History'' (2002) 86#1 pp 28-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major religious denominations were active in establishing hospitals in many cities.  Several Catholic orders of nuns specialized in nursing roles.  While most lay women got married and stopped, or became private duty nurses in the homes and private hospital rooms of the wealthy, the Catholic sisters had lifetime careers in the hospitals.  This enabled hospitals like [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital in New York]], where nurses from the [[Sisters of Charity]] began their work in 1849; patients of all backgrounds were welcome, but most came from the low-income Catholic population.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette McCauley, '' Who Shall Take Care of Our Sick?: Roman Catholic Sisters and the Development of Catholic Hospitals in New York City'' (2005)  [https://www.amazon.com/Who-Shall-Take-Care-Sick/dp/0801882168/ except and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infant mortality==
Infant mortality was the major component of life expectancy. Infant mortality was lower in America compared to other parts of the world because of better nutrition. The rates were higher in urban areas, and in Massachusetts statewide the rates increased as the state urbanized. Public health provisions involving sanitation, water supplies, and control of tuberculosis started showing effects by 1900. Public health conditions were worse in the South until the 1950s.

== Civil War ==
{{main|Medicine in the American Civil War}}

In the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), as was typical of the 19th century, more soldiers died of disease than in battle, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;George Worthington   Adams, ''Doctors in Blue: The Medical History of the Union Army in the Civil War'' (1996), [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0807121053/  excerpt and text search]; Glenna R.  Schroeder-Lein, ''The Encyclopedia of Civil War Medicine'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Civil-War-Medicine/dp/0765621304/  excerpt and text search].&lt;/ref&gt;  Conditions were poor in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], where doctors and medical supplies were in short supply.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Cunningham, ''Doctors in Gray: The Confederate Medical Service'' (1993) [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0807118567/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;  The war had a dramatic long-term impact on American medicine, from surgical technique to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities.

The hygiene of the training and field camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and, especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], and malaria. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Disease vectors]] were often unknown. The surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and [[quinine]]. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor sanitation within the camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Link, "Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life," ''Vermont History,'' (1983) 51#2 pp 69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged [[Army Medical Department (United States)|United States Army Medical Department]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818-1865'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.&lt;ref&gt;William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]] as well as smaller private agencies such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR) founded in 1861 by [[Henry Whitney Bellows]], and [[Dorothea Dix]].  Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness, as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet [[Walt Whitman]]. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martin,  ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178-230&lt;/ref&gt;

States could use their own tax money to support their troops as Ohio did. Following the unexpected carnage at the [[battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, the Ohio state government sent 3 steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals with doctors, nurses and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to eleven hospital ships.  The state also set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene E. Roseboom, ''The Civil War Era, 1850-1873'' (1944) p 396&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Army learned many lessons and in 1886, it established the Hospital Corps.  The Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.  The pioneer was [[John Shaw Billings]] (1838-1913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]], the centerpiece of modern medical information systems.&lt;ref&gt;He also built the [[New York Public Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; Billings figured out how to mechanically analyze medical and demographic data by turning it into numbers and punching onto cardboard cards as developed by his assistant [[Herman Hollerith]], the origin of the computer punch card system that dominated statistical data manipulation until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, "Numbering the North's Medical Events: Humanitarianism and Science in Civil War Statistics," ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine,'' (1992) 66#2 pp 210-233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern medicine==
After 1870 the [[Florence Nightingale|Nightingale]] model of professional training of nurses was widely copied. [[Linda Richards]] (1841 – 1930) studied in London and became the first professionally trained American nurse. She established nursing training programs in the United States and Japan, and created the first system for keeping individual medical records for hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Doona, "Linda Richards and Nursing in Japan, 1885-1890," ''Nursing History Review'' (1996) Vol. 4, p99-128&lt;/ref&gt;

After the American Revolution, the United States was slow to adopt advances in European medicine, but adopted germ theory and science-based practices in the late 1800s as the medical education system changed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Lotions-Potions-Pills-Magic-America/dp/1479807044&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Elaine G. Breslaw]] describes earlier post-colonial American medical schools as "[[diploma mill]]s", and credits the large 1889 endowment of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] for giving it the ability to lead the transition to science-based medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/163902602/KERA_163902602.mp3 |date=2012-10-29 |title=KERA Think: Health Care in Early America |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johns Hopkins originated several modern organizational practices, including ''[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]'' and ''[[Grand rounds|rounds]]''.

==World War II==

===Nursing===
As Campbell (1984) shows, the nursing profession was transformed by World War Two. Army and Navy nursing was highly attractive and a larger proportion of nurses volunteered for service higher than any other occupation in American society.&lt;ref name="Campbell_ch2"&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Kalisch and Beatrice J. Kalisch, ''American Nursing: A History'' (4th ed. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The public image of the nurses was highly favorable during the war, as exemplified by such Hollywood films as ''[[Cry 'Havoc' (film)|Cry "Havoc"]]'', which made the selfless nurses heroes under enemy fire. Some nurses were captured by the Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Norman, '' We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice they were kept out of harm's way, with the great majority stationed on the home front.  The medical services were large operations, with over 600,000 soldiers, and ten enlisted men for every nurse. Nearly all the doctors were men, with women doctors allowed only to examine patients from the [[Women's Army Corps]].&lt;ref name="Campbell_ch2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1702">'''Homogeneously staining regions''' ('''HSRs''') are chromosomal segments with various lengths and uniform staining intensity after [[G banding]]. This type of [[Chromosome abnormality|aberration]] is also known as Copy Number Gains or Amplification.

An HSR is one type of change in a [[chromosome]]'s structure which is frequently observed in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of human [[cancer]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. In the region of a chromosome where an HSR occurs, a segment of the chromosome, which presumably contains a [[gene]] or genes that give [[Fitness (biology)|selective advantage]] to the progression of the cancer, is amplified or duplicated many times.  As a result of the duplication this chromosomal segment is greatly lengthened and expanded such that when it is stained with a [[Hybridization probe|fluorescent probe]] specific to the region ([[Fluorescent in situ hybridization]]), rather than causing a focal fluorescent signal as in a normal chromosome, the probe "paints" a broad fluorescent signal over the whole of the amplified region.  It is because of the appearance of this broadly staining region that this chromosomal abnormality was named a homogeneously staining region.

[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|Articulated industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]
An '''industrial robot''' is a [[robot]] system used for [[manufacturing]]. Industrial robots are automated, programmable and capable of movement on three or more axes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8373:ed-2:v1:en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031837/https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ |date=2016-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical applications of robots include [[robot welding|welding]], painting, assembly, [[Automated storage and retrieval system|pick and place]] for [[printed circuit board]]s, [[packaging and labeling]], [[Palletizer|palletizing]], product inspection, and testing; all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. They can assist in [[material handling]].

In the year 2015, an estimated 1.64 million industrial robots were in operation worldwide according to [[International Federation of Robotics|International Federation of Robotics (IFR)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|title=Worries about premature industrialisation|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021014710/https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729864-automation-less-threat-workers-emerging-world-it-made-out|archivedate=2017-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly used robot configurations are [[articulated robot]]s, [[SCARA]] robots, [[delta robot]]s and [[cartesian coordinate robot]]s, ([[gantry cranes|gantry]] robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots would fall into the category of [[robotic arm]]s (inherent in the use of the word ''manipulator'' in ISO standard 1738).
Robots exhibit varying degrees of [[autonomous robot|autonomy]]: 
* Some robots are programmed to faithfully carry out specific actions over and over again (repetitive actions) without variation and with a high degree of accuracy. These actions are determined by programmed routines that specify the direction, acceleration, velocity, deceleration, and distance of a series of coordinated motions.
* Other robots are much more flexible as to the orientation of the object on which they are operating or even the task that has to be performed on the object itself, which the robot may even need to identify. For example, for more precise guidance, robots often contain [[machine vision]] sub-systems acting as their visual sensors, linked to powerful computers or controllers.&lt;ref name=NASAarticle&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[NASA Tech Briefs]] |volume= 35 |issue= 6 |date= June 2011 |title= Machine Vision Fundamentals, How to Make Robots See |author= Turek, Fred D. |pages= 60–62 |url= http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |accessdate= 2011-11-29 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120127043340/http://www.techbriefs.com/privacy-footer-69/10531 |archivedate= 2012-01-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Artificial intelligence]], or what passes for it,{{clarify|date=November 2016}} is becoming an increasingly important factor in the modern industrial robot.

==History of industrial robotics ==
The earliest known industrial robot, conforming to the ISO definition was completed by 
"Bill" Griffith P. Taylor in 1937 and published in [[Meccano Magazine]], March 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Automatic Block-Setting Crane|journal=Meccano Magazine|date=March 1938|volume=23|issue=3|page=172|publisher=Meccano|location=Liverpool UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Griffith P.|title=The Robot Gargantua|year=1995|publisher=Constructor Quarterly|location=Gargantua|editor=Robin Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crane-like device was built almost entirely using [[Meccano]] parts, and powered by a single electric motor.  Five axes of movement were possible, including ''grab'' and ''grab rotation''. Automation was achieved using punched paper tape to energise solenoids, which would facilitate the movement of the crane's control levers. The [[robot]] could stack wooden blocks in pre-programmed patterns. The number of motor revolutions required for each desired movement was first plotted on graph paper. This information was then transferred to the paper tape, which was also driven by the robot's single motor. Chris Shute built a complete replica of the robot in 1997.

[[Image:George C Devol Color Photo.jpg|thumb|left|George Devol, c. 1982]]
[[George Devol]] applied for the first robotics [[patent]]s in 1954 (granted in 1961).  The first company to produce a robot was [[Unimation]], founded by Devol and [[Joseph Engelberger|Joseph F. Engelberger]] in 1956. Unimation robots were also called ''programmable transfer machines'' since their main use at first was to transfer objects from one point to another, less than a dozen feet or so apart. They used [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[actuator]]s and were programmed in ''[[joint]] [[coordinate system|coordinates]]'', i.e. the angles of the various joints were stored during a teaching phase and replayed in operation.  They were accurate to within 1/10,000 of an inch{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} (note: although accuracy is not an appropriate measure for robots, usually evaluated in terms of repeatability - see later).  Unimation later licensed their technology to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[GKN]], manufacturing [[Unimate]]s in Japan and England respectively.  For some time Unimation's only competitor was [[Cincinnati Milacron]] Inc. of [[Ohio]]. This changed radically in the late 1970s when several big Japanese conglomerates began producing similar industrial robots.

In 1969 [[Victor Scheinman]] at [[Stanford University]] invented the [[Stanford arm]], an all-electric, 6-axis articulated robot designed to permit an [[arm solution]]. This allowed it accurately to follow arbitrary paths in space and widened the potential use of the robot to more sophisticated applications such as assembly and welding. Scheinman then designed a second arm for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] Lab, called the "MIT arm." Scheinman, after receiving a fellowship from Unimation to develop his designs, sold those designs to Unimation who further developed them with support from [[General Motors]] and later marketed it as the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly]] (PUMA).

Industrial robotics took off quite quickly in Europe, with both [[ABB Group|ABB Robotics]] and [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] bringing robots to the market in 1973. ABB Robotics (formerly ASEA) introduced IRB 6, among the world's first ''commercially available'' all electric micro-processor controlled robot. The first two IRB 6 robots were sold to Magnusson in Sweden for grinding and polishing pipe bends and were installed in production in January 1974. Also in 1973 KUKA Robotics built its first robot, known as [[FAMULUS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm KUKA-Roboter.de: 1973 The First KUKA Robot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220193437/http://www.kuka-robotics.com/en/company/group/milestones/1973.htm |date=2009-02-20 }} English, 28th of March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |title=History of Industrial Robots |accessdate=2012-10-27 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224213437/http://www.ifr.org/uploads/media/History_of_Industrial_Robots_online_brochure_by_IFR_2012.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; also one of the first articulated robots to have six electromechanically driven axes.

Interest in robotics increased in the late 1970s and many US companies entered the field, including large firms like [[General Electric]], and [[General Motors]] (which formed [[joint venture]] [[FANUC Robotics]] with [[FANUC]] LTD of Japan). U.S. [[startup companies]] included [[Automatix]] and [[Adept Technology]], Inc. At the height of the robot boom in 1984, Unimation was acquired by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] for 107 million U.S. dollars. Westinghouse sold Unimation to [[Stäubli Faverges SCA]] of [[France]] in 1988, which is still making articulated robots for general industrial and [[cleanroom]] applications and even bought the robotic division of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in late 2004.

Only a few non-Japanese companies ultimately managed to survive in this market, the major ones being: [[Adept Technology]], [[Stäub]], the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]], the [[Germany|German]] company [[KUKA|KUKA Robotics]] and the [[Italy|Italian]] company [[Comau]].

==Technical description==

===Defining parameters===
*''Number of axes'' – two axes are required to reach any point in a plane; three axes are required to reach any point in space. To fully control the orientation of the end of the arm(i.e. the ''wrist'') three more axes ([[yaw, pitch, and roll]]) are required. Some designs (e.g. the SCARA robot) trade limitations in motion possibilities for cost, speed, and accuracy.
*''[[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|Degrees of freedom]]'' – this is usually the same as the number of axes.
*''[[Working envelope]]'' – the region of space a robot can reach.
*''[[robot kinematics|Kinematics]]'' – the actual arrangement of rigid members and [[joint]]s in the robot, which determines the robot's possible motions. Classes of robot kinematics include articulated, cartesian, [[Parallel robot|parallel]] and SCARA.
*''Carrying capacity or [[Cargo|payload]]'' – how much weight a robot can lift.
*''Speed'' – how fast the robot can position the end of its arm. This may be defined in terms of the angular or linear speed of each axis or as a compound speed i.e. the speed of the end of the arm when all axes are moving.
*''Acceleration'' – how quickly an axis can accelerate. Since this is a limiting factor a robot may not be able to reach its specified maximum speed for movements over a short distance or a complex path requiring frequent changes of direction.
*''Accuracy'' – how closely a robot can reach a commanded position. When the absolute position of the robot is measured and compared to the commanded position the error is a measure of accuracy. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing for example a vision system or Infra-Red. See [[robot calibration]]. Accuracy can vary with speed and position within the working envelope and with payload (see compliance).
*''Repeatability'' – how well the robot will return to a programmed position. This is not the same as accuracy. It may be that when told to go to a certain X-Y-Z position that it gets only to within 1&amp;nbsp;mm of that position. This would be its accuracy which may be improved by calibration. But if that position is taught into controller memory and each time it is sent there it returns to within 0.1mm of the taught position then the repeatability will be within 0.1mm.
Accuracy and repeatability are different measures. Repeatability is usually the most important criterion for a robot and is similar to the concept of 'precision' in measurement—see [[accuracy and precision]]. ISO 9283 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|title=EVS-EN ISO 9283:2001|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310123210/https://www.evs.ee/Checkout/tabid/36/screen/freedownload/productid/159968/doclang/en/preview/1/EVS_EN_ISO_9283;2001_en_preview.aspx|archivedate=10 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out a method whereby both accuracy and repeatability can be measured. Typically a robot is sent to a taught position a number of times and the error is measured at each return to the position after visiting 4 other positions. Repeatability is then quantified using the [[standard deviation]] of those samples in all three dimensions. A typical robot can, of course make a positional error exceeding that and that could be a problem for the process. Moreover, the repeatability is different in different parts of the working envelope and also changes with speed and payload. ISO 9283 specifies that accuracy and repeatability should be measured at maximum speed and at maximum payload. But this results in pessimistic values whereas the robot could be much more accurate and repeatable at light loads and speeds.
Repeatability in an industrial process is also subject to the accuracy of the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.
*''Motion control'' – for some applications, such as simple pick-and-place assembly, the robot need merely return repeatably to a limited number of pre-taught positions. For more sophisticated applications, such as welding and finishing ([[spray painting]]), motion must be continuously controlled to follow a path in space, with controlled orientation and velocity.
*''Power source'' – some robots use [[electric motor]]s, others use [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] actuators. The former are faster, the latter are stronger and advantageous in applications such as spray painting, where a spark could set off an [[explosion]]; however, low internal air-pressurisation of the arm can prevent ingress of flammable vapours as well as other contaminants.
*''Drive'' – some robots connect electric motors to the joints via [[gear]]s; others connect the motor to the joint directly (''direct drive''). Using gears results in measurable 'backlash' which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, low torque DC motors, which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the [[harmonic drive]] is often used.
*''Compliance'' - this is a measure of the amount in angle or distance that a robot axis will move when a force is applied to it. Because of compliance when a robot goes to a position carrying its maximum payload it will be at a position slightly lower than when it is carrying no payload. Compliance can also be responsible for overshoot when carrying high payloads in which case acceleration would need to be reduced.

===Robot programming and interfaces===
[[Image:Offline teaching welding 001.png|thumb|Offline programming]]
[[Image:Teach pendant.JPG|thumb|A typical well-used teach pendant with optional [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]]]

The setup or [[Computer programming|programming]] of motions and sequences for an industrial robot is typically taught by linking the robot controller to a [[laptop]], desktop [[computer]] or (internal or Internet) [[computer network|network]].

A robot and a collection of machines or peripherals is referred to as a [[workcell]], or cell. A typical cell might contain a parts feeder, a [[injection molding machine|molding machine]] and a robot. The various machines are 'integrated' and controlled by a single computer or [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]]. How the robot interacts with other machines in the cell must be programmed, both with regard to their positions in the cell and synchronizing with them.

''Software:'' The computer is installed with corresponding [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] software. The use of a computer greatly simplifies the programming process. Specialized [[robot software]] is run either in the robot controller or in the computer or both depending on the system design.

There are two basic entities that need to be taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole the positions of the feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder to the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.

Teaching the robot positions may be achieved a number of ways:

''Positional commands'' The robot can be directed to the required position using a [[GUI]] or text based commands in which the required X-Y-Z position may be specified and edited.

''Teach pendant:'' Robot positions can be taught via a [[teach pendant]]. This is a handheld control and programming unit. The common features of such units are the ability to manually send the robot to a desired position, or "inch" or "jog" to adjust a position. They also have a means to change the speed since a low speed is usually required for careful positioning, or while test-running through a new or modified routine. A large [[emergency stop]] button is usually included as well. Typically once the robot has been programmed there is no more use for the teach pendant.

''Lead-by-the-nose:'' this is a technique offered by many robot manufacturers. In this method, one user holds the robot's manipulator, while another person enters a command which de-energizes the robot causing it to go into limp. The user then moves the robot by hand to the required positions and/or along a required path while the software logs these positions into memory. The program can later run the robot to these positions or along the taught path. This technique is popular for tasks such as [[spray painting|paint spraying]].

''Offline programming'' is where the entire cell, the robot and all the machines or instruments in the workspace are mapped graphically. The robot can then be moved on screen and the process simulated. A robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a robot, without depending on the physical operation of the robot arm and end effector. The advantages of robotics simulation is that it saves time in the design of robotics applications. It can also increase the level of safety associated with robotic equipment since various "what if" scenarios can be tried and tested before the system is activated.[8] Robot simulation software provides a platform to teach, test, run, and debug programs that have been written in a variety of programming languages.  [[Image:RoboLogix Work Envelope.jpg|Robotics Simulator|thumb|right]]

''Robot simulation'' tools allow for robotics programs to be conveniently written and debugged off-line with the final version of the program tested on an actual robot. The ability to preview the behavior of a robotic system in a virtual world allows for a variety of mechanisms, devices, configurations and controllers to be tried and tested before being applied to a "real world" system. Robotics simulators have the ability to provide real-time computing of the simulated motion of an industrial robot using both geometric modeling and kinematics modeling.

''Others'' In addition, machine operators often use [[user interface]] devices, typically [[touchscreen]] units, which serve as the operator control panel. The operator can switch from program to program, make adjustments within a program and also operate a host of [[peripheral]] devices that may be integrated within the same robotic system. These include [[Industrial robot end effector|end effector]]s, feeders that supply components to the robot, [[conveyor belt]]s, emergency stop controls, machine vision systems, safety [[interlock (engineering)|interlock]] systems, [[barcode|bar code]] printers and an almost infinite array of other industrial devices which are accessed and controlled via the operator control panel.

The teach pendant or PC is usually disconnected after programming and the robot then runs on the program that has been installed in its [[controller (computing)|controller]]. However a computer is often used to 'supervise' the robot and any peripherals, or to provide additional storage for access to numerous complex paths and routines.

===End-of-arm tooling===
The most essential robot peripheral is the [[Robot end effector|end effector]], or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] or [[pneumatics|pneumatic]]). Other common means of picking up objects is by [[vacuum]] or [[Magnet|magnets]]. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time.  They may utilize various sensors to aid the robot system in locating, handling, and positioning products.

===Controlling movement===
For a given robot the only parameters necessary to completely locate the end effector (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles of each of the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the end effector in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a [[Robotic arm|jointed arm]] these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See [[robot control]]

Positioning by Cartesian coordinates may be done by entering the coordinates into the system or by using a teach pendant which moves the robot in X-Y-Z directions. It is much easier for a human operator to visualize motions up/down, left/right, etc. than to move each joint one at a time. When the desired position is reached it is then defined in some way particular to the robot software in use, e.g. P1 - P5 below.

===Typical programming===
Most articulated robots perform by storing a series of positions in memory, and moving to them at various times in their programming sequence. For example, a robot which is moving items from one place to another might have a simple 'pick and place' program similar to the following:

''Define points P1–P5:''

# Safely above workpiece (defined as P1)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin A (defined as P2)
# At position to take part from bin A (defined as P3)
# 10&amp;nbsp;cm Above bin B (defined as P4)
# At position to take part from bin B. (defined as P5)

''Define program:''

# Move to P1
# Move to P2
# Move to P3
# Close gripper
# Move to P2
# Move to P4
# Move to P5
# Open gripper
# Move to P4
# Move to P1 and finish

For examples of how this would look in popular robot languages see [[Robot software#Examples of programming languages for Industrial Robots|industrial robot programming]].

===Singularities===
The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) defines a singularity as “a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.

A second type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist center lies on a cylinder that is centered about axis 1 and with radius equal to the distance between axes 1 and 4. This is called a shoulder singularity. Some robot manufacturers also mention alignment singularities, where axes 1 and 6 become coincident. This is simply a sub-case of shoulder singularities. When the robot passes close to a shoulder singularity, joint 1 spins very fast.

The third and last type of singularity in wrist-partitioned vertically articulated six-axis robots occurs when the wrist's center lies in the same plane as axes 2 and 3.

Singularities are closely related to the phenomena of [[gimbal lock]], which has a similar root cause of axes becoming lined up.

A video illustrating these three types of singular configurations is available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|title=Singularities in six-axis vertically-articulated industrial robots|work=CoRo Blog|accessdate=17 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417191430/http://coro.etsmtl.ca/blog/?p=107|archivedate=17 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market structure==
According to the [[International Federation of Robotics]] (IFR) study ''World Robotics 2018'', there were about 2,097,500 operational industrial robots by the end of 2017. This number is estimated to reach 3,788,000 by the end of 2021.&lt;ref name="IFR 2018"/&gt; For the year 2017 the IFR estimates the worldwide sales of industrial robots with US$16.2 billion.

The [[International Federation of Robotics]] has predicted a worldwide increase in adoption of industrial robots and they estimated 1.7 million new robot installations in factories worldwide by 2020 [https://ifr.org/industrial-robots/statistics/ &amp;#91;IFR 2017&amp;#93;]. Rapid advances in automation technologies (e.g. fixed robots, collaborative and mobile robots, and exoskeletons) have the potential to improve work conditions but also to introduce workplace hazards in manufacturing workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24649|title=Information Technology and the U.S. Workforce: Where Are We and Where Do We Go from Here?|last=Technology|first=Committee on Information|last2=Automation|last3=Workforce|first3=and the U.S.|last4=Board|first4=Computer Science and Telecommunications|last5=Sciences|first5=Division on Engineering and Physical|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-03-16|isbn=9780309454025|language=en|doi=10.17226/24649}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://oshwiki.eu/wiki/A_review_on_the_future_of_work:_robotics]   Despite the lack of occupational surveillance data on injuries associated specifically with robots, researchers from the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) identified 61 robot-related deaths between 1992 and 2015 using keyword searches of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries research database (see info from [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/aboutthecenter.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research]). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NIOSH and its state partners have investigated 4 robot-related fatalities under the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/brochure.html Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program].  In addition the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has investigated dozens of robot-related deaths and injuries, which can be reviewed at [https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/AccidentSearch.search?acc_keyword=%22Robot%22&amp;keyword_list=on OSHA Accident Search page]. Injuries and fatalities could  increase over time because of the increasing number of collaborative and co-existing robots, powered exoskeletons, and autonomous vehicles into the work environment.

Safety standards are being developed by the [https://www.robotics.org/ Robotic Industries Association] (RIA) in conjunction with the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).[https://www.robotics.org/robotic-standards] On October 5, 2017, OSHA, NIOSH and RIA signed an [https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/alliances/ria/ria.html alliance] to work together to enhance technical expertise, identify and help address potential workplace hazards associated with traditional industrial robots and the emerging technology of human-robot collaboration installations and systems, and help identify needed research to reduce workplace hazards. On October 16 NIOSH launched the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/robotics/default.html Center for Occupational Robotics Research] to "provide scientific leadership to guide the development and use of occupational robots that enhance worker safety, health, and wellbeing."  So far, the research needs identified by NIOSH and its partners include: tracking and preventing injuries and fatalities, intervention and dissemination strategies to promote safe machine control and maintenance procedures, and on translating effective evidence-based interventions into workplace practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5723">'''Karl Ziegler Morgan''' (September 27, 1907 – June 8, 1999), was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] who was one of the founders of the field of [[radiation health physics]]. Late in life, after a long career in the [[Manhattan Project]] and at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], he became a [[Anti-nuclear|critic of nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapons]] production. 

Born in [[Enochville, North Carolina]], Karl Morgan attended [[Lenoir-Rhyne College]] (now University) as a freshman and sophomore and then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina]], where he graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in physics and [[mathematics]]. He continued [[graduate study]] in physics at [[Duke University]], where he received a PhD degree in 1934 for research into [[cosmic radiation]]. He began an academic career as a faculty member at [[Lenoir Rhyne College]], but in 1943 was recruited to work in the [[Manhattan Project|secret project]] to develop an [[atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce Wright, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jun/15/guardianobituaries1 Karl Morgan], ''The Guardian'', Tuesday 15 June 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leland R. Johnson, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=M125 Karl Z. Morgan]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ORobit/&gt;

Initially at the [[University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory]] and later in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], Morgan joined a small group of physicists who were interested in the health effects of [[ionizing radiation|radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dick Smyser, "Founder of the science of health physics and also a pioneer of the environmental movement," ''The Oak Ridger'', June 24, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morgan became director of [[health physics]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL), serving from the late 1940s until his retirement in 1972. In 1955 he became the first president of the [[Health Physics Society]], and was editor of the journal ''Health Physics'' from 1955 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4020/is_200201/ai_n9036418/print?tag=artBody;col1 Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from ORNL, he joined the faculty of [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] as professor of nuclear energy in the school of [[nuclear engineering]], retiring from that position in 1982, when he became a consulting professor at [[Appalachian State University]].&lt;ref name=ORobit&gt;"Dr. Karl Z. Morgan; Pioneer health physicist," ''The Oak Ridger'', June 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

After decades as a "pillar of the nuclear establishment", Morgan had a "change of heart" about [[nuclear weapons]] production and [[nuclear power]].  He began to offer court testimony which was friendly to people who said they had been harmed by nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industry. In October 1982, he testified in a lawsuit brought by nearly 1,200 people who accused the government of negligence in atomic weapons testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the 1950s, which they said had caused [[leukemia]] and other [[cancer]]s. Morgan, then 75 years old, testified that radiation protection measures in the tests were substandard.&lt;ref name=karl&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502EFDE1238F930A25755C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print Karl Z. Morgan, 91, Founder of the Field Of Health Physics, Dies in Tennessee]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morgan also testified on behalf of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[uranium mine]]rs and their survivors, saying government officials had known about mine radiation dangers but had not protected the miners. He also testified in the case of [[Karen Silkwood]] against [[Kerr-McGee]].&lt;ref name=karl/&gt;

Morgan's autobiography, ''The Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age'' was published in 1999 by the University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; He died in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], on June 8, 1999, apparently from a ruptured [[aorta|aortic]] [[aneurysm]].&lt;ref name=ORobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/reporter/no5/morgan.htm K.Z. Morgan, health physics pioneer, dies], ''ORNL Reporter'', July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

PhD John Cameron, the developer of a more accurate [[dosimeter]] in the 1960s, was however a major critic of Morgan's error prone autobiography that was otherwise interesting for its historical detailing of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s health physics evolution. Cameron goes chapter by chapter of Morgan's generally "flawed" anti-nuclear stance, writing a critique in the year 2000 on Morgan's exaggeration of the [[Linear no-threshold model|small risks from exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/Cameron.summ.2000.html/John_Cameron.html A Flawed History of Radiation Protection by John Cameron, Ph.D]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Burn incident===
On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], ordered a 49-cent cup of coffee from the [[drive-through]] window of a local [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]] restaurant located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 [[Ford Probe]] which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled the far side of the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McCann, William Haltom, and Anne Bloom, "LAW &amp; SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM: Java Jive: Genealogy of a Juridical Icon", 56 U. Miami L. Rev. 113 (October 2001), which describes the accident in detail&lt;/ref&gt; Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, [[scalding]] her thighs, buttocks, and groin.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerlin. See also [[Ralph Nader]] &amp; Wesley J. Smith, ''No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America'' (1996) {{ISBN|0-375-75258-7}}, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebeck was taken to the hospital, where it was determined that she had suffered third-degree burns on six percent of her skin and lesser burns over sixteen percent.&lt;ref&gt;Nader &amp; Smith, ''No Contest'', 268&lt;/ref&gt; She remained in the hospital for eight days while she underwent skin [[Graft (surgery)|grafting]]. During this period, Liebeck lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}} (nearly 20% of her body weight), reducing her to {{convert|83|lb|kg}}.  After the hospital stay, Liebeck needed care for three weeks, which was provided by her daughter.&lt;ref name="injury.findlaw.com"&gt;http://injury.findlaw.com/product-liability/the-mcdonald-s-coffee-cup-case-separating-mcfacts-from-mcfiction.html&lt;/ref&gt; Liebeck suffered permanent disfigurement after the incident and was partially disabled for two years.&lt;ref name="HorseyRackley2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirsty Horsey|author2=Erika Rackley|title=Tort Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-966189-3|pages=356–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaltomMcCann2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Haltom|author2=Michael McCann|title=Distorting the Law: Politics, Media, and the Litigation Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CxlAoYKcZIC&amp;pg=PA186|date=15 November 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31469-3|pages=186–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-trial===
Liebeck sought to settle with McDonald's for $20,000 to cover her actual and anticipated expenses. Her past medical expenses were $10,500; her anticipated future medical expenses were approximately $2,500; and her daughter's&lt;ref name="injury.findlaw.com"/&gt; loss of income was approximately $5,000 for a total of approximately $18,000.&lt;ref&gt;Amended Complaint about Damages, Stella LIEBECK, Plaintiff, v. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANTS, P.T.S, Inc. and McDonald's Corporation, Defendants. 1993 WL 13651163, District Court of New Mexico, (Bernalillo County, N.M. Dist. Ct. October 5, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the company offered only $800.  When McDonald's refused to raise its offer, Liebeck retained Texas attorney Reed Morgan. Morgan filed suit in New Mexico District Court accusing McDonald's of "[[gross negligence]]" for selling coffee that was "unreasonably dangerous" and "defectively manufactured". McDonald's refused Morgan's offer to settle for $90,000. Morgan offered to settle for $300,000, and a mediator suggested $225,000 just before trial, but McDonald's refused these final pre-trial attempts to settle.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt;

==Trial and verdict==
The trial took place from August 8–17, 1994, before New Mexico District Court Judge Robert H. Scott.&lt;ref name="docket entry from nmcourts.com"&gt;''Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants'', [http://www.nmcourts.com/caselookup/app?component=cnLink&amp;page=SearchResults&amp;service=direct&amp;session=T&amp;sp=SD-202-CV-9302419 docket entry from nmcourts.com]: :
&lt;blockquote&gt;08/18/1994 NCJ: JURY TRIAL 12 PERSON::Filing Judgment entered solely against DF McDonald's and to PL for compensatory damages of $160,000.00 and punitive damages of 0$2,700,000.00plus interest and costs&lt;/ref&gt; During the case, Liebeck's attorneys [[discovery (law)|discovered]] that McDonald's required [[franchising|franchisee]]s to hold coffee at {{convert|180|-|190|F|C}}. Liebeck's attorney argued that coffee should never be served hotter than {{convert|140|F}}, and that a number of other establishments served coffee at a substantially lower temperature than McDonald's. They presented evidence that coffee they had tested all over the city was all served at a temperature at least 20°F (11°C) lower than what McDonald's served. Liebeck's lawyers also presented the jury with expert testimony that {{convert|190|F}} coffee may produce third-degree burns (where skin grafting is necessary) in about 3 seconds and {{convert|180|F}} coffee may produce such burns in about 12 to 15 seconds.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt; Lowering the temperature to {{convert|160|F}} would increase the time for the coffee to produce such a burn to 20 seconds. Liebeck's attorneys argued that these extra seconds could provide adequate time to remove the coffee from exposed skin, thereby preventing many burns. McDonald's claimed that the reason for serving such hot coffee in its drive-through windows was that those who purchased the coffee typically were commuters who wanted to drive a distance with the coffee; the high initial temperature would keep the coffee hot during the trip.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt; However, it came to light that McDonald's had done research which indicated that customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving.&lt;ref name="lectlaw"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other documents obtained from McDonald's showed that from 1982 to 1992 the company had received more than 700 reports of people burned by McDonald's coffee to varying degrees of severity, and had settled claims arising from scalding injuries for more than $500,000.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt; McDonald's quality control manager, Christopher Appleton, testified that this number of injuries was insufficient to cause the company to evaluate its practices. He argued that all foods hotter than {{convert|130|°F}} constituted a burn hazard, and that restaurants had more pressing dangers to worry about. The plaintiffs argued that Appleton conceded that McDonald's coffee would burn the mouth and throat if consumed when served.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerlin. See also trial and deposition transcripts reproduced in Nader &amp; Smith, 270–272&lt;/ref&gt;

A twelve-person jury reached its verdict on August 18, 1994.&lt;ref name="docket entry from nmcourts.com"/&gt;  Applying the principles of [[comparative negligence]], the [[jury]] found that McDonald's was 80% responsible for the incident and Liebeck was 20% at fault. Though there was a warning on the coffee cup, the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient. They awarded Liebeck $200,000 in [[compensatory damages]], which was then reduced by 20% to $160,000. In addition, they awarded her $2.7 million in [[punitive damages]]. The jurors apparently arrived at this figure from Morgan's suggestion to penalize McDonald's for one or two days' worth of coffee revenues, which were about $1.35 million per day.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt; The judge reduced punitive damages to $480,000, three times the compensatory amount, for a total of $640,000. The decision was appealed by both McDonald's and Liebeck in December 1994, but the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount less than $600,000.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Shapiro, Punitive Damages, 43 La. B.J. 252, 254 n.1 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The case is considered by some to be an example of [[frivolous litigation]].&lt;ref name="JavaWorld"&gt;Mark B. Greenlee, "Kramer v. Java World: Images, Issues, and Idols in the Debate Over Tort Reform", 26 Cap. U.L. Rev. 701&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ABC News]] called the case "the poster child of excessive lawsuits".&lt;ref name="ABCNews20070502"&gt;[[ABC News]], [http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=3121086&amp;page=1 "I'm Being Sued for What?"], 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jonathan Turley]] called the case "a meaningful and worthy lawsuit".&lt;ref name="Turley"&gt;The case led to "tort reform law" when people failed to understand that the majority of the damages awarded were punitive due to the number of lawsuits that McDonald's settled from burn victims and had failed to settle the plaintiff's reasonable medical reimbursement requests. [http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rbrill/classes/BrillTortsF2007Eve/CoursePages/Course_docs/Supp_material/Frivolous_Suits.html Legal Urban Legends Hold Sway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303195637/http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rbrill/classes/BrillTortsF2007Eve/CoursePages/Course_docs/Supp_material/Frivolous_Suits.html |date=2012-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  McDonald's asserts that the outcome of the case was a fluke, and attributed the loss to poor communications and strategy by an unfamiliar insurer representing a franchise. Liebeck's attorney, Reed Morgan, and the [[Association of Trial Lawyers of America]] defended the result in ''Liebeck'' by claiming that McDonald's [[Liebeck_v._McDonald's_Restaurants#Coffee_temperature|reduced the temperature of its coffee]] after the suit, although it is not clear whether McDonald's in fact had done so.

Detractors have argued that McDonald's refusal to offer more than an $800 settlement for the $10,500 in medical bills indicated that the suit was meritless and highlighted the fact that Liebeck spilled the coffee on herself rather than any wrongdoing on the company's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2004/08/trial-lawyerjohn-edwards-propaganda-at-kos.html |title=Trial lawyer propaganda at kos |accessdate=2008-05-14 |author=[[Stephen Bainbridge]] |date=2004-08-01|format=revised relocated blog entry}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J.

Bunn-O-Matic'', 150 F.3d 651, 654 (7th Cir. 1998)(listing cases).&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebeck died on August 5, 2004, at age 91. According to her daughter, "the burns and court proceedings (had taken) their toll" and in the years following the settlement Liebeck had "no quality of life", and that the settlement had paid for a live-in nurse.&lt;ref name=ABQJOURNAL&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/upfront/061054231171upfront01-06-09.htm|title=Student Measured Heat in Coffee Case|author=Toby Smith|newspaper= [[Albuquerque Journal]]|date=January 6, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similar lawsuits===
In ''McMahon v. Bunn Matic Corporation'' (1998), [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Frank Easterbrook]] wrote a unanimous opinion affirming dismissal of a similar lawsuit against coffeemaker manufacturer [[Bunn-o-Matic Corporation|Bunn-O-Matic]], finding that {{convert|179|°F|°C|abbr=on}} hot coffee was not "unreasonably dangerous".&lt;ref name=Easterbrook&gt;Judge Easterbrook:  "The smell (and therefore the taste) of coffee depends heavily on the oils containing aromatic compounds that are dissolved out of the beans during the brewing process. Brewing temperature should be close to 200&amp;nbsp;°F ''[93&amp;nbsp;°C]'' to dissolve them effectively, but without causing the premature breakdown of these delicate molecules. Coffee smells and tastes best when these aromatic compounds evaporate from the surface of the coffee as it is being drunk. Compounds vital to flavor have boiling points in the range of 150–160&amp;nbsp;°F ''[66–71&amp;nbsp;°C]'', and the beverage therefore tastes best when it is this hot and the aromatics vaporize as it is being drunk. For coffee to be 150&amp;nbsp;°F when imbibed, it must be hotter in the pot. Pouring a liquid increases its surface area and cools it; more heat is lost by contact with the cooler container; if the consumer adds cream and sugar (plus a metal spoon to stir them) the liquid's temperature falls again. If the consumer carries the container out for later consumption, the beverage cools still further." [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1365042.html ''McMahon v. Bunn Matic Corporation''], 150 F.3d 651 (7th Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bogle v. McDonald's Restaurants Ltd.'' (2002), a similar lawsuit in England failed when the court rejected the claim that McDonald's could have avoided injury by serving coffee at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name=Bogle&gt;Judge Field of the [[Queen's Bench]] wrote: "If this submission be right, McDonald's should not have served drinks at any temperature which would have caused a bad scalding injury. The evidence is that tea or coffee served at a temperature of 65&amp;nbsp;°C [149&amp;nbsp;°F] will cause a deep thickness burn if it is in contact with the skin for just two seconds. Thus, if McDonald's were going to avoid the risk of injury by a deep thickness burn they would have had to have served tea and coffee at between 55&amp;nbsp;°C and 60&amp;nbsp;°C. [131–140&amp;nbsp;°F] But tea ought to be brewed with boiling water if it is to give its best flavour and coffee ought to be brewed at between 85&amp;nbsp;°C and 95&amp;nbsp;°C. [185–203&amp;nbsp;°F] Further, people generally like to allow a hot drink to cool to the temperature they prefer. Accordingly, I have no doubt that tea and coffee served at between 55&amp;nbsp;°C and 60&amp;nbsp;°C would not have been acceptable to McDonald's customers. Indeed, on the evidence, I find that the public want to be able to buy tea and coffee served hot, that is to say at a temperature of at least 65&amp;nbsp;°C, even though they know (as I think they must be taken to do for the purposes of answering issues (1) and (2)) that there is a risk of a scalding injury if the drink is spilled."

===Coffee temperature===
In 1994, a spokesman for the [[National Coffee Association]] said that the temperature of McDonald's coffee conformed to industry standards.&lt;ref name="Gerlin"/&gt; An "admittedly unscientific" survey by the ''LA Times'' that year found that coffee was served between {{convert|157|and|182|F|C}}, and that two coffee outlets tested, one Burger King and one Starbucks, served hotter coffee than McDonald's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-16/business/fi-39457_1_hot-coffee |title=A Hot Tip for Coffee Lovers: Most Retailers Prefer to Make It Scalding |author= Denise Gellene |date=1994-09-16 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Liebeck'', McDonald's has not reduced the service temperature of its coffee.  McDonald's policy today is to serve coffee at {{convert|80|–|90|C|F}},&lt;ref name="CEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_huntingdon/displayarticle.asp?id=180135 |title=Burger chain sued after boy's ordeal |accessdate=2008-05-14 |date=2007-06-22 |website=Cambridge News |publisher=Cambridge Newspapers Ltd, Cambridge UK |quote=Matthew Allen, 10, suffered second degree burns after he bumped into his mum's tray and the drink tipped on to his arm. ...

'''Ligovsky pond''' ({{lang-ru|Лиговский пруд}}) is artificial lake existing in [[Ligovo]], suburb of [[Saint Petersburg]] ([[Russia]]) in 1716–1941.
[[File:Ligovo mill.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Ligovo [[watermill]] on a postcard from 1900&lt;/center&gt;]]
In 1703 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] had been based the city of Saint Petersburg and this area became capital suburb.
In 1710s emperor has taken part in destiny of settlement - it has enjoined to block the Dudergofka river in 1715.
On a dam the [[watermill]] which specialised on flour-grinding and felting works has been constructed.&lt;ref name="The text of article of the paper newspaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russian: Аминов Д. |first=D. Aminov |year=1990 |trans-title=Ligovo-Uritsk |title=Лигово - Урицк |journal=Dialog Russian: Диалог |publisher=Leningrad obkom CPSU {{lang-ru|Ленинградский обком КПСС}} |language=Russian |url=http://www.ligkaskad.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2934&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=20&amp;sid=6d7a44fe6d750fc1fbc86cf4aa9315b9 |accessdate=2009-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007223553/http://www.ligkaskad.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2934&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=20&amp;sid=6d7a44fe6d750fc1fbc86cf4aa9315b9 |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;!-- The text of article of the paper newspaper is laid out at a forum {{lang-ru|Текст статьи бумажной газеты выложен на форуме}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously with barrage of Dudergofka river has been dug the [[Ligovsky channel]].
It has taken away an essential part of water from Dudergofka and the artificial lake became a source of water for Ligovo.
At that time surrounding district represented imperial grange for maintenance of a palace with the foodstuffs; there was a dairy farm, kitchen gardens.&lt;ref name="The text of article of the paper newspaper" /&gt;

When in 1765 owner of district became [[Orlov (family)#Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov|Grigory Orlov]], for it on the bank of lake buildings have been built.
On the western coast of a pond were the house with landing stage and economic constructions.
On east coast the manour house where Orlov accepted [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian empress Catherine II]] has been constructed.&lt;ref name="The text of article of the paper newspaper" /&gt;

After 1783, when Grigory Orlov is dead, earths of Ligovo have been inherited by its pupil Natalia Alekseeva, she was married for aide-de-camp of Orlov [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden]].
In 1840s the manor of Buxhoeveden has passed to count G. G. Kushelev-Bezbordko (younger), it has continued useful agricultural activity of count Orlov, and Ligovo became an exemplary agricultural manor.
Have spent a network of avenues and paths, have created specific hills, have dug out ponds.
The house has a connected covered transition to kitchen, to the north from it have organised separate zones — an orchard with greenhouses, stables, the bird's and cattle courtyard.
Lake coast too have improved - by the architect [[Andrei Stackenschneider|A.&amp;nbsp;Stackenschneider]] have been constructed terrace, going down from the house to lake, a grotto on love island.&lt;ref name="The text of article of the paper newspaper" /&gt;

[[File:Ligovsky pond.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Love island in 1900&lt;/center&gt;]]

After Kushelev-Bezbordko's death the manor gradually fell into decay.
In 1857 in Ligovo has come Baltic railway, by the end 1870s vicinities Ligovsky pond became country area; on lake summer residents went for a drive on boats.
To October Revolution in 1917 the lake, a dam and a mill were supported as it should be.
After that the mill has stopped, contemporaries recollected that water falls fell from a dam.&lt;ref name="The text of article of the paper newspaper" /&gt;

The pond mirror was supported by a dam of a mill till 1941. On 5 December 1941 [[Army Group North|German armies]] destroyed the dam on the [[Siege of Leningrad|approach to Leningrad]]. After the [[Second World War]] hydraulic work was not restored. On a lake place the big [[ravine]] which has grown with a bush settles down. The territory of the former lake is not built up - it is a memorial zone: in fights on this place was lost more than 700 persons. Near to the former lake the memorial Orthodox church is under construction.

The '''maxillary first premolar''' is one of two [[Tooth (human)|teeth]] located in the upper jaw, laterally (away from the midline of the [[face]]) from both the [[maxillary canine]]s of the [[mouth]] but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both [[maxillary second premolar]]s.  The function of this [[premolar]] is similar to that of canines in regard to tearing being the principal action during [[mastication]], commonly known as chewing.  There are two [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s on maxillary first premolars, and the buccal (closest to the cheek) cusp is sharp enough to resemble the [[prehensile]] teeth found in carnivorous animals.  There are no deciduous maxillary premolars.  Around 10-11 years of age, the primary molars are shed and the permanent premolars erupt in their place. It takes about 3 years for the adult premolar and its root to fully calcify.

In the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal system of notation]], the permanent maxillary premolars are designated by a number.  The right permanent maxillary first premolar is known as "5", and the left one is known as "12".  In the [[Palmer notation]], a number is used in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found.  For this tooth, the left and right first premolars would have the same number, "4", but the right one would have the symbol, "┘", underneath it, while the left one would have, "└".  The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent maxillary first premolar is known as "14", and the left one is known as "24".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9135">In [[epidemiology]], '''Mendelian randomization''' is a method of using measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease in [[observational studies]]. The design was first proposed in 1986&lt;ref name=Katan1986/&gt; and subsequently described by Gray and Wheatley&lt;ref name=Gray1991/&gt; as a method for obtaining unbiased estimates of the effects of a putative causal variable without conducting a traditional [[randomised trial]]. These authors also coined the term ''Mendelian randomization''. The design has a powerful control for [[reverse causation]] and [[confounding]], which often impede or mislead epidemiological studies.&lt;ref name="DaveySmith2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith GD | title = Mendelian Randomization for Strengthening Causal Inference in Observational Studies: Application to Gene × Environment Interactions | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 527–45 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 26162196 | doi = 10.1177/1745691610383505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
An important focus of observational epidemiology is the identification of modifiable causes of common diseases that are of [[public health]] interest.  In order to have firm evidence that a recommended public health intervention will have the desired beneficial effect, the observed association between the particular risk factor and disease must imply that the risk factor actually causes the disease.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Well-known successes include the identified causal links between smoking and lung cancer, and between blood pressure and stroke.  However, there have also been notable failures when identified exposures were later shown by randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to be non-causal. For instance, it has now been shown that [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] will not prevent [[cardiovascular disease]], as was previously thought, and may have other adverse health effects.&lt;ref name=Rossouw2002/&gt; The reason for such spurious findings in observational epidemiology is most likely to be [[confounding]] by social, behavioural or physiological factors which are difficult to control for and particularly difficult to measure accurately.  Moreover, many findings cannot be replicated by RCTs for ethical reasons.

==Randomization approach==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Genetics is indeed in a peculiarly favoured condition in that Providence has shielded the geneticist from many of the difficulties of a reliably controlled comparison. The different genotypes possible from the same mating have been beautifully randomised by the meiotic process. A more perfect control of conditions is scarcely possible, than that of different genotypes appearing in the same litter." --[[R.A. Fisher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fisher RA | title = Statistical methods in genetics. 1951 | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 329–35 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20176585 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyp379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mendelian randomization is a method that allows one to test for, or in certain cases to estimate, a causal effect from observational data in the presence of confounding factors. It uses common [[genetic polymorphism]]s with well-understood effects on exposure patterns (e.g., propensity to drink alcohol) or effects that mimic those produced by modifiable exposures (e.g., raised blood cholesterol&lt;ref name=Katan1986/&gt;). Importantly, the [[genotype]] must only affect the disease status indirectly via its effect on the exposure of interest.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}} Because genotypes are assigned randomly when passed from parents to offspring during [[meiosis]], if we assume that choice of mate is not associated with genotype ([[panmixia]]), then the population genotype distribution should be unrelated to the confounders that typically plague observational epidemiology studies. In this regard, Mendelian randomization can be thought of as a “natural” randomized controlled trial. Because the polymorphism is the instrument, Mendelian randomization is dependent on [[genetic association]] studies having provided good candidate genes for response to risk exposure.

From a statistical perspective, MR is an application of the technique of [[instrumental variables]]&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Didelez2007/&gt; with genotype acting as an instrument for the exposure of interest.

MR is based on a number of assumptions. These include that there is no direct relationship between the instrument and the dependent variable, and that there are no direct paths between the instrument and any potential confounders.  In addition to direct effects of the instrument on the disease misleading the analyst, misleading conclusions may also arise in the presence of [[linkage disequilibrium]] with unmeasured directly-causal variants, [[heterogeneous#Genetics|genetic heterogeneity]], [[pleiotropy]] (often detected as a [[genetic correlation]]), or [[population stratification]].&lt;ref name=DaveySmith2003/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">'''Multiscale Electrophysiology Format (MEF)''' was developed to handle the large amounts of data produced by large-scale [[electrophysiology]] in human and animal subjects. MEF can store any time series data up to 24 [[bit]]s in length, and employs lossless range encoded [[Lossless data compression|difference compression]]. Subject identifying information in the file header can be [[Encryption|encrypted]] using 128-bit AES encryption in order to comply with [[HIPAA]] requirements for [[Medical privacy|patient privacy]] when transmitting data across an open network.

Compressed data is stored in independent blocks to allow direct access to the data, facilitate parallel processing and limit the effects of potential damage to files. Data fidelity is ensured by a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check in each compressed data block using the [[Mathematics of CRC#Polynomial representations|Koopman polynomial]] (0xEB31D82E), which has a [[Hamming distance]] of from 4 to 114 kbits.

'''Naas General Hospital''' is located in [[Craddockstown]], [[Naas]] in [[County Kildare]], near Naas' town center, in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. This [[Hospital|General Hospital]] provides acute services for the population of around 200,000 people in [[County Kildare]] and western parts of [[County Wicklow]].&lt;ref name=service&gt;{{cite web|title=Naas General Hospital - Public Information|url=http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find_a_Service/hospitals/Naas/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217185319/http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find_a_Service/hospitals/Naas/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 February 2013|publisher=www.hse.ie|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital currently has 243 patient beds which include 18 day service beds. The hospital features a 24-hour Emergency Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naashospital.ie/|title=Welcome to Naas General Hospital {{!}} Naas General Hospital|website=www.naashospital.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==
The hospital was originally built to serve as a [[workhouse]] in the 1840s, then in 1922 around the time of Ireland's independence from Britain it became Naas County Hospital. Then in 1981 the Department of Health began to develop the hospital as a general hospital.&lt;ref name=hospital&gt;{{cite web|title=HISTORY OF NAAS GENERAL HOSPITAL|url=http://naashospital.ie/about/history|publisher=naashospital.ie|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
[[File:Naas General Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 396250.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to the modern General Hospital]]
A multi-million [[euro]] development of the hospital produced a new building, with 8 wards and 243 beds.&lt;ref name=naas&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Naas General Hospital|url=http://naashospital.ie/|publisher=naashospital.ie|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naas General Hospital provides inpatient and outpatient services, 24-hour [[accident and emergency]] services, day procedures, [[radiology]], [[pathology]] and physical medicine, along with many other services and facilities.

'''Northern vigor''' is an effect seen in certain varieties of [[produce]] where varieties of plants grown in northern climates, then moved to southern climates, are hardier, better-producing, and better tasting.&lt;ref name="Ehman2010" /&gt; This effect has been primarily observed in [[potato]]es, but is also seen in [[strawberry|strawberries]]&lt;ref name="usask"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saskfruit.com/pdf/19990185_10920029457.pdf | title=Northern Vigour® of Strawberry Crowns | publisher=[[University of Saskatchewan]] | date=March 2002 | accessdate=2013-06-11 | author=Lokken, J. | author2=Storey, G. | author3=Tanino, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[garlic]].&lt;ref name="Ehman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amy Jo Ehman|title=Prairie Feast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNZ6fbbwMlAC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=28 April 2010|publisher=Coteau Books|isbn=978-1-55050-413-2|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cairn" /&gt; The [[Saskatchewan Seed Potato Growers Association]] has trademarked the term "Northern Vigour" for use with their potatoes,&lt;ref name="Ehman2010" /&gt; but the effect is seen in produce grown throughout Canada and the northern United States.&lt;ref name="cairn" /&gt;

The exact cause of northern vigor is not known, but there are many theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">'''Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember''' is a [[traveling exhibition]] that explores the [[history]] of [[disability]] within the lives of Canadians.

The exhibition was produced in collaboration with students, scholars and [[alumni]] from the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofu.ryerson.ca/about/index.html |title=Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember |publisher=Ryerson University |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition originated from a special topic seminar designed to uncover the hidden history of disability in Canada. Each student identified an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to explore that represented a particular moment in Canadian disability history. Thirteen objects were then selected for the exhibition, revealing [[narratives]] that pay homage to the resilience, creativity, and the civic and cultural contributions of Canadians with disabilities. Accompanying interpretive texts help confront [[stereotypical]] representations of disability such as [[pity]], [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] or [[freak]], helping to illustrate the complexity of disability struggles for social and political acknowledgement, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], survival and remembrance.

Out from Under is curated by three [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members from Ryerson University’s School of [[Disability Studies]].

==Exhibition components==
Each objects’ history is represented by a single word title: Digging, Labouring, Dressing, Fixing, Measuring, Naming, Breathing, Remembering, Packing, Trailblazing, Struggling, Leading and Aspiring.

==Accessibility features==
'''[[American Sign Language]]'''
[[Video]] [[podcast]] of all exhibit text in American Sign Language.

'''[[Audio description]] and [[Touch]] Stations'''
Audio podcasts of all exhibit [[Written language|text]] with detailed audio descriptions and touch stations profiling selected objects.

'''[[Braille]] Booklets'''
Braille copies of exhibit text including [[wikt:participation|participant]] profiles.

==Exhibition catalogue==
A 60-page [[color]] [[Exhibition catalog|catalogue]] entitled “Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember” (2008) was produced by the School of [[Disability Studies]].

The '''Pakistan Medical and Dental Council''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''پاکستان طبی و دندان سازی انجمن'''}}}}; abbreviated as '''PMDC''') is a statutory regulatory authority under the [[Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination]] that maintains the official register of [[physician|medical practitioners]] within [[Pakistan]]. Its chief function is to "''establish uniform minimum standard of basic and higher qualifications in medicine and dentistry throughout Pakistan''" by controlling entry to the PMDC register and suspending or removing members when necessary. It also sets the education standards for [[medical schools in Pakistan]] along with the [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmdc.org.pk/AboutUs/tabid/72/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council was initially established as the ''Pakistan Medical Council'' in 1948, by adopting the ''British Indian Medical Council Act 1933'' on the recommendations of the 1947 Pakistan Health Conference. It was later reorganized under the ''Pakistan Medical Council Act 1951'', whereby each province has its own medical council. In 1957, the West Pakistan Medical Council was formed by merging the Sindh Medical Council and Punjab Medical Council. The ''Pakistan Medical Council Ordinance 1962'' established the present-day Pakistan Medical and Dental Council as a statutory body in 1962 and all provincial councils were dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punjablaws.punjab.gov.pk/public/dr/THE%20MEDICAL%20AND%20DENTAL%20COUNCIL%20ORDINANCE,%201962.doc.pdf|title=The Medical and Dental Council Ordinance - 1962|author=|date=|website=punjab.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three amendments were passed thereafter as the ''Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Act'' in 1973, 1999 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1346053132_545.pdf The Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Act, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
PMDC has been given a mandate to establish uniform medical and dental practice across Pakistan by:
*Prescribing a uniform minimum standard of courses of training for obtaining graduate and post graduate medical and dental qualifications.
*Prescribing minimum requirements for the content and duration of graduate and post graduate medical and dental courses of study.
*Prescribing the conditions for admission of courses of training as aforesaid.
*Prescribing minimum qualification and experience required of teachers for appointment in medical and dental institutions.
*Prescribing the standards of examinations, methods of conducting the examinations.
*Prescribing the qualifications and experience required of examiners for professional examinations.
*Registering faculty and students of all medical and dental institutions.
*Maintaining the ''Register of Medical &amp; Dental Practitioners''.
*Inspecting and formulate recommendations regarding recognition of medical and dental Institutions for training of undergraduate and postgraduate qualification.
*Inspecting undergraduate and postgraduate examination for standardization.
*Deciding cases against registered practitioners for conduct and professional negligence.
*Inspecting and approve hospitals for house job and training.
*Prescribing guidelines for medical and dental journals.
*Issuing experience certificates to faculty.
*Setting up schemes of reciprocity with other countries and medical regulatory authorities.

==Registration==
All medical practitioners and students are required to register with PMDC, to legally practice medicine in Pakistan. The guidelines for registration are outlined under "''Chapter IX, Pakistan Registration of Medical and Dental Practitioners Regulations, 2008''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmdc.org.pk/Admissionrules/PG/tabid/134/Default.aspx|title=Pakistan Medical &amp; Dental Council &gt; Admission rules  &gt; PG|first=Pakistan Medical &amp; Dental|last=Council|date=|website=www.pmdc.org.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical education==
{{main|List of medical schools in Pakistan#Curriculum}}

==Criticism==
Several corruption allegations and scandals have been associated with PMDC. In particular, irregularities in the registration of medical colleges and allegations of wrongdoing in the accreditation of doctors have also been leveled in judicial probes of PMDC’s affairs. A judicial commission was set up under a court order after allegations of embezzlement in the registration of private colleges in 2013 — the commission was headed by former Lahore High Court judge Shabbar Raza Rizvi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.dawn.com/news/1216936 |title= PMDC scandal: Disillusioned with the Hippocratic Oath? |author= Ikram Junaidi, Malik Asad |date= 2 November 2015 |website= dawn.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="876">'''Plastic soup''' is an increasingly widely used term referring to pollution of the environment by plastics in general, ranging from large pieces of fishing gear that can entrap marine animals to the [[microplastics]] and [[nanoplastics]] that result from the breakdown or [[photodegradation]] of plastic waste in surface waters, rivers or oceans. 

The most notorious example of this pollution is the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] (lots more on the science of the subject there), an area in which marine debris has accumulated in an [[ocean gyre]]. It should be pointed out that the density even in that region does not correspond to the public image of floating islands of rubbish; the concentrations are however high enough to be of considerable environmental concern.

As with many countries '''pollution in the United States''' is a concern for [[environmental organization]]s, government agencies and individuals.

==Land==
Examples of land pollution include:
*[[Love Canal]]
*[[Greenpoint oil spill]]
*[[Murphy Oil Spill (Chalmette, Louisiana)]]
*[[Prudhoe Bay oil spill]]

===Superfund===

==Air==
{{main|Air pollution in the United States}}
Air pollution is caused predominantly from, burning fossil fuels, cars and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shapiro | first1 = Susan G. | title = Environment And Global Community | publisher = IDEA | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1932716122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural sources of air pollution include forest fires, volcanic eruptions, wind erosion, pollen dispersal, evaporation of organic compounds, and natural radioactivity. These natural sources of pollution often soon disperses and thins settling near its locale. However, major natural events such as volcanic activity can convey throughout the air spreading, thinning and settling over continents.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler Jr.  Living in the Environment.  Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fossil fuel]] burning for heating, electrical generation, and in motor vehicles are responsible for about 90% of all air pollution in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Paul R.'' 'Environmental Encyclopedia. Acid Rain' ''.  Detroit: Gale Research International Limited, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freshwater===
In a report published in the November 12, 2008 online issue of Environmental Science and Technology, researchers found that freshwater pollution by [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]] costs U.S. government agencies, drinking water facilities and individual Americans at least $4.3 billion annually. Of that, they calculated that $44 million a year is spent just protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/546568/ Freshwater Pollution Costs at Least $4.3 Billion Annually] Newswise, Retrieved on November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide there are numerous [[environmental organization]]s attempting to ban the use of [[polystyrene]].

Polystyrene foam products rely on nonrenewable sources for production, are nearly indestructible and leave a legacy of pollution on our urban and natural environments. If [[McDonald's]] could see the light and phase out polystyrene foam more than a decade ago, it's about time San Francisco got with the program."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/27/BAG5VJKTS91.DTL&amp;hw=styrofoam&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=367 San Francisco Chronicle Article, June 27, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is an agency of the federal government of the United States charged with protecting human health and with safeguarding the natural environment: air, water, and land. The EPA was proposed by President [[Richard Nixon]] and began operation on 2 December 1970, when it was passed by Congress, and signed into law by President Nixon, and has since been chiefly responsible for the environmental policy of the United States.

==Environmental Discrimination==
[[Environmental Justice]] is defined as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies" by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a social movement that aims to ensure all citizens have equal rights and opportunities to reside in a safe environment. The movement began in the 1980s as evidence was mounting that companies were targeting minority and low-income communities. Due to the lack of community action among minorities and low-come, corporations found little resistance when applying to build environmentally polluting factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pastor |first= Manuel|date= 2001|title= Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Environmental-Hazard Exposure in Metropolitan Los Angeles|location= Berkeley, California|publisher= California Policy Research Center|page= 15|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive Order 12898===
On February 11, 1994, President William Clinton signed Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations”. Its purpose was to create the “Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice”. It provided directions to the “Working Group” on how to develop and manage an effective system for preventing environmental injustices. The “Working Group” was made up of various heads of federal agencies and tasked with creating guidelines for reporting, tracking, and developing regulations to curb [[environmental discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mde.state.md.us/programs/CrossMedia/EnvironmentalJustice/WhatisEnvironmentalJustice/Documents/www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12898.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan EJ 2014===
In 2014, EPA has a strategy known as Plan EJ 2014. It is not, however, a rule or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/resources/policy/plan-ej-2014/plan-ej-overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the plan are to:
•	Protect health in communities over-burdened by pollution
•	Empower communities to take action to improve their health and environment
•	Establish partnerships with local, state, tribal and federal organizations to achieve healthy and sustainable communities.

===The Toxic 100===
Common offenders of environmental discrimination are corporations that build environmentally hazardous sites. These are typically waste processing facilities, energy companies such as coal plants, chemical plants, and manufacturers who use specific chemicals known to be hazardous to both the environment and/or human health. Other industries known for being responsible for negatively impacting the United States include transportation and energy mining and drilling. A list called The Toxic 100 is maintained by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] (PERI), an institute at the University off Massachusetts Amherst, of the United States’ top polluters. PERI uses a formula: Emissions (millions of pounds) x Toxicity x Population Exposure. Population is measured by its proximity to nearby residents, as well as, prevailing winds and height of smokestacks. The data on chemical releases come from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxicair_current/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118095633/http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxicair_current/ |archivedate=2015-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polydipsia''' is excessive [[thirst]] or excess drinking.&lt;ref name="pathophys"&gt;Porth, C. M. (1990). ''Pathophysiology: Concepts of altered health states''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|πολυδίψιος}} ({{grc-transl|πολυδίψιος}}) "very thirsty",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|poludi/yios|πολυδίψιος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived from {{lang|grc|πολύς}} ({{grc-transl|πολύς}}, "much, many") + {{lang|grc|δίψα}} ({{grc-transl|δίψα}}, "thirst").  Polydipsia is a nonspecific [[symptom]] in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals]], such as [[Polydipsia in birds|in birds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hamm R.J. |author2=Porter J.H. |author3=Kaempf G.L. | year = 1981 | title = Stimulus generalization of schedule-induced polydipsia | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behaviour | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 93–99 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1981.36-93|pmc=1333055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
This symptom is characteristically found in [[diabetes mellitus|diabetics]], often as one of the initial symptoms, and in those who fail to take their [[anti-diabetic medication]]s or whose condition is poorly controlled. It can also be caused by a change in the [[osmolality]] of the [[extracellular fluid]]s of the body, [[hypokalemia]], decreased [[blood volume]] (as occurs during major [[hemorrhage]]), and other conditions that create a water deficit.&lt;ref name="pathophys" /&gt; This is usually a result of [[osmotic diuresis]]. [[Diabetes insipidus]] ("tasteless" diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia.&lt;ref name="pathophys" /&gt; Polydipsia is also a symptom of [[anticholinergic]] poisoning.  Zinc is also known to reduce symptoms of polydipsia by causing the body to absorb fluids more efficiently (reduction of diarrhea, induces constipation) and it causes the body to retain more sodium; thus a zinc deficiency can be a possible cause. The combination of polydipsia and (nocturnal) [[polyuria]] is also seen in (primary) [[hyperaldosteronism]] (which often goes with hypokalemia).
[[Antipsychotics]] can have side effects such as [[Chlorpromazine#Indications|dry mouth]] that may make the patient feel thirsty.

===Psychogenic and non-psychogenic primary polydipsia===
{{main article|Primary polydipsia}}

Primary polydipsia describes excessive thirst and water intake caused in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both [[Primary polydipsia|psychogenic primary polydipsia]] and non-psychogenic primary polydipsia, such as in patients with [[Autoimmune hepatitis|autoimmune chronic hepatitis]] with severely elevated [[globulin]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobin|first=M. V.|last2=Morris|first2=A. I.|date=1988-04-01|title=Non-psychogenic primary polydipsia in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis with severe hyperglobulinaemia.|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/29/4/548|journal=Gut|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=548–549|doi=10.1136/gut.29.4.548|issn=1468-3288|pmid=3371724|pmc=1433532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychogenic polydipsia is an excessive water intake&lt;ref name="pathophys" /&gt; seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as [[schizophrenia]], and/or the developmentally disabled. It should be taken very seriously, as the amount of water ingested exceeds the amount that can be excreted by the kidneys,&lt;ref name="pathophys" /&gt; and can on rare occasions be life-threatening as the body's [[Sodium#Biological role|serum sodium]] level is diluted to an extent that seizures and cardiac arrest can occur.

While psychogenic polydipsia is generally not found outside the population of serious mental disorders, there is some anecdotal evidence of a milder form (typically called 'habit polydipsia' or 'habit drinking') that can be found in the absence of psychosis or other mental conditions. The excessive levels of fluid intake may result in a false diagnosis of [[diabetes insipidus]], since the chronic ingestion of excessive water can produce diagnostic results that closely mimic those of mild diabetes insipidus.  As discussed in the entry on [[diabetes insipidus]], "Habit drinking (in its severest form termed psychogenic polydipsia) is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated."  However, prior to a water deprivation test, consideration should be given to a psychiatric consult to see whether it is possible to rule out psychogenic polydipsia or habit polydipsia.

==Diagnosis==
Polydipsia is a symptom (evidence of a disease state), not a disease in itself.  As it is often accompanied by [[polyuria]], investigations directed at diagnosing [[diabetes insipidus]] and [[diabetes mellitus]] can be useful.  Blood serum tests can also provide useful information about the osmolality of the body's extracellular fluids. A decrease in osmolality caused by excess water intake will decrease the serum concentration of [[hematocrit|red blood cells]], [[blood urea nitrogen]] (BUN), and sodium.&lt;ref name="pathophys" /&gt;

The '''Prince Mahidol Award''' ({{lang-th|รางวัลสมเด็จเจ้าฟ้ามหิดล}}) is a [[Thailand|Thai]] [[Chakri Dynasty|Royal Family]] annual award for outstanding achievements in medicine and public health worldwide.

== Prince Mahidol Award Foundation ==
[[Rama IX|King Rama IX Bhumibol Adulyadej]] founded the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation on 1 January 1992 on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of his father, [[Mahidol Adulyadej|Prince Mahidol]], initially under the name "Mahidol Award Foundation", but since 28 July 1997 as "Prince Mahidol Award Foundation." In addition to the actual award, the Fund also promotes the memory of Prince Mahidol, who is regarded as the father of modern medicine and public health of Thailand. [[Sirindhorn|Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]] is chairman of the Foundation Committee.

The award is given annually in two categories to international personalities or organizations:
* For outstanding progress in medicine
* For the active promotion of public health


and consists of:
* a medal
* a certificate
* prize money (US $100,000)

Between 1992 and 2014, 70 prizes were awarded, including 32 in medicine and 38 in public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princemahidolaward.org/laureates-year.en.php|title=List of winners|publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Foundation|accessdate=June 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014154444/http://www.princemahidolaward.org/laureates-year.en.php|archive-date=2014-10-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nomination process ===
# Any individual or group of individuals may be nominated by a national governmental agency, or by an individual. Nominations are transmitted to the secretary-general of the Prince Mahidol Award Foundation.
# The nomination forms are forwarded to the Scientific Advisory Committee for initial screening.
# Once screened, the International Award Committee, which comprises several world-renowned experts in the fields of medicine and public health, will consider them and make recommendations to the Foundation’s Board of Trustees.
# The Foundation’s Board of Trustees makes final approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination Procedures|url=http://www.princemahidolaward.org/nomination-procedures.en.php|accessdate=June 9, 2014|publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014111319/http://www.princemahidolaward.org/nomination-procedures.en.php|archive-date=2014-10-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rat Park''' was a series of studies into [[drug addiction]] conducted in the late 1970s and published between 1978 and 1981 by Canadian psychologist [[Bruce K. Alexander]] and his colleagues at [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia, Canada.

Alexander's hypothesis was that drugs do not cause addiction, and that the apparent addiction to [[opiate]] drugs commonly observed in laboratory rats exposed to them is attributable to their living conditions, and not to any addictive property of the drug itself.&lt;ref name=Senate&gt;Alexander, Bruce K., (2001) [http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/alexender-e.htm "The Myth of Drug-Induced Addiction"], a paper delivered to the Canadian Senate, January 2001, retrieved December 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

To test his hypothesis, Alexander built Rat Park, a large housing colony, 200 times the floor area of a standard laboratory cage. There were 16&amp;ndash;20 rats of both sexes in residence, food, balls and wheels for play, and enough space for mating.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;Slater, Lauren. (2004) ''Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the experiment appeared to support his hypothesis. 

The two major science journals, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] and [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], rejected Alexander, Coambs, and Hadaway's first paper, which appeared instead in ''[[Psychopharmacology (journal)|Psychopharmacology]]'' in 1978. The paper's publication initially attracted no response.&lt;ref name=Alexander1&gt;Alexander, B.K., Coambs, R.B., and Hadaway, P.F. (1978). "The effect of housing and gender on morphine self-administration in rats," ''Psychopharmacology'', Vol 58, 175–179. {{PMID|98787}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, Simon Fraser University withdrew Rat Park's funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Bruce Alexander's 2007 Sterling Prize acceptance speech |year=2007|url=https://www.sfu.ca/sterlingprize/recipients/bruce-alexander.html|accessdate=2013-05-10|time=1:05:15-1:10:00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rat Park experiments==
[[Image:Wistar rat.jpg|right|thumb|A white [[Wistar rat|Wistar lab rat]]]]
In Rat Park, the rats could drink a fluid from one of two drop dispensers, which automatically recorded how much each rat drank. One dispenser contained a sweetened [[morphine]] solution and the other plain tap water. Morphine solution was sweetened to reduce averse reaction to the taste of morphine; as a control, prior to morphine introduction rats were offered a sweetened quinine solution instead.

Alexander designed a number of experiments to test the rats' willingness to consume the morphine. The Seduction Experiment involved four groups of rats. Group CC was isolated in laboratory cages when they were weaned at 22 days of age, and lived there until the experiment ended at 80 days of age; Group PP was housed in Rat Park for the same period; Group CP was moved from laboratory cages to Rat Park at 65 days of age; and Group PC was moved out of Rat Park and into cages at 65 days of age.

The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) took to the morphine instantly, even with relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males in one of the experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionally&amp;mdash;with the females trying it more often than the males&amp;mdash;but they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the sweet water, he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior.&lt;ref name=Senate/&gt; Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called [[Naloxone]], which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.

In another experiment, he forced rats in ordinary lab cages to consume the morphine-laced solution for 57 days without other liquid available to drink. When they moved into Rat Park, they were allowed to choose between the morphine solution and plain water. They drank the plain water. He writes that they did show some signs of dependence. There were "some minor withdrawal signs, twitching, what have you, but there were none of the mythic seizures and sweats you so often hear about ..."&lt;ref name=Slater/&gt;

Alexander believes his experiments show that animal self-administration studies provide no empirical support for the theory of drug-induced addiction. "The intense appetite of isolated experimental animals for heroin in self-injection experiments tells us nothing about the responsiveness of normal animals and people to these drugs. Normal people can ignore heroin ... even when it is plentiful in their environment, and they can use these drugs with little likelihood of addiction ... Rats from Rat Park seem to be no less discriminating."&lt;ref name=Senate/&gt;

==Reaction to the experiment==

Two major science journals, [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] and [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], rejected Alexander's results, but they were later accepted and published in ''[[Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior]]''.&lt;ref name=outline&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theoutline.com/post/2205/this-38-year-old-study-is-still-spreading-bad-ideas-about-addiction |title=This 38-Year-Old Study is Still Spreading Bad Ideas About Addiction |last=MacBride |first=Katie |date=September 5, 2017 |website=The Outline |access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies showed mixed results. One of those studies found that both caged and "park" rats showed a decreased preference for morphine, suggesting a genetic difference.&lt;ref name=Petrie&gt;Petrie, B.F., Psychol Rep. 1996, 78, 391–400. {{PMID|9148292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another found that while social isolation can influence levels of heroin self-administration, isolation is not a necessary condition for heroin or cocaine injections to be reinforcing.&lt;ref name=Bozarth&gt;Bozarth MA, Murray A, Wise RA., Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1989 Aug;33(4):903-7. {{PMID|2616610}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other studies reinforced the "Rat Park" findings showing that environmental enrichment reduced cocaine seeking behavior in mice &lt;ref&gt;Chauvet, Claudia et al. “Environmental Enrichment Reduces Cocaine Seeking and Reinstatement Induced by Cues and Stress but Not by Cocaine.” Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology 34.13 (2009): 2767–2778. {{PMID|19741591}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that environmental enrichment can eliminate already established addiction-related behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Solinas et al."Reversal of cocaine addiction by environmental enrichment." Neuropsychopharmacology. 2009 Apr;34(5):1102-11. doi: 10.1038/npp.2008.51. {{PMID|18955698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, removing mice from enriched environments has been shown to increase vulnerability to cocaine addiction &lt;ref&gt;Nader, Joëlle et al. “Loss of Environmental Enrichment Increases Vulnerability to Cocaine Addiction.” Neuropsychopharmacology 37.7 (2012): 1579–1587. {{PMID|22334125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exposure to complex environments during early stages of life produce dramatic changes in the reward systems of the brain that result in reduced reactivity to drugs of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Solinas, M et al. "Environmental enrichment during early stages of life reduces the behavioral, neurochemical, and molecular effects of cocaine." Neuropsychopharmacology. 2009 Apr;34(5):1102-11. doi: 10.1038/npp.2008.51 {{PMID|18463628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3997">{{about|the data collection technique|subjective reporting in media|Media bias}}

In  [[experimental psychology]] and [[medical science]], a '''subjective report''' is information collected from an experimental subject's description of their own experiences, symptoms or histories. Subjective reporting is the act of an individual describing their own [[subjective experience]], following their [[introspection]] on physical or psychological effects under consideration.&lt;ref name="Richardson1999"/&gt; The method of subjective report analysis also encompasses obtaining information from a subject's own recollection, such as verbal case histories, or experiences in the individual's wider daily life.

== Investigative techniques ==

Collection of subjective reports consists simply of asking the subject to reflect on their own individual experience;&lt;ref name="Richardson1999"/&gt; subjective report techniques may vary from open-ended interviews to formal [[questionnaire]]s consisting of specific, response-constrained questions or [[Likert scale|Likert items]], the latter being used in quantitative and qualitative analyses. Whereas evidential, controlled methods of experimentation yield ''objective'' information on processes observable objectively by the experimenter &amp;mdash; that is, the experimenter can observe the given effect externally through some experimental means, such as in [[Problem solving|problem-solving tasks]] or laboratory tests &amp;mdash; analysis via ''subjective'' report obtains the subject's own opinion on a particular task or subject under investigation&lt;ref name="Richardson1999"/&gt; and allows study of effects outside of the scope of controlled clinical analysis.

== Applications of subjective report analysis ==

Fields that rely heavily on subjective report include [[social psychology]]; studies of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] (the best known of subjective report studies in this field being the ''[[Kinsey Reports]]''&lt;ref name="Ericksen1998"/&gt;); [[Pharmacology|pharmacological trials]] of [[Psychiatric medication|psychiatric]] and [[analgesic]] (pain relief) medication; and [[ethnography]], the study of cultures and cultural processes as part of [[social science]]. A 2003 experimental study by Coghill ''et al'' determined that subjective reports of [[pain]] were capable of being correlated statistically to [[neuroimaging]] data, verifying the reports as being, for the most part, sufficiently accurate for clinical purposes.&lt;ref name="Coghill2003"/&gt; Issues of veracity of subjective reports can, however, be a limiting factor in using them to draw experimental conclusions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12018">The '''Virtual Physiological Human''' ('''VPH''') is a European initiative that focuses on a methodological and technological framework that, once established, will enable collaborative investigation of the human body as a single [[complex system]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapworthy et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap STEP research road map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828022132/http://www.europhysiome.org/roadmap |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective framework will make it possible to share resources and observations formed by institutions and organizations, creating disparate but integrated [[computer models]] of the mechanical, physical and [[biochemical]] functions of a living human body.

VPH is a framework which aims to be descriptive, integrative and predictive.&lt;ref name="Fenner2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fenner JW, Brook B, Clapworthy G, Coveney PV, Feipel V, Gregersen H, etal | title=The EuroPhysiome, STEP and a roadmap for the virtual physiological human. | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | year= 2008 | volume= 366 | issue= 1878 | pages= 2979–99 | pmid=18559316

The framework is formed by large collections of [[anatomy|anatomical]], [[physiology|physiological]], and [[pathology|pathological]] data stored in digital format, typically by predictive simulations developed from these collections and by services intended to support researchers in the creation and maintenance of these models, as well as in the creation of end-user technologies to be used in the clinical practice. VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling).&lt;ref name="Fenner2008"/&gt; These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a [[reductionism|reductionist]] approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by [[scientific discipline]] ([[biology]], [[physiology]], [[biophysics]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[bioengineering]]) or anatomical sub-system ([[cardiovascular]], musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).&lt;ref name="Clapworthy2008"/&gt;

==History==

The initial concepts that led to the Virtual Physiological Human initiative came from the [[Physiome Project|IUPS Physiome Project]]. The project was started in 1997 and represented the first worldwide effort to define the [[physiome]] through the development of databases and models which facilitated the understanding of the integrative function of cells, organs, and organisms.&lt;ref name="HunterBorg2003"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hunter PJ, Borg TK | title=Integration from proteins to organs: the Physiome Project. | journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol | year= 2003 | volume= 4 | issue= 3 | pages= 237–43 | pmid=12612642 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=12612642 | doi=10.1038/nrm1054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project focused on compiling and providing a central repository of databases that would link experimental information and computational models from many laboratories into a single, self-consistent framework.

Following the launch of the Physiome Project, there were many other worldwide initiatives of loosely coupled actions all focusing on the development of methods for modelling and simulation of human pathophysiology. In 2005, an expert workshop of the Physiome was held as part of the Functional Imaging and Modelling of the Heart Conference in Barcelona where a white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Ayache N, Boissel JP, Brunak S, Clapworthy G, Lonsdale G, Fingberg J, Frangi A, Deco G, Hunter P, Nielsen P, Halstead M, Hose R, Magnin I, Martin-Sanchez F, Sloot P, Kaandorp J, Hoekstra A, Van Sint Jan S, Viceconti M |url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/health/docs/events/barcelona2005/ec-vph-white-paper2005nov.pdf |title=Towards virtual physiological human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology |format=PDF | publisher = edited by DG INFSO &amp; DG JRC |date= November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''Towards Virtual Physiological Human: Multilevel modelling and simulation of the human anatomy and physiology'' was presented. The goal of this paper was to shape a clear overview of on-going relevant VPH activities, to build a consensus on how they can be complemented by new initiatives for researchers in the EU and to identify possible mid-term and long term research challenges.

In 2006, the European Commission funded a coordination and support action entitled ''STEP: Structuring The EuroPhysiome''. The STEP consortium promoted a significant consensus process that involved more than 300 stakeholders including researchers, industry experts, policy makers, clinicians, etc.  The prime result of this process was a booklet entitled ''Seeding the EuroPhysiome: A Roadmap to the Virtual Physiological Human''.&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt; The STEP action and the resulting research roadmap were instrumental in the development of the VHP concept and in the initiation of much larger process that involves significant research funding, large collaborative projects, and a number of connected initiatives, not only in Europe but also in the United States, Japan, and China.

VPH now forms a core target of the 7th Framework Programme&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ 7th Framework Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]], and aims to support the development of patient-specific computer models and their application in personalised and predictive healthcare.&lt;ref name="KohlNoble2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kohl P, Noble D | title=Systems biology and the virtual physiological human. | journal=Mol Syst Biol | year= 2009 | volume= 5 | issue=  1| page= 292 | pmid=19638973 | doi=10.1038/msb.2009.51 | pmc=2724980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Virtual Physiological Human Network of Excellence (VPH NoE) aims to connect the various VPH projects within the 7th Framework Programme.

==Goals of the initiative==

VPH-related projects have received substantial funding from the European Commission in order to further scientific progress in this area. The European Commission is insistent that VPH-related projects demonstrate strong industrial participation and clearly indicate a route from basic science into clinical practice.&lt;ref name="Clapworthy2008"/&gt; In the future, it is hoped that the VPH will eventually lead to a better healthcare system which aims to produce the following benefits:&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt;

* personalized care solutions
* reduced need for experiments on animals
* more holistic approaches to medicine
* preventative approaches to treatment of disease

Personalized care solutions are a key aim of the VPH, with new modelling environments for predictive, individualized healthcare to result in better patient safety and drug efficacy. It is anticipated that the VPH could also result in healthcare improvement through greater understanding of pathophysiological processes.&lt;ref name="Fenner2008"/&gt; The use of biomedical data from a patient to simulate potential treatments and outcomes could prevent the patient from experiencing unnecessary or ineffective treatments.&lt;ref name="Sadiq2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadiq SK, Mazzeo MD, Zasada SJ, Manos S, Stoica I, Gale CV, etal | title=Patient-specific simulation as a basis for clinical decision-making. | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | year= 2008 | volume= 366 | issue= 1878 | pages= 3199–219 | pmid=18573758 |  url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18573758 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of in silico (by computer simulation) modelling and testing of drugs could also reduce the need for experiments on animals.

A future goal is that there will be also be a more holistic approach to medicine with the body treated as a single multi-organ system rather than as a collection of individual organs. Advanced integrative tools should further help to improve the European healthcare system on a number of different levels that include diagnosis, treatment and care of patients and in particular quality of life.&lt;ref name="europhysiome1"/&gt;

==Projects==
* ImmunoGrid is a project funded by the EU under Framework 6, to model and simulate the human [[immune system]] using [[grid computing]] at different physiological levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImmunoGrid - The European virtual human immune system project|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/79503_en.html|publisher=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service :|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zygote intrafallopian transfer''' ('''ZIFT''') is an [[infertility treatment]] used when a blockage in the [[fallopian tube]]s prevents the normal binding of sperm to the egg. [[Egg cells]] are removed from a woman's [[ovaries]], and [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilised]]. The resulting [[zygote]] is placed into the [[fallopian tube]] by the use of [[laparoscopy]]. The procedure is a spin-off of the [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]] (GIFT) procedure. {{Citation needed span|text=ZIFT has a success rate of 64.8% in all cases.|date=September 2011}}

==Procedure==
The average ZIFT cycle takes five weeks-six weeks to complete. First, the female must take a [[fertility medication]] clomiphene to [[ovulation induction|stimulate egg production]] in the ovaries. The doctor will monitor the growth of the [[ovarian follicles]], and once they are mature, the woman will receive an injection containing [[human chorionic gonadotropin]]s (HCG or hCG). The eggs will be harvested approximately 36 hours later, usually by [[transvaginal ovum retrieval]]. After fertilization in the laboratory, the resulting early embryos or zygotes are placed into the woman's fallopian tubes using a [[laparoscope]].

==Indications==
ZIFT has been used in infertility situations where at least one of the fallopian tubes is normal and other treatments have failed; however, the need for two interventions and the fact that [[IVF]] results are equal or better (as of 2004), leaves few indications for this procedure. Accordingly, the number of ZIFTs performed has been declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toner JP| title=Progress we can be proud of: U.S. trends in assisted reproduction over the first 20 years. |journal=Fertil.
