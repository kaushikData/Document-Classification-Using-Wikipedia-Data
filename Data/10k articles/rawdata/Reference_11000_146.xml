The '''''Almanach de Gotha''''' ({{lang-de|Gothaischer Hofkalender}}) was a directory of Europe's [[Royal family|royalty]] and higher [[nobility]], also including the major [[government]]al, [[military]] and [[diplomatic corps|diplomatic]] [[corps]], as well as statistical data by country. First published in 1763 by C.W. Ettinger in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] in [[Thuringia]], Germany, at the [[duke|ducal]] [[court]] of [[Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Frederick III]], Duke of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], it came to be regarded as an authority in the classification of monarchies and their courts, reigning and former dynasties, princely and ducal families, and the genealogical, biographical and titulary details of Europe's highest level of aristocracy. It was published from 1785 annually by [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|Justus Perthes]] Publishing House in Gotha, until 1944. The [[Soviet]]s destroyed the ''Almanach de Gotha's'' archives in 1945.

In 1998, a London-based publisher acquired the rights for use of the title of ''Almanach de Gotha'' from Justus Perthes Verlag Gotha GmbH. Perthes regard the resultant volumes as new works, and not as a continuation of the editions which Perthes had published from 1785 to 1944.&lt;ref name=Perthes&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perthes.de/geschichte_justus_perthes/almanach_de_gotha/almanach_de_gotha_english.html |title=Almanach de Gotha |accessdate=9 June 2008 |publisher=Justus Perthes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new volumes have been widely criticized for inaccuracies and errors &lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.economist.com/node/949183 |title=Gothic Horror |accessdate=6 July 2017 |publisher=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two volumes have been printed since 1998, with Volume I containing lists of the sovereign, formerly sovereign and [[mediatisation|mediatised]] houses of Europe, and a diplomatic and statistical directory; and Volume II containing lists of the non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe.

==Gotha publication, 1763–1944==
The original ''Almanach de Gotha'' provided detailed facts and statistics on nations of the world, including their [[reign]]ing and formerly reigning houses, those of [[Europe]] being more complete than those of other continents. It also named the highest incumbent [[Great Officer of State (disambiguation)|officers of state]], members of the [[diplomatic corps]], and Europe's upper nobility with their families. Although at its most extensive the ''Almanach'' numbered more than 1200 pages, fewer than half of which were dedicated to monarchical or aristocratic data,&lt;ref name="gotha"&gt;Almanach de Gotha. [[Justus Perthes]], Gotha, 1944, pp. 7-12, 131, 169, 363-364, 558, 581-584. French.&lt;/ref&gt; it acquired a reputation for the breadth and precision of its information on royalty and nobility compared to other [[almanac]]s.&lt;ref name="diesbach"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secrets of the Gotha|last=de Diesbach|first=Ghislain|authorlink = Ghislain de Diesbach|year=1967|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|location=UK|pages=21, 23–24, 28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:London Library book, Gothaisches Genealogisches Taschenbuch der Freiherrlichen Häuser, 1910, Justus Perthes, Gotha.jpg|thumb|[[London Library]]'s copy of ''Gothaisches Genealogisches Taschenbuch der Freiherrlichen Häuser'', 1910.]]
The ''Almanach'''s publication by [[Justus Perthes]] began at the ducal court of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in Germany and, its reigning dynasty was listed first therein well into the 19th century, usually followed by kindred sovereigns of the [[House of Wettin]] and then, in alphabetical order, other families of princely rank, ruling and non-ruling. Although always published in French, other almanacs in French and English were more widely sold internationally. The almanac's structure changed and its scope expanded over the years. The second portion, called the ''Annuaire diplomatique et statistique'' ("Diplomatic and Statistical Yearbook"), provided [[demography|demographic]] and governmental information by nation, similar to other [[almanac]]s. Its first portion, called the ''Annuaire généalogique'' ("Genealogical Yearbook"), came to consist essentially of three sections: reigning and formerly reigning families, [[mediatization|mediatized families]] and non-sovereign families at least one of whose members bore the title of prince or duke.&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt;

The first section always listed Europe's [[sovereignty|sovereign]] houses, whether they ruled as emperor, king, grand duke, duke, prince (or some other title, e.g., [[prince elector]], [[margrave]], [[landgrave]], [[count palatine]] or [[pope]]). Until 1810 these sovereign houses were listed alongside such families and entities as Barbiano-Belgiojoso, Clary, Colloredo, Furstenberg, the Emperor, Genoa, Gonzaga, Hatzfeld, Jablonowski, Kinsky, Ligne, Paar, Radziwill, Starhemberg, Thurn and Taxis, Turkey, Venice and the [[Order of Malta]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]]. In 1812, these entries began to be listed in groups.&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt; First were German sovereigns who held the rank of grand duke or prince elector and above (the Duke of Saxe-Gotha was, however, listed here along with, but before, France—see below).

Listed next were Germany's reigning ducal and princely dynasties under the heading "College of Princes", e.g., [[Hohenzollern]], [[County of Isenburg|Isenburg]], [[Leyen]], [[Liechtenstein]] and the other [[Ernestine duchies|Saxon duchies]]. They were followed by heads of non-German monarchies, i.e. Austria, Brazil, Great Britain, etc. Fourthly were listed non-reigning dukes and princes, whether mediatized or not, including [[Arenberg]], [[House of Croÿ|Croy]], [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Furstenberg]] alongside [[Batthyany]], [[Jablonowski]], [[Sulkowski]], Porcia and [[Prince of Benevento|Benevento]].

In 1841 a third group was added to those of the sovereign dynasties and the non-reigning princely and ducal families. It was composed exclusively of the mediatized families of comital rank recognized as belonging, since 1825, to the same historical category and sharing some of the same privileges as reigning dynasties by the various states of the [[German Confederation]]; these families were German with a few exceptions (e.g. [[Bentinck]], [[Van Rechteren|Rechteren-Limpurg]]). The 1815 treaty of the [[Congress of Vienna]] had authorized — and Article 14 of the German Confederation's ''Bundesakt'' (charter) recognized — retention from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] regime of [[Royal intermarriage|equality of birth]] for marital purposes of mediatized families (called ''Standesherren'') to reigning dynasties.&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt; The almanac added a third section consisting exclusively of mediatized families of comital rank.

In 1877, the mediatized comital families were moved from section III to section II A, where they joined the princely mediatized families. For the first time in the century of its existence, the largely non-German, un-mediatized princely and ducal families of the ''Almanach de Gotha'' were removed from the same section as other non-reigning families bearing princely titles.&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt; While non-mediatized German and Austrian families (e.g. [[Prince Lichnowsky|Lichnowsky]], [[Wrede]]), were likewise relocated from the almanac's second to its third section, the second section's new preponderance of German families, princely and comital, which were henceforth recognized as possessing the exclusive privilege of inter-marriage with reigning dynasties was salient:&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt; Excluded were members of such historically notable families as the [[House of Rohan|Rohan]]s, [[Orsini]]s, [[Duke of Ursel|Ursels]], [[Duke of Norfolk|Norfolks]], [[Czartoryski]]s, [[Galitzine]]s, [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld|La Rochefoucaulds]], [[House of Kinsky|Kinskys]], [[Radziwiłł family|Radziwills]], [[De Mérode|Merodes]], [[Dohna (Disambiguation)#People|Dohnas]] and [[Duke of Alba|Albas]].

Although theoretically mediatized families were distinguished from Europe's other nobility by the former status of their territories as ''[[Imperial State|Reichsstand]]'' and their exercise within the Holy Roman Empire of "semi-sovereignty" or [[imperial immediacy]] (''Reichsunmittelbarkeit''), many ''Standesherr'' families, especially those bearing the [[count|comital]] title, had not been fully recognized as legally possessing immediate status within the Empire prior to its collapse in 1806. No other families whose highest title was count were admitted to any section of the almanac.&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt;

Moreover, other [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] European dynasties (e.g. [[House of Arenberg|Arenberg]], [[Ernst-Johann Biron, Prince of Courland|Biron]], [[Dadiani]], [[Boncompagni]]-[[Ludovisi (family)|Ludovisi]], [[Giray dynasty|Giray]], [[House of Murat|Murat]]) did not benefit ''vis-a-vis'' the almanac from a similar interpretation of their historical status. Many princely or ducal families were listed only in its third, non-dynastic section or were excluded altogether, evoking criticism in the 20th century from such genealogists as [[Cyril Toumanoff]], [[Jean-Engelbert d'Arenberg|Jean-Engelbert, Duke d'Arenberg]] and [[William Addams Reitwiesner]],&lt;ref&gt;Fra Cyril Toumanoff, "Genealogical Imperialism" (1985) vol 6 (no 134) (NS) Coat of Arms pp. 145, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duke and Prince Jean Engelbert d'[[Arenberg]], "The Lesser Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in the Napoleonic Era" dissertation, Washington, DC, 1950, published as Les Princes du St-Empire à l'époque napoléonienne (Louvain, 1951) 15ff, quoted in Almanach de Gotha (Almanach de Gotha, London, 1998) pp. 275–286.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter commenting that the changes displayed "pan-German triumphalism" and even a "fairly nasty bit of Germanic chauvinism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.wargs.com/essays/mediatize.html |title= Mediatization |accessdate= 19 April 2011 |last= Reitwiesner |first= William Addams |date=January 1998 |authorlink= William Addams Reitwiesner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the early 19th century the almanac's retention of [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] dynasties evoked objections, although not necessarily the desired changes. The elected Emperor [[Napoleon]] protested in writing to his foreign minister, [[Jean-Baptiste Nompère de Champagny|Champagny]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Monsieur de Champagny, this year's "Almanach de Gotha" is badly done. First comes the Comte de Lille [title used in exile by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis de Bourbon, Count of Provence]] -- future King Louis XVIII of France], followed by all the princes of the [[Confederation of the Rhine|Confederation]] as if no change has been made in the constitution of Germany; the family of France is named inappropriately therein. Summon the Minister of Gotha, who is to be made to understand that in the next Almanach all of this is to be changed. The House of France must be referred to as in the [French] Imperial Almanac; there must be no further mention of the Comte de Lille, nor of any German prince other than those retained by the Articles of Confederation of the Rhine. You are to insist that the article be transmitted to you prior to publication. If other almanacs are printed in my allies' realms with inappropriate references to the Bourbons and the House of France, instruct my ministers to make it known that you have taken note, and that this is to be changed by next year.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ScM3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=Napol%C3%A9on+13275+Champagny&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W7-5U8PHMpHooATfkYCoBg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Napol%C3%A9on%2013275%20Champagny&amp;f=false |title= Correspondance de Napoléon I|volume=XVI |publisher=Imprimerie Impériale|date=1864|location=France|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The response of the publishers was to humour Napoleon by producing two editions: one for France, with the recently ennobled, and another which included dynasties deposed since abolition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A merged version, whose first section including recently reigning dynasties but also families which lost sovereignty after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, remained in publication until 1944, and has been replicated in subsequent dynastic compilations (e.g., ''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser'', ''Le Petit Gotha'', Ruvigny's "Titled Nobility of Europe").

In 1887 the ''Almanach'' began to include non-European dynasties in its first section, with the inclusion of one of the ruling families of India.

===World War II and aftermath===
When Soviet troops entered [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] in 1945, they systematically destroyed all archives of the ''Almanach de Gotha''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1951 a different publisher, C.A. Starke, began publication of a multi-volume German-language publication entitled the ''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels'' ([[:de:Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels|GHdA]]). The publication is divided into subsets; the ''Fürstliche Häuser'' subset is largely equivalent to the German language ''Gothaischer Hofkalender'' and its ''Fürstlichen Häuser'' volume which was also published by Perthes, or sections 1, 2 and 3 of the ''Almanach de Gotha''. However, no single volume of the ''Fürstliche Häuser'' includes all the families included in the ''Hofkalender'' or ''Almanach de Gotha''. It is necessary to use multiple volumes to trace the majority of European royal families.

==London publication, since 1998==

In 1989 the family of [[Justus Perthes]] re-established its right to the use of the name ''Almanach de Gotha''. The family then sold these rights in 1995 to a new company, Almanach de Gotha Limited, formed in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/L-60158-1601227 Notice of Disclaimer]&lt;/ref&gt; The new publishers launched with the 182nd edition on 16 March 1998 at [[Claridge's Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.almanachdegotha.com/site/modern.htm|title=The Modern Gotha |accessdate=30 May 2008 |publisher=Almanach de Gotha |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211154624/http://www.almanachdegotha.com/site/modern.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jury, Louise.

The London publisher produced a further four editions of volume I (1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004) based on the 1998 edition of volume I which include Europe's and South America's reigning, formerly reigning, and mediatised princely houses, and a single edition of volume II in 2001 edited by John Kennedy and Ghislain Crassard which include other non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe.&lt;ref name="Hardman"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1317982/Family-almanac-will-unmask-the-noble-pretenders.html|title=Family almanac will unmask the noble pretenders|last=Hardman|first=Robert|date=19 June 2001|work=|accessdate=6 June 2008|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' criticised the low editorial standards and attacked volume II for a lack of genealogical accuracy.&lt;ref name=review_economist&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Almanach de Gotha -- Gothic horror | url=http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=949183 | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date = 24 January 2002 | accessdate=7 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a gap of eight years a new edition of volume I was published in 2012 under the editorship of John James.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13798 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708090622/http://www.boydellandbrewer.com/store/viewitem.asp?idproduct=13798 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2011 |title=Almanach de Gotha 2012.

==Structure==
As it was the practice of the diplomatic corps to employ official titles, adhere to local [[Order of precedence|precedence]] and etiquette, and to tender congratulations and condolences to members of the dynasty of the nation to which they were assigned, the almanac included a ''Calendrier des Diplomates'' ("Diplomats' Calendar") section, which detailed major national holidays, anniversaries, ceremonies and royal birthdates.&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt;

Following [[World War I]] and the fall of many [[royal house]]s, fewer regulatory authorities remained to authenticate use of titles; however the ''Almanach de Gotha'' continued the practice of strict verification of information, requesting certified copies of [[letters patent]], genealogies confirmed by competent authorities, documents, decrees and references for titles claimed.&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt; Europe's middle and lower nobility (families whose principal title ranked below that of prince or duke&amp;nbsp;— except [[German mediatisation|mediatized]] families, listed in a section of their own) were not included in the almanac. Nor were the [[grandee]]s or [[Portuguese dukedoms|ducal families]] of Portugal and Spain (where titles, being habitually transmissible through both male and [[cognatic|female lines]], were often inherited by relatives of non-[[patrilineality|patrilineal]] lineage). Families of some Italian and East European nations (e.g., Russia, Romania), where the princely title was claimed by many, were also incomplete. Yet the reigning, formerly reigning and noble families included in the almanac numbered in the hundreds by the time it ceased publication in 1944.&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt;

In 1890 the almanac renamed II A to section II, and II B to section III. Dynasties ruling non-European nations were located in section I B. Families which became extinct were listed for the final time in the year following death of the last member, male or female, and subsequent editions referred readers to that volume.&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt;

Families that ceased to be included for other reasons, such as lack of proof of a family's legitimate descendants or discovery that it did not hold a valid princely or ducal title, were henceforth excluded but added, along with dates of previous insertion, to a list following the last section of each ''Annuaire Genealogique'' (Genealogical Yearbook), which page was entitled ''Liste des Maisons authrefois publiees dans la 3e partie de l'Almanach de Gotha'' ("List of Houses formerly published in the 3rd section of the ''Almanach de Gotha''.") &lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt;

From 1927, the almanac ceased to include all families in each year's edition, henceforth rotating entries every few years. Where titles and [[style (manner of address)|style]]s (such as [[Serene Highness]]) had ceased to be recognized by national governments (e.g. Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia), the almanac provided associated dates and details, but continued to attribute such titles and styles to individuals and families, consistent with its practice since the [[French revolution]]; deposed sovereigns and dynasties continued to be accorded their former titles and rank, but dates of deposition were noted,&lt;ref name="diesbach"/&gt; and titles exclusively associated with sovereignty (e.g. emperor, queen, grand duke, crown princess) were not accorded to those who had not borne them during the monarchy. Titles of [[pretender|pretence]] below sovereign rank were accorded to members of formerly reigning dynasties as reported by heads of their houses, otherwise self-assumed titles were not used. The almanac included an explicit disclaimer announcing that known biographical details, such as birthdates and divorces, would not be suppressed.&lt;ref name="gotha"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9803">The '''Bogardus social distance scale''' is a [[psychological testing]] [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]] created by [[Emory S. Bogardus]] to empirically measure people's willingness to participate in social contacts of varying degrees of closeness with members of diverse social groups, such as racial and [[ethnic groups]].

The scale asks people the extent to which they would be accepting of each group (a score of 1.00 for a group is taken to indicate no social distance):
* As close relatives by marriage (''i.e.'', as the legal spouse of a close relative) (score 1.00)
* As my close personal friends (2.00)
* As neighbors on the same street (3.00)
* As co-workers in the same occupation (4.00)
* As citizens in my country (5.00)
* As non-citizen visitors in my country (6.00)
* Would [[social exclusion|exclude]] from entry into my country (7.00)

The Bogardus social distance scale is a cumulative scale (a [[Guttman scale]]), because agreement with any item implies agreement with all preceding items.

Research by Bogardus first in 1925 and then repeated in 1946, 1956, and 1966 shows that the extent of social distancing in the US is decreasing slightly and fewer distinctions are being made among groups. The study was also replicated in 2005. The results supported the existence of this tendency, showing that the mean level of social distance has been decreasing comparing with the previous studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrillo | first1 = Vincent N. | last2 = Donoghue | first2 = Christopher | year = 2005 | title = Updating the Bogardus social distance studies: a new national survey | url = | journal = The Social Science Journal | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 257–271 | doi = 10.1016/j.soscij.2005.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A web-based questionnaire has been running since late 1993. Internet users are encouraged to submit their responses [http://socialdistancesurvey.com/sdsurvey.html here] where the maintainer of this site has posted at least two papers that update research on social distance.

For Bogardus, social distance is a function of affective distance between the members of two groups: ‘‘[i]n social distance studies the center of attention is on the feeling reactions of persons toward other persons and toward groups of people.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogardus | first1 = E. S. | year = 1947 | title = Measurement of Personal-Group Relations | url = | journal = Sociometry | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 306–311 | doi=10.2307/2785570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for him, social distance is essentially a measure of how much or little [[sympathy]] the members of a group feel for another group.

==Criticisms==
* The assumption of a universally applicable ordering of options and, with it, the assumption of its implication that rankings are interpersonally comparable lead to the following potential problems:

:* First, individual options within the scale may be [[Granularity#Data granularity|insufficiently refined]], with the effect that a respondent's ordering of options may be different for different subtypes of one or more options presented as undifferentiated.

::* For example, given a respondent's personal history of differing power relationships with different types of close family members, a respondent might consider him/herself bound to accept a divorced or widowed parent's choice to marry a member of a disfavored group while being indifferent toward the prospect of a sibling's marrying a member of that group and objecting to the prospect of a child's marrying a member of that group.

::* In addition, differing levels of attachment to different immediate-family members may prompt different responses:  A respondent who believes associating with members of a given group to be detrimental might simultaneously ''a'') object to the prospect of a group member's marriage to an immediate family member for whom the respondent retains strong affection, ''b'') be indifferent to or grudgingly accept that group member's marriage to an immediate family member with whom the respondent has little contact, and ''c'') welcome the supposed harm that the respondent anticipates that marriage to that group member will inflict on an immediate family member toward whom the respondent bears animosity.

:* Second, the cumulative status of the scale as presented is vulnerable to individual, subcultural, and cultural differences in the relative positions of these items, as well as to changes in those orderings since the scale's development.

::* Differences in the ordering of these items decrease the [[inter-rater reliability]] of any individual survey conducted at a given time.

:::* For example, an individual who is estranged from his or her close family members may care less about whom they marry than about who is in his or her circle of close friends, and a respondent whose poor social skills and/or social anxiety limit the respondent's ability to initiate friendships may welcome anyone who comes the respondent's way despite that person's membership in a group disfavored by the respondent.

:::* The larger the number of persons who place these items in different orders, the less strongly representative of the community is the ordering favored by a majority or plurality of surveyed individuals.  This problem includes but is not limited to the "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" multicultural scenario in which subsets of a given overall community are internally relatively homogeneous but retain characteristics that distinguish them from other subsets of that overall community.

::* The longer the time interval between surveys in a series, the more vulnerable cross-temporal surveys are to changes in the ordering that constitutes the metric used to evaluate a given survey's results and the changes between successive surveys.

:::* For example, in cultures in which average social interaction between members of the same geographic community has decreased since the scale's development (as studies such as Robert Putnam's "[[Bowling Alone]]" have suggested with respect to the U.S.), a significant number of persons may interact more with their co-workers than with their physical neighbors, and for these people a disfavored group member's presence in the same workplace may be more objectionable than that member's residence on the same street would be.

:::* Likewise, especially for younger generations, whose members are on average more geographically mobile than were their elders at a comparable age, a significant number of persons may interact more with their friends, co-workers, and/or neighbors than with their siblings-, parents-, and/or children-in-law, with the effect that a respondent may envision him/herself being less bothered on a daily basis by having a disfavored group member as a relative-in-law than s/he would by having that individual as a co-worker or neighbor.  In addition, a respondent who prefers not to associate with members of certain groups but respects others' freedom of association may accept a close relative's choice of a disfavored group member as a spouse even when that respondent would refuse to consider choosing the group member to be one of his or her own close friends.

:* Third, the assumption of an equal difference in quantitative social distance between the various options complicates any effort at generalization and/or comparison, whether in intrapersonal or interpersonal comparisons and whether for time-specific, longitudinal, or intervalic surveys.

::* For example, if a respondent considers the difference in social distance between "3" and "4" to be more or less than the difference between "5" and "6," it would likely be inaccurate to infer that a disfavored group at level "6" is twice as distant as a disfavored group at level "3," and even if two respondents agree on the quantitative level of distance associated with each option, it would be inaccurate to average a "2" response from one and a "6" response from the other as a "4."

::* This difficulty is compounded when different individuals assign different absolute levels of distance to, and with them different absolute amounts of difference between, given options in the scale.

* Bogardus’s conceptualization is not the only one in the sociological literature. Several sociologists have pointed out that social distance can also be conceptualized on the basis of other parameters such as the frequency of interaction between different groups or the normative distinctions in a society about who should be considered an "insider" or "outsider."&lt;ref&gt;Karakayali, Nedim. 2009. "Social Distance and Affective Orientations." ''Sociological Forum'', vol. 23, n.3, pp. 538–562, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The scale has been criticized as oversimplified because social interactions and attitudes in close familial or friendship-type relationships may for at least some persons be qualitatively different from social interactions with and attitudes toward relationships with far-away contacts such as citizens or visitors in one's country.

The '''Buttolph–Williams House''' is a [[historic house museum]] at 249 Broad Street in [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]].  Built in 1711, it is one of the oldest surviving houses in the town.  It is owned by [[Connecticut Landmarks]], a historic preservation organization, and is open for regular tours between May and October.  it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1968 for its significance as an extremely well-preserved example of early colonial architecture.

==Description and history==
The Buttolph–Williams House is a 2-1/2 story timber frame structure, three bays wide and one deep, with a steeply pitched side-gable roof and a large central chimney.  A 1-1/2 story addition, with its own chimney, extends to the rear of the house.  The main entrance, centered on the front facade, is unadorned.  The other  bays of the main facade are filled with diamond-pane windows that are a reconstruction of the original size and placement of windows when the house was built.  The upper story hangs over the lower one by a few inches, built in a way that indicates it is a false overhang done for decorative rather than architectural reasons.  The siding is reproduction split wood siding, manufactured in the 20th century using techniques similar to those employed at the turn of the 18th century.  The interior has also undergone a careful restoration, and now houses furnishings and artifacts appropriate to the period of its construction.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=68000048}}|title=NHL nomination for Buttolph–Williams House|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Photo set to accompany text of NRHP Inventory-Nomination document for Buttolph–Williams House: 4 photos, exterior, from 1974 and 1967.|url={{NHLS url|id=68000048|photos=y}} |format=pdf|author=Unnamed|date=n.d.|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Buttolph-Williams House - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The house after restoration, in 2009]]
Although once thought to have been built between 1692 and 1698,&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt; more recent research has dated its construction to c. 1711.  The house underwent a careful restoration in 1947, led by architect Frederick C. Palmer, in which much of its original material was preserved.  The property opened as a museum in 1951, and is now operated by the nearby [[Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum]], although ownership remains with Connecticut Landmarks.&lt;ref name=ctl/&gt;  The house plays a role in the [[Newbery Medal]]-winning book ''[[The Witch of Blackbird Pond]]'', by [[Elizabeth George Speare]].&lt;ref name=ctl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlandmarks.org/content/buttolph-williams-house|title=Buttolph–Williams House|publisher=The Antiquarian &amp; Landmarks Society|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

The '''Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] non-profit organization, which acquires, preserves and provides public access to material on the history of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] and [[queer]] communities in Canada and internationally.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-s-gay-archive-getting-an-upgrade-1.3921914 "Toronto's gay archive getting an upgrade"]. [[CBC News]], January 5, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], it is the largest independent LGBTQ+ archive in the world.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt;

==History==
The Archives were established in 1973 by ''[[The Body Politic (magazine)|The Body Politic]]'''s editorial collective (also known as the [[Pink Triangle Press]]). Originally named the '''Canadian Gay Liberation Movement Archives''', the organization became the '''Canadian Gay Archives''' in 1975; established a separate collective in 1976; incorporated in 1980; received Charitable status in 1981; formed a board of directors in 1992; and adopted its current name in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield, R. (2015). The Emergence, Development and Survival of Four Lesbian and Gay Archives (Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation). University of Toronto, Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning as a one-cupboard reference collection co-housed with [[Pink Triangle Press]], the Archives relocated to an independent location on Temperance Street in downtown Toronto in 1992.

In November 2005, the CLGA moved to a temporary location at 65 Wellesley Street in the city's [[Church and Wellesley]] [[gay village]], launched a fundraising campaign, and began the search for a permanent home in the same area. The historic Jared Sessions house at 34 Isabella Street,built in 1860,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobuilt.ca/php/browseoldest.php?page=145|title=TOBuilt: Toronto's Oldest Buildings|website=www.tobuilt.ca|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005234623/http://www.tobuilt.ca/php/browseoldest.php?page=145#|archive-date=2016-10-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was donated to the Archives by the city's [[Children's Aid Society]] after CAS began construction on a newer, larger building next door. After major renovations to 34 Isabella Street, the '''Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives''' re-opened in September 2009. In December 2016, the Archives received a $50,000 grant from [[Toronto City Council]] to improve the building's accessibility for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt;

Today the Archives host a reading room and rare book library, vertical file room, offices, AV room, and gallery space for exhibitions. Additional holdings remain at 65 Wellesley and in deep storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://clgaengagement.blogspot.com/2009/09/34-isabella-street-grand-opening.html|title= 34 Isabella Street Grand Opening|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|date= 2009-09-15|accessdate= 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At their AGM in May 2018, after a year long consultation process, they announced that they will be changing their name to The ArQuives.&lt;ref&gt;https://clga.ca/newsfeed/2018-agm/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives was established in order to "preserve, organize, and give public access to information and materials in any medium, by and about [[LGBT]] people, primarily produced in or concerning Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/aboutus/index.shtml|title= About Us|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the archives are not limited to traditional printed material, but instead contain many diverse collections.

===Artifacts===
In addition to traditional printed material (over 3000 books, diaries, booklets, leaflets, programmes, zines, press clippings, etc.), the Archives collects artifacts that would normally be considered museum objects to capture specific moments in the history of the lesbian and gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/artifacts/|title= Artifacts|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artifacts include:

* Banners and [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|flags]]
*[[Pin-back button|Buttons]] and pins
*Leather items
*Matchbooks and matchboxes
*T-shirts
*Trophies
*Uniforms

===Artwork===
The Archives have acquired over 500 original works of art from within the lesbian and gay community. These are primarily paper or canvas works, and the emphasis is historical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/artwork/|title= Artwork|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include:

*Works exhibited by [[Gallery Without Walls]]
*Submissions for Toronto's AIDS Memorial

===Audio Recordings===
Containing more than 2000 hours of sound on tapes and over 1300 discs, the Archives house [[LP records|LPs]], [[gramophone record]]s, [[compact cassette|cassettes]], and [[CDs]]. Much of this material is vocal or instrumental recordings of lesbian and gay performers, but there is also a significant library of taped interviews and radio programs, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/audio/|title= Audio|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moving Images===
The moving images collection includes more than 2200 items, in [[8 mm film]] and [[16 mm film]], [[Betamax]], [[VHS]], and [[DVD]] formats. While there are feature films, documentaries, and erotica housed in the Archives, there are also videos shot at lesbian and gay community events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/moving_images|title= Moving Images|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its extensive collection, the Archives are often used to provide source material for Canadian film projects, such as ''[[Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives|Forbidden Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/Material/MovingImages/docs/filmcga.htm|title= Film Makers and the CGA|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|date= November 1992|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photographs===
Beginning as the photo files for ''The Body Politic'', the Archives grew around the photograph collection, and while many of the items are not yet cataloged due to the high number of entries, the Archives currently houses over 7000 individual items in various mediums, including [[photographic printing|prints]], [[negative (photography)|negatives]], and [[halftone]] reproductions.

In terms of scope, the photographs depict the community in a broad sense; photographs of demonstrations, conferences, social events, performances, and police harassment, as well the personal, domestic and social lives of lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/photographs/|title= Photographs|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posters===
Posters in the Archives are predominantly Canadian, with some international, representing film, theatre, concerts, parties, bars, and [[avant-garde]] art, within the lesbian and gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/posters/|title= Posters|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vertical Files.jpg|thumb|Vertical Files at the CLGA]]

===Vertical Files===
The Archives currently hold over 30,000 vertical files on people, groups, and events affecting the lesbian and gay community. Unlike most of the Archives, the vertical files provide information about an individual or organization, rather than information produced ''by'' the individual or organization. The vertical files contain approximately fifty percent Canadian content and fifty percent international content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.clga.ca/collections/vertical_files/|title= Vertical files|publisher= Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives|year= 2010|accessdate= 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4358">The '''Chronicle of 741''' (or '''''Continuatio Byzantia-Arabica''''' or '''''Continuatio Isidoriana''''') is a [[Latin]]-language history in 43 sections or paragraphs, many of which are quite short, which was composed in about the years 741-743, in a part of Spain under Arab occupation. It is the earliest known Spanish work from the period of Arab occupation.

==Contents==
The work is very much shorter than the ''[[Chronicle of 754]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The critical text was published by Gil (see References) and occupies less than 7 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains little Spanish history; the first 14 sections contain very brief mentions of the Visigothic kings up to the reign of [[Suintila]] (621-631), taken from the ''[[Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum]]'' of [[Isidore of Seville]]. The remainder of the content consists of alternating sections dealing with the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperors]] and the parallel leaders of the Arabs beginning with the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]. These sections perhaps derive from the ''Chronicon Mundi'' of [[John of Nikiû]] and from Arabic or Syriac works which have not survived. Some of these sections contain very brief mentions in passing, of the Arab invasions of North Africa, Spain, France, and parts of the Middle East.

Little if any of the content is original; the value of the work lies in what it reveals of the author and his times.

==Author==
The work is noted for being pro-Arab and in particular pro-[[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]].&lt;ref&gt;Martín (2007) para. 13 of his online article details the bias.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories about the author have been proposed to account for this:
*he was a Christian converted to Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Dubler, article cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; or
*a Christian sympathizing with the Arabs,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, book cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; or
*a Christian convert to Islam writing a propaganda piece under the direction of an Arab&lt;ref&gt;Martín (2007), para. 12 of his online article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, various cities of origin have been proposed, such as Toledo, Cordoba, Seville or Mérida,&lt;ref&gt;all possibilities canvassed by Díaz y Díaz, article cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; but arguments for these are based on very general considerations.

==Date==
The date of the work cannot be earlier than 741, as it mentions the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and the length of his reign which terminated in that year.

Martín&lt;ref&gt;para. 18 of Part 1 of his online article.&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out that the work contains the words "nostris temporibus" (our times) when saying that the caliphate was then held by a great-grandson of the caliph [[Marwan I]]. The first of Marwan's great-grandsons to hold that position was [[Al-Walid II]], reigned 743-744, and this is likely to represent the date of writing.

From: Julius Wellhausen, ''The Arab Kingdom and its Fall'', Engl. translation by Margaret Graham Weir, p. 168 (Univ. of Calcutta, 1927):
{| class="wikitable"
|“Yzit... Jucundissimus et cunctis nationibus regni ejus subditis vir gratissime habitus, qui nullam unquam, ut omnibus moris est, sibi regalis fastigii causa gloriam appetivit, sed communis cum omnibus civiliter vixit.”
|“Yazîd... extremely affable and most loved by all those under his authority, quite devoid of conceit, hating the pomp of royalty, living like a commoner, a private citizen.”

'''Comparative economic systems''' is the subfield of economics dealing with the comparative study of different systems of economic organization, such as [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], [[feudalism]] and the [[mixed economy]]. It is widely held have been founded by the economist [[Calvin Bryce Hoover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Duke University {{!}} Economics: Calvin Bryce Hoover|url = http://econ.duke.edu/about/history/individuals/calvin-bryce-hoover|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612090802/http://econ.duke.edu/about/history/individuals/calvin-bryce-hoover|dead-url = yes|archive-date = June 12, 2010|website = econ.duke.edu|accessdate = July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Comparative economics''' therefore consisted mainly of comparative economic systems analysis before 1989 but switched substantially its efforts to comparison of the economic effects of the transition experience from [[socialism]] to [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622864/description#description |title= Aims &amp; Scope|author=''Journal of Comparative Economics''|accessdate=19 April 2010}} Article abstracts by year and issue [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01475967 links.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a part of economics which is the study of gaining knowledge concerned with the production, consumption and transfer of wealth. It is based on the collective wants of the population and the resources available that initially create an economic system. The performance of the economic system can be measured through gross domestic product; that is, it will indicate the growth rate of country. Normative judgments can be made as well by asking questions like whether the gap of the distribution of wealth and income and social justice. Theoreticians regularly try to evaluate both the positive and normative aspects of the economic system in general and they do so by making assumptions about the rules of the game governing utility-seeking. It is comparatively easy to predict the economic outcomes when the economic system of the country has either a perfect competition or has a perfect planning economic system. With those types of the economic systems, it is easy to offer policy guidance. &lt;ref&gt;Rosefielde, Steven. Comparative Economic Systems : Culture, Wealth, and Power in the 21st Century, Wiley, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key roles in economic systems ==
[[Ethics]], [[politics]] and [[culture]] play an important roles in determining the performance of systems. 
Common cultures may prohibit or restrict individual's satisfaction, ultimately changing of the rule of the economic game while on the other hand, competitive societies may abuse of the economic system and over-stimulate self-seeking. [[Marxist]] culture of the 1930s, which associated markets with labor exploitation, obligated Stalin to adopt administrative command planning, and inhibited reform until attitudes softened under Khrushchev a quarter century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosefielde|first1=Steven|title=Comparative Economic Systems : Culture, Wealth, and Power in the 21st Century|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Merits of economic systems ==
There is no unity about right and wrong economic systems. Each type of economic system can be compared, based on a set of factors but generally there is not a general agreement about which economic system is more right than the other. Hence, there is no single standard that is able to evaluate indisputably the merit of the economic system. Even though, facts can be gathered and models can be built to discuss the economic performance of a country, it cannot prove that any system is the best. With the proper guide, it is enables to do normative assessments, that is measuring the potential,the moral and ethical reasoning of an economic system. Systems can be measured relative to the achievement of the rivals and normative assessments can be done based on statistics of the living standard, the gap of income and wealth distribution and the level of unemployment 
The modeling of comparative economic is strongly affected by the perceptions on which accepted cultural, political and ethically motives are the most predominant as well as the importance of the demand and supply side factors.
There are three school of thoughts. The first one are comparativists rely on what extent does the economy rely on the market and the degree of government intervention. Others stress on motivation. Finally, most are more concerned with the interplay.


== During the Cold War ==

The comparative study of economic systems was of significant practical and political significance during the [[Cold War]], when the relative merits of capitalist and communist systems of economic and political organization were a central topic of political concern. One of the most important early contributions was the [[economic calculation problem|calculation debate]] regarding the assertion of [[Ludwig von Mises]] that a system of central planning could never work because the information generated by a price system would never be available to planners. One response was the advocacy and partial implementation of systems of [[market socialism]].

==The world economy after the Cold War==

Despite huge economic inferiority, countries like Germany and Japan were at the brink of complete success before the World War II. However, due of having a small army force and a lack of military weapons, put an end to the success that were previously within their grasp during the first period of the war. Economic Systems' fundamentals changed drastically during the second period of the war. Military forces grew to be of much importance than the gross domestic product or the population of a country. Countries that had a powerful military force could take risks and absorb the cost of mistakes and gain quantitative superiority against countries that had powerful economies but less arm-force.

== After 1989 ==

With the fall of Communism, attention shifted to problems of [[transition economies]]. With a handful of exceptions, all currently existing systems are [[capitalism|capitalist]] in orientation, though the substantial economic role of the state supports the alternative view that the [[mixed economy]] has emerged as the dominant form of economic organisations.

Even in the absence of substantial differences between countries, the comparative study of economic systems of resource allocation is of considerable value in illustrating the implications of alternative methods of resource allocation, including markets, households, centralised allocation and custom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18198">== Factors ==

=== Bits ===
[[Computer architecture]]s are often described as ''n''-[[bit]] architectures. Today ''n'' is often 8, 16, 32, or 64, but other sizes have been used. This is actually a strong simplification. A computer architecture often has a few more or less "natural" datasizes in the [[instruction set]], but the hardware implementation of these may be very different. Many architectures have instructions operating on half and/or twice the size of respective processors' major internal datapaths. Examples of this are the [[8080]], [[Z80]], [[MC68000]] as well as many others. On this type of implementations, a twice as wide operation typically also takes around twice as many clock cycles (which is not the case on high performance implementations). On the 68000, for instance, this means 8 instead of 4 clock ticks, and this particular chip may be described as a [[32-bit]] architecture with a [[16-bit]] implementation. The external databus width is often not useful to determine the width of the architecture; the [[NS320xx|NS32008, NS32016 and NS32032]] were basically the same 32-bit chip with different external data buses. The NS32764 had a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] bus, but used 32-bit registers.

The width of addresses may or may not be different from the width of data.
Early 32-bit microprocessors often had a 24-bit address, as did the [[System/360]] processors.

=== Operands ===
{{main| instruction set#Number of operands}}

The number of operands is one of the factors that may give an indication about the performance of the instruction set.
A three-operand architecture will allow
 A := B + C
to be computed in one instruction.

A two-operand architecture will allow
 A := A + B
to be computed in one instruction, so two instructions will need to be executed to simulate a single three-operand instruction
 A := B
 A := A + C

=== Endianness ===
An architecture may use "big" or "little" endianness, or both, or be configurable to use either. Little endian processors order [[byte]]s in memory with the least significant byte of a multi-byte value in the lowest-numbered memory location. Big endian architectures instead order them with the most significant byte at the lowest-numbered address. The x86 architecture as well as several [[8-bit]] architectures are little endian. Most [[RISC]] architectures (SPARC, Power, PowerPC, MIPS) were originally big endian (ARM was little endian), but many (including ARM) are now configurable.

Endianness ''only'' applies to processors that allow individual addressing of units of data (such as [[bytes]]) that are ''smaller'' than the basic addressable machine word.

== Instruction sets ==
Usually the number of registers is a power of two, e.g. 8, 16, 32. In some cases a hardwired-to-zero pseudo-register is included, as "part" of [[register file]]s of architectures, mostly to simplify indexing modes. This table only counts the integer "registers" usable by general instructions at any moment. Architectures always include special-purpose registers such as the program pointer (PC). Those are not counted unless mentioned. Note that some architectures, such as SPARC, have [[register window]]; for those architectures, the count below indicates how many registers are available within a register window. Also, non-architected registers for [[register renaming#Architectural vs physical registers|register renaming]] are not counted.

Note, a common type of architecture, "load-store", is a synonym for "Register Register" below, meaning no instructions access memory except special – load to register(s) – and store from register(s) – with the possible exceptions of atomic memory operations for locking.

The table below compares basic information about instruction sets to be implemented in the CPU architectures:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10046">'''Electronic Yellow Pages''' are [[internet|online]] versions of traditional printed [[business]] directories produced by [[Telephone#Telephone operating companies|telephone companies]] around the world. Typical functionalities of online yellow pages include the alphabetical listings of businesses and search functionality of the business database by name, business or location. Since Electronic Yellow Pages are not limited by space considerations, they often contain far more comprehensive business information such as vicinity [[map]]s, company profiles, product information, and more.

An advantage of Electronic Yellow Pages is that they can be updated in real time; therefore, listed businesses are not constrained by once-a-year publishing of the printed version which leads to greater accuracy of the listings since contact information may change at any time.

Before the popularity of the internet, business telephone numbers in the [[United Kingdom]] could be searched by accessing a remote [[computer terminal]] by [[modem]]. The initial prototype of this was superseded in 1990 with a commercial service. This service allowed searches via Name, Business classification and locality for business listings and a free text field was provided to allow "unstructured text" searching of Adverts. This [[Dial-up access|dialup]] service was available via Prestel and "BT Gold" services. The service Electronic Yellow Pages was superseded in the mid-1990s by the internet service www.yell.com. A similar system called ''Phonebase'' for published residential phone numbers was discontinued in the 1990s, being superseded a web-based search interface.

==History==
The first true online Yellow Pages, was a creation based on the independent YP publisher in Seattle, Washington called Banana Pages. This was the first print directory which was registered with both YPPA (the Yellow Pages Publishers Association), and the ADP (Association of Directory Publishers) to place their listings online. The Yellow Pages product was the brain child of the co-owner brothers of the company, Peter and John Richards. Many RBOCS (Regional Bell Operating Companies) would follow. Banana Pages eventually became YPI (Yellow Pages on the Internet, Inc) which was sold to InfoSpace.com and became their Yellow Pages offering to cobrands.

Among the first to place their listings on the Web was [[Pacific Bell]]'s now-defunct “At Hand” online [[yellow pages]] that was officially launched on August 30, 1996. At Hand debuted with approximately 1.2 million merchant listings from across [[California]]. At the time, the service was competing with BigBook.com, a nationwide [[Web directory]] that was since absorbed by [[SuperPages]].

Although it is “old hat” now, At Hand allowed an online visitor to look for a French restaurant in a given town and get an interactive [[map]]. If the restaurant has paid for an enhanced listing, the visitor could also find out other information, such as whether it took [[American Express]] or if it served bouillabaise. At Hand showcased editorial content from 14 publishers, including [[HarperCollins]], the [[Hearst Corporation]], the [[New York Times Company]] and [[American Express]].

Another early entrant into the then-$11 billion [[yellow pages]] industry occurred in 1997 when four [[Baby Bells]] banded together to create a co-branded [[Web site]] and initiated a $1 million [[marketing]] campaign to drive more traffic to their regional yellow pages sites. That "original yellow pages" site was simply a map of the United States, where users could click on any state and be linked to the appropriate online directory, as published by [[Ameritech]], [[BellSouth]], [[Pacific Bell]], or [[US West]].  The site experienced stiff competition from Big Yellow (now part of SuperPages) and [[SuperPages]] itself.

On Nov. 4, 2004 [[SBC Communications Incorporated]] (now [[AT&amp;T]]) and [[BellSouth]] announced a joint venture to acquire [[Yellowpages.com]]. The venture utilized the highly recognized brand name to become the market leader in [[local search (Internet)]]. At the time of acquisitions, it was expected that the YellowPages.com site would receive more than 50 million [[consumer]] searches per month.

In 2005, [[Amazon.com]] elbowed its way into the online yellow pages business, with a new service from its [[A9.com]] search engine, featuring photo-rich listings that allow an online visitor to “wander around” near a given destination.

According to [[market research]] company the Kelsey Group, advertising in online yellow pages is rapidly expanding but still only retain less than 7% of the total market, including [[online]] and print. The reason for this is that traditional yellow pages [[publishers]], such as the phone companies, have big sales forces to approach local businesses.

[[MarketWatch]], an online financial newsletter, carried an article on Dec. 18, 2006 detailing how mobile online yellow pages were enhancing [[small business]] lead generation. The article noted that Internet-based yellow pages, local search and [[wireless]] was growing by an estimated 30.5% versus print [[advertising]], and that a company could only benefit from this online growth by being listed in an Internet-based directory.

==Search Engines==
Search engines such as [[Google Maps]] carry a significant number of business listings, often rivaling and sometimes exceeding the number of listings found in the traditional online yellow pages. These search engine results are a very effective way to reach new customers.

Search engine listings can often be edited by users, not just business owners. It is therefore important for business owners to verify and register their business address with all the major search engines.

Some of the problems associated with search engine advertising is click fraud. This is when ads are clicked on with no intention of purchasing anything. The search engines still charge the advertiser for these clicks, if the advertiser does not discover the fraud. Many online advertisers have discovered that clicks do not equal calls.

Many small businesses find the search engine keyword model very complicated. The average category in an Internet Yellow Pages would take an average of 20different keywords/search terms to "cover" on a search engine. For example, a plumber might need to buy leaky sink, leaky pipe, Toilet repair, sink repair, drain cleaning and on and on. It is easier for many businesses to buy an ad under "plumbers" in their local IYP's.

==Migration of Physical Publishers to Electronic Yellow Pages==
Electronic Yellow Pages or Online Yellow Pages use software to quickly edit and change online content for display on the internet.  Printed Yellow Pages or [[business directories]] often discontinue publication to limit printing costs and instead publish directly to the internet as a [[web directory]].  Online yellow pages or directories continue publishing online because advertisers pay for the visual exposure from those who read or use these online publications on the internet. Publishers or people that create these online directories create software with their own resources or use [[opensource]] or [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off-the shelf]] software to build their website or online directory.  [[Electronic Yellow Pages#History|Banana Pages]] was an online directory function built with their own resources.  The cost of online yellow pages or online directory software is limited compared to the large cost of physical printing and distribution of a phone book or directory of information.

The '''Empress Place Building''' is a historic building in Singapore, located on the north bank of the [[Singapore River]] in the [[Downtown Core]], within the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]] in Singapore's central business district. The building is currently the second wing of the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]]. The other wing of the museum is located at the [[Old Tao Nan School]] building along Armenian Street.

==History==
[[File:Asian Civilisations Museum, Empress Place 5, Jan 06.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The west façade of Empress Place Building, next to [[Raffles Landing Place]].]]
[[File:Asian Civilisations Museum, Empress Place 8, Jan 06.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The north façade of Empress Place Building, near the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall]].]]

[[File:Raffles Landing Place, Jan 06.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A statue of [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] denotes his [[Raffles' Landing Site|landing place]] in 1819, located next to the Empress Place Building.]]
During the [[British empire|colonial era]], the Empress Place Building was known simply as Government Offices. The first [[civic engagement|civic]] buildings were planned here in [[Sir Stamford Raffles]]' day. Originally intended to be a [[courthouse]], the Empress Place Building instead became offices for the government departments located in the adjacent Maxwell's House (later the [[Old Parliament House, Singapore|old Parliament House]]).  

Maxwell's House, designed by [[George Drumgoole Coleman]], was a two-storey house built for a merchant, John Argyle Maxwell, in 1827. However, it was never occupied by him and it became a courthouse and lands office. Subsequently, it was converted to Government Offices and additions were made in 1839 and 1847.

Constructed in four phases from 1864 to 1920, Government Offices was built to provide much needed space for the growing colonial administration. The original section of the building was designed by colonial engineer J.F.A. McNair and built by convict labour between June 1864 and December 1867. This original section now forms the part of the building nearest to the old Parliament House. 

Yet another courthouse was built in 1865; this is now the core of the Government Offices. In 1873–1875, the old courthouse was extended towards the river and this is where the Supreme Court of the Colony held its sessions from 1875 until 1939 when the first [[Old Supreme Court Building, Singapore|Supreme Court]] was built. Maxwell's original house became the Assembly House in 1954 after extensive renovations and reconstruction. The decision to build a new Town Hall was made in 1854; the building was completed in 1862.

Government Offices that were housed included the Secretariat, Audit Office, Registration of Deeds Office, Land Office, [[Public Works]] and Medical Department, Treasury and Stamp Office, and the bureaux of the Colonial Engineer, the Official Assignee, and the Inspector General of the Police Force. The Legislative chamber occupied a room on the upper floor.

In front of the building was a public square which was given the name Empress Place by the Municipal Council in 1907 in honour of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It may well be the oldest pedestrian space in Singapore. Over time, Government Offices became associated with Empress Place and its name changed to what we know it today.

As the demand for more government office space increased, three major extensions were added in 1880, 1904–1909 and 1920.  Fortunately, every one of these extensions were faithful to McNair's [[Neo-Palladian]] design and the building maintained a harmonious overall look.

In the surrounding area also known as Empress Place, the Memorial Hall and Tower were added in 1905 and extensive renovations were carried out from 1954 till 1979. Raffles' statue, now in front of the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall|Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre]], as it is now called, was first erected on the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] in 1887 but later removed to its present site in 1919. A second statue, a copy of the first one, was erected at [[Raffles Landing Place]] in 1972. The [[Dalhousie Obelisk|Dalhousie Memorial]] was originally located at Dalhousie Pier but found its present place in 1886. [[Cavenagh Bridge]] was built in 1869 and was converted to pedestrian traffic after the erection of [[Anderson Bridge]]. These are the major elements which have contributed to the developing qualities of Empress Place.

The Empress Place Building was used by government departments until the late 1980s. It is perhaps best known as the [[Civil registry|Registry of Births and Deaths]], the Citizenship Registry, and the Immigration Department.

In the late 1980s, plans were made to convert Empress Place Building into a museum. Extensive restoration began, culminating in the opening of the Empress Place Museum on 7 April 1989 by the then Second [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Ong Teng Cheong]]. 

Although the museum was afflicted with structural and logistical problems from its inception, it nonetheless managed to organise five outstanding [[Collection (museum)|exhibition]]s on [[Chinese history]] in six years. The first of these exhibitions, which featured royal objects from the [[Qing Dynasty]], put on display many precious [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s never seen before outside China. By 1995, the museum's problems got the better of it and on 30 April that year, it closed its doors.

Subsequently, the Empress Place Building underwent renovations and opened as the second wing of the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]] on 2 March 2003, exhibiting [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]], [[South Asia|South]], and [[Southwest Asia|West Asia]]n collections.

The Empress Place Building was [[gazette]]d as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 14 February 1992.

==Architecture==
Located at the mouth of the [[Singapore River]], the Empress Place Building's imposing [[Neo-Palladian]] exterior with timber-[[louvre]]d [[window]]s and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]ed [[clay]] [[tile]] roofs caught the attention of immigrants and visitors sailing into Singapore harbour. A 1905 Singapore guidebook says of Government Offices and its neighbouring buildings, "Apart from the cities of [[India]], there is, perhaps, no place in the East which boasts such a handsome group of [government] buildings as viewed from the sea."

Inside, the rooms are stately, with high ceilings, handsome [[Doric order|Doric]] [[column]]s and exquisite [[plaster]] mouldings and [[cornice]]s. Elegantly proportioned, the building is laid out [[symmetrical]]ly along a central axis.

transfer of simple  and compound clips between television program storage systems.  It is a container format that can contain Motion JPEG (M-JPEG), MPEG, or DV-based video compression standards, with associated audio, time code, and user data that may include user-defined metadata.

GXF was developed by [[Grass Valley Group]], then standardized by [[SMPTE]] as SMPTE 360M,&lt;ref name="S360"&gt;[http://store.smpte.org/product-p/smpte%200360-2009.htm SMPTE 360M]&lt;/ref&gt; and was extended in SMPTE RDD 14-2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.smpte.org/product-p/rdd%2014-2007.htm SMPTE RDD 14-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; to include high-definition video resolutions.

GXF has a fairly simple data model compared with SMPTE [[MXF]] container format since it should be used for file transfers and not as a storage format with no editing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/mag/broadcasting_file_interchange_formats/ File interchange formats]&lt;/ref&gt; SMPTE RDD 14-2007 is only 57 pages long, compared with many hundreds of pages for the MXF standards.

[[File:La Cosmographie de Claude Ptolemée.djvu|page=9|thumb|The ''Geography'' of Ptolemy in a {{circa|lk=no|1411}} Latin translation by [[Jacobus Angelus]] with 27 maps by [[Claudius Clavus|Claus Swart]].]]
The '''''Geography''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Γεωγραφικὴ Ὑφήγησις}}, ''Geōgraphikḕ Hyphḗgēsis'', {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Geographical Guidance"), also known by its [[Latin]] names as the '''''{{lang|la|Geographia}}''''' and the '''''{{lang|la|Cosmographia}}''''', is a [[gazetteer]], an [[atlas (book)|atlas]], and a treatise on [[cartography]], compiling the geographical knowledge of the 2nd-century [[Roman Empire]]. Originally written by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] at [[Alexandria]] around AD&amp;nbsp;150, the work was a revision of a now-lost atlas by [[Marinus of Tyre]] using additional Roman and [[Parthian Empire|Persian]] gazetteers and new principles.{{sfnp|Berggren|2001}} Its translation into [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] in the 9th century and [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in 1406 was highly influential on the geographical knowledge and cartographic traditions of the [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|medieval Caliphate]] and [[Renaissance]] Europe.

==Manuscripts==

Versions of Ptolemy's work in antiquity were probably proper [[atlas (book)|atlas]]es with attached maps, although some scholars believe that the references to maps in the text were later additions.

No [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscript of the ''Geography'' survives from earlier than the 13th century.{{sfnp|Dilke|1987b|pp=267–268}} A letter written by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[monk]] [[Maximus Planudes]] records that he searched for one for [[Chora Monastery]] in the summer of 1295;{{sfnp|Dilke|1987b|p=268}} one of the earliest surviving texts may have been one of those he then assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana [The Apostolic Vatican Library]. Vat.&amp;nbsp;Gr.&amp;nbsp;177. Late 13th&amp;nbsp;century&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, maps were sometimes redrawn using the coordinates provided by the text,{{sfnp|Milanesi|1996}} as Planudes was forced to do.{{sfnp|Dilke|1987b|p=268}} Later scribes and publishers could then copy these new maps, as [[Athanasius I of Constantinople|Athanasius]] did for the [[list of Byzantine emperors|emperor]] [[Andronicus&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;Palaeologus]].{{sfnp|Dilke|1987b|p=268}} The three earliest surviving texts with maps are those from [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) based on Planudes's work.{{efn|They are the [[Urbanas Graecus 82]],&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana [The Apostolic Vatican Library]. Urbinas Graecus 82. Late 13th&amp;nbsp;century&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fragmentum Fabricianum Graecum 23]],&lt;ref&gt;Universitetsbiblioteket [The University Library of Copenhagen]. Fragmentum Fabricianum Graecum 23. Late 13th&amp;nbsp;century&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Seragliensis 57]]&lt;ref&gt;The Sultan's Library in Istanbul. Codex Seragliensis GI 57. Late 13th&amp;nbsp;century&lt;/ref&gt; The Urbanas Graecus is usually considered the oldest,{{sfnp|Dilke|1987b|p=269}}{{sfnp|Diller|1940}} although some argue for the precedence of the Turkish manuscript.{{sfnp|Stückelberger|2006}}}}

The first [[Latin]] translation of these texts was made in 1406 or 1407 by [[Jacobus Angelus]] in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Italy]], under the name ''{{lang|la|Geographia Claudii Ptolemaei}}''.{{sfnp|Angelus|c. 1406}} It is not thought that his edition had maps,{{sfnp|Clemens|2008|p=244}} although [[Manuel Chrysoloras]] had given [[Palla Strozzi]] a Greek copy of Planudes's maps in Florence in 1397.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Contents==
The ''Geography'' consists of three sections, divided among 8 books. Book&amp;nbsp;I is a treatise on [[cartography]], describing the methods used to assemble and arrange Ptolemy's data. From Book&amp;nbsp;II through the beginning of Book&amp;nbsp;VII, a gazetteer provides longitude and latitude values for the [[Ecumene|world known]] to the [[ancient Romans]] (the "[[ecumene]]"). The rest of Book&amp;nbsp;VII provides details on three projections to be used for the construction of a map of the world, varying in complexity and fidelity. Book&amp;nbsp;VIII constitutes an [[atlas (book)|atlas]] of regional maps. The maps include a recapitulation of some of the values given earlier in the work, which were intended to be used as captions to clarify the map's contents and maintain their accuracy during copying.

===Cartographical treatise===
Maps based on [[cartography|scientific principles]] had been made in Europe since the time of [[Eratosthenes]] in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC. Ptolemy improved the treatment of [[map projection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=John |title=Flattening the Earth |publisher= University of Chicago Press |page=6 |isbn=9780226767475}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided instructions on how to create his maps in the first section of the work.

===Gazetteer===
The gazetteer section of Ptolemy's work provided [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] [[coordinate]]s for all the places and geographical features in the work. Latitude was expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]]  from the [[equator]], the same system that is used now, though Ptolemy used fractions of a degree rather than minutes of arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Talbert | first = Richard | title = Roman Portable Sundials: The Empire in Your Hand | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2017 | pages = 119-123}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Prime Meridian]] ran through the [[Fortunate Isles]], the westernmost land recorded,{{sfnp|Wright|1923}} at around the position of [[El Hierro]] in the [[Canary Islands]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The maps spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Fortunate Isles in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to [[China]].

Ptolemy was aware that Europe knew only about a quarter of the globe.

===Atlas===
Ptolemy's work included a single large and less detailed world map and then separate and more detailed regional maps. The first Greek manuscripts compiled after [[Maximus Planudes]]'s rediscovery of the text had as many as 64 regional maps.{{efn|For example, the illustrations for Burney MS 111,&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:Category:Burney MS 111|Images from Burney MS 111]] at [[:c:Main Page|Wikicommons]].&lt;/ref&gt; most of which were inserted into an earlier copy of the ''Geography'' during the early 15th century.}} The standard set in Western Europe came to be 26: 10 European maps, 4 African maps, and 12 Asian maps. As early as the 1420s, these canonical maps were complemented by extra-Ptolemaic regional maps depicting, e.g., [[Scandinavia]].

==History==

===Antiquity===
The original treatise by [[Marinus of Tyre]] that formed the basis of Ptolemy's ''Geography'' has been completely lost. A world map based on Ptolemy was displayed in [[Augustodunum]] ([[Autun]], [[France]]) in late Roman times.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]], writing at [[Alexandria]] in the 4th century, produced a [[scholia|commentary]] on Ptolemy's ''Geography'' and used it as the basis of his (now lost) ''Chorography of the Ecumene''.{{sfnp|Dilke|1987a|p=234}} Later imperial writers and mathematicians, however, seem to have restricted themselves to commenting on Ptolemy's text, rather than improving upon it; surviving records actually show decreasing fidelity to real position.{{sfnp|Dilke|1987a|p=234}}

Whereas previous Greco-Roman geographers such as [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] demonstrated a reluctance to rely on the contemporary accounts of sailors and merchants who plied distant areas of the [[Indian Ocean]], Marinus and Ptolemy betray a much greater receptiveness to incorporating information received from them.{{sfnp|Parker|2008|p=118}} For instance, Grant Parker argues that it would be highly implausible for them to have constructed the [[Bay of Bengal]] as precisely as they did without the accounts of sailors.{{sfnp|Parker|2008|p=118}} When it comes to the account of the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]) and the ''[[Magnus Sinus]]'' (i.e. [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[South China Sea]]), Marinus and Ptolemy relied on the testimony of a Greek sailor named Alexandros, who claimed to have visited a far eastern site called "[[Cattigara]]" (most likely [[Oc Eo]], [[Vietnam]], the site of unearthed [[Antonine]]-era Roman goods and not far from the region of [[Jiaozhi]] in northern Vietnam where [[Twenty-Four Histories|ancient Chinese sources]] claim several [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman embassies]] first landed in the 2nd and 3rd centuries).{{sfnp|Young|2001|p=29}}{{sfnp|Mawer|2013|p=38}}{{sfnp|Suárez|1999|p=90-92}}{{sfnp|Yule|1915|p=52}}

=== Medieval Islam ===
{{See also|Geography and cartography in medieval Islam}}
[[File:Amirbliulaie.png|thumb|The Amir of Bani Bu Ali tribe, the likely ''Bliulaie'' of Ptolemy's map.]] 
[[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|Muslim cartographers]] were using copies of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' and ''Geography'' by the 9th century.{{sfnp|Edson|2004|pp=61–62}} At that time, in the court of the [[list of caliphs|caliph]] [[al-Maʾmūm]], [[al-Khwārazmī]] compiled his ''[[Book of the Depiction of the Earth]]'' which mimicked the ''Geography''{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=128}} in providing the coordinates for 545 cities and regional maps of the [[Nile River|Nile]], the [[Island of the Jewel]], the Sea of Darkness, and the [[Sea of Azov]].{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=128}} A 1037 copy of these are the earliest extant maps from Islamic lands.{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=127}} The text clearly states that al-Khwārazmī was working from an earlier map, although this could not have been an exact copy of Ptolemy's work: his [[Prime Meridian]] was 10° east of Ptolemy's, he adds some places, and his latitudes differ.{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=128}} [[C.A. Nallino]] suggests that the work was not based on Ptolemy but on a derivative world map,{{sfnp|Nallino|1939}} presumably in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Arabic]].{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=128}} The colored [[map of al-Maʾmūm]] constructed by a team including al-Khwārazmī was described by the [[Persian people|Persian]] encyclopædist [[al-Masʿūdī]] around 956 as superior to the maps of [[Marinus of Tyre|Marinus]] and Ptolemy,{{sfn|al-Masʿūdī|loc=33}} probably indicating that it was built along similar mathematical principles.{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=130}} It included 4530 cities and over 200 mountains.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Despite beginning to compile numerous gazetteers of places and coördinates indebted to Ptolemy,{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=129}} Muslim scholars made almost no direct use of Ptolemy's principles in the maps which have survived.{{sfnp|Edson|2004|pp=61–62}} Instead, they followed al-Khwārazmī's modifications and the [[orthogonal projection]] advocated by  [[Suhrāb]]'s early 10th-century treatise on the ''[[Marvels of the Seven Climes to the End of Habitation]]''. Surviving maps from the medieval period were not done according to mathematical principles. The world map from the 11th-century ''[[Book of Curiosities]]'' is the earliest surviving map of the [[Caliphate|Muslim]] or [[Christendom|Christian]] worlds to include a [[geographic coordinate system|graticule]] but the copyist seems to have not understood its purpose, starting it from the left using twice the intended scale and then (apparently realizing his mistake) giving up halfway through.{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=126–127}} Its presence does strongly suggest the existence of earlier, now-lost maps which had been mathematically derived in the manner of Ptolemy,{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=127}} al-Khwārazmi, or Suhrāb. There are surviving reports of such maps.{{sfnp|Rapoport|2008|p=129}}

Ptolemy's ''Geography'' was translated from [[Arabic]] into [[Latin]] at the court of king [[Roger II of Sicily]] in the 12th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amari |first1=Michele |title=Il Libro di Re Ruggiero ossia la Geografia di Edrisis |journal=Bollettino della Societa Geografica Italiana |date=1872 |issue=7 |pages=1-24}}.

===Renaissance===
{{further information|Waldseemüller map|Sino-Roman relations|Indo-Roman relations|Europeans in Medieval China|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}
The Greek text of the ''Geography'' reached [[Florence]] from [[Constantinople]] in about 1400 and was translated into Latin by [[Jacobus Angelus]] of [[Scarperia]] around 1406.{{sfnp|Angelus|c. 1406}} The first printed edition with maps, published in 1477 in [[Bologna]], was also be the first printed book with engraved illustrations.&lt;ref name=Landau1996&gt;{{cite book |authors=Landau, David, and Parshall, Peter |title=The Renaissance Print |publisher=Yale |date=1996 |pages=241–242 |isbn=0-300-06883-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crone, G.R. |title=review of ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum.

Also in 1482, [[Francesco Berlinghieri]] printed the first edition in vernacular [[Italian language|Italian]].
[[File:Cosmographia, 1482.djvu|page=7|thumb|Edition printed in Ulm in 1482]]

Ptolemy had mapped the whole world from the ''Fortunatae Insulae'' ([[Cape Verde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennis Rawlins |title=The Ptolemy GEOGRAPHY's Secrets |journal=DIO - The International Journal of Scientific History |volume=14 |date=March 2008 |url=http://www.dioi.org/bk/de0.pdf |issn=1041-5440}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Canary Islands]]) eastward to the eastern shore of the ''Magnus Sinus''. This known portion of the world was comprised within 180 degrees. In his extreme east Ptolemy placed ''Serica'' (the Land of Silk), the ''Sinarum Situs'' (the Port of the [[Sinae]]), and the emporium of ''[[Kattigara|Cattigara]]''. On the 1489 map of the world by Henricus Martellus, which was based on Ptolemy’s work, Asia terminated in its southeastern point in a cape, the Cape of Cattigara. Cattigara was understood by Ptolemy to be a port on the ''Sinus Magnus,'' or Great Gulf, the actual Gulf of Thailand, at eight and a half degrees north of the Equator, on the coast of Cambodia, which is where he located it in his [[Canon of Famous Cities]]. It was the easternmost port reached by shipping trading from the Graeco-Roman world to the lands of the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. McCrindle, ''Ancient India as described by Ptolemy,'' London, Trubner, 1885, revised edition by Ramachandra Jain, New Delhi, Today &amp; Tomorrow’s Printers &amp; Publishers, 1974, p.204: “By the Great Gulf is meant the Gulf of Siam, together with the sea that stretches beyond it toward China”; Albert Herrmann, “Der Magnus Sinus und Cattigara nach Ptolemaeus”, ''Comptes Rendus du 15me Congrès International de Géographie,'' Amsterdam, 1938, Leiden, Brill, 1938, tome II, sect. IV, Géographie Historique et Histoire de la Géographie, pp.123-8.[https://books.google.com/books?id=WNEUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CDer+Magnus+Sinus+und+Cattigara+nach+Ptolemaeus%E2%80%9D,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=07xjT7iFIdGciAfPk73MBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CDer%20Magnus%20Sinus%20und%20Cattigara%20nach%20Ptolemaeus%E2%80%9D%2C&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Ptolemy’s later and more well-known Geography, a scribal error was made and Cattigara was located at eight and a half degrees South of the Equator. On Ptolemaic maps, such as that of Martellus, ''Catigara'' was located on the easternmost shore of the ''Mare Indicum,'' 180 degrees East of the Cape St Vincent at, due to the scribal error, eight and a half degrees South of the Equator.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schnabel, „Die Entstehungsgeschichte des kartographischen Erdbildes des Klaudios Ptolemaios“, ''Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften: Philosophisch-Historische Klasse, Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften,'' Bd.XIV, 1930, S.214-250, n.b. 239-243; cited in Albert Herrmann, “South-Eastern Asia on Ptolemy’s Map”, ''Research and Progress: Quarterly Review of German Science,'' vol.V, no.2, March–April 1939, pp.121-127, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Catigara'' is also shown at this location on Martin Waldseemüller’s 1507 world map, which avowedly followed the tradition of Ptolemy. Ptolemy’s information was thereby misinterpreted so that the coast of China, which should have been represented as part of the coast of eastern Asia, was falsely made to represent an eastern shore of the Indian Ocean. As a result, Ptolemy implied more land east of the 180th meridian and an ocean beyond. [[Marco Polo]]’s account of his travels in eastern Asia described lands and seaports on an eastern ocean apparently unknown to Ptolemy. Marco Polo’s narrative authorized the extensive additions to the Ptolemaic map shown on the 1492 globe of [[Martin Behaim]]. The fact that Ptolemy did not represent an eastern coast of Asia made it admissible for Behaim to extend that continent far to the east. Behaim’s globe placed Marco Polo’s Mangi and [[Cathay]] east of Ptolemy’s 180th meridian, and [[Kublai Khan|the Great Khan’s]] capital, [[Khanbaliq|''Cambaluc'']] ([[Beijing]]), on the 41st parallel of latitude at approximately 233 degrees East. Behaim allowed 60 degrees beyond Ptolemy’s 180 degrees for the mainland of Asia and 30 degrees more to the east coast of ''[[Cipangu]]'' (Japan). Cipangu and the mainland of Asia were thus placed only 90 and 120 degrees, respectively, west of the Canary Islands.

The Codex Seragliensis was used as the base of a new edition of the work in 2006.{{sfnp|Stückelberger|2006}} This new edition was used to "decode" Ptolemy's coordinates of Books 2 and 3 by an interdisciplinary team of [[TU Berlin]], presented in publications in 2010&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kleineberg, Christian Marx, Eberhard Knobloch, Dieter Lelgemann, ''Germania und die Insel Thule.

==== Influence on Christopher Columbus ====
[[Christopher Columbus]] modified this geography further by using 53⅔ Italian nautical miles as the length of a degree instead of the longer degree of Ptolemy, and by adopting [[Marinus of Tyre]]’s longitude of 225 degrees for the east coast of the ''[[Magnus Sinus]]''. This resulted in a considerable eastward advancement of the longitudes given by [[Martin Behaim]] and other contemporaries of Columbus. By some process Columbus reasoned that the longitudes of [[eastern Asia]] and [[Cipangu]] respectively were about 270 and 300 degrees east, or 90 and 60 degrees west of the [[Canary Islands]]. He said that he had sailed 1100 leagues from the Canaries when he found [[Cuba]] in 1492. This was approximately where he thought the coast of eastern Asia would be found. On this basis of calculation he identified [[Hispaniola]] with Cipangu, which he had expected to find on the outward voyage at a distance of about 700 leagues from the Canaries. His later voyages resulted in further exploration of Cuba and in the discovery of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]]. At first South America, the ''Mundus Novus'' ([[New World]]) was considered to be a great island of continental proportions; but as a result of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Fourth voyage|fourth voyage]], it was apparently considered to be identical with the great Upper India peninsula ([[India Superior]]) represented by Behaim—the Cape of Cattigara. This seems to be the best interpretation of the sketch map made by Alessandro Zorzi on the advice of [[Bartholomew Columbus]] (Christopher’s brother) around 1506, which bears an inscription saying that according to the ancient geographer Marinus of Tyre and Christopher Columbus the distance from [[Cape St Vincent]] on the coast of Portugal to Cattigara on the peninsula of India Superior was 225 degrees, while according to Ptolemy the same distance was 180 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;“Alberico”, vol.IV, c. 169, Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Banco Rari 234; Sebastian Crino, "Schizzi cartografici inediti dei primi anni della scoperta dell' America", ''Rivista marittima'', vol.

===Early modern Ottoman Empire===
Prior to the 16th century knowledge of geography in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was limited in scope, with almost no access to the works of earlier Islamic scholars that superseded Ptolemy. His Geography would again be translated and updated with commentary into Arabic under [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]], who commissioned works from Byzantine scholar [[George Amiroutzes]] in 1465 and the Florentine humanist [[Francesco Berlinghieri]] in 1481.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ottoman 'Discovery' of the Indian Ocean in the Sixteenth Century: The Age of Exploration from an Islamic Perspective |first=Giancarlo |last=Casale |date=2003 |url=http://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/p/2005/history_cooperative/www.historycooperative.org/proceedings/seascapes/casale.html#_ftnref25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trading Territories: Mapping the Early Modern World |first=Jerry |last=Brotton |page=101 |url=http://librarun.org/book/53582/101 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406165044/http://librarun.org/book/53582/101 |archivedate=2016-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longitudes error and Earth size==

Italian scholar [[Lucio Russo]] points out two apparently distinct errors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucio Russo |title=Ptolemy's Longitudes and Eratosthenes' Measurement of the Earth's Circumference |date=2012 |doi=10.2140/memocs.2013.1.67 |url=http://msp.org/memocs/2013/1-1/memocs-v1-n1-p04-s.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucio Russo |title=Far-reaching Hellenistic geographical knowledge hidden in Ptolemy’s data |date=2016 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01275282/document}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lucio Russo |title=L'America dimenticata: I rapporti tra civiltà e un errore di Tolomeo |date=2013 |publisher=Mondadory Education s.p.a |place=Milano |isbn=8861843204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Considering a sample of 80 cities amongst the 6345 listed by Ptolemy, those that are both identifiable and for which we can expect a better distance measurement since they were well known, there is a systematic overestimation of the longitude by a factor 1.428 with a high confidence (coefficient of determination r² = 0.9935). This error produces evident deformations in Ptolemy's world map most apparent for example in the profile of [[Italy]], which is markedly stretched horizontally.
* Ptolemy accepted that the known [[Ecumene]] spanned 180° of longitude, but instead of accepting [[Eratosthenes]]'s estimate for the circumference of the [[Earth]] of 252,000 stadia, he shrinks it to 180,000 stadia, with a factor of 1.4 between the two figures.

Ptolemy took as location for the longitude 0° the [[Fortunate Isles]] which at his times were identified with the [[Canary Islands]]. The strange coincidence of the two aforementioned errors may be accounted for if one assumes that this identification was wrong and that at the time of Ptolemy's sources the Fortunate Isles were actually the eastern [[Antilles]]. Since Ptolemy could estimate the actual distance to the Canaries, Russo proposes that he purposely shrank the circumference of Earth to accommodate his data and his wrong identification of the Fortunate Isles. This suggests or even proves that the American continent was known in [[Classical Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Lettera Matematica]]|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=3|pp=111–112|title=Lucio Russo: L’America dimenticata.

'''''Handbook on history of Ukraine''''' (''Історія України'') is a multi-volume comprehensive encyclopedic book about the [[History of Ukraine|history of]] [[Ukraine]]. There were at least two editions published by [[Kiev]] publisher "[[Geneza]]" which specializes in publishing school handbooks. The first edition was published in 1993-99, the second in 1999.

The authors of the handbook are [[:uk:Підкова Ігор Зіновійович|Ihor Pidkova]] and [[:uk:Шуст Роман Мар'янович|Roman Shust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twirpx.com/file/450947/ Scope of the handbook].&lt;/ref&gt;

The web version also provides electronic copies of Ukrainian historical outlines from such Ukrainian historians like [[Natalia Yakovenko]] and [[Yaroslav Hrytsak]].

'''''Haughton v Smith,''''' [1975] AC 476, [1973] 3 All ER 1109, [1974] 3 W.L.R. 1 was a case heard in the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], which held that it was impossible to commit the crime of [[handling stolen goods]] where the goods in question were not in fact stolen; nor could an offence of attempting to handle stolen goods be committed in the same circumstances.

==Judgement==
[[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Viscount Dilhorne]]'s statement about the impossibility of crimes is often quoted at 19 (citing to All E.R..): 

:''A man taking his own umbrella from a club, thinking it the property of someone else, does not steal. His belief does not convert his conduct into an offence. In my view, it matters not that the crime cannot be committed as a result of physical impossibility, e.g. the absence of the property he wants to steal, or of legal impossibility. In either case he cannot be convicted of an attempt when he could not be convicted of the full offence if he had succeeded in doing all that he attempted to do. Conduct which is not criminal is not converted into criminal conduct by the accused believing that a state of affairs exists which does not.''

This case was subsequently overturned by the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. There is an in-depth discussion of the law of attempted crimes, in particular the debate about criminal liability in issues of [[Impossibility defense|impossible crimes]].

}}'''''Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors''''' is a book written under the [[pseudonym]] Rex Feral and published by [[Paladin Press]] in 1983. Paladin Press owner Peder Lund claimed, in an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', that the book started life as a detailed crime novel written by a Florida housewife, and that the format was later changed to appeal to Paladin's reader base accustomed to the publisher's non-fiction books on military, survivalist, weapons and similar topics. The book portrays itself as a [[how-to]] manual on starting a career as a [[Contract killing|hit man]], fulfilling contracts. However, after a number of lawsuits claiming that the book was used as a handbook in several murders, the publication of the book was stopped. It marked "the first time in American publishing history that a publisher has been held liable for a crime committed by a reader."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/19990531/33480-paladin-press-pays-millions-to-settle-hit-man-case.html|title=Paladin Press Pays Millions to Settle `Hit Man' Case|last=|first=|date=May 31, 1999|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Paladin Press published the book under the author's pseudonym "Rex Feral" in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;''Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors'' {{ISBN|0-87364-276-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written as if by an actual experienced assassin, as a how-to manual on [[contract killing]]. It was said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/paladin.htm|title=If Books Could Kill|last=Montgomery|first=David|date=26 July 1998|work=Washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post Company|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be written by a divorced mother-of-two who simply fabricated much of the material it contains based on mystery novels and movies.&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=David B.

Accessed 2017-01-029.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
On March 3, 1992, a triple murder was committed in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], by a man who claimed to have used the book as his guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2006-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/montgom/hitmen/horn.htm
|title=Horn Convicted for Three Murders
|author= Karl Vick|work=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 4, 1996 |pages=Page A01}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Perry, who had been imprisoned for a violent crime, was caught, convicted, and sentenced three times to death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-94-millie-trevor-horn-janice-saunders/|title=Case 94: Millie &amp; Trevor Horn, Janice Saunders - Casefile: True Crime Podcast|date=2018-09-01|work=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been hired by [[Lawrence Horn]], who sought to receive the proceeds of a trust fund that resulted from his ex-wife's suing a hospital over injuries to their son.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The families of Mildred Horn, her son Trevor, and her nurse Janice Saunders sued, claiming Paladin Press "aided and abetted" the murder. The suit, ''Rice v Paladin Enterprises'', claimed that Paladin Press had a share of responsibility in the murders by virtue of their publication of a book that, by Paladin's own admission, could be used by criminals and would-be criminals in the solicitation, planning, and commission of murder for hire. In November 1997, a U.S. appeals court ruled 3–0 that ''Hit Man'' was not protected by the free speech/free press clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and thus Paladin Enterprises could be held liable for a triple murder committed by one of its readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=185

|title=RICE v PALADIN ENTERPRISES, No. 962412P |date=November 10, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 21, 1999, Paladin Press' insurance company agreed to settle the case out-of-court, against the wishes of Paladin Press themselves, who were confident that they would prevail in court on First Amendment grounds; however, Paladin’s insurance company balked at going to court again, figuring expenses for a lengthy trial in federal court, plus the posting of a bond in case they lost and appealed, would have cost much more than the settlement.&lt;ref name="The Murder of the First Amendment"&gt;[http://www.loompanics.com/Articles/FirstAmend.htm The Murder of the First Amendment?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Under this settlement, Paladin's insurance policy paid several million dollars to the families of those killed by the murderer, while also agreeing to destroy the remaining 700 copies of the book in their possession and surrendering any rights they had to publish and reproduce the work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jon Ford, Paladin’s editorial director, called the settlement "economic censorship."&lt;ref name="The Murder of the First Amendment"/&gt;

The book was also cited as a source of information in a similar crime committed by Robert Vaughn Jones in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2006-02-20

The lawsuit was result of the 1998 attempted murder of Bobby Joe Wilson by her ex-husband, Robert Leslie Goggin, who allegedly hired Robert Jones to kill her in order to get money from her life insurance policy. In court, Jones testified that Goggin recruited him to kill Wilson. Jones said he then purchased &lt;i&gt;Hit Man&lt;/i&gt;. In her lawsuit, Wilson outlined two dozen points of advice from the book that Jones followed to the letter in planning to kill her. The suit was eventually settled out of court in 2002.&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paladin-press.com/faqs|title=Paladin Press, Firearms, Self-Defense, Sniping, Survival, Books and DVDs|work=Paladin-press.com|accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15793|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027062023/http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=15793|archivedate=October 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=August 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the legal cases, Paladin no longer published the book, and allowed the remaining undestroyed circulating copies to sell out.&lt;ref name="reason" /&gt; Copies exist on the Internet (notably [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]), often accompanied by the spurious claim that the book is now in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Paladin Press claims that the rights are still held by the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328191849/http://www.copyright.gov/records/cohm.html|archivedate=March 28, 2007|deadurl=bot: unknown|accessdate=2007-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be purchased used from independent sellers. It is believed that 13,000 copies were sold, although ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]]'' estimates there are 20,000 copies of the book in existence.

== Media ==
In 1999, a book called ''Deliberate Intent: a lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book'', was released by lawyer, author, and [[First Amendment]] scholar, [[Rodney A. Smolla|Rod Smolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/deliberateintent00smol|title=Deliberate intent : a lawyer tells the true story of murder by the book|last=Smolla|first=Rodney A.|date=1999|publisher=New York : Crown Publishers|others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;i&gt;Deliberate Intent&lt;/i&gt; described his involvement in the notorious "Hit Man" case, where Smolla successfully represented the families of three murder victims in the court case against Paladin Press. The book was later made into a television movie and actor [[Timothy Hutton]] portrayed Smolla.

On August 6, 2000, a [[television film]] by Fox and the FX Cable Network called ''[[Deliberate Intent]]'' was aired in the U.S. based directly on the book and the case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/reviews/deliberate-intent-1200464011/|title=Deliberate Intent|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|date=2000-08-02|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rotten Tomatoes|first=|title=Deliberate Intent (2000)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deliberate_intent/|volume=|pages=|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred Timothy Hutton, [[Ron Rifkin]], [[Clark Johnson]], [[Penny Johnson Jerald]], [[Cliff DeYoung]], [[James McDaniel]], and [[Yanna McIntosh]]. Peder Lund, Paladin Press' owner, was played by [[Kenneth Welsh]]. It was directed by [[Andy Wolk]], produced by Howard Braunstein and [[Michael Jaffe]], with music by [[Harald Kloser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deliberate Intent (TV 2000)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251662/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the drama, which clearly parallels the Horn case,&lt;blockquote&gt;The legal team then proceeds to tie the book to the case of a Motown recording engineer (McDaniel) who gets a hitman to murder his ex-wife, their paraplegic daughter{{Sic}} and the son’s nurse. By proving that the hired killer followed 22 of the 26 steps shown in Paladin’s book, they’re able to bring home the point that freedom of speech laws should not protect material that is produced for the purpose of aiding and abetting murder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==By location==

===In Europe===
In Sweden, identitarianism has been promoted by a now inactive organisation {{ill|Nordiska förbundet|sv|Nordiska förbundet}}, which founded the online encyclopedia [[Metapedia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/kulturdebatt/den-nya-nationalhogern/ "Den nya nationalhögern"], Christoph Andersson. 10/03/2006, [[Dagens Nyheter]].&lt;/ref&gt; It then mobilised a number of "independent activist groups" similar to their French counterparts, among them [[Reaktion Östergötland]] and [[Identitet Väst]], who performed a number of political actions marked by a certain degree of civil disobedience. A 24-page first manifesto, aimed at defining the identitarian movement in Northern Europe, was published as ''Identitet och Metapolitik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Identitet och Metapolitik |location=Göteborg |publisher=Nordiska Förlaget |date=2008 |isbn=978-91-85043-17-0 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demonstration against Morten Kjærum in Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Austrian identitarians demonstrating in Vienna]]
The main identitarian youth movement is ''Génération Identitaire'' in France, a youth wing of the ''[[Les Identitaires|Bloc Identitaire]]'' party.

The origin of the Italian chapter ''Generazione Identitaria'' dates back to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.vice.com/it/article/estrema-destra-crowdfunding-per-bloccare-ong L’estrema destra europea vuole bloccare le navi delle Ong con un crowdfunding] (in Italian), Di Leonardo Bianchi, 18 May 2017, [[Vice News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Markus Willinger, who grew up in [[Schärding]], Austria, and is now a student of history and political science at the [[University of Stuttgart]], published a 2013 manifesto entitled "Generation Identity: A Declaration of War Against the '68ers", (68ers being people whose political identities are seen as stemming from the social changes of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="SPLC-2015"/&gt; what would be called [[baby boomer]] liberals in the US, or those sympathetic to them) and translated into English from German by Aetius. The book is considered the manifesto of the ''[[Identitäre Bewegung Österreichs]]'', which was founded in 2012.

The movement also appeared in Germany and converged with preexisting circles, centered on the magazine ''[[Blaue Narzisse]]'' and its founder [[Felix Menzel]], a [[martial artist]] and former German [[Karate]] Team Champion, who according to Gudrun Hentges &amp;ndash; who worked for the official [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]] &amp;ndash; belongs to the "elite of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hentges|first1=Gudrun|last2=Kökgiran|first2=Gürcan|last3=Nottbohm|first3=Kristina|year=2014|title=Die Identitäre Bewegung Deutschland (IBD) – Bewegung oder virtuelles Phänomen?|url=http://forschungsjournal.de/sites/default/files/fjsbplus/fjsb-plus_2014-3_hentges_koekgiran_nottbohm_x.pdf|language=de|journal=Forschungsjournal Soziale Bewegungen|volume=27|issue=supplement to issue 4|publisher=Lucius &amp; Lucius|access-date=8 July 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been a "[[Eingetragener Verein|registered association]]" since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Reg-No.: VR 3135, District Court Paderborn, cf: [[Impressum]] on the website.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing upon thinkers of the [[Nouvelle Droite]] and the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] such as [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]] or the contemporary Russian [[Aleksandr Dugin]], it played a role in the rise of the [[PEGIDA]] marches in 2014/15.

The identitarian movement has a close linkage to members of the [[Neue Rechte|German New Right]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruns|first1=Julian|last2=Glösel|first2=Kathrin|last3=Strobl|first3=Natascha|year=2014|title=Die Identitären: Handbuch zur Jugendbewegung der Neuen Rechten in Europa|language=de|location=Münster, Germany|publisher=Unrast|isbn=978-3-89771-549-3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., to its prominent member [[Götz Kubitschek]] and his journal ''Sezession'', for which the identitarian speaker [[Martin Sellner]] writes.

As their symbol, the European Identitarian movement and Generation Identity, uses a yellow [[lambda]] sign, a symbol that was painted on the shields of the [[Spartan army]] &amp;ndash; popularized by the film ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' &amp;ndash; supposedly to commemorate the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].&lt;ref name="zeit.de"/&gt;

In August 2016, members of the identitarian movement in Germany scaled the iconic [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]] and hung a banner in protest at [[European migrant crisis|European immigration]] and perceived [[Islamisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-germany-farright/german-rightists-scale-brandenburg-gate-to-protest-immigration-idUSKCN1120H1|title=German rightists scale Brandenburg Gate to protest immigration|date=27 August 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the identitarian movement erected a new summit cross in a "provocative" act (as the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' reported) on the [[Schafreuter]], after the original one had to be removed because of damage by an unknown person.&lt;ref name="Schafreuter summit cross"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sebald|first1=Christian|title=Rechtsextreme errichten neues Gipfelkreuz am Schafreuter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/alpen-rechtsextreme-errichten-neues-gipfelkreuz-am-schafreuter-1.3149336|website=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|access-date=17 August 2017|deadurl=no|language=German|trans-title=Right-wing extremists erect new summit cross on the Schafreuter|date=15 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 the [[PayPal]] donations account of the identitarian "Defend Europe" was locked, and the identitarian account of the bank "Steiermärkische Sparkasse" was closed.&lt;ref&gt;Bonvalot, Michael (22 June 2017) [http://blog.zeit.de/stoerungsmelder/2017/06/22/weitere-bank-kuendigt-spendenkonto-der-identitaeren_24006 Weitere Bank kündigt Spendenkonto der Identitären] (in German), [[Die Zeit]].&lt;/ref&gt; Defend Europe crowdfunded more than $178,000 to charter a ship in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/11/13/full-ship-behind-generation-identitys-high-seas-publicity-stunt|title=Full of ship: Behind Generation Identity's high seas publicity stunt|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intention was ferry any rescued migrants back to Africa, observe any incursions by other [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] ships into Libyan waters, and report them to the [[Libyan Navy|Libyan coastguard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anti-immigrant-ship-mediterranean-ngo-ships-refugee-crisis-migrant-boats-people-smugglers-defend-a7838731.html|title=Far-right group are sending a boat full of activists to Mediterranean to send refugees 'back to Africa'|date=2017-07-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the ship chartered by GI suffered an engine failure, and had to be rescued by a ship from one of the NGOs rescuing migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henley|first1=Jon|title=Refugee rescue ship sails to aid of anti-migrant activists stranded in Med|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/migrant-rescue-ship-sails-to-aid-of-stranded-far-right-activists|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=The Guardian|date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, key figures of the identitarian movement met in London in efforts to target the United Kingdom, and discussed the founding of a British chapter as a "bridge" to link with radical movements in the US.&lt;ref name="dearden"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/far-right-uk-identitarian-movement-alt-right-defend-europe-isd-research-nazis-national-action-a8013331.html|title=Far-right extremists targeting UK as they 'weaponise internet culture'|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|date=22 October 2017|work=The Independent|accessdate=16 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Members of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian movement met in London over the weekend with the aim of starting a new British branch.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom and Ireland branch was launched in late October 2017 after a banner was unfurled on Westminster Bridge reading "Defend London, Stop Islamisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=Far-right group is sending UK recruits to military-style training camps in Europe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/generation-identity-far-right-group-training-camps-europe-uk-recruits-military-white-nationalist-a8046641.html |work=The Independent |date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2018, Sellner and his girlfriend Brittany Pettibone were barred from entering the UK. The reason stated was that their presence was "not conducive to the public good."&lt;ref name=activists&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43393035|title=Why 3 anti-Islam activists were refused entry to the UK|date=2018-03-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2017, two [[non-commissioned officers]] with the [[US Marines]] were arrested for trespassing after displaying a banner from a building in [[Graham, North Carolina|Graham]], [[North Carolina]], during a [[Confederate Memorial Day]] event. The banner included the identitarian logo, and the phrase "he who controls the past controls the future", a reference to [[George Orwell]]'s novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', along with the acronym YWNRU, or "you will not replace us". The Marine Corps denounced the behavior and investigated the incident. A marine spokesperson commented to local news “Of course we condemn this type of behavior ... we condemn any type of behavior that is not congruent with our values or that is illegal.” Both men plead guilty to trespassing.

According to Christoph Gurk of [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]], one of the goals of identitarianism is to make racism modern and fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Gurk: [http://www.br.de/puls/themen/welt/interview-extremismusforscher-alexander-haeusler-100.html ''„Diese Gruppen machen den Rassismus hip“''] (Interview with Alexander Häusler).

'''''Krista Purana''''' ({{IPA|/ˈkɾist̪ə puˈɾaːɳə/}}; [[Devanagari]]: क्रिस्त पुराण, "The [[Christian]] [[Puranas]]") is an [[epic poem]] on the life of [[Jesus Christ]] written in a mix of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Konkani language|Konkani]] by [[Thomas Stephens (Jesuit)|Fr.Thomas Stephens, S.J.]] (1549–1619). Adopting the literary form of the [[Hindu]] [[puranas]], it retells the entire story of mankind from the creation days to the time of Jesus, in lyrical verse form. The Christian Puranas – 11,000 stanzas of 4 verses – were very popular in the churches of the area where they were sung on special occasions up to the 1930s. Although no copy of the original edition has yet been discovered, it is believed to have been published at Rachol (Raitur) in 1616 (while the author was still living), 1649, and 1654.

# ''Discurso sobre a vinda do Jesu-Christo Nosso Salvador ao mundo, dividido em dous Tratados, pelo Padre Thomaz Estevão, Inglez, da Companhia de Jesu. Impresso em Rachol com licencia da Santa Inquisicão, e Ordinario no Collegio de Todos os Santos da Companhia de Jesu Anno 1616.''&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Saldanha, ''The Christian Puránna of Father Thomas Stephens of the Society of Jesus: A Work of the 17th Century: Reproduced from manuscript copies and edited with a biographical note, an introduction, an English synopsis of contents and vocabulary'', ed. Joseph L. Saldanha (Bolar, Mangalore: Simon Alvares, 1907) xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt;  First edition, Rachol [Raitur], Goa, 1616. [Roman script.] The title with all its details is taken from the ‘Licence,’ which itself is found not in the MS collated by J.L. Saldanha, but in J.H. da Cunha Rivara’s Introduction to his edition of Stephens, ''Grammatica da Lingua Concani'', 1857,&lt;ref&gt;[J.L. Saldanha xli, note 2. Cunha Rivara’s "Ensaio" does contain the censures and licences, in Portuguese; however, he states clearly that he was working from MS, and that he had not found any copy of the first three printed editions: see "Ensaio" 1957 cxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Imprimatur 22 June 1615. "From the Censures and Licences annexed it seems to have originally been written in Portuguese and then translated into the vernacular in which we now find it. The translation appears to have been completed in 1614,&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Saldanha xxxix, note 1: see stanzas 119-120, Canto 59, Dussarem Puránna.&lt;/ref&gt; and printed for the first time, in 1616, as declared in the descriptive title in Portuguese first given to the book."&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Saldanha xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; No copy has been traced to date.
# ''Puranna.'' Second edition, 1649. [Roman script.] "A second edition, taken in hand in 1646 under the auspices of the aforementioned Fr[ei] Gaspar de S. Miguel, who, with some other ecclesiastics, completed a revision of the work on 20 February 1649, appears to have been published in the latter year under the title of the Puránna, in place of the original Portuguese designation borne by the first edition…. It is not known where the second edition was printed."&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Saldanha xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; The Drago edition, however, indicates (see front matter) that it was printed at Raitur, Goa, 1649. No copy has been traced to date. 
# ''Puránna.'' Em Goa com licenca da Santa Inquisicao e Ordinario no Collegio de S. Paolo novo de Companhia de Jesu. Anno de 1654. Third edition, Old Goa [according to Drago], 1654. [Roman script.] Licences by Rev. Fr Lucas da Cruz and another, dt. 2 January 1653 and 22 June 1654. No copy has been traced to date. See, however, the MS preserved in the Central Library, Panjim, listed below, which claims to be a copy of this third, 1654, edition. (The photo alongside is of this MS.)

== Manuscripts ==

=== In Goa ===
At least five MS of the Khristapurana have been located to date in Goa:
# The Goa Central Library MS: ''Discurso sobre a vinda de Jesu Christo Nosso Salvador ao Mundo dividido em dous tratados feito pelo Padre Thomas Estevão Ingrez da Companhia de Jesus. Impresso em Goa com licenca das Inquisicão, e Ordinario no Collegio de S. Paulo novo de Companhia de Jesu. Anno de 1654, Escripto por Manoel Salvador Rebello, Natural de Margão no Anno 1767.'' (CL)
# The Pilar MS, at the Museum of the Pilar Monastery, Pilar, Goa. (P)
# The M.C. Saldanha MS at the [[Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr]], Alto Porvorim, Goa (TSKK-1). Whether this M.C. Saldanha is the same as the well-known professor [[Mariano Saldanha]] of [[Ucassaim]], Goa, is yet to be established. But from the fact that the MS has been bound in Kodailbail, Mangalore, it is highly probable that this is one of the 5 MS used by J.L. Saldanha in the preparation of his 1907 edition of the ''Khristapurana''.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Saldanha, "Editor's Preface" iii.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Another MS at the [[Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr]] (TSKK-2).
# The Bhaugun Kamat Vagh MS in the Pissurlencar Collection at the Goa University Library (BKV).

Apart from CL, the MS are not dated. The chronology will therefore have to be established from internal evidence, taking into account the terminology (Romanized or Sanskritized), the number of cantos and strophes, the interpolations, the Praise of Marathi (missing in the Marsden MS), the chapter on the Miracle at Cana (missing in the Marsden MS), etc. This will also help us move closer to establishing whether or not the Sanskritized M was the ‘original’ text of the Khristapurana.

=== In the United Kingdom ===
# The Adi or First Puran + The Deva Puran. [Devanagari manuscripts.] Marsden Collection Manuscripts. London: School of Oriental and African Studies. N.d.&lt;ref&gt;Falcao 2003, 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts had belonged to the library of William Marsden who, Abbot says, ‘a century ago’ had made a large collection of coins and Oriental books when in India, many of the latter having been obtained from the Archives in Goa (which Archives, Abbot does not say). The library was given by Marsden to the Kings College, London, in 1853, but in 1916 came into the possession of the School of Oriental Studies. The catalogue contained only a few Marathi items. Abbot reports two, with entries made by Mr Marsden as follows: "The Adi or First Puran, a Christian work in the Mahratta language and Nagari character appearing to contain an exposition of the Old Testament." "The Deva Puran, or Divine History, a Christian work in the Mahratta language and Nagari character appearing to contain an exposition of the New Testament or History of Christ." The manuscript is in two volumes differing in handwriting. The Deva Puran is a copy of an older copy. The MS end in the usual form of an Indian Puran, Iti Mahapurane, or Iti Deva-Purane, which the Mangalore text does not do.&lt;ref&gt;See "Mr. Justin E. Abbot’s Letter to ‘The Times of India’." Parisista 3: B 946-949. See also J.E. Abbott, "The Discovery of the Original Devanagari Text of the Christian Purana of Thomas Stevens," BSOS 2 (1921-23) 679-683.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbott claims that this is a copy of Thomas Stephens’ original text. Bandelu feels that there is not enough evidence for Abbott’s claim. Falcao follows Abbott without really arguing his case. Strangely, while admitting that the Marsden MS is a MS and not an ‘edition,’ he still lists it as the 7th edition, coming after Drago, without giving any supporting reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Falcao 2003 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr H. Staffner obtained a microfilm of M and made 2 copies. One is in the Jaykar Library of the Pune University. The other is in Snehasadan, Pune.&lt;ref&gt;Drago, "Abhara," ix.&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem, however, that there is another microfilm of the same in the Mumbai Marathi Sansodhan Mandala, Mumbai, though D does not specify that this is M.&lt;ref&gt;See Drago 905.&lt;/ref&gt; Falcao (2003) follows Drago, but specifies that this microfilm is indeed of the Marsden MS.&lt;ref&gt;Falcao 2003 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Mangalore ===

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

'''Minerva''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɝ|.|v|ə}}; {{IPA-la|mɪˈnɛr.wa|lang}}; [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]: ''Menrva'') was the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of [[wisdom]] and strategic warfare and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. From the second century BC onward, the Romans [[Religious syncretism|equated]] her with the Greek [[goddess]] [[Athena]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not stress her relation to battle and warfare as the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s did.

Following the Greek myths around Athena, she was born of [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], who had been swallowed by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and burst from her father's head, fully armed and clad in armor.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta World English Dictionary 1998–2004 Microsoft Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter forcefully impregnated the [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] Metis, which resulted in her attempting to change shape (or [[shapeshift]]) to escape him. Jupiter then recalled the prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and in turn, Saturn had [[Caelus]]. 

Fearing that their child would be male, and would grow stronger than he was and rule the Heavens in his place, Jupiter swallowed Metis whole after tricking her into turning herself into a fly. The titaness gave birth to Minerva and forged weapons and armor for her child while within Jupiter's body. In some versions of the story, Metis continued to live inside of Jupiter's mind as the source of his wisdom. Others say she was simply a vessel for the birth of Minerva. The constant pounding and ringing left Jupiter with agonizing pain. To relieve the pain, [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] used a hammer to split Jupiter's head and, from the cleft, Minerva emerged, whole, adult, and in full battle armor.

She was the [[Virginity|virgin]] goddess of music, [[poetry]], [[medicine]], [[wisdom]], [[commerce]], [[weaving]], and the [[craft]]s.&lt;ref name="Candau"&gt;{{cite book | title=Coded Encounters: Writing, Gender, and Ethnicity in Colonial Latin America| url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0-87023-886-8| last=Candau| first=Francisco J. Cevallos| year=1994| pages=215| publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0-87023-886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the "[[owl of Minerva]]",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Philosophy of Right]]'' (1820), "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt; which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge as well as, less frequently, the snake and the [[olive tree]].

==Worship in Rome and Italy==

Minerva was worshipped at several locations in Rome, most prominently as part of the [[Capitoline Triad]]. She was also worshipped at the [[Temple of Minerva Medica]], and at the "[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#delubrum|Delubrum]] Minervae", a temple founded around 50 BC by [[Pompey]] on the site now occupied by the church of ''[[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]]''.

The Romans celebrated her festival from March 19 to March 23 during the day which is called, in the neuter plural, [[Quinquatria]], the fifth after the Ides of March, the nineteenth, an [[artisan]]s' holiday. A lesser version, the ''Minusculae Quinquatria'', was held on the Ides of June, June 13, by the [[auloi|flute-players]], who were particularly useful to religion. In 207 BC, a [[guild]] of poets and actors was formed to meet and make [[votive offering]]s at the temple of Minerva on the [[Aventine Hill]]. Among others, its members included [[Livius Andronicus]]. The Aventine sanctuary of Minerva continued to be an important center of the arts for much of the middle [[Roman Republic]].

As ''Minerva Medica'', she was the goddess of medicine and physicians. As ''Minerva Achaea'', she was worshipped at [[Lucera]] in [[Apulia]] where [[votive gift]]s and arms said to be those of [[Diomedes]] were preserved in her temple.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Mirab. Narrat.'' 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dgrbm"&gt;{{Cite book

Her worship also was spread throughout the empire. In Britain, for example, she was syncretized with the local goddess [[Sulis]], who often was [[Bath curse tablets|invoked]] for restitution for theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. S. O. Tomlin |title=Voices from the Sacred Spring |url=http://www.bathspa.ac.uk/Media/CHC%20Images/Vol%2004%20-%2001.%20Tomlin%20-%20Voices%20from%20the%20Sacred%20Spring.pdf |pages=8, 10 |journal=Bath History |volume=4 |year=1992 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182656/http://www.bathspa.ac.uk/Media/CHC%20Images/Vol%2004%20-%2001.%20Tomlin%20-%20Voices%20from%20the%20Sacred%20Spring.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' III, [[Ovid]] called her the "goddess of a thousand works". Minerva was worshipped throughout Italy, and when she eventually became equated with the Greek goddess Athena, she also became a goddess of battle. Unlike Mars, god of war, she was sometimes portrayed with sword lowered, in sympathy for the recent dead, rather than raised in triumph and battle lust. In Rome her bellicose nature was emphasized less than elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu.com/Minerva/|title=Minerva|author=Mark Cartwright|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Roman coinage===
Minerva is featured on the coinage of different [[Roman emperor]]s. She often is represented on the reverse side of a coin holding an owl and a spear among her attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://numismatics.org/search/results?q=ric+691+domitian|title=American Numismatic Society: Browse Collection|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan Menrva==
{{Main|Menrva}}
Stemming from an Italic moon goddess ''*Meneswā'' ('She who measures'), the [[Etruscan religion|Etruscans]] adopted the inherited Old Latin name, ''*Menerwā'', thereby calling her [[Menrva]]. It is presumed that her Roman name, Minerva, is based on this [[Etruscan mythology]]. Minerva was the goddess of wisdom, war, art, schools, and commerce. She was the Etruscan counterpart to Greek [[Athena]]. Like Athena, Minerva burst from the head of her father, Jupiter (Greek [[Zeus]]), who had devoured her mother (Metis) in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent her birth.

By a process of [[folk etymology]], the Romans could have linked her foreign name to the [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''men-'' in [[Latin language|Latin]] [[word]]s such as ''mens'' meaning "mind", perhaps because one of her aspects as goddess pertained to the intellectual. The word ''mens'' is built from the [[PIE|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*men-'' 'mind' (linked with memory as in Greek [[Mnemosyne]]/μνημοσύνη and ''mnestis''/μνῆστις: memory, remembrance, recollection, ''manush'' in Sanskrit meaning mind).

The Etruscan Menrva was part of a holy [[triad (relationship)|triad]] with [[Tinia]] and [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], equivalent to the Roman [[Capitoline Triad]] of Jupiter-Juno-Minerva.

'''''Neotropical Birds Online''''' is an online encyclopedia whose subject is the bird [[species]] that breed in the [[Neotropics]].

''Neotropical Birds Online'' is patterned after ''[[Birds of North America]]''. Each account profiles a single species, and the accounts are published in the order in which they are completed. The project is sponsored by the [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]] at [[Cornell University]], a leading US research center in [[ornithology]]. The list of species covered by ''Neotropical Birds Online'' is based on the two avian checklist committees of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]]: the North American Classification Committee (NACC), which is responsible for the taxonomy and nomenclature of bird species found in [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]], including the [[Caribbean]]; and the South American Classification Committee, which covers the birds of [[South America]] and of related islands.

Each species account has a consistent format. The content of each account provides comprehensive information for each species. The topics that are covered include identification, distribution and habitat, foraging and reproductive behavior, the conservation status of the species, and the author's suggestions for the highest priorities for future research on that species. Also provided are a map of the distribution of the species and, when available, photographs of the species, its habitat, and of the nest and eggs. Also provided, when available, are recordings of the species' song and calls, selected from the collection in the [[Macaulay Library]] at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and from other online sources, such as [[xeno-canto]].

[[File:Novae Hollandiae plantarum specimen title.png|thumb|Title page]]'''''Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen''''' is a two-volume work describing the [[flora of Australia]].

The author was the French botanist [[Jacques Labillardière]], who visited the region in 1792 with the [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux|d'Entrecasteaux]] expedition. Published between 1804 and 1806, it is one of the earliest works to describe the plants of the continent;&lt;ref name="Hopper 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Stephen | last = Hopper | authorlink = Stephen Hopper | year = 2003 | title= South-western Australia, Cinderella of the world's temperate floristic regions 1 | journal = Curtis's Botanical Magazine | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 132–179 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8748.00380}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Denis Carr|Denis]]&lt;!--  Dennis John Carr --&gt; and [[Maisie Carr]]&lt;!-- Stella Grace Maisie Carr --&gt;, "[i]n practical terms, this was the first general flora of Australia."&lt;ref name="Carr 1981"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Carr, S.

The preface describes the journey "from Cape of Good Hope to Australia", an example of the continent being named as 'Australia' before its popularisation by [[Matthew Flinders|Flinders]]' use in ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''.&lt;ref name="Hopper 2003" /&gt; The work includes 256 black-and-white botanical illustrations, including contributions by [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]].&lt;ref name="Hopper 2003" /&gt; [[intaglio printing|Copper plates]] drawn by [[Pierre Antoine Poiteau]] and engraved by [[Auguste Plée]] were produced for other illustrations.&lt;ref name="Hewson 1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labillardière had named and described more Australian flora than any other botanist of the day; the work was the most comprehensive until [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] published his ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen|Prodromus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Hamilton|first=J. |title=The Flower Chain The early discovery of Australian plants|publisher=Kangaroo Press |location=Sydney |year=1998|edition=Etext University of Sydney Library |chapter=19 Australia at Malmaison |url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/pubotbin/toccer-new?id=ham.p00081.sgml&amp;images=acdp/gifs&amp;data=/usr/ot&amp;tag=botany&amp;part=19&amp;division=div1|isbn= 0-86417-922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work featured the first descriptions of ''[[Cephalotus follicularis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{APNI|name=''Cephalotus follicularis'' Labill.|id=5073}}&lt;/ref&gt; a carnivorous plant, and species ''[[Adenanthos obovatus]]'' and ''[[Gahnia trifida]]'' from the southern coast. The collections made at [[southwest Australia]] also produced new genera ''[[Adenanthos]]'' (Proteaceae) and ''[[Calytrix]]'' (Myrtaceae), species ''[[Astartea fascicularis]]'', ''[[Hakea clavata]]'' and ''[[Taxandria marginata]]'', and the first description of the now widely introduced ''[[Acacia saligna]]''.&lt;ref name="Hopper 2003" /&gt;  Tasmanian species include ''[[Eucryphia lucida]]'' (leatherwood) and ''[[Phyllocladus aspleniifolius]]'' (celery-top pine).&lt;ref name="NAF" /&gt; The first confirmed collection of Australian [[bryophyte]]s are described and illustrated by the author; the current name for these species are the mosses ''[[Cyathophorum bulbosum]]'' and ''[[Hypnodendron comosum]]'' and a liverwort ''[[Hymenophyton flabellatum]]''.&lt;ref name="bryology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/bryophyte/aust-bryology-episodes-2.html|title=The first century |last= Lepp|first=Heino|date=29 January 2009 |work=Episodes in Australian bryology|publisher=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen'' has been praised for the accuracy of its descriptions and for the elegant scientific names coined therein. It has been criticised for its imprecision and occasional errors in collection locality and habitat; for example it attributes the collection of ''[[Eucalyptus ovata]]'' to [[southwest Australia]], but it occurs only in [[Tasmania]] and southeast Australia. Labillardière has also been criticised for publishing species based upon specimens collected by other botanists, without providing attribution or acknowledgement for the specimens.&lt;ref name="Duyker 2003"&gt;{{cite book | first = Edward | last = Duyker |authorlink = Edward Duyker| year = 2003 | title = Citizen Labillardière: A naturalist's life in revolution and exploration | location = Carlton | publisher = Miegunyah Press | isbn = 0-522-85160-6 | pages = 98, 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plesner Fragment''' is a [[parchment]] page from c. 1275. It is one of the four fragments remaining, or early copy of, the original [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]] [[Gesta Danorum]]. Size is 15x13cm. It consists of one page with two written sides.

==History==
Found in 1877 by ''C. U. A. Plesner'' in [[Geheime-archive]] (Danish National Archives), where it was used as staple-list on [[Kristianstad]] [[fief]] taxman-number (skattemandtal) list of 1623.
Now owned by the [[Danish Royal Library|Royal Library]] of [[Copenhagen]]. It has Royal Library signature of ''Ny kgl. Saml. Fol. 570''.

Correspond to page 811-813 in [[Peter Erasmus Müller]] Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1839 or page 459.15 – 460.24 in [[Jørgen Olrik]] &amp; H. Ræder's Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1931.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5291">'''''Poor Robin''''' was an English 17th and 18th-century satirical [[almanac]] series, appearing as '''''Poor Robin's Almanack''''' from 1663. Other similar writings by the pseudonymous Poor Robin were published later, in America and into the 19th century.

==Origins==
The earliest volume published under the pseudonym of 'Poor Robin' was an almanac calculated from the meridian of [[Saffron Walden]], which is said to have been originally issued in 1661 or 1662. It was taken over by the [[Stationers' Company]], and was continued annually by various hands until 1776. The identity of its original author has been disputed, but is assigned as [[William Winstanley]] by [[Sidney Lee]], in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', who dismisses the claim that [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]] wrote it. He notes the discovery in the parish registers of Saffron Walden for 14 March 1646-7 relating to Robert Winstanley (a nephew of William and a younger brother of [[Henry Winstanley]]) but argues that Robert would still have been a boy when the first almanacs were written; a listing for Robert's publications was given by H. Eckroyd Smith.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes and Queries'', ser. vi. vol. 7, pp. 325-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Bullen, ''A Christmas Garland'' (London: John C. Nimmo, 1885), p. 214. [http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/provide_for_christmas.htm on line].&lt;/ref&gt; On internal grounds, namely the verse style of William Winstanley in his known works, Lee argues for the latter, and mentions a 1667 portrait of William Winstanley with caption 'Poor Robin,' with verses by [[Francis Kirkman]], in a volume called ''Poor Robin's Jests, or the Compleat Jester'. 

In the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' article on [[Robert Pory]], by [[Joseph Hirst Lupton]], it is said that Pory, at the time of the first edition in 1663 [[archdeacon of Middlesex]], had his name taken in vain with the claim that he had licensed the almanac.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Pory, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another volume in verse by 'Poor Robin,' in which the tone of [[John Taylor the water-poet]] is closely followed, was called ''Poor Robin's Perambulation from Saffron Walden to London performed this Month of July 1678'' (London, 1678,); the doggerel poem deals largely with the alehouses on the road, and Lee assigns it to William Winstanley.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Winstanley, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

"Poor Robin" established a tradition of [[parody]], reporting the trivial and inconsequential juxtaposed with the serious, in parallel chronologies&amp;mdash;set in [[Couplet|rhymed couplet]]s&amp;mdash;of the "Loyal" and the "Fanatic", which began in 1663 and became '''''Old Poor Robin''''' with the 1777 issue.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Palmeri, ''Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665-1815'', ([[University of Delaware Press]]) 2003, "Poor Robin", pp 51ff.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poor Robin'' offered deadpan prognostications of the obvious, and substituted parodic [[Saint's day|saints' day]]s under the "Fanatic" rubric. From the turn of the 18th century, the satire becomes blunted and wise homilies of prudence take their place. It observes the continued use of [[cucking stool]]s in 1746.

A '''protocol implementation conformance statement''' or, most commonly, '''PICS''' is a structured document which asserts which specific requirements are met by a given implementation of a [[communications protocol|protocol]] [[Technical standard|standard]].  It is often completed as a record of formal protocol [[conformance testing|conformance test]] results, and some [[automated testing]] systems machine-author a PICS as output.  A potential buyer or user of the implementation can consult the PICS to determine if it meets their requirements.

PICS may be used with [[TTCN-3]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2081">'''''Schmidt v Dwyer''''' is an important case in [[South African contract law]] and the [[South African law of lease]], heard in the Cape Provincial Division by De Villiers JP and Van Wyk J on August 5, 1957, with judgment handed down on August 23. It is important for its consideration of ''voetstoots'' clauses and its determination that these cannot nullify warranties.

== Facts ==
A written deed of sale of a farm, after describing the [[property]] and its approximate extent, added that "the property includes approximately 120,000 vines planted thereon." Another clause provided that "the property is sold as it stands and the seller shall not be held responsible for any defects therein whether patent or latent."

In fact, there were only 67,000 vines planted on the farm. The purchaser accordingly claimed damages

# for breach of [[warranty]]; or, alternatively,
# by reason of the misrepresentation.

== Judgment ==
In an exception to the declaration, the court held that ''ex facie'' the deed of sale the statement therein regarding the number of vines on the property amounted to a warranty, and that, as the ''voetstoots'' clause had no bearing on this statement, that clause did not debar the plaintiff from relying upon the representation. The exceptions and application to strike out were dismissed with costs.

A '''school district solicitor''' is a type of [[solicitor general]] appointed by a local [[school district]] to represent the school district's legal interests and advise the district's governing body in the proper operation of the school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsba.org/services/council-school-attorneys-cosa/what-school-lawyers-do|title=What School Lawyers Do {{!}} National School Boards Association|website=www.nsba.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The types of matters handled by school district solicitors can vary significantly, and often include drafting and making recommendations on [[Policy|policies]]; assisting with [[United States labor law|labor]] and [[employment]] matters; drafting and reviewing [[contract]]s for supplies, construction projects, real estate and more; representing schools in [[Lawsuit|litigation]]; and assuring compliance with state and federal regulations governing the operation of schools.

Most local school districts are not [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] entities, but instead get power from whatever state law creates them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.freeadvice.com/government_law/education_law/school_distrcit_powers.htm|title=What Are the Powers and Duties of a School District?|website=FreeAdvice|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state and federal laws regulating public school districts have become increasingly complex, requiring more and more help from school lawyers in recent years.

== Qualifications and background ==
In most jurisdictions, a school district solicitor must be a practicing [[lawyer]].  There generally is no special license or other registration required.  Often, a school district solicitor will work in a private [[law firm]], and the school district will contract with the lawyer or firm for the services.  In more rare instances, particularly with larger school entities, the school district may employ its own [[in-house counsel]] to act as solicitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/g/generalcounsel/|title=General Counsel - The School District of Philadelphia|website=webgui.phila.k12.pa.us|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional associations ==
School district solicitors  have created a number of professional associations for networking and professional development.  For example, the [https://www.nsba.org/ National School Boards Association (NSBA)], which is a national advocacy organization made up of school boards from all over the United States, has an affiliated entity known as the [https://www.nsba.org/services/council-school-attorneys-cosa Council of School Attorneys (COSA)] similarly made up of school district solicitors from throughout the United States. Each state also has a state association of school district solicitors, often also associated with that [https://www.nsba.org/services/state-association-services state's school boards association].

'''''Shostakovich v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp.,''''' 80 [[case citation|N.Y.S.2d]] 575 ([[New York Supreme Court|N.Y. Sup. Ct.]] 1948), aff'd, 87 N.Y.S.2d 430 ([[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|N.Y. App. Div.]] 1949), was a copyright lawsuit. In ''[[The Iron Curtain (film)|The Iron Curtain]]'', a 1948 motion picture depicting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[espionage]] in [[Canada]], [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] used compositions by composers, who were citizens and residents of the Soviet Union as background music, and on the film credited these composers with the compositions. The name of one of the composers, [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] was also used in the picture when one of the characters therein incidentally referred to him in an appreciative manner. All of the music used was in the [[public domain]] and had no [[copyright|copyright protection]], therefore the court refused to [[Wiktionary:enjoin|enjoin]] the use of the names and the music.
 
Furthermore, the use of the composers' names in conjunction with the compositions is not subject to restraint under the [[New York State]] [[civil rights]] law (§ 51). In the absence of copyright, others may use the names of the authors in copyrighting, publishing or compiling their works.

Assuming that the publication of defamatory matter may be enjoined, there was no showing that the composers have been [[slander and libel|slandered or libeled]]. There is furthermore no indication in the motion picture that the composers participated in or gave their approval or indorsement to the picture nor is their approval of it "necessarily implied" therein. No such implication exists, necessarily or otherwise, where the work of the composer is in the public domain and may be freely published, copied or compiled by others.

The case foreshadowed ''[[Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.|Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox]]'' over fifty years later.

'''''State v. Palendrano''''', 120 N.J. Super. 336, 293 [[A.2d]] 747 (Law Div. 1972), was a [[legal case]] decided by the [[New Jersey Superior Court]], Law Division, holding that the [[common law]] offense of being a [[common scold]] was no longer a crime despite the presence of [[reception statutes]] in the state.  

==Background==
In 1970, Marion Palendrano was indicted in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] for [[assault]], threatening a person's life, and being a scold. 

==Decision==
The court reasoned that the offense was superseded by the New Jersey Disorderly Persons Act.&lt;ref&gt;Dressler, J.  ''Understanding Criminal Law, Fifth Edition.''  Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc.  Newark, NJ: 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  They also expressed concerns that a female-only crime violated [[due process]] and the nature of the offense was [[Vagueness doctrine|too vague]].

'''''Kui Hua Zi (Sunflower Seeds)''''' is an art installation created by contemporary artist and political activist, [[Ai Weiwei]]. It was first exhibited at the [[Tate Modern]] art gallery in London from October 2010 to May 2011. It is a commentary on the mass production techniques that China caters to Western Countries.

Viewers were originally able to interact and walk across the sunflower seeds, but after the Tate Modern Museum recognized that the dust emitting from the installation was harmful to viewers' lungs, they fenced it off. The piece has been exhibited in twelve exhibitions from 2009-2013 in museums and galleries across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiweiweiseeds.com/exhibitions/list-of-exhibitions|title=List of Exhibitions: - Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Ai Weiwei is a [[conceptual artist]] in China. Towards the later 20th century, he led societal movements challenging the Chinese Communist Party. Ai has felt the presence and pressures of the society that the Chinese government has imposed on the peoples, and that is generated into his artwork. “‘From a very young age I started to sense that an individual has to set an example in society’, he has said. ‘Your own acts and behaviour tell the world who you are and at the same time what kind of society you think it should be.’”&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-ai-weiwei/interpretation-text|title=The Unilever Series: Ai Weiwei: Sunflower Seeds: Interpretation text - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
This massive art installation includes over 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds that cover a 1,000 square metre floor with a depth of 10cm in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The entire artwork weighs around 150 tons. Each seed went through a 30 step procedure, hand painted and fired at 1,300 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiweiweiseeds.com/about-ai-weiweis-sunflower-seeds|title=About Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds|publisher=Faurschou Foundation|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process required more than 1,600 workers over a span of two and a half years in [[Jingdezhen]], a town that is known as the "Porcelain Capital," and has produced the imperial porcelain for over a thousand years. Ai began the process two-and-a-half years before its exhibition at the [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref&gt;"About Ai Weiwei's ''Sunflower Seeds''." Ai Weiwei. Faurschou Foundation, n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
[[File:Sunflower Seeds by Ai Weiwei.jpg|thumb|right|Close up of Ai Weiwei's ''Sunflower Seeds'']]

Sunflower seeds were a common theme in the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s political propaganda during Ai's childhood. Leader [[Mao Zedong]] would often represent himself as the sun, and the people of China as seeds on sunflowers in artworks. Ai also explains that when he was growing up, even the poorest families in China could share the seeds as a treat. The seeds represent optimism during difficult times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-ai-weiwei/interpretation-text|title=The Unilever Series: Ai Weiwei: Sunflower Seeds: Interpretation text - Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
When looking at the seeds up close in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall,  picking out each unique seed proves to be an easy task. However, when standing farther back once each of the 100 million seeds is deposited in a neat and orderly fashion, all together a sense of expanse and immenseness is felt by the viewers. &lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt; The millions of individually created seeds spread across such a wide space are meant to symbolize the vastness of China, and its uniform and precise order. An individual seed is instantly lost among the millions, symbolizing the conformity and censorship of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party.]] The combination of all the seeds represent that together, the people of China can stand up and overthrow the  [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]].

Most of Ai's artworks and projects carry this theme of making the Chinese Government's faults transparent to the rest of the world, as well as encouraging freedom of expression and strength to act. Along with this, the seeds represent China's growing mass production stemming from the consumerist culture, particularly that in the Western world, upon which Chinese exporters rely. The sculpture directly challenges the “Made in China” mantra that China is known for, considering the labor-intensive and traditional method of creating the work. &lt;ref&gt; "About Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds." Ai Weiwei. Faurschou Foundation, n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The work triggered inquiries from the viewers of the piece about their society and the effects of consumerism.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Telefonbog ubt-1.JPG|thumb|A "white pages" telephone directory]]

A '''telephone directory''', also known as a '''telephone book''', '''telephone address book''', '''phone book''', or the '''white/yellow pages''', is a listing of telephone [[subscriber]]s in a geographical area or subscribers to services provided by the organization that publishes the directory. Its purpose is to allow the telephone number of a subscriber identified by name and address to be found.

The advent of the Internet and [[smartphones]] in the 21st century greatly reduced the need for a paper phone book.  Some communities, such as [[Seattle]] and [[San Francisco]], sought to ban their unsolicited distribution as wasteful, unwanted and harmful to the environment.&lt;ref name=SF&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Yellow-Pages-ruling-endangers-SF-ban-3951477.php Yellow Pages ruling endangers SF ban], Heather Knight, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 15 October 2012; accessed 19 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2019441687_yellowpages16m.html Appeals court rules against Seattle's curbs on yellow pages], Emily Heffter, ''[[Seattle Times]]'', 15 October 2012; accessed 19 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Subscriber names are generally listed in alphabetical order, together with their postal or street address and [[telephone number]].  In principle every subscriber in the geographical coverage area is listed, but subscribers may request the exclusion of their number from the directory, often for a fee; their number is then said to be "unlisted" ([[American English]]), "ex-directory" ([[British English]]), "private" or '''private number''' (Australia and New Zealand), or "non-published" (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.bell.ca/Home_phone/Phone_line/How_to_unlist_my_Bell_Home_phone_number |title=How to get a non-published Bell Home phone number |publisher=Support.bell.ca |date=2013-06-17 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone directory may also provide instructions: how to use the [[Local telephone service|telephone service]], how to dial a particular number, be it local or international, what numbers to access important and [[emergency services]], utilities, hospitals, doctors, and organizations who can provide support in times of crisis. It may also have [[civil defense]] or [[emergency management]] information. There may be transit maps, postal code/zip code guides, international dialing codes or stadium seating charts, as well as advertising.

In the US, under current rules and practices, mobile phone and [[voice over IP]] listings are not included in telephone directories.  Efforts to create cellular directories have met stiff opposition from several fronts, including those who seek to avoid [[telemarketer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Types ==
A telephone directory and its content may be known by the color of the paper it is printed on.
* White pages&lt;!--redirects here--&gt; generally indicates personal or alphabetic listings.
* [[Yellow pages]], golden pages, A2Z, or classified directory is usually a "business directory", where businesses are listed alphabetically within each of many classifications (e.g., "lawyers"), almost always with paid advertising.
* [[Reverse telephone directory|Grey pages]], sometimes called a "reverse telephone directory", allowing subscriber details to be found for a given number. Not available in all jurisdictions.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  (These listings are often published separately, in a city directory, [[Polk directory]], or under another name, for a price, and made available to commercial and government agencies.)

Other colors may have other meanings; for example, information on [[government agencies]] is often printed on [[blue pages]] or green pages.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Publication ==
Telephone directories can be published in [[hard copy]] or in electronic form. In the latter case, the directory can be used provided as an online service through proprietary terminals or over the Internet, or on physical media such as CD-ROM. In many countries directories are both published in book form and also available over the Internet. Printed directories were usually supplied free of charge.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:New haven directory 1878.jpg|thumb|upright|The first telephone directory, printed in New Haven, Connecticut in November 1878]]
Telephone directories are a type of [[city directory]]. Books listing the inhabitants of an entire city were widely published starting in the 18th century, before the invention of the telephone. 

The first telephone directory, consisting of a single piece of cardboard, was issued on 21 February 1878; it listed 50 individuals, businesses, and other offices in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] that had telephones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Phone Book | url= http://failuremag.com/feature/article/the_phone_book/ | author=Jason Zasky | work=Failure Magazine |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British telephone directory was published on 15 January 1880  by The Telephone Company. It contained 248 names and addresses of individuals and businesses in London; telephone numbers were not used at the time as subscribers were asked for by name at the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Telephone Company Limited (Bell's Patents), BT Archives reference TPA&lt;/ref&gt; The directory is preserved as part of the British phone book collection by [[BT Archives]].

In 1938, AT&amp;T commissioned the creation of a new type font, known as [[Bell Gothic|BELL GOTHIC]], the purpose of which was to be readable at very small font sizes when printed on newsprint where small imperfections were common.

In 1981 France was the first country to have an electronic directory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitepages.fr/minitel/ |title=Telephone History in France by |publisher=Whitepages.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a system called [[Minitel]]. The directory is called "11" after its telephone access number.

In 1991 the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled (in ''[[Feist v. Rural]]'') that telephone companies do not have a [[copyright]] on telephone listings, because copyright protects creativity and not the mere labor of collecting existing information.

1996 was the year the first telephone directories went online in the USA. [[Yellowpages.com]] and [[Whitepages.com]] both see their start in April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitepages.fr/telecom-history-ft-late-with-internet.html Telephone Directory History by Whitepages.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the first online telephone directories and people-finding sites such as [[LookupUK.com]] go online in the UK. In 2003, more advanced UK searching including Electoral Roll become available on [[LocateFirst.com]].

[[File:Unused Phonebooks.JPG|thumb|Recently delivered 2013–2014 phone books in the trash unopened; in the 21st century some communities have tried to stop the unsolicited distribution of the books&lt;ref name=SF/&gt;]]
In the 21st century, printed telephone directories are increasingly criticized as waste. In 2012, after some North American cities passed laws banning the distribution of telephone books, an industry group sued and obtained a court ruling permitting the distribution to continue.&lt;ref name=SF/&gt; Manufacture and distribution of telephone directories produces over 1,400,000 metric tons of [[greenhouse gases]] and consumes over 600,000 tons of paper annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Paster |first= Pablo |url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/ask-pablo-what-is-the-impact-of-all-those-unwanted-phone-books.html |title=Ask Pablo: What Is The Impact Of All Those Unwanted Phone Books? |publisher=TreeHugger |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reverse directories ==
{{main|Reverse telephone directory}}
A reverse telephone directory is sorted by number, which can be looked up to give the name and address of the subscriber.

== In popular culture ==
Ripping phone books in half has often been considered a [[Feats of strength|feat of strength]]. There are ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' for ripping the most phone books within a specific time period: the record for most phone books ripped within three minutes was established by Tina Shelton in 2007 for females (21 books)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2016|date=10 Sep 2015|publisher=Guinness World Records|isbn=9781910561034|pages=81|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=f896CgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=wUXRyT3wUQ&amp;dq=%22tina%20shelton%22%20phone%20directory%20record%20%22guinness%22&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Edward Charon in 2006 for males (56 books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most telephone directories torn in three minutes (male)|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-telephone-directories-torn-in-three-minutes-(male)|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 [[James Cameron]] film ''[[The Terminator]]'' features a titular 'cyborg assassin' antagonist sent back in time to murder the character [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]. Knowing only the name and general location of the target, the cyborg uses telephone directories from public phone booths to systematically murder everyone in the local area with that name, in the order in which they appeared in the directory, causing the press and police to use the nickname 'The Phone Book Killer'.

'''''The Metaphysical Magazine''''' was  a late 19th and early 20th century American periodical devoted to occult and metaphysical matters. Intermittently it published under other names, including ''Intelligence'', ''New Cycle'', and ''Ideal Review''.

==History==
''The Metaphysical Magazine: A Monthly Review of the Occult Sciences and Metaphysical Philosophy'' was founded in 1895 by Leander Edmund Whipple, a mental healer.&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;&lt;ref name=OL/&gt; It covered metaphysics, mental phenomena such as mental healing, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], astrology, and other occult subjects, with an emphasis on "the best and most reliable information."&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;&lt;ref name=OL/&gt; Contributors included the ornithologist and Theosophist [[Elliott Coues]] (who had the lead article in the magazine's first issue, discussing his telekinetic theory of levitation),&lt;ref name=Coues/&gt; the archaeologist [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon]], and the occultist author [[Florence Huntley]].&lt;ref name=iapsop/&gt;

It was issued monthly for the most part and ceased publication in 1911.&lt;ref name=OL/&gt; For brief periods it was published under the following alternate titles: ''Intelligence'' (June 1897 – March 1898), ''New Cycle'' (January–March 1900), and ''Ideal Review'' (April–December 1900).&lt;ref name=OL/&gt; Despite these title changes, it retained continuity in its volume numbering throughout its history.&lt;ref name=OL/&gt; 

The writer and editor John Emery McLean was the magazine's first managing editor, remaining in that position for over two years (1895–97).&lt;ref name=Mount/&gt;

In '''''Toich v Magistrate, Riverside''''' (2007), an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]], Toich's home was searched on two occasions by the [[police]], who were purportedly acting in terms of valid [[search warrant]]s. Various items and sums of cash were seized.

Toich sought an order for the return of the property seized under both warrants, and for the setting aside of the second warrant.

The court held that the first warrant authorized a search of a certain [[farm]], and not of the applicant's house, which was on an entirely different property. Accordingly, the search of her house had been unauthorized and unlawful, as had been the seizure of her property. Moreover, hardly any of the property seized had been specified in the warrant. In consequence, the applicant was entitled to the return of all the seized items.

Regarding the second warrant, the court found that the police officer had applied to the [[magistrate]] for a warrant on the grounds:

* that the Asset Forfeiture Unit had ordered the seizure of certain cash known or suspected to be in the applicant's possession;
* that the possibility existed that cash had been generated from the commission of crimes; and
* that, despite an undertaking to do so, the applicant had failed to account to the police for the source of the money.

The court held that it was clear that the only document relied upon by the police officer in her application for the warrant was her own undated and unattested "[[affidavit]]." Given that there had been no ''viva voce'' evidence, and given that the "affidavit" had not been attested, there had been no information of any kind placed before the magistrate on [[oath]]; he had had no power, therefore, under section 21(1)(a) of the CPA, to authorize the issue of the second warrant; it was accordingly invalid.

Furthermore, the court found that the authorities were clear that the validity of a search warrant was to be examined with a jealous regard for the subject's rights to privacy and property.

In addition, the magistrate or justice of the peace, in authorizing the warrant, must be satisfied by information on oath only that the article to be searched for and seized was under the control or in the possession of a specified person, or was at a specified premises within his or her [[jurisdiction]].

The terms of the warrant were to be construed with reasonable strictness. It should ordinarily be read in the terms in which it was expressed.

There must be reasonable grounds, therefore, for believing that the article sought might afford evidence of an offense, but in the instant case the court held that no such grounds had been advanced to the magistrate. He could consequently not have harbored such a belief.

It followed that he had not properly applied his mind when issuing the warrant, and that it was invalid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4624">'''William Whitaker's WORDS''' ({{lang-la|Verba Gulielmi Whitaker}}){{Citation needed|reason=Author pages never referred to the program by a Latin name|date=May 2018}} is a [[computer program]] that [[parsing|parses]] the [[inflection]] or [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of a [[Latin]] word, and also translates the [[root word|root]] into English. Given an English word, the program outputs Latin translations. The software, written in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], is free for download but can be used online through several different hosts as well.

This program, especially the online version{{clarify |date=May 2018 |reason=The original program never existed in any other but the desktop version}}, has gained popularity among Latinists because of its simple interface, high coverage of the Latin lexicon and mostly accurate results{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Nevertheless, the user has to check the results, since ''WORDS'' uses a set of rules based on natural [[prefix|pre-]], [[infix|in-]], and [[suffix]]ation, [[declension]], and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] to determine the possibility of an entry. As a consequence of this approach of analysing the structure of words, there is no guarantee that these words were ever used in Latin [[literature]] or [[Public speaking|speech]], even if the program finds a possible meaning to a given word.

A few years after the original author's death, the software became the subject of active digital preservation efforts.

==Coverage==
The dictionary consists of about 39,000 entries, which would result in hundreds of thousands of variations, counting declensions and conjugations.&lt;ref&gt;http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe Words homepage&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the dictionary contains prefixes and suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe Words&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Oxford Latin Dictionary]], considered to be the most complete Latin [[lexicon]] published in the English language, has about 34,000 entries, excluding proper names.&lt;ref name="words"&gt;[http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/words.htm#1 ND.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Latin Dictionary has fewer entries because it only contains entries from [[Classical Latin]], whereas WORDS contains words from many time periods.

==Parsing process==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
For instance, given the Latin [[verb]] form ''amābantur'', WORDS analyzes it as:

amābantur = am + (ā + ba + nt + ur), where
*'''am''' = [[:wikt:amo#Latin|amo, amare, amavi, amatus]] (English ''to [[love]]'')
*'''ā''' = theme vowel for [[indicative mood]]
*'''ba''' = marker for the [[imperfect]]
*'''nt''' = marker for third person plural [[grammatical number|number]]
*'''ur''' = marker for [[passive voice|passive]] [[grammatical voice|voice]]

So ''amābantur'' is the passive, 3rd person, plural, imperfect, indicative form of the verb "to love", which would be translated "they were being loved".

==About William Whitaker==
William A. Whitaker (1936–2010) was a colonel in the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mrt/obituary.aspx?n=william-whitaker&amp;pid=147336402 Death Notice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66889159&lt;/ref&gt; While at the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), he chaired the [[High Order Language Working Group]] that recommended development of the computer language [[Ada programming language|Ada]], in which WORDS is written. An amateur Latinist, he created the translation software called WORDS after his retirement from the forces.
