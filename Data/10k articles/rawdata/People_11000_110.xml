He was named both Gatorade and USA Today's National Player of the Year, as well as a 1998 McDonald's High School All-American after his senior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Al Harrington traded for Stephen Jackson |url=http://www.insidehoops.com/harrington-jackson-071504.shtml |work=InsideHoops.com |date=July 15, 2004 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Indiana Pacers (1998–2004)===
At only 18 years of age, Harrington was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 25th overall pick in the [[1998 NBA draft]], and spent six seasons with them, primarily coming off the bench. Harrington really began to come into his own in the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]], in which he averaged 13.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, but his season came to an end in a game against the [[Boston Celtics]] when he suffered a knee injury that forced him to miss the final 38 games of the season.

He made a comeback in the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]], becoming the only Pacer to play in all 82 games that year. He averaged 12.2 points and 6.0 rebounds per game while starting in 37 games. The following season, he boosted his averages slightly to 13.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per game, and finished second in voting for the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]]. He was an integral part of the Pacers' first run to the [[NBA Playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] since 2000.

===Atlanta Hawks (2004–2006)===
On July 15, 2004, Harrington was traded to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in exchange for [[Stephen Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/Harrington_Trade_071504.html HAWKS OBTAIN AL HARRINGTON FROM INDIANA FOR STEPHEN JACKSON]&lt;/ref&gt; Harrington finally became a nightly starter, but the Hawks did not fare as successfully as the Pacers did after his departure.

===Second run with Pacers (2006–2007)===
On August 22, 2006, Harrington and [[John Edwards (basketball)|John Edwards]] were acquired by the Indiana Pacers from the Atlanta Hawks in a sign-and-trade deal that also sent the Hawks a [[Acie Law|2007 first round draft pick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2557921 Pacers get Harrington from Hawks for first-round pick]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]], Harrington wore jersey #32 because his first choice #3 was worn by teammate [[Šarūnas Jasikevičius]] (saying it stands for "number three, and it's my second time around").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/harrington_transcript_060824.html PACERS: Harrington All Smiles Upon Return To Pacers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217135314/http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/harrington_transcript_060824.html |date=February 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cannabis==
===Entrepreneurship===
After retiring from the NBA, Harrington started a business that produces [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] extracts.  The company, Viola Extracts, is named after Harrington's grandmother who uses cannabis.  Suffering from [[glaucoma]] and [[diabetes]], she tried cannabis at the urging of Harrington and found significant relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schube|first1=Sam|title=Al Harrington Wants to Be the NBA's First Pot Mogul|url=https://www.gq.com/story/al-harrington-viola-extracts-weed-empire|accessdate=February 19, 2018|work=GQ|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company cultivates cannabis in-house and has facilities in several states.&lt;ref name="aldridge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldridge|first1=David|title=Al Harrington wants to help NBA see benefits of medical marijuana|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/30/morning-tip-al-harrington-becomes-medical-marijuana-advocate-businessman|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=nba.com|date=October 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mano|first1=Daniel|title=Ex-Warriors' talk with David Stern signals sea change on marijuana in the NBA|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/25/ex-warriors-talk-with-david-stern-signals-sea-change-on-weed-in-the-nba/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=The Mercury News|date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 Harrington announced the launch of Harrington Wellness, a company that manufactures non-psychoactive [[cannabinoid]] products.&lt;ref name="wellness"&gt;{{cite press release|date=February 16, 2018|title=Basketball Legend Al Harrington Premiers "Harrington Wellness" Upscale and Professional Brand of CBD-Based Wellness Products|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/basketball-legend-al-harrington-premiers-harrington-wellness-upscale-and-professional-brand-of-cbd-based-wellness-products-300599869.html|agency=PR Newswire|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also announced was his investment in a third company Butter Baby, which makes [[cannabis edible]]s.&lt;ref name="wellness" /&gt;  All three companies together comprise The Harrington Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Johnny|title=Cleveland Cavaliers Coach And NBA Players Attend CBD Product Launch|url=https://www.weednews.co/cleveland-cavaliers-coach-and-nba-players-attend-cbd-product-launch/|accessdate=March 9, 2018|work=Weed News|date=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
Harrington is a proponent for the legalization of cannabis.  In October 2016, he appeared in an online ad endorsing the passage of California's [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|Proposition 64]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tinsley|first1=Justin|title=Retired NBA Vets Are Making Legal Marijuana The New Pick And Roll|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/retired-nba-vets-are-making-legal-marijuana-the-new-pick-and-roll/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=The Undefeated|date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also written an essay for ''[[The Players' Tribune]]'' titled "9 Reasons to End the War on Marijuana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrington|first1=Al|title=9 Reasons to End the War on Marijuana|url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/al-harrington-ending-the-war-on-marijuana/|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=The Players' Tribune|date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, Harrington interviewed former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] regarding cannabis use by players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Commissioner David Stern: Medical marijuana should be removed from banned list|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/10/25/david-stern-medical-marijuana-al-harrington|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=nba.com|date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stern told Harrington during the interview: "I'm now at the point where personally I think [cannabis] probably should be removed from the banned list.  You've persuaded me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Stern thinks medical marijuana shouldn't be on banned list|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21157188/medical-marijuana-studied-taken-banned-list|accessdate=February 20, 2018|work=ESPN|date=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2584">'''Adolphus Albert Le Sueur''' (8 December 1849 – 25 April 1906), often known as '''Albert Le Sueur''', was an astronomer known for his early involvement with the [[Great Melbourne Telescope]] and his preliminary use of astronomical [[spectroscopy]].

== Life ==
Adolphus Albert Le Sueur was born on 8 December 1849,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;W. Steinicke, ''Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae and Star Clusters: From Herschel to Dreyer's New Catalogue'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 415–416.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of John Le Sueur, a mercer, of [[Jersey]]. He [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1859, being admitted to [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], where he was a [[Scholarship|scholar]]. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor of arts]] degree as 21st [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in 1863,&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Venn, ''Alumni Cantabrigienses'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1951), vol. ii, part iii, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; he trained in astronomy under [[John Couch Adams]] at a local observatory. In 1866, he was invited to oversee the construction of the [[Great Melbourne Telescope]] at the [[Grubb Family Iron Dynasty|Grubb]] factory in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Le Sueur wrote that he felt he had little "special knowledge" in the field of astronomy, but would endeavour to prove himself capable to his clients. In the meantime, he was coached in [[Astrophotography|celestial photography]] by [[Warren De la Rue|Warren de la Rue]] and immersed himself in the intricacies of building the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gillespie, ''The Great Melbourne Telescope'' (Victoria Museums Publishing, ebook, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, he supervised its transportation to and erection in [[Melbourne]]; despite being a talented astronomer, drawer and photographer, he clashed with the telescope's director and returned home in 1870.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Le Sueur's observations were amongst preliminary attempts at using astronomical spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;R. Haynes, ''Explorers of the Southern Sky: A History of Australian Astronomy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Jersey, the remaining trajectory of his life is largely unclear and it does appear that he made further observations. He married in 1875 and died on 25 April 1906, aged 58.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

'''Alice Ann Bailey''' (June 16, 1880&amp;nbsp;– December 15, 1949) was a writer of more than twenty-four books on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] subjects, and was one of the first writers to use the term [[New Age]]. Bailey was born as '''Alice La Trobe-Bateman''', in [[Manchester]], England.&lt;ref&gt;''American Astrology'' magazine, September 1937&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.

Bailey's works, written between 1919 and 1949, describe a wide-ranging system of [[esotericism|esoteric]] thought covering such topics as how [[spirituality]] relates to the [[Solar System]], meditation, healing, spiritual psychology, the destiny of nations, and prescriptions for society in general. She described the majority of her work as having been [[telepathy|telepathically]] dictated to her by a Master of Wisdom, initially referred to only as "the Tibetan" or by the initials "D.K.", later identified as [[Djwal Khul]].&lt;ref name="Bailey, Alice 1951 p 1"&gt;Bailey 1951 p.1. From the Preface by Foster Bailey.&lt;/ref&gt; Her writings bore some similarity to those of [[Madame Blavatsky]] and are among  the teachings often referred to as the "Ageless Wisdom". Though Bailey's writings differ in some respects to the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky, they have much in common with it. She wrote on religious themes, including [[Christianity]], though her writings are fundamentally different from many aspects of Christianity or other orthodox religions. Her vision of a unified society included a global "spirit of religion" different from traditional religious forms and including the concept of the [[Astrological age|Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 1951. pp.233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jenkins&gt;Jenkins 2000. p.87. "Writers of the 1920s and 1930s presented themselves as advocates of a New Age of occult enlightenment, and Alice Bailey did much to popularize the dual terms 'New Age' and 'Aquarian'"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and early life ===
Bailey was born to a wealthy middle class British family and, as a member of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]], received a thorough Christian education.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey 1951. pp. 9, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her autobiography states that at the age 15, on June 30, 1895, Bailey was visited by a stranger, "... a tall man, dressed in European clothes and wearing a [[turban]]" who told her she needed to develop self-control to prepare for certain work he planned for her to do.&lt;ref name=Keller763&gt;}Keller 2006. p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;  This turned out to be the creation and publication of 19 books together with educational and meditation work that reached into "practically all the countries of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

At the age of 22, Bailey did [[evangelism|evangelical]] work in connection with the [[YMCA]] and the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Together they moved to America where Evans became an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] priest.&lt;ref name="Keller, Rosemary 2006 p 762"&gt;Keller, Rosemary Skinner. ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America''. Indiana University Press. 2006. p 762&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage did not last and Bailey pushed for and received a divorce. She left with their three children after formal separation in 1915. Then followed a difficult period in which she worked in a sardine factory to support herself and the children.&lt;ref name="Keller763" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sutcliffe46"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |page=46 |isbn=0-415-24299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== With the Theosophical Society ===
[[File:Theosophicalseal.svg|150px|thumbnail|The Society's seal incorporated the Swastika, Star of David, Ankh, Aum and Ouroboros symbols]]
Bailey discovered the [[Theosophical Society]] and the work of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]. The Theosophical Society states that Bailey became involved in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Joy, ''100 Years of Theosophy, A History of the Theosophical Society in America,'' 1987, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophist Joy Mills states that in 1918 she became a member of the Esoteric Section of the society.&lt;ref&gt;Meade, Marion, ''Madame Blavatsky, the Woman Behind the Myth,'' [[Music Corporation of America|Putnam]], 1980, p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophist Bruce F. Campbell notes, "She quickly rose to a position of influence in the American Section of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]] society, moving to its headquarters at [[Krotona]] in [[Hollywood]]. She became editor of its magazine, ''The Messenger,'' and member of the committee responsible for Krotona."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1980, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919, Foster Bailey (1888–1977), who was to be her second husband, became National Secretary of the Theosophical Society. They married in 1921.&lt;ref name="penn2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Penn |first=Lee |title=False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One World Religion |publisher=Sophia Perennis |year=2004 |page=20 |isbn=1-59731-000-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theosophist published the first few chapters of her first work, ''Initiation, Human and Solar,''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw_aQnzCDpwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=the+first+chapter+of+%22initiation+human+and+solar%22+appeared+in+the+messenger+theosophical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ABBuXj9Kiv&amp;sig=LQThdUH6B3DAzyl2mCWWI2VUQtM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBraW0gIrLAhVN-m]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;762) but then stopped for reasons Bailey called "theosophical jealousy and reactionary attitude".&lt;ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 151"&gt;Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey "objected to the 'neo-Theosophy' of [[Annie Besant]]" and worked with Foster Bailey to gain more power in the American Section.&lt;ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 151" /&gt; According to Theosophist [[Josephine Maria Davies Ransom]], she became part of a progressive "Back to Blavatsky movement, led mainly by Mr. and Mrs. Foster Bailey".&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, Josephine, ''A Short History of the Theosophical Society'', Adyar, 1938, p. 452&lt;/ref&gt; She outlined her vision for the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society; however, her efforts to influence the society failed, and she and her husband were dismissed from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]], Bailey's early writings of communications with the Tibetan were well received within the society, but society president Annie Besant questioned Bailey's claims of communications with "the Tibetan" and allowed the Baileys to be expelled from the organization.&lt;ref name=hammer65&gt;{{cite book |last=Hammer |first=Olav |title=Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age |publisher=BRILL |year=2004 |page=65 |isbn=90-04-13638-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bailey, she had come to see the society as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and involved with "lower psychic phenomena".&lt;ref name=Keller763 /&gt;

=== Lucis Trust ===
{{Main|Lucis Trust}}
Alice and Foster Bailey founded the Lucis Trust in 1922. Its activities include the Arcane School, World Goodwill, Triangles, a quarterly magazine called The Beacon, and a publishing company primarily intended to publish Bailey's many books. The Arcane School gives instruction and guidance in meditation, via correspondence, based on the ideas in Bailey's books. World Goodwill is intended to promote better human relations through goodwill which they define as "love in action".  That "action" included support of the [[United Nations]]. The "Triangles" are groups of three people who agree to link up in thought each day and to meditate on right human relations, visualising light and love pouring into human minds and hearts, followed by the use of the Great Invocation. It is not necessary for each person to link in thought at the same time each day and need only take a few moments of time.

Alice and Foster Bailey founded, "Lucifer Publishing Company".  ("'[[Lucifer]]' and 'Lucis' come from the same word root, ''lucis'' being the Latin genitive case meaning ''of light''."[https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school/talks_and_articles/the_esoteric_meaning_lucifer]  After the first two or three years, the name was changed to "Lucis Publishing Co."&lt;ref&gt;Initiation, Human and Solar. Copyright 1922 by Alice A. Bailey. First Edition. Lucifer Publishing Co., 135 Broadway, New York City&lt;/ref&gt;   (The Theosophical Society also used the name "Lucifer" for its early magazine.)  In 1923, with the help of Foster Bailey, Alice Bailey founded the Arcane School, which is part of Lucis Trust.  This school provides educational correspondence, meditation instruction, and guided study based on her writings.[https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school]

Bailey continued to work up to the time of her death in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Judah, Stillson J. "History and Philosophy of Metaphysical Movements in America" (1967), Westminster Press, pp.119–131, and Campbell, Bruce, ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (1980), pp. 150–55, [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, {{ISBN|0-520-03968-8}}, as cited in Beekman, Scott, ''William Dudley Pelley: A Life in Right-Wing Extremism And the Occult'' (2005), p.196, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|0-8156-0819-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main ideas ==

=== The Seven Rays of energy ===
Bailey's writings includes a detailed exposition of the "seven rays" which are presented as the fundamental energies that are behind and exist throughout all manifestation.  They are seen as the basic creative forces of the universe and emanations of Divinity that underlie the evolution of all things.[https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school/talks_and_articles/the_science_the_seven_rays]  The rays are described as related to human psychology, the destiny of nations, as well as the planets and stars of the heavens.  The concept of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|seven rays]] can be found in Theosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ernest, ''The Seven Rays,'' Theosophical Publishing House, Wheaton, Illinois, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell writes that Bailey, "... was the first to develop the idea of the seven rays, although it can be found in germ in earlier Theosophical writings."&lt;ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153" /&gt; The seven rays also appear in Hindu religious philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colebrooke |first=Henry Thomas|title=Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus |publisher=Williams and Norgate |year=1858 |pages=79, 83, 119 |quote=Reprinted from 'Asiatic researches' and from the 'Transactions of the Royal Asiatic society.'

=== Esoteric astrology ===

[[Esoteric astrology]] is part of Alice Bailey's "Ageless Wisdom" teachings, which she said were relayed by her Tibetan Master Djwhal Khul.&lt;ref name="Leo 1978 318"&gt;{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=1978|publisher=Destiny Books|isbn=0-89281-181-1|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leo 2005 88"&gt;{{cite book|title=Symbolism and Astrology: An Introduction to Esoteric Astrology|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo Classics|isbn=1-59605-614-2|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The esoteric astrologers who follow the teachings of Bailey typically base their work on her five-volume ''Treatise on the Seven Rays'', particularly volume three which focuses on astrology.  Her esoteric astrology deals with the evolution of soul consciousness and the obstacles to that evolution.&lt;ref name="Oken 1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=Soul-Centered Astrology|last=Oken|first=Alan|year=1990|publisher=The Crossing Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Esoteric healing ===
Bailey's teaching on healing primarily concerns the relationship of soul to personality, of the spiritual to the material nature.  In her view, all disease has its ultimate root in some type of blocked or inhibited soul life.  Therefore, healing consists of releasing the soul, that is the establishing of a right relation between the soul and the personality where the personality is defined as the instrument of soul expression.[https://www.lucistrust.org/books/ponder_on_this/ponder_online/contents/part_2/books_ponder_on_this_ponder_online_contents_part_2_068_070][https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/esoteric_healing_obooks/part_one_the_basic_causes_disease/chapter_the_psychological_causes_disease_part1]

=== The constitution of man ===
In line with previous Theosophical teachings,&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W., ''A Textbook Of Theosophy,'' The Theosophical Publishing House, India, 1914, chapter I&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey taught that man consists of
# Soul (higher mind, Love nature, true self or higher consciousness)
# Personality consisting of three aspects
#* Lower mind (intellect)
#* Emotions or astral nature
#* Physical and etheric body
Each of the three aspects of the lower nature is described as a "body" or aura of energy and seen as partial expression of the real self or soul.   The soul is regarded as the real self that works through or uses the three aspects of personality.&lt;ref name="Bailey, Alice 1953 p 564"&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing.'' Lucis Trust. 1953 p 564&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust. 1922 p IV, chart III&lt;/ref&gt; She also speaks of these as "vehicles" or "sheaths", and alternately as the "mental body", "astral body", or "physical body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ponder on This|url = https://www.amazon.com/Ponder-on-This/dp/B004U4Q6XC/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=|publisher = Lucis|date = 1983-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "etheric" body is most directly related to physical health and is seen as the vital energizing agent for the individual while in physical incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Esoteric Codex: Theosophy I|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_O9zBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Lulu.com|date = 2014-02-13|isbn = 978-1-312-01114-4|language = en|first = Mark|last = Rogers}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;172)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ponder on this: From the Writings of Alice A.

=== The Great Invocation ===
The ''Great Invocation'' is a mantra given in 1937 by Bailey. The mantra begins with "From the point of Light within the Mind of God, let light stream forth into the minds of men ..." with the rest of the passage expressing the ideas of love, the return of [[Christ (title)|The Christ]] ([[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]]) and of men acting in accordance with the plan of God.

It is well known by some followers of the New Age movement, where it is widely used as part of meditation, particularly in groups.&lt;ref name="melton57"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton |first1=J. Gordon |last2=Clark |first2=Jerome |last3=Kelly |first3=Aidan A. |title=New Age Encyclopedia  |publisher=Gale Research Inc |year=1990 |page=57 |isbn=0-8103-7159-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the invocation has been used in the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community since the 1970s. In response to the [[September 11 attacks]] (2001), the Great Invocation was used as a central element of a new daily program at Findhorn known as the "Network of Light meditations for peace".&lt;ref name=sutcliffe138&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |pages=138–139 |isbn=0-415-24299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosemary Keller described the Great Invocation as a call for "the Christ to return to Earth" and wrote that Bailey-related groups purchased radio and television time to broadcast the invocation as part of their mission, and that often the invocation was recited in what Keller called "light groups", to accomplish what Bailey's disciples considered to be attracting and focusing "spiritual energies to benefit the planet".&lt;ref name="Keller763" /&gt;

Alice Bailey's writings have a theme that generally advocates replacement of the old with the new and this occurs in connection with the Great Invocation as follows:  "This new Invocation, if given widespread distribution, can be to the new world religion what the [[Lord's Prayer]] has been to Christianity and the [[Psalm 23|23rd Psalm]] has been to the spiritually minded Jew."[https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/the_reappearance_the_christ/chapter_two_christ_unique_occasion]

==== Antisemitism ====
Researcher Hannah Newman described what she found to be an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] element in the Great Invocation. According to Newman, "the Plan" named in the invocation refers to the plan authored by "the Hierarchy", that Newman states places "high priority on removing all Jewish presence and influence from human consciousness, a goal to be achieved by eliminating [[Judaism]]."&lt;ref name="newman351"&gt;{{cite book|title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |editor-first=Richard S. |editor-last=Levy |first=Hannah |last=Newman |contribution=Invocation, The Great |year=2005 |pages=351–352 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1851094393#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Invocation%2C%20The%20Great%22&amp;f=false |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-85109-439-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|A commentary on the Great Invocation on Lucis Trust's website says "Christ emphasised ever the Fatherhood of God and substituted it in place of the cruel, jealous tribal Jehovah."&lt;ref&gt;Lucis Trust, "The Use and Significance of the Great Invocation," https://www.lucistrust.org/the_great_invocation/the_use_and_significance_the_great_invocation1, accessed May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Marcionism]].}}

=== Discipleship and service ===
Bailey's writings downplayed traditional devotional and religious aspects of the spiritual life, in favor of a life of meditation, service to humanity, and cooperation with "the Plan of the Hierarchy".&lt;ref name=Lane132&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age|last=Lane |first=David H.|page=132|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}} "One of the three fundamental requirements of the training in the School is "occult meditation" and disciples are taught to "cooperate with the Plan of Hierarchy" elaborated in the writings of Alice Bailey. Serving "the Plan" by serving humanity is central to the esotericism which forms a practical way of life for disciples and prepares them for "service in the Aquarian age". (''[footnote in situ]'' from the Arcane School brochure supplied by the Triangle Center, Wllington NZ. The Aquarian Age is the "New Age" issued in under the astrological sign Aquarius.)"&lt;/ref&gt;  In her thinking, service, "... is a soul instinct ... innate and peculiar to soul unfoldment. It is the outstanding characteristic of the soul, just as desire is the outstanding characteristic of the lower nature ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Esoteric Psychology Vol II|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axsqmWdk3FQC|publisher = Lucis Publishing Companies|date = 1942-01-01|isbn = 978-0-85330-119-6|language = en|first = Alice A.|last = Bailey|first2 = Djwhal|last2 = Khul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unity and divinity of nations and groups ===
Ross describes Bailey's teachings as emphasizing the "underlying unity of all forms of life", and the "essential oneness of all religions, of all departments of science, and of all the philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell notes that the New Group of World Servers was established for "... promotion of international understanding, economic sharing, and religious unity".&lt;ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153" /&gt;

=== Comparison with Theosophy ===
{{Theosophy}}

Theosophists are divided on their assessment of Alice Bailey's writings. For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer [[Geoffrey Hodson]] wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, "Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt."&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''World Theosophy Magazine,'' February 1931&amp;nbsp;– June 1931, The Theosophical Society, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Olav Hammer writes, "Her first book, ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition."&lt;ref&gt;[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]], ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age''. BRILL, 2001, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. "During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the latter had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice's work with the Tibetan."&lt;ref name="Keller, Rosemary 2006 p 762" /&gt; For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see [[Theosophy in Scandinavia]].

Campbell writes that Bailey's books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky's work evoke a picture of [[Tibet]] as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a 'post-Theosophical' theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from "former personal pupils of Blavatsky" and notes that her third book (''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'') not only reproduces Blavatsky's apocryphal [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, Steven J, ''Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices.'' Routledge, 2003, p 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallels between Theosophy and Bailey are many, for instance, one principle of Theosophy, the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|Law of Attraction]] was discussed in esoteric writings by Blavatsky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky |first=Helena Petrovna |title=Isis Unveiled: Secrets of the Ancient Wisdom Tradition|author2=Michael Gomes |publisher=Quest Books |year=1997 |page=83 |isbn=0-8356-0729-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annie Besant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Besant |first=Annie Wood |title=Popular Lectures on Theosophy |publisher=Theosophical Publishing House |year=1919 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Quan Judge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judge |first=William Quan |title=The Ocean of Theosophy |publisher=United Lodge of Theosophists |year=1915 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar |first=Sri K.

Jon Klimo, in ''Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources'', writes, "As with Blavatsky/Theosophical material, and more recent contemporary channeled material from other sources, we find in the Bailey work the same occult cosmological hierarchy: physical, etheric, astral, mental, causal, and higher inhabited levels of existence."&lt;ref&gt;Klimo, Jon, ''Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources'', J. Tarcher, Inc, 1987, p 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olav Hammer]], in the book ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', highlights Bailey's Theosophical similarities as well as noting what he thinks are some differences between them: "To a large extent, Bailey's teachings are a restatement and amplification of theosophy of the ''Secret Doctrine.'' Bailey inherited from Blavatsky and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Leadbeater]] a predilection for profuse details and complex classificatory schemes. ... Her books have also introduced shifts in emphasis as well as new doctrinal elements."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Olav, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age." BRILL, 2001, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Theosophical critics have contended that there are major differences between Bailey's ideas and the Theosophy of Blavatsky, such as Bailey's embrace of some mystical Christian terms and concepts&lt;!-- Which? --&gt; and her acceptance of [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]].&lt;ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153"&gt;Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1980, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blava_arc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/baileyal.htm|title=Theosophy's Shadow: A Critical Look at the Claims and Teachings of Alice A. Bailey|author=Weeks, Nicholas|publisher=blavatskyarchives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine ''Fohat'' in 1997, felt Bailey's assertion that "... her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus" was false. Her books are in fact "rooted in the [[Neo-Theosophy|pseudo-theosophy]] pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater." He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater's "fantasy" of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey's ''[[Great Invocation]]'', a prayer supposed to "induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities" to lead the [[Aquarian Age]]. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on "the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)#Maitreya and the "Christ Principle"|Christos principle]] within each person".&lt;ref name=blava_arc /&gt;  However, Nicholas Weeks' thesis would seem to be, in part, contrary to statements where Bailey emphasized the Christos principle in each person, e.g.:  "The Christ of history and the Christ in the human heart are planetary facts."[https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/the_reappearance_the_christ/chapter_three_the_reappearance_the_christ]

=== Ideas about races and evolution ===
Bailey described a concept of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a "ladder of evolution". These '"races" do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the [[Aryan]] [[root race]] (or '5th race'), is an "emerging new race" and so a relative new evolutionary phenomena.  The term "Aryan" as used by her has a different meaning than a separative or racist use of the word. She stated that this newer type is forming in every land but primarily in lands where [[Caucasian race|Caucasian peoples]] are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. Bailey considered the Aryan race to be determined by a state of consciousness rather than by genetic or racial traits.  She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness. "I speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or in its [[Nordic race|Nordic]] implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=Glamour, A World Problem |publisher=Lucis Publishing |year=1950 |pages=113–114 |isbn=978-0-85330-109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Education in the New Age'', Bailey made predictions about the use of this esoteric racial concept in the schools of the future and that these schools would incorporate the idea of "root races".  These "races" are a way of conceptualizing evolution as it occurs over vast prehistoric spans of time, and during which humanity developed body (Lemurian), emotion (Atlantean), and mind (Aryan).  She states that there is now being developed a "new race" with a spiritual dimension that expresses as "group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, ''Education in the New Age'', p. 69–71&lt;/ref&gt; However, she stated that this new development may take many thousands of years and may therefore not be the quick advance some of her [[New Age]] followers wish for. In her ''The Destiny of the Nations'', Bailey described a process by which this "new race" will evolve, after which "very low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard."&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;Penn, Lee, ''False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One-World Religion'', p. 264, Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|1-59731-000-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, " Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 209, 261, 268''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey's sometimes elusive and abstract ideas on the races are perhaps more clear in following passage in which she address the phenomena of [[Miscegenation|mixing of races]].

from page 222 of her book, ''Esoteric Healing'' and it provides context for the criticisms that follow.

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years—due to migration, travel, education and mental unity—has led to there being no really pure racial types today.  This is far more certainly the case than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history of mankind is considered.  Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as a result of the world war, 1914–1945) will be increasingly the case.  This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Criticism of her ideas on races ====
Bailey's ideas about race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a [[cultural anthropologist]] and ethnographer, who in a survey of modern [[Neopaganism]] in Russia, drew particular attention to "... groups [that] take an extremely negative view of [[Multiculturalism|multi-culturalism]], object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration."  Shnirelman saw some of Bailey's ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of [[Julius Evola]], saying that "... racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its "Jewish inheritance" and reject the "[[Hebrew Bible|Jewish Bible]]" as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius."&lt;ref name="Shnirelman"&gt;[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/13shnir.html Shnirelman, Victor A. ''Russian Neo-pagan Myths and Antisemitism''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810224751/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/13shnir.html |date=2007-08-10 }} in ''Acta no. 13, Analysis of Current Trends in Antisemitism.'' The Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 1998. Retrieved 2007-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shnirelman's view was echoed by Isaac Lubelsky who criticized not only Bailey, but Blavatsky, Steiner, and others.  In Lubelsky's view, racists ideas were common to  the whole "Theosophical family".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mythological and Real Race Issues in Theosophy, in "Handbook of the Theosophical Current"|last = Lubelsky|first = Isaac Lubelsky|publisher = Brill|year = 2013|isbn = |location = https://isaaclubelsky.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lubelsky-mythological-and-real-race-issues-in-theosophy.pdf|pages = 335–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monica Sjöö]], a Swedish painter, writer and a radical anarcho/eco-feminist wrote that Bailey, through her published teachings, had a "reactionary and racist influence on the whole New Age movement."&lt;ref name="Sjoo"&gt;[[Monica Sjöö|Sjöö, Monica]] of the 1960s onward. [http://monicasjoo.org/artic/channelbrief/sinisterchannelings1.htm ''The Racist Legacy of Alice Bailey''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063909/http://monicasjoo.org/artic/channelbrief/sinisterchannelings1.htm |date=2016-03-04 }} in ''From the Flames&amp;nbsp;– Radical Feminism with Spirit'' issue 22. Winter 1998/1999. Retrieved August 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; She also noted what she called Bailey's (and Theosophy's) "[[Fascism|pro-fascist]] religious views", such as the belief in a secret elite of "Masters" who influence world events and human minds through occult means and attempt to bring about the evolution of an Aryan race (although this is an understandably modern misunderstanding of her teaching&amp;nbsp;– 'Aryan' as used by Bailey is easily confused with the modern terminology, and the "Masters" are not an elite, but instead are 'enlightened' individuals originally introduced in theosophy as having evolved beyond the human or "4th kingdom" into the fifth or "Kingdom of souls", and who&amp;nbsp;– in her view&amp;nbsp;– guide the human race as a whole).&lt;ref&gt;Sjöö, Monica, ''Some Thoughts About the New Age Movement, ''Wood and Water'' magazine, Summer 1989:2–6.

Controversy has arisen around some of Bailey's statements on [[nationalism]], [[American isolationism]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet totalitarianism]], [[Fascism]], [[Zionism]], [[Nazism]], [[race relations]], Africans, Jews, and the religions of [[Judaism]] and Christianity. [[Yonassan Gershom]] and others have claimed that her writings contain racist material.&lt;ref name=newman351 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gershom /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penn |first=Lee |title=False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One World Religion |publisher=Sophia Perennis |year=2004 |pages=267–268, 273, 299 |isbn=1-59731-000-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Elliott |title=A Crash Course on the New Age Movement: Describing and Evaluating a Growing Movement |publisher=[[Baker Book House]] |year=1989 |page=197 |isbn=0-8010-6248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[Hasidic Judaism|Chassidic]] author [[Yonassan Gershom]] wrote that Bailey's plan for a [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] and her call for "the gradual dissolution—again if in any way possible—of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] faith" revealed that "her goal is nothing less than the destruction of [[Judaism]] itself." Gershom also wrote that "This stereotyped portrayal of Jews is followed by a hackneyed diatribe against the Biblical Hebrews, based upon the "angry Jehovah" theology of nineteenth-century [[Protestantism]]. Jews do not, and never have, worshipped an angry vengeful god, and we Jews never, ever call God 'Jehovah'."&lt;ref name=Gershom&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinenet.com/rooster/bailey.html |title=Antisemitic Stereotypes in Alice Bailey's Writings |last1=Gershom |first1=Yonassan |year=2005 |origyear=orig. 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012013627/http://pinenet.com/~rooster/bailey.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On organized religions ===
Bailey taught a form of universal spirituality that transcended denominational identification, believing that, "Every class of human beings is a group of brothers. Catholics, Jews, Gentiles, occidentals and orientals are all the sons of God." She stated that all religions originate from the same spiritual source, and that humanity will eventually come to realize this, and as they do so, the result will be the emergence of a universal world religion and a "new world order".&lt;ref name=Lane139&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age|last=Lane |first=David H.|page=139|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hick155&gt;{{cite book|title=Dialogues in the Philosophy of Religion |last=Hick |first=John |page=155|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2001 |isbn=0-333-76103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Steven Sutcliffe wrote that Bailey's "World Goodwill" organization was promoting groups of "world servers" to, as he quotes Bailey, "serve the Plan, Humanity, the Hierarchy and the Christ".&lt;ref name="sutcliffe51"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |page=51 |isbn=0-415-24299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her focus on unity of religion, Bromley and Hammond point out that Bailey and other "occultists" "... hammered home the central idea, 'The East is the true home of spiritual knowledge and occult wisdom'."&lt;ref name=bromley1&gt;{{cite book |last=Bromley |first=David G.|author2=Phillip E. Hammond |title=The Future of New Religious Movements |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=1987 |page=15 |isbn=0-86554-238-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

=== Groups founded by Bailey or her followers ===
The Arcane School, founded by Alice and Foster Bailey to disseminate spiritual teachings, organizes a worldwide "Triangles" program to bring people together in groups of three, for daily meditation and study. Their belief is that they receive divine energy through meditation and that this energy is transmitted to humanity, so raising spiritual awareness.&lt;ref&gt;"New Age Movement", subsection "Origins", in ''Encyclopædia Britannica.'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; John Michael Greer's ''New Encyclopedia of the Occult'' states that the school "seeks to develop a New Group of World Servers to accomplish the work of the Hierarchy of Masters, under the guidance of its head, the Christ."&lt;ref name=greer31&gt;{{cite book |last=Greer |first=John Michael |title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2003 |page=31 |isbn=1-56718-336-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on the New Age Movement ===
Bailey made extensive use of the term "[[New Age]]" in her books and some writers have described her as the founder of the New Age movement,&lt;ref name=jenkins /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shnirelman /&gt;&lt;ref name=pike1&gt;{{cite book |last=Pike |first=Sarah M. |title=New Age and Neopagan Religions in America |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2004 |page=64 |isbn=0-231-12402-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''[[The New Age]]'' was used as the title of a Journal of Christian liberalism and Socialism, published as early as 1894, predating Bailey's use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orage.mjp.brown.edu/mjp/pdf/Martin02.pdf |title=Chapter II.

James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton, in ''Perspectives on the New Age'' wrote, "The most important—though certainly not the only—source of this transformative metaphor, as well as the term "New Age", was Theosophy, particularly as the Theosophical perspective was mediated to the movement by the works of Alice Bailey."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. and J. Gordon Melton. ''Perspectives on the New Age''. SUNY Press. 1992. p xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir John Sinclair, in his book ''The Alice Bailey Inheritance'', commented on the seminal influence of Alice Bailey, which, he said, underlies the consciousness growth movement in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Sir John R. ''The Alice Bailey Inheritance''. Turnstone Press Limited. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on neopaganism ===
Several writers have mentioned the affinity of some of Bailey's concepts with modern expressions of [[paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Richard H., &amp; Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: paganism in the modern world'', Edinburgh University Press, 1998, pp 34, 41–43, 203, 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Daren, ''New Age: A Guide,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, the [[neopagan]] author and [[ceremonial magic]] ritualist Caroll Poke Runyon published a magazine called ''The Seventh Ray,'' its name taken from the writings of Alice Bailey. In the 1990s, two volumes of collected articles from the magazine were published as ''The Seventh Ray Book I, The Blue Ray'' and ''The Seventh Ray Book II, the Red Ray.''

In contrast to this, Daren Kemp in ''Handbook to the New Age'' sees critical differences between neopaganism and New Age movements and indicates that it is a mistake to conflate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== Influence on women in religion ===
Author [[Catherine Wessinger]] wrote that Bailey was a liberated woman "... sixty years before it became popular" and that Bailey's books expressed a similar "millennial view" to the works of Annie Besant.  Wessinger stated that they were "an important source of the contemporary New Age movement."&lt;ref&gt;Wessinger, Catherine Lowman, ''Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations Outside The Mainstream.'' University of Illinois, Press, 1993, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America'', several leaders of New Age philosophy have further developed Bailey's teachings, including the well-known personalities [[JZ Knight]] (who channels the entity known by the name [[Ramtha]]), [[Helen Schucman]] (author of [[A Course in Miracles]] through the process of telepathic dictation she called "scribing"), and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (who published what she referred to as "dictations from Ascended Masters").  These developments have been referred to by other sources as "spin-offs" and splinter groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The "Tibetan" teacher, Djwhal Khul, whom Bailey claimed was the co-author of many of her books, has also been claimed as co-author by two new female channelers, Violet Starre and Moriah Marston. Starre claims to have channeled Bailey's old teacher twice: the title of her first book, ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays &amp; More'', owes an obvious debt to Bailey's writings, and is sometimes listed in book catalogues under the full title "''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays &amp; More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A. Bailey)'' by Djwhal (channeled Through Violet Starre) Khul.".&lt;ref&gt;Djwhal (channeled Through Violet Starre) Khul ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays &amp; More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A. Bailey)'' Light Technology Publishing (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The same influence can also be seen in Starre's ''The Amethyst Light: Djwhal Khul Through Violet Starre'', published in 2004. Marston's ''Soul Searching with Djwahl Khul, the Tibetan'', was published in 2006, and according to her publisher, Airleaf Books, "She has been a conscious channel for Ascended Master Djwhal Khul since 1986."

The many claims and teachings of the spin-off groups underscores their divergences, for example there appears to be a widespread confusion about the phrase and meaning of "Ascendant Master" in that it was adopted by Mark and Elizabeth Prophet but not by Theosophists or Alice Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

=== Influence on psychotherapy and healing ===
In 1930, with the patronage of English-Dutch spiritualist, theosophist and scholar [[Olga Froebe-Kapteyn]], Bailey established the short-lived "School of Spiritual Research" located on Froebe-Kapteyn's estate, Casa Gabriella, in Switzerland. (In 1932 the school was closed because of personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the [[Eranos]] group.)

Princeton University Press. 1989, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey's magazine ''The Beacon''; and he was a trustee of Bailey's organization, the Lucis Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Richard H., &amp; Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World,'' p.44&lt;/ref&gt; He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey's work.&lt;ref&gt;Grof, Stanislav, ''The Adventure of Self-Discovery,'' SUNY Press, 1988 p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromley, David G. &amp; Phillip E.

Roger J. Woolger said, in a paper presented to the "Beyond the Brain" Conference held at [[Cambridge University]] in 1999, "In [[David Tansley|Tansley]] as in [[Barbara Brennan|Brennan]] you will find descriptions of a hierarchy of subtle bodies called the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual that surround the physical body. (Tansley attributed the source of his model to Alice Bailey's theosophical commentary on The ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'', the ''locus classicus'' of Hindu teaching.)"&lt;ref&gt;Woolger, Roger J., [http://www.rogerwoolger.com/images/Beyond_the_Brain.pdf ''The Presence of Other Worlds In Psychotherapy and Healing''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927051334/http://www.rogerwoolger.com/images/Beyond_the_Brain.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} from a paper delivered at the Beyond the Brain Conference held at St. John's College, Cambridge University, England, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey's influence can be found in therapeutic communities with which she was never directly involved, such as the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref name=Keller763 /&gt;  She was also cited in ''THERAPEUTIC TOUCH: Healing Science or Psychic Midwife?'' by Sharon Fish.[http://www.equip.org/PDF/DN105.pdf]

=== Influence on UFO groups ===

Alice Bailey makes no reference to [[unidentified flying object]]s [https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/welcome_obooks_website]   This is not surprising since Alice Bailey's books were written between 1919 and 1949 [https://www.lucistrust.org/books/alice_bailey_books] and "The emergence of religion specifically focused on UFOs is a post-1947 phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = UFO Religions|last = Partridge|first = Christopher|publisher = Routledge|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;    But she did speak of Masters as having evolved beyond the human level, and expounded a cosmology of a living universe in which even planets and stars are regarded as living entities. These ideas may partially account for an association in minds of some between Bailey, and others of the Theosophical schools, and UFOs.  For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as "easily transferred"  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/nr.2004.8.2.110?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]  The connection does exist in the sense that there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.[http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial4.html]

Christopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the "[[UFO religion]]s".&lt;ref name="Partridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Christopher H. |title=UFO Religions |publisher=Routledge |year=2003}} Pages 8&amp;nbsp;– 9&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that "... Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey.".&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher H. ''The Re-enchantment of the West'' p. 175 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mPKeVWeLq1UC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=alice+bailey+hierarchy+of+masters+from+venus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Q9dC4ssjeA&amp;sig=PT4d0yuNm8REHtzO9kvtsKDTDEo]
Retrieved October 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Partridge also quoted Gordon Melton, who suggested that the first UFO religion was [[Guy Ballard]]'s [["I Am" Activity]],&lt;ref name="Partridge 2003" /&gt; (which Bailey described as a "cheap comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Alice A. |title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1957}} Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Professor Robert S. Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a [[contactee]] named [[Daniel Fry]]. He reported that, "There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |title=Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1973|isbn=0-13-773317-8}} Pages 143&amp;nbsp;– 145: "Understanding, Inc." and "Reading Selection: Understanding, Inc."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] of the [[University of Wolverhampton]], cited Bailey's influence on the ideas of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] and related UFO organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_chryssides.htm Chryssides, George D. An untitled paper] presented at the [[CESNUR]] Conference held in Palermo, Sicily, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

[[Lou Reed]] of [[the Velvet Underground]] was a devoted reader of Bailey's work, especially her book ''A Treatise on White Magic'', which he urged on others. Author Ryan H. Walsh suggests that book had an influence on the Velvet's second album, ''[[White Light/White Heat]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968'' (NY: Penguin Press, 2018), 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called "Initiation" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]], taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"; the three parts of the song are listed as: "I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire." The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] titled "[[Another Live]]".  This album contained a song titled "The Seven Rays" (see reference above). Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled "Love in Action" from the Utopia album [[Oops! Wrong Planet]]. Love in Action was the concept promoted by Bailey's and Foster Bailey's "World Goodwill" organization.

In 1982, Bailey's influence appeared in [[popular culture|pop culture]], with the release of [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Beautiful Vision]]'', in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs "[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]" and "Aryan Mist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music for Inner Space|last=Drury|first=Nevill|year=1985|publisher=Prism Press|page=60|isbn=0-9589759-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison also used the phrase "world of glamour", reminiscent of Bailey's ''Glamour: A World Problem'', in the songs "[[Ivory Tower (Van Morrison song)|Ivory Tower]]" and "Green Mansions". The song [[Ancient of Days (song)|Ancient of Days]] from the 1984 [[Sense of Wonder]] album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as ''[[The Externalization of the Hierarchy]]''. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's ''Glamour: A World Problem'' is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]''.

The Wikipedia article on [[José López Rega]], Argentina's Minister of Social Welfare during the Peronist government, cites his interest in esoteric studies.  Apparently, these included the writings of Alice Bailey:  "Also found in his home were 12 volumes by Alice Bailey on telepathy and Cosmic Fire ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Alyson Kennedy''' (born June 11, 1950) is an American activist, a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and the party's nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]. She was the party's candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].

==Biography==
Originally from [[Indianapolis]], Kennedy joined the socialist movement in 1973 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. She has worked in [[coal mine]]s in Alabama, Colorado, Utah, and West Virginia. In 1977 she ran as the SWP candidate for mayor of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] against incumbent Republican [[Ralph Perk]], garnering 1,225 votes and losing by a wide margin to [[Dennis Kucinich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cleveland Election Upsets Perk |author= |newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |volume=53 |issue=238 |date=October 5, 1977 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k3geAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DsoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5431,1583631 |accessdate=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She first joined the [[United Mine Workers of America]] (UMWA) in 1981, and was one of the leaders of a strike in [[Utah]] 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Miners plan to return to their jobs |first=Tiffany|last=Erickson |newspaper=Deseret News |volume= |issue= |date=July 3, 2004 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,595075034,00.html |accessdate=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also being involved in litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9184049249608861504&amp;q=%22alyson+kennedy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002 |title=INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF UNITED WORKERS UNION v.

'''Anastasios Polyzoidis''' ({{lang-el|Αναστάσιος Πολυζωίδης}}, 1802&amp;ndash;1873) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] politician and judicial official.

He was born in [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]], [[Ottoman empire]] (nowadays in [[Bulgaria]]), where he graduated local [[Greece|Greek]] school. From 1818 he was studying law, history and social studies in [[Vienna]], [[Göttingen]] and Berlin. At the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]], he interrupted his studies and returned to [[Greece]]. After a series of adventures he reached [[Trieste]], and from there he passed to [[Missolonghi]] along with some [[philhellenes]].

In [[Missolonghi]] he cooperated with [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] and was set in several gubernatorial positions (secretary of executive) in the Provisional Administration of Greece. He took part in the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus|First Greek National Assembly]] at [[Epidaurus]]. There, almost on his own, he wrote the new state's [[Greek Constitution of 1822|constitution]] and the declaration of 15 January 1822, which informed the European powers, allied in the [[Holy Alliance]], that the revolution was national and not social. In 1823 he was in charge of the committee, which was sent to London for the negotiation of a public loan. In 1827, he was elected representative to the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen|National Convention]] at [[Troezen]]. In October of the same year, he went to Paris, in order to continue his studies.

Returning from Paris, Polyzoidis found himself pitted against the autocratic government of Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], and soon passed into the opposition, editing the newspaper ''Apollon'', printed at [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]]. In 1832 he was nominated by the Bavarian regency to be president of a five-member court of [[Nafplio]], which had to judge [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]] and other former leaders of the War of Independence on trumped-up charges of treason. Polyzoidis, together with fellow judge [[Georgios Tertsetis]], knowing very well the innocence of the defendants, refused to countersign the decision of condemnation. The Minister of Justice, K. Schinas, personally intervened to force Polyzoidis to append his signature to the document "in the name of the King", to which Polysoidis replied: "I prefer my hand to be cut off rather than sign." His stance caused his imprisonment and violent maltreatment. This refusal to accept royal intervention in the administration of justice was indicative of the Polyzoidis' integrity, and his portrait, together with that of Tertsetis, now hangs in the ''[[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areios Pagos]]'', the Supreme Court of Greece.

After the coming of age of king [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], he was rehabilitated and nominated as vice-president of the ''[[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areios Pagos]]'' and counselor of state. In 1837, he was named minister of education and of internal affairs. In the former capacity, he was instrumental in the establishment of Greece's [[University of Athens|first university]] in Athens, while from his latter post he fought against censorship. Following the overthrow of Otto in 1862, he was appointed prefect of the joint [[Attica and Boeotia Prefecture]]. He died in [[Athens]] in 1873.

The events of the trial of Kolokotronis and the consecutive trial of Polyzoidis and Terchetis have been portrayed in the 1974 Greek Film "Η δίκη των Δικαστών" (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255936/).

By Lizelle Reymond. (Translated from the French original ''La Vie dans la vie'' by Nancy Pearson and Stanley Spiegelberg.) Morning Light Press, 2007. {{ISBN|1-59675-016-2}}.

==Early life and sannyas==

Sri Anirvan was born on 8 July 1896 in the town of [[Mymensingh]], then a part of [[British Raj|British India]] and now in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; His birth name was Narendrachandra Dhar. He was the son of Rajchandra Dhar, a doctor, and Sushila Devi.&lt;ref name="Antaryoga"&gt;''Antaryoga'' ({{lang-bn| অন্তর্যোগ}}). Kolkata: Sri Goutam Dharmapal, Haimavati Prakashani, 1997 (Bengali year 1404), 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a spiritually and intellectually inclined child, who by age 11 had memorised the ''Astadhyayi'' of [[Pāṇini]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; He was named '''Baroda Brahmachari''' after going through the [[sacred thread]] ceremony. He also won a state scholarship as a teen and completed university IA and BA degrees at the [[University of Dhaka]] and an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[Sanskrit College]] of the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;

At 16, he joined the [[Shanti Ashram|Assam Bangiya Saraswata Math]] (the ''[[ashram]]''), located in the village of Kokilamukh near [[Jorhat]] in Assam.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; He was a disciple of the ashram's founder, [[Swami Nigamananda|Paramahansa Srimat Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev]], who initiated him into [[Sannyasa|sannyas]]. Anirvan's new monastic name was '''Nirvanananda Saraswati'''.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; He taught at the ashram school and edited its monthly magazine ''Aryyadarpan''. In fact, the Aryadarpan still retains the following Sanskrit epigram, in the Rathoddhata metre, that Sri Anirvan (then Srimat Varada Brahmacari) wrote: arya-sastra-gahanartha-dipakascetas-timiravaravarakah/ dyotayan vijayatam vipascitam arcisa hrdayam aryadarpanah//

==Scholar and writer==

Some time after 1930, Nirvanananda changed his name to '''Anirvan''' and ceased to wear the ochre [[swami]]'s robes.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; He travelled widely in North India,&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; eventually returning to Assam and establishing an ashram in [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamakhya]] near [[Guwahati]].&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; However, he continued to travel. In the 1940s, he lived in [[Lohaghat]] and [[Almora]]. Madame Lizelle Reymond documented some of this period in ''My Life with a Brahmin Family'' (1958) and ''To Live Within'' (1971).&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reymond"/&gt; During this time, Sri Anirvan translated [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s [[Collected Works of Sri Aurobindo|''The Life Divine'']] into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (as ''Divya Jeevan Prasanga''); this book, his first, was published in two volumes between 1948 and 1951.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;

In 1953, Sri Anirvan moved to [[Shillong]] in Assam.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; His reputation as a [[Vedas|Vedic]] scholar grew;&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reymond"/&gt; and he wrote both in Bengali (chiefly) and in English (he was also fluent in French) on various aspects of [[Hindu philosophy]] (particularly [[Samkhya]], the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]] and [[Vedanta]]) and the parallels between [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]], [[Puranas|Puranic]], [[Tantra|Tantric]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reymond"/&gt; His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Veda Mimamsa'', was published in three volumes in 1961, 1965 and 1970.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; This work won him the [[Rabindra Puraskar|Rabindra award]].

Though Sri Anirvan was a saint, he studied subjects such as [[Marxism]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} and gardening; yet he called himself a simple [[baul]] {{Citation needed | reason=citation known to exist, but not in English | date=November 2017}}.

Sri Anirvan made his final move, to [[Kolkata]], in 1965.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt; He died on 31 May 1978, after a six-year illness.&lt;ref name="Buddhiyoga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reymond"/&gt;

'''Ann Van Elsen''' (born 27 December 1979 in [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]]) is a Belgian model as well as TV and radio personality from [[Mol, Belgium|Mol]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]] in [[Belgium]]. She was crowned ''[[Miss Belgium]]'' in 2002.

== Biography ==
After finishing her Marketing studies, Van Elsen obtained her master's degree in Business Economics in 2006. She spread her studies over several years to accommodate her professional career.

==Beauty pageants and modelling==
Van Elsen first appeared on the cover of a magazine when that magazine had chosen a photograph of a reader to appear on the cover. This inspired her to enter beauty pageants like ''Miss Antwerp'', ''[[Miss Belgium]]'' and ''[[Miss Universe]]''.

In 2002 Van Elsen won both the ''Miss Antwerp'' and ''Miss Belgium'' pageants. This enabled her entrance to the ''[[Miss World]]'' and ''Miss Universe'' competitions.

Van Elsen is one of the candidates who refused to participate in the ''[[Miss World#The 2002 Nigeria contest|Miss World]]'' competition held in [[Nigeria]] in 2002, to protest the conviction of [[Amina Lawal]].

Van Elsen appeared in the January 2008 edition of Playboy. She accepted the deal on account that Playboy would donate part of the photo-shoot payment to ''Music For Life'', a goodwill annual charity of radio station [[Studio Brussel]].

== Media career ==

===Television===
On television, Van Elsen has presented several programs on Belgian channels [[één|TV1]] and [[VT4]], including ''Mediamadammen'' (since October 2002), ''Huizenjacht'', ''Onder Hoogspanning'', ''De Brandkast'' (2005), ''[[Supertalent in Vlaanderen]]'' (2007) and ''Summerdate''. In June 2005 Van Elsen signed an exclusive television contract with VT4, where she performed the tasks of an in-vision [[continuity announcer]] (since 2003) and hosted several other TV shows as well.

In 2006, Van Elsen presented the first prize to the winner of the "Pinanti is Pinanti" [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taking competition in the TV1 sports program ''Studio 1 op zondag'', [[Football (soccer)|football]] player [[Désiré Mbonabucya]]. During the ceremony in the [[King Baudouin Stadium|Koning Boudewijnstadion]], she was shown to have some footballing skills as well.

For two years Van Elsen regularly appeared on the TV1 music show ''Het Swingpaleis'', on which she was the team captain.

In 2013 she presents the TV-show Singl3s on Vijf.

===Radio===
In January 2008 Van Elsen went to work for [[Radio Donna]] for the ''Sunday Match'' program. She presented between 20.00h and 23.00h. After the reestablishment of Donna as [[MNM (radio)|MNM]] (5 January 2009) she presented together with Dave Peters ''The Ann &amp; Dave Show''. In early 2012 she also presented the Monday early morning program ''MNM Request''. Since 2010 she continues to (co)host various programs on MNM, including a summer period mid-morning to noon program.

==Personal life==
Ann Van Elsen was married to Belgian soccer player [[Gunter Van Handenhoven]], who is the brother of singer Sandrine Van Handenhoven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 22 June 1942, the Albanian student trio of '''Branko Kadija''', '''Jordan Misja''' and '''Perlat Rexhepi''', who stayed in Misja's house at Firaj Street in [[Shkodër]] (at the time part of the [[Military history of Italy during World War II|fascist Italian protectorate]] of the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–1943)|Albanian Kingdom]]), were for several hours surrounded by Albanian (fascist) forces and police, numbering some 600 people. The three young friends were members of the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Communist Party of Albania]], which was established on 8 November 1941 and had begun with smaller detachments of 5-10 people which engaged in various acts of sabotage to the Italian forces, including antifascist propaganda in order to gain support of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Albania at war, 1939-1945 [[Bernd Jürgen Fischer]] Edition illustrated Publisher C.

Jordan Misja, a nephew of the hero bearing the same name, has rejected the latter claim and said that an ancestor had come from the suburbs of [[Elbasan]], and the surname Misja has not changed its form while being spread throughout the Elbasan region. Perlat Rexhepi was an ethnic Albanian, originally from [[Vlorë]].

==Legacy==

The "Perlat Rexhepi" partisan battalion from Shkodër operated in the [[Gjakovë]] highlands in 1943, and assisted the conference of Albanian and Yugoslav communists in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=P3knunC7z_oC&amp;pg=PA315 p. 315]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several schools, streets and other buildings have been named after the three individuals.

'''Jame Gumb''' (known by the nickname '''Buffalo Bill''') is a character and the primary [[antagonist]] of [[Thomas Harris]]'s 1988 [[novel]] ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' and its 1991 [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|film adaptation]], in which he is played by [[Ted Levine]]. In the film and the novel, he is a [[serial killer]] who murders overweight women and skins them so he can make a "woman suit" for himself.

==Overview==
===Background===
According to the novel, Gumb was born in California on October 25, 1949, and abandoned by his mother – an alcoholic aspiring actress who misspelled "James" on his birth certificate – and taken into [[foster care]] at age two. The screenplay omits Gumb's backstory, but does imply that he had a traumatic childhood. Lecter summarizes Gumb's life thus: "Billy was not born a criminal, but made one by years of systematic abuse."

The novel goes on to tell of Gumb living in foster homes until the age of 10 before being adopted by his grandparents, who became his first victims. The story then puts him in Tulare Vocational Rehabilitation, a [[psychiatric hospital]] where he learns to be a tailor. Later, Gumb has a relationship with Benjamin Raspail. After Raspail leaves him, he kills Raspail's new lover, Klaus, and [[flaying|flays]] him.&lt;ref name="silence"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harris | first=Thomas | year=1991 | title=The Silence Of The Lambs | publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks | pages= | isbn=0-312-92458-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the novel and film depict Gumb as a tortured and self-hating individual. Believing himself to be [[transgender]], he wants to become a woman but is too psychologically disturbed to qualify for [[gender reassignment surgery]]. He kills women so he can skin them and create a "woman suit" for himself.

===Modus operandi===
Gumb's [[modus operandi]] is to approach a woman, pretending to be injured and asking for help, then knock her out in a surprise attack and kidnap her. He takes her to his house and leaves her in a well in his basement, where he starves her until her skin is loose enough to easily remove. In the first two cases, he leads the victims upstairs, slips nooses around their necks and pushes them from the stairs, strangling them. He then skins parts of their body (a different section on each victim), and then dumps each body into a different river, destroying any trace of evidence. This MO caused the homicide squad to nickname him Buffalo Bill ([[Buffalo Bill#Buffalo Bill's Wild West|Buffalo Bill's Wild West]] show typically claimed that [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] had [[scalping|scalped]] a [[Cheyenne]] warrior). One officer quipped it was because he "skins his humps." In the case of Gumb's first victim, Fredrica Bimmel, he weighed down her body, so she ends up being the third victim found. In the case of the fourth victim, he shoots her instead of strangling her, then inserts a [[moth]] into her throat and dumps the body.&lt;ref name="silence"/&gt;

At the start of the novel, Gumb has already murdered five women. [[Behavioral Science Unit]] Chief [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] assigns gifted trainee [[Clarice Starling]] to question incarcerated serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]] about the case. (Lecter had met Gumb while treating Raspail.) When Gumb kidnaps Catherine Martin, the daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin, Lecter offers to give Starling a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the killer in return for a transfer to a federal institution; this profile is mostly made up of cryptic clues designed to help Starling figure it out for herself, although Lecter does directly inform Clarice about Gumb wanting to have a sex change operation. This is highlighted in one of the most famous scenes from the movie where Gumb dances to the song "[[Goodbye Horses]]" by [[Q Lazzarus]], putting on makeup and other women's accessories to complete his "transformation" into a woman.  Starling eventually deduces from Lecter's riddles that Gumb knew his first victim, Frederica Bimmel, and goes to Bimmel's hometown of [[Belvedere, Ohio]] to gather information. By this time, Crawford has already found out the killer's true identity and gone with a [[SWAT]] team to his house to arrest him, but they find that it is only a business address. Meanwhile, Starling goes to the home of Bimmel's employer, Mrs. Lippman, only to find Gumb &amp;mdash; calling himself "Jack Gordon" &amp;mdash; living there. (Gumb had murdered Mrs. Lippman earlier.) When Starling sees a moth flutter by, she realizes she has found her man and orders him to surrender. Gumb flees into the basement and stalks her with a revolver and night vision goggles. Just as he is about to shoot Starling, she hears him behind her, turns around and opens fire, killing him.

==Influences==
Harris based various elements of Gumb's MO on six real-life serial killers:&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, Anthony.  [http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/lecter/2.html "Buffalo Bill" page 2 - ''"All About Hannibal Lecter - Facts and Fiction"''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011121704/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/lecter/2.html |date=October 11, 2008 }} @ Crime Library.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;Bowman, David (July 8, 1999).[http://www.salon.com/1999/07/08/profiler/ "Profiler"]. [[Salon (website)|Salon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Jerry Brudos]], who dressed up in his victims' clothing and kept their shoes.
* [[Ed Gein|Edward Gein]], who fashioned trophies and keepsakes from the bones and skin of corpses he dug up at cemeteries. He also made a female skin suit and skin masks.
* [[Ted Bundy]], who pretended to be injured (using an arm-brace or crutches) as a ploy to ask his victims for help. When they helped him, he incapacitated and killed them, dumping their bodies far away.
* [[Gary M. Heidnik]], who kidnapped and tortured six women and held them prisoner as [[sex slave]]s.
* [[Edmund Kemper]], who, like Gumb, killed his grandparents as a teenager "just to see what it felt like."
* [[Gary Ridgway]], the Green River Killer (still unidentified at the time of the novel's writing), who, like Gumb, dumped women's bodies in rivers and inserted foreign objects into their corpses.

==Analysis==
Marjorie Garber, author of ''Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety'', asserts that despite the book and the film indicating that Buffalo Bill merely ''believes'' himself to be [[transsexualism|transsexual]], they still imply negative connotations about transsexualism. Garber says, "Harris's book manifests its cultural anxiety through a kind of baroque bravado of plot," and calls the book "a fable of [[gender dysphoria]] gone spectacularly awry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Garber | first=Marjorie | year=1997 | title=Vested Interests: Cross-dressing and Cultural Anxiety | publisher=Routledge | page=116 | isbn=978-0-415-91951-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Creed, writing in ''Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema'', says that Buffalo Bill wants to become a woman "presumably because he sees femininity as a more desirable state, possibly a superior one". For Buffalo Bill, the woman is "[a] [[totem]] animal". Not only does he want to wear women's skin, he wants to become a woman; he dresses in women's clothes and tucks his penis behind his legs to appear female. Creed writes, "To experience a rebirth as woman, Buffalo Bill must wear the skin of woman not just to experience a physical transformation but also to acquire the ''power of transformation'' associated with woman's ability to give birth." Buffalo Bill wears the skin of his totem animal to assume its power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Creed | first=Barbara | year=1993 | chapter=Dark Desires: Male masochism in the horror film | editor1-last=Cohan | editor1-first=Steven | editor2-last=Hark | editor2-first=Ina Rae | title=Screening the Male: Exploring Masculinities in the Hollywood Cinema | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_Ijvzk6dR0C&amp;dq=Dark+Desires%3A+Male+masochism&amp;q=buffalo+bill#v=snippet&amp;q=buffalo%20bill&amp;f=false | publisher=Routledge | pages=126–127 | isbn=978-0-415-07759-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Halberstam, author of ''Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters'', writes, "The cause for Buffalo Bill's extreme violence against women lies not in his gender confusion or his sexual orientation but in his [[humanism|humanist]] presumption that his sex and his gender and his orientation must all match-up to a mythic [[norm (social)|norm]] of white [[heterosexual]] masculinity." Halberstam says Buffalo Bill symbolizes a lack of ease with one's skin. She writes that the character is also a combination of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster]] in how he is the creator gathering body parts and experimenting with his own body. Halberstam writes, "He does not understand gender as inherent, innate; he reads it only as a surface effect, a representation, an external attribute engineered into identity." Buffalo Bill challenges "the interiority of gender" by taking skin and remaking it into a costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Halberstam | first=Judith | year=1995 | chapter=Skinflick: Posthuman Gender in Jonathan Demme's ''The Silence of the Lambs'' | title=Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters | publisher=Duke University Press Books | pages= | isbn=978-0-8223-1663-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The film adaptation of ''Silence of the Lambs'' was criticized by some [[gay rights]] groups for its portrayal of Gumb as [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/Silence-Lambs.html Common Sense Media review of ''The Silence of the Lambs''] Common Sense Media. July 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] sex-reassignment surgeon, present in the book but not the film (his scene was deleted and is found in bonus materials on the [[DVD]]), protests exactly the same thing. FBI Director [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] pacifies him by repeating that Gumb is not in fact transsexual, but merely believes himself to be. In the film, a similar scene is shown with Starling and Lecter in the same roles as the surgeon and Crawford, respectively. In the director's commentary for the 1991 film, director [[Jonathan Demme]] draws attention to various [[Instant film|Polaroids]] taken of Buffalo Bill in the company of strippers; these are visible in Gumb's basement in the film.

'''Charles Proteus Steinmetz''' (born '''Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz''', April 9, 1865&amp;nbsp;– October 26, 1923) was a German-born American [[mathematician]] and [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and professor at [[Union College]]. He fostered the development of [[alternating current]] that made possible the expansion of the [[electric power industry]] in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of [[hysteresis]] that enabled engineers to design better [[electrical machine|electromagnetic apparatus equipment]] including especially [[induction motor|electric motor]]s for use in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=139|website=Invent Now, Inc.

==Early life==
[[File:Steinmetz Cabin.jpg|thumb|Steinmetz maintained a small cabin overlooking the [[Mohawk River]] near [[Schenectady, New York]].]]
Steinmetz was born '''Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz''' on April 9, 1865 in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Province of Silesia]], [[Prussia]] (now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz.&lt;ref name="Clemens (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clemens|first=Nora|title=Discovering the Nature of Energy|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group.|url=https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Nature-Energy-Scientists-Physics/dp/1448847028|location=New York|isbn=978-1448847020|page=78|edition=1st|author2=Greenberger, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized a [[Lutheran]] into the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia]].&lt;ref name="Garlin1977"&gt;{{harvnb|Garlin|1977|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=70I5ZKOYW_QC&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=Charles+Steinmetz+lutheran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9kNlVfXmMMfbsAThg4PADQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBw|title=Credo: Unitarians and Universalists of Yesteryear Talk about Their Lives and Motivations|date=25 September 2018|publisher=Eric Cherry|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmetz, who only stood four feet tall as an adult,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; suffered from [[dwarfism]], [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], and [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].

Following the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a [[Socialism|socialist]] university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.

==Socialism and technocracy==
As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to [[Zürich]] in 1888 to escape possible arrest.  Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to "Charles" in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name "[[Proteus]]", a wise hunchbacked character from the ''[[Odyssey]]'' who knew many secrets, after a childhood epithet given by classmates Steinmetz felt suited him.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the Wizard of Schenectady|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/charles-proteus-steinmetz-the-wizard-of-schenectady-51912022/#ixzz2lRMjrfit|website=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2017-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornell University]] Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of ''Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist'',&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Klein, Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist (Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology), 1992, {{ISBN|978-0801842986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as being in arrears with his tuition at the University and life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters being tension filled.

Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a "powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office", and because "only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today".&lt;ref name="UC Mag (1998)"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Charles Steinmetz: Union's Electrical Wizard|magazine=Union College Magazine|date=November 1, 1998|url=http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805190419/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the original [[Technical Alliance]], which also included [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Leland Olds]], Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: "Some day we make the good things of life for everybody".

==Engineering wizard==
[[File:Charles Proteus Steinmetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Steinmetz circa 1915]]
Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] systems theory: [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]], [[steady state (electronics)|steady-state]] analysis, and [[transient (oscillation)|transients]].&lt;ref name="Note-1"&gt;See also [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary|Electropedia]]'s: [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=351-45-16 hysteresis], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=603-02-06 steady state of a system], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=102-02-09 complex number] and [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=351-45-08 transient behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC hysteresis theory===
Shortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in [[Yonkers, New York]], and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, which gave him worldwide professional recognition.&lt;ref name="IEEEPER (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Magnetic Force of Charles Proteus Steinmetz |journal=IEEE Power Engineering Review |date=Feb 1996 |volume=16 |issue=9 |page=7 |doi=10.1109/MPER.1996.535476 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=535476&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;queryText%3DCharles+Proteus+Steinmetz+history |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213406/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=535476&amp;contentType=Journals+&amp;+Magazines&amp;queryText=Charles+Proteus+Steinmetz+history |archivedate=25 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eickemeyer's firm developed [[transformer]]s for use in the [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical power]] among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed [[General Electric]] Company, where he quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.&lt;ref name="IEEEPER (1996)"/&gt;

===AC steady state circuit theory===
Steinmetz's work revolutionized [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|circuit theory and analysis]], which had been carried out using complicated, time-consuming [[calculus]]-based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, "Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering", presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)]], Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to "a simple problem of algebra". He systematized the use of [[complex number]] [[phasor]] representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the [[lower-case letter]] "j" is used to designate the 90-degree [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] operator in AC system analysis.&lt;ref name="Alger1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedell (1942)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=865|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal books and many other AIEE papers "taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena".&lt;ref name="Alger1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZSE (nodate)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steinmetz, Putting it in Perspective - R, L, and C Elements and the Impedance Concept|url=http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|publisher=Zabreb School of Engineering|accessdate=21 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105044817/http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|archivedate=5 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC transient theory===
Steinmetz also greatly advanced the understanding of [[lightning]].  His systematic experiments resulted in the first laboratory created "man-made lightning", earning him the nickname the "Forger of [[Thunderbolt]]s".&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;  These were conducted in a football field-sized laboratory at General Electric, using 120,000 [[voltage|volt]] generators. He also erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning in order to study its patterns and effects, which resulted in several theories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Professional life==
Steinmetz acted in the following professional capacities:
* At Union College, as chair of electrical engineering from 1902 to 1913&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"&gt;lemelson.mit.edu website, [http://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-steinmetz "Charles Steinmetz"]&lt;/ref&gt; and as faculty member thereafter until his death in 1923&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"/&gt;
* As a board member on the [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady Board of Education]] for six years, including four years at the board's president&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"/&gt;
* As a president of the [[Schenectady, New York|Common Council of Schenectady]]&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"/&gt; 
* As the [http://ethw.org/List_of_Presidents_of_the_American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers_(AIEE) president] of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] from 1901 to 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz |title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz |author= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* As the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME) {which became the [[International Municipal Signal Association|International Municipal Signal Association (IMSA)]]} from 1913 until his death in 1923.

He was granted an honorary degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1901&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"/&gt; and a doctorate from Union College in 1903.&lt;ref name="lemelson-mit"/&gt;

Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not exclusively about engineering.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} He was a member and adviser to the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] at [[Union College]], whose chapter house there was one of the first ever electrified residences.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

While serving as president of the Schenectady Board of Education Steinmetz introduced numerous progressive reforms, including extended school hours, school meals, [[school nurse]]s, special classes for the children of immigrants, and the distribution of free textbooks.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In spite of his love for children and family life, Steinmetz remained unmarried to prevent the spinal deformity afflicting himself, his father, and grandfather from being passed on to any offspring.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

When Joseph LeRoy Hayden, a loyal and hardworking lab assistant, announced that he would marry and look for his own living quarters, Steinmetz made the unusual proposal of opening his large home, complete with research lab, [[greenhouse]], and office to the  Haydens and their prospective family. Hayden favored the idea, but his future wife was very wary of the unorthodox setup. She finally agreed after Steinmetz's assurance she could run the house as she saw fit.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

After an uneasy start, the arrangement worked well for all parties, especially after three Hayden children were born. Steinmetz legally adopted Joseph Hayden as his son, becoming grandfather to the youngsters, entertaining them with fantastic stories and spectacular scientific demonstrations. The unusual but harmonious living arrangements lasted for the rest of Steinmetz's life.&lt;ref name="King" /&gt;

Steinmetz founded America's first glider club, but none of its prototypes "could be dignified with the term 'flight'".&lt;ref name="Crouch2002"&gt;Crouch, Tom D. (February 7, 2002).

Steinmetz was a lifelong [[agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref name="Hammond1924"&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1924|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Quoting from Hammond, "This has placed him before the public as an atheist.* The title he did not deny.

on October 26, 1923, and was buried in [[Vale Cemetery and Vale Park|Vale Cemetery]] in [[Schenectady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2766|Charles Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz's connection to Union is further celebrated with the annual Steinmetz Symposium,&lt;ref name="UC SteinmetzSym"&gt;{{cite web |title=Steinmetz Symposium: Celebrating 25 years of student research  |url=http://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/05/steinmetz-symposium-celebrating-25-years-of-student-research.php |publisher=Union College |date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a day-long event in which Union undergraduates give presentations on research they have done. Steinmetz Hall, which houses the Union College computer center, is named after him.

Steinmetz was portrayed in 1959 by the actor [[Rod Steiger]] in the [[CBS television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[The Joseph Cotten Show]]''. The episode focused on his socialist activities in Germany.

A Chicago public high school, [[Steinmetz College Prep]], is named for him.

A public park in north Schenectady, New York was named for him in 1931.&lt;ref name="Steinmetz Park Association (2006)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinmetz Park Association (2006) |title=Steinmetz Park Master Plan |url=http://www.cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf |accessdate=January 22, 2013 |location=Schenectady, N.Y. |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120181618/http://cityofschenectady.com/pdf/development/Steinmetz_Park_Masterplan_2006_Final_Web.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Steinmetz is featured in [[John Dos Passos|John Dos Passos's]] ''[[U.S.A. (trilogy)|U.S.A.]]'' trilogy in one of the biographies.&lt;ref&gt;The 42nd Parallel, p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also serves as a major character in Starling Lawrence's ''The Lightning Keeper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/13/books/13star.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Starling Lawrence Writes a Novel About the Early Days of G.E | first=Dinitia | last=Smith | date=May 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[John Ball (author)|John Ball]] grew up in Steinmetz's house. His parents were graduate students paid by General Electric to live with and take care of the man Ball called "Uncle Steinie". Ball used to tell his Steinmetz stories at the Southern California Mystery Writers Association meetings.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Clifford Harper''' (born 13 July 1949 in [[Chiswick]], West London) is a worker, illustrator, and militant [[anarchist]].

== Biography ==
Clifford Harper is a worker, illustrator and militant anarchist. He was born in Chiswick, West London &amp;ndash; at that time within Middlesex &amp;ndash; on 13 July 1949.  His father was a postman and his mother a cook. Expelled from school at 13 and placed on two years probation at 14, he then worked in a series of "menial jobs" before "turning on, tuning in, and dropping out" in 1967.  After living in a [[commune]] in [[Cumberland]], he started a commune on [[Eel Pie Island]] in the River Thames near [[Richmond, Surrey]], in 1969. In 1971 he took part in the All London Squatters organization, [[squatting]] in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[North London]], then [[Stepney Green]], [[East (London sub region)|East London]], and [[Peckham]] in [[South East (London sub region)|South East London]], while being very active in anarchist circles. In 1978 he settled in [[Camberwell]] where he has lived ever since. He has suffered from poor health for most of his adult life. After contracting [[tuberculosis|TB]] in France in 1969 Harper was hospitalised for three months in 1971, leaving his lungs and heart badly damaged and leading to [[heart failure]] in 2002. In early 2006 he survived heart attacks, in 2008 was diagnosed as [[diabetes|diabetic]], further heart attacks followed. In 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent major surgery at Guy's Hospital in London, which was successful. 

[[File:Harpergarden1.jpg|thumb|One of the series of Harper's 1970s 'Visions' posters, originally drawn for ''Undercurrents'' magazine.]]
Beginning in the early 1970s he became a prolific illustrator for many anarchist, radical, alternative and mainstream publications, organisations, groups and individuals, including Freedom Press, Undercurrents, Respect for Animals, BIT Newsletter, Arts Lab Newsletter, Idiot International, !977 Firemans Strike, Libertarian Education, The Idler, Radical Community Medicine, Anarchy Magazine, Black Flag, Anarchy Comix, Common Ground, Industrial Worker, Abelour Distillery, Country Life, Graphical Paper and Media Union, The Times Saturday Review, Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival, New Scientist, Oxford University Press, Penguin Books, Times Educational Supplemnt, London Anarchist Bookfair, Public and Commercial Services Union, The Sunday Times Magazine, Catholic Worker, Soil Association, The Bodleian Library, New Statesman, Cienfeugos Anarchist Review, Headline Books, The Financial Times, Resurgence, Scotland on Sunday, Town and Country Planning Association, Movement Against a Monarchy, Nursing Times, John Hegarty, The Listener, Zero, McCallan Whisky, Solidarity, New Society, News From Neasden, House &amp; Garden, The Tablet, Radical Science Journal, Royal Mail, The Co-ops Fairs, Picador Books, Pluto Press, Working Press, Anarchismo, Insurrection, Our Generation, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Vogue, Radio Times,  National Union of Teachers, Faber &amp; Faber, Pimlico, Trades Union Congress, Transport and General Workers Union, Serpents Tale, Compendium Books, Poison Girls, Yale University Press, Verso, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, Elephant Editions, Intelligent Life, Landworker, Zounds, Honey, New Musical Express, Knockabout Comics, Trickett &amp; Webb, The Times, See Sharp Press, Countryside Commission, Industrial Common Ownership Movement, BBC Worldwide, Stop The War Coalition, Aganovich, The Folio Society, Unison, Unite The Union, Anarchist Studies, Country Standard, Strike, Fitzrovia News, Anarchist Black Cross and many others. In 1992 he won a [[W H Smith]] Illustration Award and in 2002 he was the winner of the Trade Union Press and PR Award for Best Illustration.

His early drawing style was typically exemplified by the [[utopian]] 'Visions' series of posters, for the ''Undercurrents'' 1974 anthology ''Radical Technology''. These were highly detailed and precise illustrations showing scenes of post-revolutionary [[self-sufficiency]], autonomy and alternative technology in urban and rural settings, becoming almost ''de rigueur'' on the kitchen wall of any self-respecting radical's commune, squat or [[bedsit]] during the 1970s. Of these posters Harper writes:{{quote|text=Funnily enough they were particularly popular in Spain following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] and the [[liberalisation]] that followed that happy, but long overdue, event. I think the reason for their success is that although they are utopian images they depict an existence that is immediately approachable—all it would take is the seizing of a few empty buildings and the knocking down of a few meaningless walls...}}

Heavily influenced by [[George Grosz]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Eric Gill]] and, most of all, the narrative [[woodcut]]s of [[Frans Masereel]], Harper's style evolved in the 1980s in a bolder, [[expressionist]] direction, with much of his later work resembling woodcut, although he mainly works in pen and ink, and watercolour.

In 1987 ''[[Anarchy, A Graphic Guide]]'', which Harper wrote and illustrated, was published by [[Camden Press]]:{{quote|text=Like all really good ideas, Anarchy is pretty simple when you get down to it - Human beings are at their very best when they are living free of authority, deciding things among themselves rather than being ordered about. That's what 'Anarchy' means - Without Government.}} This has become a definitive and popular introduction to the subject, combining a thorough and inclusive overview of anarchism with his distinctive illustration. England's principal radical illustrator, he had a strong association with Freedom Press from 1969 up to 2005 as well as many other anarchist groups, publications and individuals. Harper remains a "100% committed" and engaged anarchist activist, having been deeply involved with organising the UK's annual [[Anarchist Bookfair]], re-designing Freedom newspaper in 2005, producing books, pamphlets, posters, book covers, postcards and drawings for, and supporting, anarchists everywhere. His drawings have been used and reproduced by anarchists and others in nearly every country of the world. He has produced a book of anarchist postage stamps 'For after the Revolution' and created his own small publishing project [[Agraphia Press]]. He does a great deal of work for the Union movement in Britain and he began working for ''[[The Guardian]]'' in the early 1990s, his work appearing every week until he was sacked in 2014. His illustrations for ''The Guardian'''s ''[[Country Diary]]'' column were published as a book in 2003 by Agraphia Press. ''Graphic Anarchy'', an exhibition of his work, was held in 2003 at the Newsroom Gallery, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently writing and illustrating an entirely new version of his book Anarchy: A Graphic Guide. You can see some of the new drawings at www.facebook.com/AnarchyAGraphicGuide. Although in poor health, Harper continues to work as an illustrator. One of his drawings, 'Solidarity', was displayed on a giant screen in Cairo's Tahrir Square in 2011.

'''Coptic Americans''' are American citizens of [[Coptic people|Coptic]] descent or persons of Coptic descent residing in the [[United States of America]]. 
According to the American Coptic Association, there are approximately 450,000  Copts in the United States since many ethnic Copts listed themselves in the 2011 U.S. Census mistakenly as either Egyptians, Sudanese, Libyans or Americans and by this way reducing the ethnic Coptic population in the United States to not be even included within the 2011 U.S. Census. Estimates for the number of ethnic Copts in the US range from 700,000 to more than 1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDE1531F936A35751C1A965958260 NY Times][http://www.arabmediawatch.com/amw/CountryBackgrounds/Egypt/Copts/tabid/346/Default.aspx][http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=373326]{{cite web |url=http://sce.uhcl.edu/akladios/Magdy%20Akladios%20Website/Links%20For%20Church/Copticsflocktowelcome.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319010757/http://sce.uhcl.edu/akladios/Magdy%20Akladios%20Website/Links%20For%20Church/Copticsflocktowelcome.doc |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration history==
[[File:StMarkCopticOrthodoxChurchBellaireTX0.JPG|230px|right|thumb|St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church of Bellaire, Texas]]

The immigration of the [[Copt]]s to the [[United States]] started as early as the late 1940s. After 1952, the rate of Coptic immigration from [[Egypt]] to the United States increased. The first Coptic church in the United States is [[St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church (Jersey City, New Jersey)|St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church]], which was established in the late 1960s in [[Jersey City]].

There are many [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] churches and congregations in the United States. Estimated numbers of adherents, based on church membership, was between 350,000 and 420,000.&lt;ref name="CCU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticcu.com/WhyCCU.html|title=''Why CCU?''|accessdate=June 21, 2009|publisher=Coptic Credit Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the estimates of certain Coptic organizations, the number was between 700,000 and one million &lt;ref name="CCU"/&gt; [http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=373326] [https://web.archive.org/web/20090319010757/http://sce.uhcl.edu/akladios/Magdy%20Akladios%20Website/Links%20For%20Church/Copticsflocktowelcome.doc] [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDE1531F936A35751C1A965958260] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070220180014/http://www.copts.com/english/CoptsDiaspora.aspx] in the year 2002.

'''Daniel''' ({{Hebrew Name|דָּנִיאֵל|Daní’ēl|Dānî’ēl| meaning "God is my Judge", [[Greek language|Greek]]: Δανιήλ}}) is the hero of the biblical [[Book of Daniel]].{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=74}} A noble Jewish youth of Jerusalem, he is taken into captivity by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] of Babylon and serves the king and his successors with loyalty and ability until the time of the Persian conqueror [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]], all the while remaining true to the God of Israel.{{sfn|Redditt|2008|pp=181–82}} The consensus of modern scholars is that Daniel never existed, and the book is a cryptic allusion to the reign of the 2nd century BCE Greek king [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]].{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=74}}

Six cities claim the [[Tomb of Daniel]], the most famous being that in [[Susa]], in southern [[Iran]], at a site known as [[Tomb of Daniel|Shush-e Daniyal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4872-daniel-tomb-of "Daniel's tomb," ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; He is not a prophet in Judaism,{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=76}} but the rabbis reckoned him to be the most distinguished member of the Babylonian diaspora, unsurpassed in piety and good deeds, firm in his adherence to the Law despite being surrounded by enemies who sought his ruin, and in the first few centuries CE they wrote down the many legends that had grown up around his name.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=326}} The various branches of the Christian church do recognise him as a prophet, and although he is not mentioned in the Quran, Muslim sources describe him as a prophet (''nabi'').

==Background==
[[File:BLW Stained Glass - Scene from the Story of Daniel.jpg|thumb|right|220px| Stained glass depiction of Daniel interceding with Arioch, commander of the king's guard, who was ordered to execute the Babylonian wise men after they were unable to interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream.]]
Daniel's name means "God (El) is my judge".{{sfn|Redditt|2008|p=180}} While the best known Daniel is the hero of the Book of Daniel who interprets dreams and receives apocalyptic visions, the Bible also briefly mentions three other individuals of this name:
#The [[Book of Ezekiel]] (14:14, 14:20 and 28:3) refers to a legendary Daniel famed for wisdom and righteousness. In chapter 20, Ezekiel says of the sinful land of Israel that "even if these three, Noah, Daniel and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness." In chapter 28, Ezekiel taunts the king of Tyre, asking rhetorically, "art thou wiser than Daniel?"{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219}} The author of the Book of Daniel appears to have taken this legendary figure, renowned for his wisdom, to serve as his central human character.{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}}
#[[Ezra-Nehemiah|Ezra 8:2]] mentions a priest named Daniel who went from [[Babylon]] to Jerusalem with Ezra.{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219}} 
#Daniel is a son of David mentioned at [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 3:1.

Daniel (Dn'il, or [[Danel]]) is also the name of a figure in the Aqhat legend from [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=219}} (Ugarit was a Canaanite city destroyed around 1200 BCE – the tablet containing the story is dated c. 1360 BCE).{{sfn|Walton|1994|p=49}} This legendary Daniel is known for his righteousness and wisdom and a follower of the god [[El (deity)|El]] (hence his name), who made his will known through dreams and visions.{{sfn|Seow|2003|pp=3–4}} It is unlikely that Ezekiel knew the far older Canaanite legend, but it seems reasonable to suppose that some connection exists between the two.{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=220}} The authors of the tales in the first half of the Book of Daniel were likely also unaware of the Ugaritic Daniel and probably took the name of their hero from Ezekiel; the author of the visions in the second half in turn took his hero's name from the tales.{{sfn|Collins|1999|p=220}}

==Tales of Daniel==
{{main|Book of Daniel}}
[[File:Daniel refuse kingsfood.jpg|thumb|Daniel refusing to eat at the King's table, early 1900s Bible illustration]]

The Book of Daniel begins with an introduction telling how Daniel and his companions came to be in Babylon, followed by a set of tales set in the Babylonian and Persian courts, followed in turn by a set of visions in which Daniel sees the remote future of the world and of Israel.{{sfn|Wesselius|2002|p=294}} The tales in chapters 1–6 can be dated to the 3rd or early 2nd centuries BCE;{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=34–35}} it is generally accepted that these were expanded by the addition of the visions in chapters 8–12 between 167 and 164 BCE.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=29–30}}

In the third year of the reign of [[Jehoiakim]], Daniel and his friends [[Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah]] were among the young Jewish nobility carried off to [[Babylon]] following the capture of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar]], king of [[neo-Babylonian empire|Babylon]].{{sfn|Seow|2003|p=4}} The four are chosen for their intellect and beauty to be trained in the Babylonian court, and are given new names. Daniel is given the Babylonian name Belteshazzar ({{lang-akk|𒊩𒆪𒈗𒋀|Beltu-šar-uṣur}}, written as &lt;small&gt;NIN&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;.LUGAL.ŠEŠ&lt;/small&gt;), while his companions are given the Babylonian names [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]]. Daniel and his friends refuse the food and wine provided by the king of Babylon to avoid becoming defiled. They receive wisdom from God and surpass "all the magicians and enchanters of the kingdom." Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a giant statue made of four metals with feet of mingled iron and clay, smashed by a stone from heaven. Only Daniel is able to interpret it: the dream signifies four kingdoms, of which Babylon is the first, but God will destroy them and replace them with his own kingdom. Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree that shelters all the world and of a heavenly figure who decrees that the tree will be destroyed; again, only Daniel can interpret the dream, which concerns the sovereignty of God over the kings of the earth. When Nebuchadnezzar's son King Belshazzar uses the vessels from the Jewish temple for his feast, a hand appears and writes a mysterious message on the wall, which only Daniel can interpret; it tells the king that his kingdom will be given to the [[Medes]] and Persians, because Belshazzar, unlike Nebuchadnezzar, has not acknowledged the sovereignty of the God of Daniel. The Medes and Persians overthrow Nebuchadnezzar and the new king, [[Darius the Mede]], appoints Daniel to high authority. Jealous rivals attempt to destroy Daniel with an accusation that he worships God instead of the king, and Daniel is thrown into a den of lions, but an angel saves him, his accusers are destroyed, and Daniel is restored to his position.

In the third year of Darius, Daniel has a series of visions. In the first, four beasts come out of the sea, the last with ten horns, and an eleventh horn grows and achieves dominion over the Earth and the "Ancient of Days" (God) gives dominion to "one like a son of man". An angel interprets the vision. In the second, a ram with two horns is attacked by a goat with one horn; the one horn breaks and is replaced by four. A little horn arises and attacks the people of God and the temple, and Daniel is informed how long the little horn's dominion will endure. In the third, Daniel is troubled to read in holy scripture (the book is not named but appears to be [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]) that Jerusalem would be desolate for 70 years. Daniel repents on behalf of the Jews and requests that Jerusalem and its people be restored. An angel refers to a period of 70 ''sevens'' (or weeks) of years. In the final vision, Daniel sees a period of history culminating in a struggle between the "king of the north" and the "king of the south" in which God's people suffer terribly; an angel explains that in the end the righteous will be vindicated and God's kingdom will be established on Earth.

==Additional tales (Greek text)==
[[File:Guido Reni - Susanna and the Elders - WGA19296.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Susanna and the Elders, by [[Guido Reni]]]]

The Greek text of Daniel contains three additional tales, two of which feature Daniel (the third is an expansion of the tale of the fiery furnace). 
#[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] tells how Daniel saves the reputation of a young Jewish girl when two lecherous Jewish elders condemn her to death, supposedly for unchastity, but actually because she resisted their advances. Daniel's clever cross-examination unmasks their evil and leads to their deaths. The story is unique in that the villains are Jews instead of heathens; it may have been written as a polemic by the [[Pharisees]] against the [[Saducees]], who, according to their opponents, were abusing their control of the courts.{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=90}}
#[[Bel and the Dragon]] consists of two episodes. In the first Daniel exposes the deceptions of the heathen priests, who have been pretending that their idols eat and drink (in fact it is the priests who have been consuming the food set out for the false gods). In the second Daniel destroys a giant serpent that Cyrus believes to be a god; the Babylonians revolt, Cyrus imprisons Daniel without food, the prophet [[Habakkuk]] miraculously feeds him, and Cyrus repents.{{sfn|Spencer|2002|p=90}}

==Death and tomb of Daniel==
[[File:آرامگاه دانیال نبی.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Daniel at [[Susa]]]]
{{Main|Tomb of Daniel}}

The last mention of Daniel in the Book of Daniel is in the third year of Cyrus ({{Bibleref|Daniel|10:1|JPS}}). Rabbinic sources suppose that he was still alive during the reign of the Persian king [[Ahasuerus]] (better known as Artaxerxes – Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 15a, based on the [[Book of Esther]] 4, 5), when he was killed by [[Haman]], the wicked prime minister of Ahasuerus (Targum Sheini on Esther, 4, 11).

The 1st century Jewish writer [[Josephus]] reported that Daniel's body lay in a tower in [[Ecbatana]] in [[Parthia]], alongside the bodies of the kings of the Medes and Persians; later Jewish authorities said he was buried in [[Susa]], and that near his house were hidden the vessels from the [[Temple of Solomon]]. Muslim sources reported that the Muslims had discovered his body, or possibly only a box containing his nerves and veins, together with a book, a jar of fat, and a signet ring engraved with the image of a man being licked by two lions. The corpse was reburied, and those who buried it decapitated to prevent them revealing the spot.{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=75}}

Today six cities claim [[Daniel's Tomb]]: [[Babylon]], [[Kirkuk]] and [[Muqdadiyah]] in [[Iraq]], [[Susa]] and [[Malamir, Iran|Malamir]] in [[Iran]], and [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4872-daniel-tomb-of "Daniel's tomb", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous is that in Susa, (Shush, in southern [[Iran]]), at a site known as Shush-e Daniyal. According to Jewish tradition the rich and poor of the city quarreled over possession of the body, and the bier was therefore suspended from a chain over the centre of the river. A house of prayer open to all who believed in God was built nearby, and fishing was prohibited for a certain distance up and down the river; fish that swam in that section of the river had heads that glinted like gold, and ungodly persons who entered the sacred precinct would miraculously drown in the river.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=350}} To this day the tomb is a popular site of pilgrimage.

==Daniel in later tradition==
===Judaism===
{{Main|Daniel in rabbinic literature}}
[[File:Sir Peter Paul Rubens - Daniel in the Lions' Den - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|''Daniel in the Lions' Den'', c. 1615 by [[Pieter Paul Rubens]]]] 
Daniel is not a prophet in Judaism: prophecy is reckoned to have ended with [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]].{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=76}} In the [[Hebrew Bible]] his book is not included under the Prophets (the Hebrew Bible has three sections, Torah, Prophets and Writings), perhaps because its content does not match the prophetic books; but nevertheless the eight copies found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and the additional tales of the Greek text are a testament to Daniel's popularity in ancient times.{{sfn|Stone|2011|p=68}}

The Jewish rabbis of the first millennium CE reckoned Daniel to be the most distinguished member of the Babylonian diaspora, unsurpassed in piety and good deeds, firm in his adherence to the Law despite being surrounded by enemies who sought his ruin, and in the first few centuries CE they wrote down the legends that had grown up around his name. His captivity was foretold by the prophet [[Isaiah]] to King [[Hezekiah]] in these words, "they (Hezekiah's descendants) shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon." This misfortune was turned to a blessing when Daniel and his three companions were able to show their mutilated bodies to Nebuchadnezzar and so prove their innocence of charges of leading an unchaste life.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=326}}

Daniel kept the welfare of Nebuchadnezzar in mind continually, and when the king was condemned by God to live as a beast for a certain period Daniel prayed that the period of punishment should be shortened, and his prayer was granted.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=334}} When Nebuchadnezzar was dying he wished to include Daniel among his heirs, but Daniel refused the honour, saying that he could not leave the inheritance of his forefathers for that of the uncircumcised.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=339}} Daniel also restored the sight of king Darius, who had wrongly thrown the pious Daniel into prison on false charges, upon which many converted to Judaism.{{sfn|Ginzberg|1998|p=347}}

===Christianity===
The [[New Testament]] makes one reference to Daniel at [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew ]] 24:15, which asserts that [[Jesus]] recognised Daniel as a prophet of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24:15-21&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 24:15-21 - King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is commemorated in the [[Coptic Church]] on the 23rd day of the Coptic month of [[Baramhat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/classes/synex.php?sa=1&amp;month=7&amp;day=23&amp;btn=View |title=The Departure of the great prophet Daniel |publisher=Copticchurch.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]], the feast days celebrating St. Daniel the Prophet together with the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Three Young Men]], falls on [[December 17 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|December 17]] (during the [[Nativity Fast]]), on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Bulgakov, ''Manual for Church Servers'', 2nd ed. (Kharkov, 1900) pp. 453–65. December 11–17: Sunday of the Holy Forefathers Translation: Archpriest Eugene D. Tarris&lt;/ref&gt; (the Sunday which falls between 11 and 17 December), and on the Sunday before Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgakov, ''Manual for Church Servers'', pp. 461–62. December 18–24: Sunday before the Nativity of Christ of the Holy Fathers&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel's prophecy regarding the stone which smashed the idol ({{Bibleverse||Daniel|2:34–35|HE}}) is often used in Orthodox hymns as a metaphor for the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]: the "stone cut out" being symbolic of the [[Logos]] (Christ), and the fact that it was cut "without hands" being symbolic of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]. Thus the hymns will refer to the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) as the "uncut mountain"

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] commemorates St. Daniel in the [[Roman Martyrology]] on July 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04620a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia on CD-ROM |publisher=New Advent |chapter=Daniel|author=Francis E. Gigot |year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local liturgical calendars of dioceses also list his feast, sometimes on July 21 and sometimes on another day. For example, the [[archdiocese of Gorizia]] celebrates the feast of St. Daniel, prophet and confessor, on September 11. The reading of the Mass is taken from the Book of Daniel, chapter 14; the Gradual from Psalm 91; the Alleluia verse from the Epistle of James 1; and the Gospel from Matthew 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4872-daniel-tomb-of "Daniel's tomb", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] commemorates Daniel, together with the Three Young Men ([[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]]), on December 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chi.lcms.org/history/tih1217.htm |title=Today in History – December 17 |publisher=Chi.lcms.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Islamic view of Daniel}}
Daniel ([[Arabic]]: دانيال, ''Danyal''), is not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], but there are accounts of his prophet-hood in later Muslim literature. He was carried off to Babylon after the destruction of Jerusalem, where he was rescued from lions with the aid of the prophet [[Jeremiah]]. (In [[Bel and the Dragon]] it is the prophet [[Habakkuk]] who plays this role). Another source ([[Tabiri]]) retells how Daniel interpreted the king's dream of a statue made of four metals destroyed by a rock from heaven.{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=75}} All sources, both [[Islamic Golden Age|classical]] and [[modern history|modern]], describe Daniel as a saintly and righteous man. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] in his Qur'anic commentary says:
{{Quote|Daniel was a righteous man of princely lineage and lived about 620–538 B.C. He was carried off to Babylon in 605 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar, the Assyrian, but was still living when Assyria was overthrown by the Medes and Persians. In spite of the "captivity" of the Jews, Daniel enjoyed the highest offices of state at Babylon, but he was ever true to Jerusalem. His enemies (under the Persian monarch) got a penal law passed against any one who "asked a petition of any god or man for 30 days" except the Persian King. But Daniel continued true to Jerusalem. "His windows being open in his chambers towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime."|[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]|''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]|''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', '''Note.'''150&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Kitab al-Kafi]], Imam [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]] asserts that Allah revealed to Daniel that, "The most hated among my creatures are the ignorant ones who disrespect the scholars and do not follow them. The Most beloved to Me in My servants are the pious ones who work hard to become entitled for greater rewards, who always stay close to the scholars, follow the fore-bearing people and accept (the advice of) people of wisdom."&lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Daniel Leavitt''' (November 16, 1813 &amp;ndash; July 27, 1859){{efn|1=Daniel Leavitt was alive at the time of Samuel Colt's patent infringement trial of 1852, but his interests were represented by Edward Leavitt.

Leavitt's patent was granted before Colt had manufactured a single pistol, indicating that Leavitt was working on his own, without a Colt prototype to study.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VjZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA860&amp;dq=%22samuel+colt%22+leavitt&amp;lr=&amp;ei=O5kwSZHXOYrUkwTq19HgAg]&lt;/ref&gt; was manufactured only briefly before a patent suit by Colt forced the company to stop producing the Leavitt &amp; Wesson Dragoon revolver. But Leavitt's early patents, and those of his partner Wesson, stoked competition and helped drive the technological and manufacturing boom that produced the modern firearms industry.

==Early life==
Leavitt was born November 16, 1813, at [[Rye, New Hampshire]], the son of Benning Leavitt, influential businessman, [[Massachusetts Senate|state senator]], county commissioner and later Chicopee [[Selectman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GigWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA491&amp;dq=%22benning+leavitt%22&amp;ei=9xMxSavlHpLYlQTV9rzFCQ|title="Our County and Its People": A History of Hampden County, Massachusetts|first=Alfred Minott|last=Copeland|date=19 November 2018|publisher=Century Memorial Publishing Company|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Olive (Jenness) Leavitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSsWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=%22benning+leavitt%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sXhdkyIyLK&amp;sig=fXc_5S7feSg301GD97N0qb4drkE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA245,M1|title=Sketches of the Old Inhabitants and Other Citizens of Old Springfield of the Present Century: And Its Historic Mansions of "ye Olden Tyme"|first=Charles Wells|last=Chapin|date=19 November 1893|publisher=Press of Springfield Print. and Binding Company|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Leavitt married in 1838 at [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], Ruth Jeannette Ball. They had three children.

==Leavitt's early patent==

Leavitt took out a patent on his new design on April 29, 1837, when the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] &lt;ref&gt;When Daniel Leavitt secured the patent for his new [[revolver]] in 1837, the Commissioner of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] was [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]] of [[Connecticut]]. Ellsworth served as the first head of the [[U.S. Patent Office]] for a decade &amp;ndash; from 1835 to 1845 &amp;ndash; and was one of Samuel Colt's champions when the inventor started in business.&lt;/ref&gt; granted him [[United States patent law|United States patent]] number 182 for an 'improvement in many-chambered cylinder firearm.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.american-firearms.com/american-firearms/z-patent/patent-L/Leavitt,%20Daniel/182.jpg |first=D. |last=Leavitt |title=Revolver, Illustration, American Firearms |website=american-firearms.com |publisher= |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early weapon, the second of its kind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zO0OC45ylEC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22wesson+&amp;+leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=A-AwScOhMYzukgSOzNzDBg|title=The War Department at the Centennial Exposition, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1888|date=19 November 1888|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a .40-caliber percussion, 6-shot single-action revolver with a 6¾-inch octagon tip-up barrel.

Leavitt took out his patent less than a year after Samuel Colt had obtained a patent on his seminal revolver, and before Colt had a chance to bring his new weapon to market. The patent was granted to Leavitt at his residence in [[Cabotville Common Historic District|Cabotville, Massachusetts]], now part of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;The selection of Chicopee by Leavitt and other early inventors and manufacturers would influence industrial [[New England]] for a century afterward. The legacy of machine-tool manufacture set up by early firearm manufacturers like Wesson, Leavitt, their employee Joshua Stevens, among others, later attracted the [[Duryea brothers]], who chose Chicopee as the base of their early automotive manufacturing due to the town's depth of talent in machine tools and manufacturing.[https://books.google.com/books?id=IZva1zXenNYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%22edwin+wesson%22+stevens&amp;source=web&amp;ots=lnBUs7HqhT&amp;sig=SzWm363WcUqCrbkRmiN-VTocjIU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA209,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; The design was radical in one respect. "The revolving cylinder which I use does not differ from such as have been previously employed in many-chambered guns," Leavitt wrote in his patent application. "The improvement which I have made consists in giving a convex form to that end of the revolving cylinder which is in contact with the barrel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-firearms.com/american-firearms/z-patent/patent-L/Leavitt,%20Daniel/182-claims1.jpg|title=Daniel Leavitt, of Cabotville, Massachusetts, The United States Patent Office, Letters Patent No. 182, April 29, 1837, American Firearms, american-firearms.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leavitt's innovation was the beveled face of the cylinder, which was designed to direct flash from the fired cylinder away from adjacent chambers, thus preventing multiple discharges, the major problem with early percussion revolvers.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In his design, Leavitt attempted to solve the problem through the beveling and the new convex shape he imparted to the revolving cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt built on his innovation for pistol design with a follow-up design some years later for a rifle using the same principle.[https://books.google.com/books?id=COMGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+massachusetts&amp;ei=KMAwSZeZKo6ukATOpKWsBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leavitt's design, wrote Philadelphia's ''Journal of the Franklin Institute'' in 1838, was "one of those fire arms which have several chambers bored in a cylinder, the axis of which is parallel to the axis of the barrel of the gun, and which chambers can be successively made to coincide with the said barrel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=%22daniel+leavitt%22+cabotville&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+cabotville&amp;ei=Ob4wSYBLk4yQBJOktf4E&amp;pgis=1|title=journal of the franklin institute of the state of pennsylvania and mechanics' register|first=Thomas P. Jones|last=M.D|date=19 November 2018|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Leavitt's innovation, noted the Journal, was to make the end of the cylinder convex to draw off the fumes and flash of the cartridge explosions.

==Early firearm manufacturing==
The inventor's early patent demonstrated that the firearms industry was attracting considerable innovation and competition as it was getting off the ground. (In the same year that Leavitt's patent was granted, the U.S. Patent Office granted two other men patents on innovations in many-chambered firearms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sa_jjUyt5U4C&amp;pg=RA2-PA413&amp;lpg=RA2-PA413&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+patent&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Qqk-FrUYYh&amp;sig=CzFhDkmCHO7kbDeJry5LoIGEaL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PRA2-PA413,M1|title=A History of American Manufactures from 1608 to 1860, Vol. II, John Leander Bishop, Edwin Troxell Freedley, Edward Young, Printed by Edward Young &amp; Co., Philadelphia, 1866|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 1836, Samuel Colt had been granted a U.S. patent (later renumbered X9430) for his patent for a 'revolving gun.'&lt;ref&gt;The first 10,000 U.S. patents issued between 1790 to 1836 were not originally numbered, and all records of them were lost in a fire at the Patent Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolvers were produced in small quantities by the firm of Wesson, Stephens &amp; Miller in nearby [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. In 1839 Edwin Wesson, principal of the manufacturing concern and himself an inventor, make some modifications to Leavitt's initial design, dubbing the new product the 'Wesson &amp; Leavitt' revolver, which he began producing at a factory in [[Massachusetts]], a concern which led to the formation of the [[Massachusetts Arms Company]] of [[Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts]]. After a patent grant to Wesson in 1850, awarded posthumously,{{efn|1=Edward Wesson died suddenly in 1850 of a heart attack, leaving his brother [[Daniel B. Wesson|Daniel]] to try to collect on his patents and attempt to organize the manufacturing based on them. The Massachusetts Arms Company had been organized by the heirs and kin of Edwin Wesson for the manufacture of revolvers under Wesson and Leavitt's patents. Born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], in 1825, [[Daniel B. Wesson|Daniel Baird Wesson]] went to work in his brother Edwin's manufactory in [[Northborough, Massachusetts]], in 1843 as an apprentice.}} the first Wesson &amp; Leavitt revolvers rolled off the line at Chicopee Falls. The enormous 40-caliber handgun weighed over 4 pounds and was nearly 15&amp;nbsp;inches long, with 7.1&amp;nbsp;inches of that in the barrel itself.&lt;ref name= "Walter"&gt;{{cite book  |title=The Guns that Won the West: Firearms on the American Frontier, 1848–1898 |author=John Walter |location=St Paul, Minnesota |publisher=MBI Publishing Company |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-85367-692-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850/51 the firm produced some 800 copies of the new revolver, which could be reloaded by simply pressing a latch, raising the barrel and pulling the cylinder forward and off the axis pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american-firearms.com/american-firearms/z-pic/pics-W/Wesson%20&amp;%20Leavitt%20Massachusetts%20Arms%20Company/pic/w&amp;l.gif|title=Photograph, Leavitt revolver, American Firearms, american-firearms.com|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the standard model, another thousand smaller .31-caliber Belt models were manufactured with a shorter barrel.&lt;ref&gt;Testing of the new revolvers by the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|United States Ordnance Department]] seemed to give the edge to the Colt weapons for their accuracy and penetration of targets, but some observers disputed the neutrality of the tests.[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXkDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22samuel+colt%22+leavitt&amp;lr=&amp;ei=65wwSYruDYq6kwSOwZyoAg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new revolvers were embraced by customers. General [[Winfield Scott]], for instance, carried one of the smaller Wesson &amp; Leavitt 32-caliber six-shot revolvers in the [[Mexican-American War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_41/outLXI05/outLXI05j.pdf|title=CONTENTdm|website=www.la84foundation.org|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samuel Colt sues for patent infringement==
[[Image:Navy revolver.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1851 Colt Navy revolver]]
The success of the fledgling company's weapon soon attracted the attention of Samuel Colt, who sent his cousin Henry Sargeant to purchase one of the revolvers.&lt;ref name = "Houze"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9e37mYzuNIC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22edwin+wesson%22+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FsvKbxpGCT&amp;sig=16UnkN19jBBKPZ59pc0K4SNMCdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA135,M1|title=Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention|first1=Herbert G.|last1=Houze|first2=Carolyn C.|last2=Cooper|first3=Elizabeth Mankin|last3=Kornhauser|date=19 November 2018|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emboldened by the recent extension of his original patent until 1857, Colt sued Wesson &amp; Leavitt, now run by Edwin's brother [[Daniel B. Wesson|Daniel Wesson]], who had gone to work for his brother Edwin in 1843 and who took over after Edwin's 1849 death. Colt's lawsuit alleged infringement of Colt's original patent on the revolver. The case went to trial in October 1852 before the [[United States circuit court]] for the District of New York. Both sides alleged tampering with the original U.S. Patent files as well as fraudulent exhibits. The case was extensively covered by the New York City newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1852/10/14/75119122.pdf Colt's Revolvers, Important Suit for Infringement of Patent, ''The New York Times'', October 14, 1852]&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Colt had overwhelmed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_07AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA373 |title=Reports of cases argued and determined in the Circuit court of the United States for the Second circuit [1845-1887]|volume=Volume II |first1=Samuel|last1=Blatchford|others=United States Circuit Court (2nd Circuit)|publisher=Derby and Miller |accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tiny manufacturer in court and won large damages. Massachusetts Arms Co. continued to manufacture revolvers based on alternate version of their revolvers with various less useful methods for revolving the cylinder to get around Colt's patents. The original company dissolved after the Civil War in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flayderman |first1=Norm |title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values |date=2007 |publisher=Gun Digest Books |location=Iola, Wisconsin |pages=361-363 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Colt's victory, his attorney Edward N. Dickerson fired off a circular at the manufacturers in the firearms business. "You will please to take notice," Dickerson wrote, "to desist forthwith from the sale of any REPEATING FIRE ARMS, in which rotation, or locking or releasing, are produced by combining the breech with the lock; or in which the cones are separated by partitions, or set into recesses; except such as are made by Col. Colt, at [[Hartford]]."&lt;ref name="Houze"/&gt;

"Needless to say," write the authors of ''Samuel Colt: Arms, Art, and Invention'', "this circular had a chilling effect on the American arms industry." A number of the firms warned by Dickerson capitulated and paid damages to settle with Colt. But despite this early victory, Colt's attorney warned his client not to persist with his patent infringement suits. "Nothing is easier than to get into a big law suit", said Dickerson, "but there are many easier things than to get out successfully. Your luck, as I suppose you will call it, has hitherto been very good &amp;ndash; better than ''any other inventor'' in America by far, but it may turn, and another suit may bring out something which we know not of, and which may destroy us...."{{sfnp|Flayderman|2007|p=125}}

Dickerson may have been smarting from confrontations in the U.S. District Court battle, which turned into a jousting match between two of the foremost attorneys of the day: Dickerson representing Colt; and [[Rufus Choate]] representing the [[Massachusetts Arms Company]].&lt;ref name = "Walter"/&gt; Nevertheless it was Dickerson &amp;ndash; and his client Colt, who was away on business in Europe during the trial &amp;ndash; who came out on top in the first courtroom dust-up.

Despite the warning of Dickerson to his client not to press his luck, Colt's litigious salvos had one effect: they virtually shut down the output of his competitors for several years, and his firm became the largest manufacturer of civilian firearms during the 1850s.{{sfnp|Flayderman|2007|p=125}}

==The aftermath of Colt's litigation==
[[Image:SamuelColt.jpg|thumb|upright|Samuel Colt, firearm manufacturer who crushed his competitors in his patent infringement case in 1852]]
Altogether the [[Massachusetts Arms Company]] &amp;ndash; considered a predecessor of arms manufacturer [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Smith &amp; Wesson Firearms |author=Dean K. Boorman |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-58574-721-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; manufactured roughly a thousand of the .31-caliber belt models of the original patented revolver, 200 of which were purchased by the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] Massachusetts-Kansas Aid Committee in 1856. Many of these firearms later found their way to abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].

The Massachusetts Arms Company continued in business, and after the expiration of some of Samuel Colt's original patents, as well as improvements in the design of its revolvers, the company manufactured an assortment of weapons.{{efn|1=From the beginning Samuel Colt's manufactory had far better distribution than its competitors, and its weapons found their way into the hands of Western frontiersmen in far great numbers than those of its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guns on the Early Frontiers: A History of Firearms from Colonial Times Through the Years of the Western Fur Trade |author=Carl Parcher Russell |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-80328-903-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BJRJZZIxrmkC&amp;pg=PA96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Several of its early employees, notably designer Joshua Stevens, went on to found other successful weaponry companies. (The J. Stevens Company, founded by former Wesson &amp; Leavitt employee Stevens, was ultimately sold to New England Westinghouse Company in 1915 to produce military arms{{efn|1=The former J. Stevens Company later became famous for its heavy Browning Machine Rifles.}} for [[World War I]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYlCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=%22wesson+&amp;+leavitt%22&amp;lr=&amp;ei=790wSZ6iD5DckASF-dzGCA|title=Firearms in American History: Our rifles|first=Charles Winthrop |last=Sawyer |date=19 November 2018|publisher=The Author|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early inventor, although eventually crushed by the legal team of arms magnate Samuel Colt, had helped spur competition and drive technological improvements in the design of American pistols &amp;ndash; guns later used in the [[Old West]], the [[American Civil War]] and elsewhere, and the envy of the world's firearm manufacturers. Leavitt himself served in the [[Massachusetts Volunteer Militia]] in 1847 as  [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] of Company F, 10th Regiment, 6th Brigade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hfUBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=daniel+leavitt+cabotville&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pGZQsxTxfl&amp;sig=1RMj_e_L0vZfzlwhfdf23QAVo2U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA115,M1|title=The Massachusetts Register and United States Calendar for the Year of Our Lord ...|date=19 November 2018|publisher=Richardson, Lord &amp; Holbrook, and James Loring|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the Chicopee [[Freemasons]] lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyE4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA519&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+chicopee&amp;lr=&amp;ei=Z6YwSZijMYXikwTr-dSNAg|title=The New England Freemason|first1=Sereno Dwight|last1=Nickerson|first2=Charles H.|last2=Titus|date=19 November 1875|publisher=F. Wood.|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leavitt did not confine himself to the design of firearms. On August 18, 1842 he was granted a patent (number 2755) for a 'Mode of Securing Bobbins in Shuttles for Weaving'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktYGAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+cabotville&amp;ei=HrswSfeSM5XOkwTgsPGYBQ|title=Journal of the Franklin Institute|author=Franklin Institute |location=Philadelphia, Pa. |date=1848|publisher=Pergamon Press|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2755A/en|title=Mode of securing bobbins in shuttles for weaving|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt's patent for an innovation for bobbins used in power looms demonstrated that the inventor had his eye on another emerging [[New England]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoYFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26&amp;lpg=RA1-PA26&amp;dq=%22daniel+leavitt%22+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g4mQT2JME0&amp;sig=DSWFT1aP73Uk6782t3K2LRIEsho&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result|title=Senate Documents, Otherwise Publ. as Public Documents and Executive Documents: 14th Congress, 1st Session-48th Congress, 2nd Session and Special Session|first=United States Congress|last=Senate|date=19 November 2018|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an industry in which Leavitt had more than passing interest: his father Benning owned a Chicopee factory that produced bobbins. There is no indication whether Leavitt's patent for textile manufacturing was more successful than his firearm patents.

==Death==
Leavitt died at [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]] on July 27, 1859.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13893">'''[[William Wordsworth]]''' (7 April 1770 – 23 April 1850) was an English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet who, with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], helped launch the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]] in [[English literature]] with their 1798 joint publication, ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''. His early years were dominated by his experience of the countryside around the [[Lake District]] and the English moors. [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], his sister, served as his early companion until their mother's death and their separation when he was sent to school.

==Parents==
Wordsworth's parents were John Wordsworth, a legal agent for [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]] and Collector of Customs at [[Whitehaven]], and his wife, Ann Cookson.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1989 pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; John was the son of Richard Wordsworth, a land owner who served as a legal agent to the [[Robert Lowther (1681&amp;ndash;1745)|Lowther]] family.

Like his father, John became a legal agent for [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]]&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 7&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; and was made Bailiff and Recorder for [[Cockermouth]] and Coroner for the [[wikt:seigniory|Seigniory]] of Millon.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1989 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann was the daughter of William Cookson, a linen-draper, and Dorothy Crackanthorpe, daughter of a gentry family in Westmorland. They lived above Cookson's shop in [[Penrith, Cumbria]]. Ann's brother, Christopher "Kit" Crackanthorpe Cookson (later, Christopher Crackanthorpe) inherited the family estate of Newbiggin Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 4&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;

John, at the age of 26, married Ann, 18, in 1766, and he used his connections with the Lowther family to move into a large mansion in the small town of Cockermouth, Cumbria, in the Lake District. John owned many properties, in Cockermouth and [[Ravenglass]], and he inherited a property at [[Sockbridge]], which was originally purchased by his father and given to John after his older brother, Richard, was disinherited by their father. However, the brother's relationship was not strained by this decision, and Richard would become guardian to John's children after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 5&amp;ndash;-8&lt;/ref&gt;

William's mother died when he was 7 years old and he became an orphan at the age of 13 years.

===Childhood===
Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in Cockermouth, the second of five children.&lt;ref name=" Gill p. 13"&gt;Gill 1989 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, the poet, and diarist Dorothy, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptized together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who would become a poet and enjoy nature with William and Dorothy until he died in an 1805 shipwreck; and Christopher, the youngest, who would become a scholar and eventually Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. Although he lived at his father's mansion, Wordsworth, as with his siblings, had little involvement with their father, and they would be distant with him until his death in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 5&amp;ndash;7&lt;/ref&gt;

Wordsworth's father, although rarely present, did teach him poetry, including that of [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], in addition to allowing his son to rely on his father's library. In addition to spending his time reading in Cockermouth, he would stay at his mother's parents home in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]],&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 9&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt; for extended periods of time, which took place primarily during 1775–1776 and during the winter months of 1776–1777.&lt;ref name="Gill p. 15"&gt;Gill 1989 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  At Penrith, Wordsworth was exposed to the moors and was influenced by his experience with the landscape and was further turned towards nature by the harsh treatment he received at the hands of his relatives. In particular, Wordsworth could not get along with his grandparents and his uncle, and his hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 11&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1778, Ann died of an illness, possibly pneumonia, at Penrith. After the death of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his children away to be raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother's family and eventually sent to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]], and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann's cousin, in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth's first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 15&amp;ndash;18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and nature===
At Penrith, Wordsworth was sent to a school for the children of upper-class families and taught by Ann Birkett, a woman who insisted in instilling tradition in her students that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day, or Shrove Tide. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''Spectator'', but little else. It was at the school that Wordsworth was to meet the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who would be his future wife. Life at Penrith wasn't a happy time for Wordsworth, because he was unsatisfied with his grandparents' treatment; he still spent time at his grandparents' home and their relationship was still tense. Wordsworth became rebellious to the point of destroying a family portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 15&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;

His discontent with his familial situation provoked Wordsworth to spend his time wandering away from his home, an action Wordsworth relates as uniting a childish imagination with both nature and mankind in ''The Prelude''. He became attached to nature, and, when he was finally sent to school in Hawkshead, he was able to fully enjoy the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 20&amp;ndash;22&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the local surroundings, Wordsworth was educated at the Hawkshead Grammar School, which had a reputation for scholarship and preparation for University entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of Wordsworth's education at Hawkshead was based on mathematics. The rest of the curriculum was based on teaching the classics, and it was during his classical studies that Wordsworth gained a love for Latin literature. Besides his literary education, Wordsworth and his brothers were given dancing lessons in 1785. While Wordsworth was taught at Hawkshead, he boarded with Hugh and Ann Tyson in the nearby hamlet of Colthouse, where he was exposed to the local yarn trade. The community had a strong Quaker influence, and Wordsworth, after experiencing their traditions, rejected their fixation on praising God for a relationship with the divine that would involve a more direct interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 26&amp;ndash;29&lt;/ref&gt;

===College===
Hawkshead School had a strong relationship with St.John's College at Cambridge University and, in October 1787, Wordsworth became an undergraduate there.

==Early career==
Wordsworth felt that his life before Samuel Taylor &lt;ref&gt;"William Wordsworth." 2014. The Biography Channel website. Feb 08 2014, 06:10 http://www.biography.com/people/william-wordsworth-9537033.&lt;/ref&gt;Coleridge was sedentary and dull and his poetry amounted to little. When Coleridge was near, he was Wordsworth's muse, and Coleridge's praise and encouragement kept Wordsworth motivated.&lt;ref name="Matlak 1978 p. 48"&gt;Matlak 1978 p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy described Wordsworth while around Coleridge when she wrote: "His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did".&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth 1967 p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; It was under Coleridge's support that Wordsworth was encouraged to write poetry intended to rival Milton.&lt;ref name="Matlak 1978 p. 48" /&gt;

===Separation from Coleridge===
When Wordsworth was forced to move from Alfoxden, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy agreed to travel to Germany in September 1798. Originally, Coleridge and Wordsworth lived together in Hamburg, until Coleridge decided to look for a place to live at [[Ratzeburg]]. Wordsworth wanted to join his friend, but was forced to decline over monetary issues; Wordsworth was unable to provide for both himself and his sister in such an expensive town, and they instead moved to [[Goslar]]. The separation, with the expenses, made it impossible for Wordsworth to spend time with Coleridge until after the winter of 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978 pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Wordsworth continued to write even without the support of Coleridge's company, and from October 1798 to February 1799 Wordsworth began writing the "Matthew" poems along with the [[The Lucy poems|"Lucy" poems]] and other poems. These poems express the frustration and anxiety that Wordsworth was feeling&lt;ref&gt;Matlak 1978 pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is possible that the "Lucy" poems allowed Wordsworth to vent his frustration with his sister, and that they contain the subconscious desire for his sister to die.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson 1954 p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The two poems are thematically unique compared to Wordsworth's other poems,&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973 p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; especially in their portrayal of loss&lt;ref&gt;Hartman 1967 p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of faith that nature is able to provide comfort or solutions to life's problems.&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973 pp. 10&amp;ndash;11&lt;/ref&gt; This reversal of Wordsworth's view of nature provoked Alan Grob to suggest that the two sets of poems should be known "as the Goslar lyrics of 1799".&lt;ref&gt;Grob 1973 p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early works==
Besides an emphasis on nature, as Bennett Weaver points out, "The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew's daughter, and for Lucy Gray."&lt;ref&gt;Weaver 1960 p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrical Ballads===
In his ''"Preface to Lyrical Ballads"'', which is called the "manifesto" of English Romantic criticism, Wordsworth calls his poems "experimental". The year 1793 saw Wordsworth's first published poetry, with the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. He received a legacy of £900 from [[Raisley Calvert]] in 1795 so that he could pursue writing poetry. That year, he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. In 1797, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in Nether Stowey. Together, Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''Lyrical Ballads'' (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's name as author. One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, "Tintern Abbey", was published in the work, along with Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author, and included a preface to the poems, which was augmented significantly in the 1802 edition. This Preface to Lyrical Ballads is considered a central work of Romantic literary theory. In it, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the "real language of men" and which avoids the poetic diction of much 18th-century poetry. Here, Wordsworth gives his famous definition of poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility." A fourth and final edition of Lyrical Ballads was published in 1805.

===Prelude===
In 1799, Wordsworth completed a version of his ''[[The Prelude|Prelude]]'', which was, according to Stephen Gill, "the most sustained self-examination in English poetry".&lt;ref name="Gill p. 13" /&gt; In Wordsworth's 1799 ''Prelude'', he attempted to write a biography about the growth of his mind from childhood to the current time. However, he realized that this could never be complete&lt;ref name="Gill p. 13" /&gt; and wrote:
::But who shall parcel out
:His intellect by geometric rules,
:Split like a province into round and square?
:Who knows the individual hour in which
:His habits were first sown even as a seed?
:Who that shall point as with a wand, and say
:'This portion of the river of my mind
:Came from yon fountain'? (''Prelude'' II 243&amp;ndash;249)
The 1799 ''Prelude'' describes Wordsworth's early, happy moments in Cockermouth with a particular focus on the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]] and [[Cockermouth Castle]]. The poem transitions into the happy moments at Hawkshead, skipping over Wordsworth's experience with his mother's family,&lt;ref name="Gill p. 15" /&gt; and only one scene containing his experience in Penrith was introduced in Book XII of the 1805 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman 1968 pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Carpenter''' (29 August 1844 &amp;ndash; 28 June 1929) was an English [[socialism|socialist]] [[poet]], [[philosopher]], [[anthologist]], and early activist for [[LGBT social movements|rights for homosexuals]].&lt;ref name="WWiH"&gt;[[Warren Allen Smith]]: ''Who's Who in Hell, A Handbook and International Directory for Humanists, Freethinkers, Naturalists, Rationalists, and Non-Theists'', Barricade Books, New York, 2000, p. 186; {{ISBN|978-1-56980-158-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A poet and writer, he was a close friend of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a friend of [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leylandpublications.com/exc_gaysuccess.html Excerpt from Gay Roots Vol. 1: THE GAY SUCCESSION The following document first appeared in ''Gay Sunshine Journal'' 35 (1978) and was reprinted as an appendix to the Allen Ginsberg interview in the book ''Gay Sunshine Interviews'', Volume 1, Gay Sunshine Press, 1978.] retrieved September 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He corresponded with many famous figures such as [[Annie Besant]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Roger Fry]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Keir Hardie]], J. K. Kinney, [[Jack London]], [[George Merrill (gay activist)|George Merrill]], [[E. D. Morel]], [[William Morris]], [[Edward R. Pease]], [[John Ruskin]], and [[Olive Schreiner]].&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;[http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/collections_az/Fab-Carp-1/highlights.aspx FABIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL THOUGHT Series One: The Papers of Edward Carpenter, 1844-1929, from Sheffield Archives Part 1: Correspondence and Manuscripts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006231457/http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/collections_az/Fab-Carp-1/highlights.aspx |date=6 October 2007 }} at www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[philosopher]] he was particularly known for his publication of ''Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure'' in which he proposes that civilisation is a form of disease that human societies pass through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Edward|title=Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Civilisation:_Its_Cause_and_Cure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early advocate of sexual freedoms, he had an influence on both [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Sri Aurobindo]], and inspired [[E. M. Forster]]'s novel [[Maurice (novel)|''Maurice'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''The Essential Gay Mystics'' |editor=[[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]] |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], Carpenter was educated at nearby [[Brighton College]] where his father was a governor. His brothers Charles, George and Alfred also went to school there. When he was ten, he displayed a flair for the piano.&lt;ref name=Days&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecdd1.htm|title= Edward Carpenter, ''My Days and Dreams'', London: Unwin, 1916.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic ability appeared relatively late in his youth, but was sufficient to earn him a place at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Rowbotham&gt;Rowbotham 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there he began to explore his feelings for men. One of the most notable examples of this is his close friendship with [[Edward Anthony Beck]] (later Master of Trinity Hall), which, according to Carpenter, had "a touch of romance".&lt;ref name=Days/&gt; Beck eventually ended their friendship, causing Carpenter great emotional heartache. Carpenter graduated as 10th [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in 1868.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;{{acad|id=CRPR864E|name=Carpenter, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; After university he joined the [[Church of England]] as a [[curate]], "as a convention rather than out of deep Conviction".&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;[http://www.edwardcarpenter.net/ecbiog.htm Philip Taylor's Biography of Carpenter], Philip Taylor 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 he was invited to become tutor to the royal princes [[George V of the United Kingdom|George Frederick]] (late King George V) and his elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence]], but declined the position. The job instead went to his lifelong friend and fellow Cambridge student [[John Neale Dalton]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter continued to visit Dalton while he was tutor, and was presented with photographs of themselves by the princes.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years he experienced an increasing sense of dissatisfaction with his life in the church and university, and became weary of what he saw as the hypocrisy of Victorian society.&lt;ref name=Days/&gt; He found great solace in reading poetry, later remarking that his discovery of the work of [[Walt Whitman]] caused "a profound change" in him. (''My Days and Dreams'' p.&amp;nbsp;64)


==Moving to the North of England==
[[File:Carpenter1875.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Carpenter in 1875]]

Carpenter left the church in 1874 and became a [[lecturer]] in [[astronomy]], sun worship, the lives of ancient Greek women and [[music]], moving to [[Leeds]] as part of University Extension Movement, which was formed by academics who wished to introduce higher education to deprived areas of England. He hoped to lecture to the [[working class]]es, but found that his lectures were attended by [[middle class]] people, many of whom showed little active interest in the subjects he taught.  Disillusioned,&lt;ref name=Days/&gt; he moved to [[Chesterfield]], but finding that town dull, he based himself in nearby [[Sheffield]] a year later.&lt;ref name=Rowbotham/&gt; Here he finally came into contact with manual workers, and he began to write poetry. His sexual preferences were for working men: "the grimy and oil-besmeared figure of a stoker" or "the thick-thighed hot coarse-fleshed young bricklayer with a strap around his waist".&lt;ref&gt;Aronson p.49 citing d'Arch Smith, Love in Earnest p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sheffield, Carpenter became increasingly radical.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Influenced by a disciple of [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Henry Hyndman]], he joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) in 1883 and attempted to form a branch in the city.  The group instead chose to remain independent, and became the [[Sheffield Socialist Society]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} While in the city he worked on a number of projects including highlighting the poor living conditions of industrial workers.

In May 1889, Carpenter wrote a piece in the ''Sheffield Independent'' calling Sheffield the laughingstock of the civilized world and said that the giant thick cloud of smog rising out of Sheffield was like the smoke arising from Judgment Day, and that it was the altar on which the lives of many thousands would be sacrificed. He said that 100,000 adults and children were struggling to find sunlight and air, enduring miserable lives, unable to breathe and dying of related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Carpenter, Letter, ''Sheffield Independent'' (25 May 1889)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he left the SDF with [[William Morris]] to join the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]].

When his father Charles Carpenter died in 1882, he left his son a considerable fortune. This enabled Carpenter to quit his lectureship to start a simpler life of [[market gardening]] in [[Millthorpe, Derbyshire|Millthorpe]], near [[Barlow, Derbyshire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitchesterfield.info/thedms.asp?dms=13&amp;venue=6050330{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter popularised the phrase the "Simple Life" in his essay ''Simplification of Life'' in his ''England's Ideal'' (1887).{{sfn|Delany|1987|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;10}} He asked [[Harold Cox]] to send him a pair of [[sandal]]s from India, and used this pair as a template to begin making sandals at Millthorpe.

==Travel in India==
Drawn increasingly to Hindu philosophy, he traveled to India and Ceylon in 1890.  Following conversations with the guru Ramaswamy (known as the Gnani) there, he developed the conviction that socialism would bring about a revolution in human consciousness as well as of economic conditions.   His account of the travel was published in 1892 as  ''From Adam's Peak to Elephanta: Sketches in Ceylon and India''.  The book's spiritual explorations would subsequently influence the  Russian author [[Peter Ouspensky]], who discusses it extensively in his own book, ''[[Tertium Organum]]'' (1912).

==Life with George Merrill==
[[Image:Carpenter et Merrill.jpg|thumb|Carpenter and Merrill c. 1900.]]
On his return from India in 1891, he met [[George Merrill (gay activist)|George Merrill]], a working-class man also from Sheffield, 22 years his junior, and the two men struck up a relationship, eventually cohabiting in 1898.&lt;ref name=Rowbotham/&gt; Merrill had been raised in the slums of Sheffield and had no formal education.  Their relationship endured and they remained partners for the rest of their lives, a fact made all the more extraordinary by the hysteria about homosexuality generated by the [[Oscar Wilde]] trial of 1895. Carpenter remarked in his work ''The Intermediate Sex'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Eros is a great leveller. Perhaps the true Democracy rests, more firmly than anywhere else, on a sentiment which easily passes the bounds of class and caste, and unites in the closest affection the most estranged ranks of society. It is noticeable how often [[Uranian]]s of good position and breeding are drawn to rougher types, as of manual workers, and frequently very permanent alliances grow up in this way, which although not publicly acknowledged have a decided influence on social institutions, customs and political tendencies.&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;Edward Carpenter ''The Intermediate Sex'', p.114-115&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Edward Carpenter, 1894.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Edward Carpenter'' (1894) by [[Roger Fry]] (1866&amp;ndash;1934), oil on canvas; given by the artist, 1930]]

Carpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the [[Humanitarian League]], [[Henry S. Salt]], and his wife, Catherine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Savour of Salt: A Henry Salt Anthology |page=153 |publisher=Centaur Press |year=1989 |author=George and Willene Hendrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the critic, essayist and sexologist, [[Havelock Ellis]], and his wife, Edith; actor and producer [[Ben Iden Payne]]; Labour activists, [[John Bruce Glasier|John Bruce]] and [[Katharine Glasier]]; writer and scholar, [[John Addington Symonds]]; and the writer and feminist, [[Olive Schreiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Stephen. 2013. Two Dissident Dream-Walkers: The Hardly Explored Reformist Alliance between Olive Schreiner and Edward Carpenter. ''English Academy Review: Southern African Journal of English Studies'' Volume 30, Issue 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. M. Forster]] was also close friends with the couple, who on a visit to Millthorpe in 1912 was inspired to write his gay-themed novel, ''[[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]]''.&lt;ref name="Rowse"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowse | first=A. L. | authorlink=A. L. Rowse | title=Homosexuals in History: A Study of Ambivalence in Society, Literature, and the Arts | publisher=Macmillan | location=[[New York City|New York, New York]] | year=1977 | url= | isbn=0-88029-011-0 | pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster records in his diary that Merrill "...touched my backside - gently and just above the buttocks. I believe he touched most people's. The sensation was unusual and I still remember it, as I remember the position of a long vanished tooth. He made a profound impression on me and touched a creative spring."&lt;ref name=Rowbotham/&gt;

The relationship between Carpenter and Merrill was the template for the relationship between Maurice Hall and Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper in Forster's novel.&lt;ref name="Rowse"/&gt; Carpenter was also a significant influence on the author [[D. H. Lawrence]], whose ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' can be seen as a heterosexualised ''Maurice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cF_eCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT242|title=Masculinity, Class and Same-Sex Desire in Industrial England, 1895-1957|first=Helen|last=Smith|date=5 October 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, he published ''The Healing of Nations and the Hidden Sources of Their Strife'', where he argued that the source of war and discontent in western society was class-monopoly and social inequality.

Carpenter was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Larson|Larson, Martin Alfred]]. (1977). ''The Story of Christian Origins: Or, The Sources and Establishment of Western Religion''. J. J. Binns. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; He authored the book ''Pagan and Christian Creeds'', 1920.

After the [[First World War]], he had moved to [[Guildford]], Surrey, with George Merrill&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;[http://www.brightonourstory.co.uk/newsletters/winter99/edward.htm Brighton Ourstory Project - Lesbian and Gay History Group&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.brightonourstory.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and the two lived at 23 Mountside Road.&lt;ref name=exploring&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/people/writers/edward_carpenter/ |title=Edward Carpenter (1844 – 1929) |publisher=exploringsurreyspast.org.uk |date=2012 |accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1928, Merrill died suddenly.&lt;ref name=Rowbotham/&gt; Carpenter was devastated and he sold their house and lodged for a short time, with his companion and carer Ted Inigan, at 17 Woodland Avenue, just a short walk from Mountside. They then moved to a bungalow called ‘Inglenook’ in Josephs Road.&lt;ref name=exploring/&gt;

In May 1928, Carpenter suffered a paralytic [[stroke]]. He lived another 13 months before he died on 28 June 1929, aged 84.&lt;ref name=Rowbotham/&gt; He was interred, in the same grave as Merrill, at the [[Mount Cemetery]] at [[Guildford]] in Surrey.

[[Ansel Adams]] was an admirer of Carpenter's writings, especially ''Towards Democracy''.&lt;ref name="Ref_f"&gt;''Ansel Adams and the American Landscape: A Biography'' by Jonathan Spaulding, University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Paul]] was influenced by Carpenter's ideas; in turn he passed on Carpenter's ideas to the scouting group he founded, [[The Woodcraft Folk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Wall]], '' Green History : A Reader in Environmental Literature, Philosophy and Politics'', London, Routledge, 1993. {{ISBN|041507925X}} (pp.  232-34)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter has also been known as the "Saint in Sandals", the "Noble Savage" and, more recently, the "gay godfather of the British left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/01/edward-carpenter|title=Review: Edward Carpenter by Eliot Smith - Books - The Guardian|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Gilbert''' ({{circa|1819}} – August 2, 1852) was an American newspaper editor and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[California]] politician.

Gilbert was born in [[Cherry Valley, New York|Cherry Valley]], New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000172|title=GILBERT, Edward - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846-48, he served in the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.onevoter.org/reports/Legislators_of_California.pdf|title=Legislators of California|date=2011|last1=Vassar|first1=Alexander C.|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his regiment arrived in [[San Francisco]], California in 1847, Gilbert was discharged from service and chose to remain in California.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=44236945|title=Edward Gilbert (1819 - 1852) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849, Gilbert partnered with businessman Edward Kemble and printer G. O. Hubbard to found the [[The Daily Alta California|''Alta California'']] weekly paper, where Gilbert worked as senior editor for the next four years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In September 1849, Gilbert became the youngest delegate to the Constitutional Convention, winning the San Francisco delegate position with 1,512 out of the 1,519 votes cast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was elected in November 1849 at-large as one of California's first two Representatives in the [[31st United States Congress|31st Congress]], and served from September 11, 1850 until March 3, 1851.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1852, Gilbert wrote an article that charged [[James W. Denver|General James W. Denver]] with "negligence and gross mismanagement" in an expedition to aid destitute immigrants, and the increasing conflict between Gilbert and Denver finally led Gilbert to challenge him to a duel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cal-press.wildapricot.org/hall-of-fame_edward-gilbert|title=California Press Foundation - Hall-of-Fame_Edward-Gilbert|website=cal-press.wildapricot.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several missed shots from both men, Denver shot Gilbert in the abdomen, killing him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gilbert was interred in Laurel Hill Cemetery, San Francisco.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, after the city banned cemeteries within city-limits, his remains were removed and buried in the Laurel Hill Mound mass grave of Cyprus Lawn Memorial Park in [[Colma, California|Colma]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Elise Blenker''' (* 1824 in [[Köthen (Anhalt)|Köthen]], Saxony-Anhalt; † 15 May 1908 in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/05/17/104725571.pdf Obituary, The New York Times, 17th May 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;) was the wife of [[Louis Blenker]], a German revolutionary officer of the years 1848/1849. Elise was also actively involved in various actions of the [[German revolutions of 1848–49]] in the [[Circle of the Rhine|Palatinate]] and in [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]].

==Life in Germany== 
Elise Blenker (née Aue) was the daughter of an evangelical pastor, Johann Christian Aue. In 1843 she married the former [[Uhlan]] officer, Louis Blenker, in [[Worms, Germany|Worrms]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine|Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. At this time Louis was running a wine trading business in Worms. In 1848, he became a colonel in the Worms militia. When the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|revolution of 1848]], broke out in Baden, Elise accompanied her husband on his campaigns, partially dressed in military uniform.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;ADB&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Elise met with other revolutionary women, including Kathinka Zitz-Halein, Emma Herwegh, Amalie Struve and Mathilde Franziska Anneke. On 20th–21st May Elise and her husband took part in an unsuccessful attack on [[Landau]]. She also played a decisive role in the plundering of the [[Alt Eberstein|Castle of Eberstein]] in Baden.

==Life in the United States==
After the suppression of the revolution, Elise was compelled to flee with her husband, first to [[Switzerland]], and then in 1850 to the United States.&lt;ref name="nie"&gt;NIE&lt;/ref&gt; With her father's help, Elise and Louis built a new life in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], where they ran a dairy farm.&lt;ref name="wittke"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wittke |first=Carl |title=Refugees of Revolution: The German Forty-Eighters in America |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |year=1952 |location=Philadelphia |pages=233–235 |url=https://archive.org/details/refugeesofrevolu008276mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together Elise and Louis had four children (three daughters and a son).
Upon the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861 Louis organized the [[8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], of which he became colonel.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; For his gallantry at Bull Run he was raised to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] of volunteers.&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; In October 1863 Louis died of injuries sustained while with his command at [[Warrenton, Virginia]],&lt;ref name="nie"/&gt; leaving Elise and their children in poverty.&lt;ref name="adb"/&gt; Elise was unable to cover the cost of his funeral, and had to turn to friends and family for help.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington ist begeistert von dem Deutschen'' in ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|FAZ]]'', 30 October 2013, page 30&lt;/ref&gt; Her widow's pension was later increased from 30 to 50 US dollars a month.

Elise Blenker died on 15 May 1908 in her daughter's house in Mount Vernon (New York).

'''Francisco Aguilar y Leal''' (1776–1840) was a soldier and Spanish merchant, that became one of the main leaders of Uruguayan independence.

== Life and the military ==
Francisco Aguilar y Leal was born in 1776 in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]],
[[Spain]]. Later, he moved to [[Arrecife]], in the island of [[Lanzarote]], where, in the early nineteenth century, he chartered an expedition of 200 people from the island bound for [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], starting the Canarian emigration from the eastern islands to that place (after the Canary emigration that took place in Uruguay in the first half of the eighteenth century), which basically will not terminate until 1900, emigrating more than 10,000 people in this period.&lt;ref name="Emigración"&gt;Hernández González, Manuel. ''La emigración canaria a América'' (''emigration of Canarian people to the Americas''). Pages: 67 and 70. First edition: January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a Merchant in the Canary Island. Later, he moved to [[Maldonado, Uruguay|Maldonado]], Uruguay, arriving with a lot of money from the Canary island. Here, he continued working as a trader and cemented a fortune in the agricultural businesses, commercial and industrial: His ships performed the traffic in goods imports and exports, with trade contacts with [[London]], [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]]. He also won the concession of the exploitation of seals and whales, whose leather in the first case, and oils have a strong demand abroad. He served this office for twelve years.&lt;ref name="LCD"&gt;{{cite news|author= Enrique Rodríguez Cuza, Fidel|date=March–April 2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3rE9Ik1V6a0C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=Francisco+Aguilar+y+Leal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zFrFYQdiXi&amp;sig=HFynknZZhR6n3heOT2g1nUIltCs&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=KYukTPqzD4aZ4.Ab7vIDgDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Francisco%20Aguilar%20y%20Leal&amp;f=false|title=Canarias – Uruguay – Canarias: el papel de los emigrantes canarios en el tejido empresarial de Canarias y Uruguay (Canary Islands - Uruguay - Canary Islands: the role of migrants canaries in the business of the Canary Islands and Uruguay) (In Spanish).|accessdate= September 29, 2010 &lt;!-- at 14:30 pm --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he was one of people those most fought for the release of Uruguay, presenting important services to the struggle for independence: He supported the Revolution of 1811 and be revealed in 1812 against the Luso-Brazilian domination. He paid the company of the Treinta y Tres (Thirty-Threean) and he led an army that participated in it. Later, between 1835 and 1840, he was Minister of Finance of the Republic. During these moments he fought in all the progressives works of Maldonado of his time, which promoted their port, agriculture and industry. He died in Montevideo in 1840.&lt;ref name="Emigración"/&gt;

== Personal life ==

'''G. Anne Nelson Richardson''' (born 1956) is a [[Rappahannock Tribe|Rappahannock]] woman, who was elected the first woman Chief to lead a tribe in Virginia since the 18th century.

== Biography ==

Nelson was born in 1956 to Chief and Mrs. Captain Nelson of [[Indian Neck, Virginia]].

Anne was elected Assistant Chief to her father in 1980. She served in that position for eighteen years.

In 1989, Anne helped to organize the [[United Indians of Virginia]], which was established as an intertribal organization represented by all tribal Chiefs.

In 1991, Richardson became executive director of Mattaponi-Pamunkey-Monacan, Inc., that provides training and employment services for [[Native American tribes in Virginia|Virginia Indians]].

In 1998, Anne was elected the first woman Chief to lead a tribe in Virginia since the 18th century, by the [[Rappahannock Tribe]]. She is a fourth generation chief in her family.  Under her tenure as Chief, in 1998, the Tribe purchased {{convert|119.5|acre|km2}} to establish a land trust, retreat center, and housing development. The Tribe also built their first model home and sold it to a tribal member in 2001. The Rappahannocks are currently engaged in a number of projects ranging from cultural and educational to social and economic development programs, all geared to strengthen and sustain their community.

In 2005, Chief Anne was ordained by Pastor Sally Beckman at Living Waters Fellowship. She, also, became chair of the Native American Employment and Training Council. She was elected as Chairman of the Council, working with the Secretary to further the goals of 'Indian Country through Labor Programs'.

In 2006, she was invited, along with other Virginia natives, to attend the various ceremonies leading up to the English 2007 events, commemorating the anniversary of the founding of the first permanent English settlement in America in [[Jamestown, Virginia]].  Also in 2006, Anne Richardson launched Restoring Nations International, a ministry whose mission is "to restore honor and human dignity by facilitating reconciliation and bringing healing to Native American and other indigenous nations around the world through ministering God's love, purpose and destiny for those nations."

Richardson was named one of the [[Virginia Women in History]] for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2006/richardson.htm|title=Virginia Women in History 2006 - G. Anne Nelson Richardson|work=virginia.gov|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]], China, he was known to the West as ''Howqua'' (the second). His father, Wu Guorong was also ''Howqua'' (the first) and was founder of the family company. Because his Chinese name was too difficult for western traders to pronounce,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} the name Howqua comes from his Chinese Business Name "浩官" ({{zh|poj=Hō-koaⁿ}}), very similar to a [[Doing business as|DBA]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:廣州十三行]]&lt;/ref&gt; He became rich on the trade between China and the [[British Empire]] in the middle of the 19th century during the [[First Opium War]]. Perhaps the wealthiest man in China during the nineteenth century, Howqua was the senior of the Hong merchants in Canton, one of the few authorized to trade silk and porcelain with foreigners. According to historic records,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;&lt;觸藩始末&gt;&gt; '''''The Start and End of Upsetting The Foreigners''''', Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; there was a fire in 1822 and many of the [[cohong]]s were burned down. The melted silver allegedly formed a little stream almost two miles in length.&lt;ref name="chinareviewnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.sina.com.tw"/&gt; Of the 3 million dollars of compensation that was required to pay the British from the [[Treaty of Nanking]], he single-handedly contributed one million, one third of the total sum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szdaj.gov.cn/dadg/rwzz/19.html 档案揭秘:被称为“天下第一大富翁”的伍秉鉴-欢迎进入深圳档案网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later died in [[Guangzhou|Canton]] the same year.

To this day, portraits of the pigtailed Howqua in his robes still hang in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport mansions]] built by U.S. merchants grateful for his assistance.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Legacy==
During his time as one of the Hong merchants in the Thirteen Factories, under the [[Canton System]], the Qing Dynasty saw a short period of trade prosperity. [[Guangzhou|Canton]] also became one of the most populated cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201e.htm|title=What Were the Largest Cities Throughout History?|website=Geography.about.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of then world-renowned firms including [[James Matheson]], [[William Jardine (merchant)|William Jardine]], [[Samuel Russell]] and [[Abiel Abbot Low]] all had a close relationship with Howqua. Following the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], which spelled the end of the Thirteen Factories, [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson &amp; Co]] continued to use "Ewo" as their Chinese name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cheong|first=W.E.|title=The Hong merchants of Canton: Chinese merchants in Sino-Western trade|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-0361-6}} p.122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3BjCHpQk5J8C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=ewo+canton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QzmfVaeXMV&amp;sig=0wawF7OPXXml_L8Vg_vBGlfTSBE&amp;hl=zh-CN&amp;ei=FyGiTbmICY_vcOizrPAB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ewo%20canton&amp;f=false Online version at Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the spelling '''Hu-Kwa''', his name and likeness are used for a brand of imported [[lapsang souchong]] smoked [[tea]].

'''Hugh Williamson''' (December 5, 1735 – May 22, 1819) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and [[politician]]. He is best known as a [[signatory]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]], and for representing [[North Carolina]] at the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].

Williamson was a scholar of international renown. His erudition had brought him into contact with some of the leading intellectuals of the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause and, in turn, with the ferment of political ideas that eventually found expression in the Constitution. During the [[American Revolution]], Williamson contributed his talents as physician and natural scientist to the American war effort. His experiences in that preeminent event of his generation transformed the genial scholar into an adroit politician and a determined leader in the campaign for effective national government. This leadership was evident not only at the Convention in [[Philadelphia]] but also, with telling effect, during the ratification debates in North Carolina.

Williamson's career demonstrates the rootlessness that characterized the lives of many Americans even in the 18th century. Born on the frontier, he lived for significant periods of his long life in three different regions of the country. This mobility undoubtedly contributed to the development of his nationalistic outlook, an outlook strengthened by wartime service with interstate military forces and reinforced by the interests of the planters and merchants that formed his North Carolina constituency. These experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.

==Early years==
Williamson was born in [[West Nottingham Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania|West Nottingham Township]], in what was then the frontier region of the [[Province of Pennsylvania]]. His fragile health as a youth weighed against his beginning a career in the family's clothier business. His parents instead sent him to Francis Alison's New London Academy and, in 1754, to the College of Philadelphia (today's [[University of Pennsylvania]]).  Williamson graduated in the school's first class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/williamson_hugh.html |title=Hugh Williamson (1735-1819), University of Pennsylvania University Archives |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 17, 1757,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k136k281320t8735/ |title=Hugh Williamson, M.D., LL.D. (1735–1819): Soldier, Surgeon, and Founding Father |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2016-06-25 |doi=10.1007/s00268-004-2069-8 |volume=29 |journal=World Journal of Surgery |pages=S80–S84}}&lt;/ref&gt; five days before his father died. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/cumberland/wills/willbka-b.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  After teaching at Philadelphia Academy, Williamson studied theology with his West Nottingham neighbor, the Rev. Samuel Finley (later president of the College of New Jersey, today's Princeton).He moved to [[Connecticut]] and obtained a preacher's license but his disillusionment with factional disputes within the Presbyterian Church and a resurgence of ill health led him to abandon a career in the ministry. Upon completing a master's degree at Philadelphia in 1760, Williamson joined his alma mater's faculty as a professor of [[mathematics]].

In another career shift four years later, Williamson turned to the study of medicine. After spending a year at the University of Edinburgh, he matriculated at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;Album Studiosorum Academiae Rheno-Traiectinae MDCXXXVI-MDCCCLXXVI, kol. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a brief thesis, and received his Medical Decree on August 6, 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Album Promotorum Academiae Rheno-Trajectinae 1636-1815, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English-speaking students of medicine at the University of Leyden / R.W. Innes Smith. - Edinburg/London : Oliver and Boyd, 1932, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Leon M. Contributions to a census of American Latin Prose, 1634-1800 - In: Humanistica Lovaniesia : Journal of Neo-Latin Studies, Vol. 31, 1982, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Philadelphia to open a private practice. At the same time, he pursued a number of independent scientific and educational projects, and his work in these areas eventually led to membership in the [[American Philosophical Society]] as well as acclaim in Europe's intellectual circles.

Interest in science and education indirectly led Williamson to politics and the Patriot cause. Sailing for England in 1773 to raise funds for a local educational project, Williamson stopped en route at Boston. There he witnessed the famous [[Boston Tea Party]], in which Patriots dressed as [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] destroyed a cargo of [[tea]] in protest over a newly enforced Parliamentary [[tax]] on imported commodities. On reaching [[London]] he was summoned before the Privy Council to testify on this act of rebellion and on colonial affairs in general.

Williamson came of age politically during this encounter. In response to questions by Council members, who were in the process of formulating punitive measures against [[Massachusetts]], he bluntly warned that repression would provoke rebellion. He then went on to express the argument that was becoming the core of the Patriot position: Americans were entitled to the full rights of Englishmen, including representation in the decisions of the English government. This testimony brought him to the attention of other Americans in London. A mutual interest in scientific matters cemented a solid working relationship with [[Benjamin Franklin]], and Williamson soon found himself joined with the famous American scientist and others in appealing for support among those Englishmen who, in opposition to their own government, sympathized with American claims. 
Williamson continued on to the Netherlands where, taking advantage of the cover afforded by his attendance at meetings on scientific and educational subjects, he organized the publication of pamphlets and other papers that supported the Patriot cause. While there he learned that the colonies had declared their independence. He rushed back to Philadelphia in early 1777 and volunteered for service in the Medical Department of the Continental Army. The Department had no opening at that time, so Williamson decided to form a partnership with a younger brother to import [[medicine]]s and other scarce items from the [[West Indies]] through the British [[blockade]]. Believing that he could best contribute to the war effort by using his contacts and reputation in this manner, Williamson made [[Edenton, North Carolina]], his base of operations. Settlement in North Carolina soon led to his establishing a medical practice to serve the planters and merchants of the region.

==Military physician==
These various activities brought Williamson to the attention of North Carolina's political leaders. Facing the threat of a British invasion of the region from the sea and bases in Florida, the state legislature voted to raise a force of 4,000 men to assist South Carolina. When [[Governor]] [[Richard Caswell]], with the rank of major general, took to the field at the head of these citizen-soldiers, he named Williamson to serve as the state's Physician and Surgeon General, a post Williamson held until the end of the war.

The capture of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1780 not only marked a stunning defeat for American forces, but also signaled the end of the first phase in a new British war strategy. Under this strategy British forces would continue to tie down Washington's main army in the north while a Royal army under General [[Charles Cornwallis]] would advance northward. Using [[Savannah, Georgia]] and Charleston as their bases of operations, the British expected their regular units to push through North Carolina and Virginia while a militia composed of local Loyalists secured areas captured by the regular forces. If successful, this strategy would have led to the conquest of the colonies from the south. To counter Cornwallis' efforts, the Continental Congress sent [[Horatio Gates]] to command a small force composed of a division of continentals, Caswell's units from North Carolina, and a group of hastily assembled Virginia [[militia]] units.

Gates attempted to attack the British advance base near [[Camden, South Carolina]], but his tired militia units, which were still forming when the battle began, were routed, and the Americans suffered another defeat. Williamson, who witnessed the disaster, volunteered to pass behind enemy lines to care for the American wounded. He spent two months on this mercy mission. When [[smallpox]] threatened the prison camp, he argued strenuously with Cornwallis and other British officers over the proper method to combat the disease. His perseverance and scientific reputation paid off. The British followed his advice, and an [[epidemic]] was averted.

In the fall of 1780 Williamson returned to the field. Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], Gates' replacement, had begun his brilliant campaign to recover the south through the joint efforts of continentals and militia. While his main force engaged the British in a series of battles, the militiamen concentrated on picking off small outposts and isolated enemy parties. [[Francis Marion]], nicknamed "Swamp Fox", and others who operated mainly in South Carolina are most remembered for this type of [[guerrilla warfare]], but North Carolina units also adopted these tactics. Williamson was attached to a force under Brigadier General [[Isaac Gregory]] whose mission was to limit British activity in eastern North Carolina. Gregory established his base in the vast reaches of the Dismal Swamp where he could pin the British down in Wilmington without jeopardizing his small force. Williamson's bold innovations in preventive medicine, especially his strenuous efforts to indoctrinate raw troops in the importance of sanitation and diet, kept the command virtually free of disease during the six months that it inhabited the swamp-—a rare feat in 18th-century warfare.

==Statesman==

In 1782 Williamson's neighbors elected him to the lower house of the North Carolina legislature, where he served for several terms. He sat on numerous committees, including those formed to regulate veterans' rights, and he authored the state's [[copyright]] law. His fellow legislators also chose Williamson to serve in the [[Continental Congress]] in 1782. Appointment to this national body represented a natural political progression for Williamson, who was evolving into a champion of [[federalism]]. His experiences during the Revolution, especially his exposure to the pressing need for interstate cooperation during the 1780 and 1781 campaigns in the Carolinas, had convinced him of the military importance of strong national government. This interest increased when he came to realize the economic benefits that might accrue from binding interstate association. In 1786 North Carolina chose Williamson to attend the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], a meeting called to settle economic questions affecting the middle Atlantic states. Although he arrived too late to play a role in the Maryland proceedings, he was prepared to discuss interstate issues the following year when his state appointed him as a representative at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.

Williamson, a faithful attendee at Convention sessions, lodged with [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], two of the country's best-known nationalist leaders. His intellectual stature and international background also propelled him into a leadership role in the North Carolina delegation. A capacity for hard work and his innate good humor made him invaluable to the Federalists as they worked out the many political compromises necessary for consensus on the new instrument of government. On 11 July 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania proposed the [[three fifths compromise]]. It failed to pass (4:6), but a substantially similar motion was passed two days later.  Williamson, like many other Founders, was opposed to the institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/williamson_hugh.html Hugh Williamson (1735-1819)], [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the Convention adjourned, Williamson wrote a series of public letters in defense of a strong federal system. These "Letters of Sylvius" addressed many of the practical concerns of his state, where the rural and frequently debt-ridden farmers favored minimal government regulations, while the mercantile-planter group from the seaboard region wanted an economy strictly regulated by a central government. Using simple examples, Williamson explained to both groups the dual dangers of [[inflation]]ary finances and of taxes that would stunt the growth of domestic manufacture. He exhorted North Carolinians to support the Constitution as the basis for their future prosperity. The ratification process, he explained, would decide whether the United States would remain a "system of patchwork and a series of expedients" or become "the most flourishing, independent, and happy nation on the face of the earth."

Following adjournment in Philadelphia, Williamson returned to New York to participate in the closing sessions of the Continental Congress and to serve as one of the agents settling North Carolina's accounts with that body. These duties caused him to miss the Hillsboro Convention, where North Carolina first considered and rejected the Constitution, but he played a major role at a second convention that met in Fayetteville in 1789. Here he participated in a successful effort to rally support for the Constitution.

[[File:WSTM nathanschneider 0031.jpg|thumb|Williamson's grave at [[Trinity Church Cemetery]].]]
Williamson's neighbors elected him to represent them in the first federal Congress. He served two terms before retiring and settling in New York City, where he continued to pursue a wide range of scholarly interests. He wrote extensively about his research, joined numerous learned societies, and contributed to many charities. He also served as one of the original trustees of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]].

[[Thomas Jefferson]] described Williamson's role at the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in the following terms: "he was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of an high degree of erudition."

Williamson married Maria Apthorpe in January 1789; she died after the birth of their second child in 1790.  They had two sons, both of whom died young (the older one at the age of 22 in 1811, the younger, shortly thereafter, according to Hosack's Memoir of Hugh Williamson). Williamson was a Presbyterian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pw/Hugh_Williamson.html |title=Hugh Williamson, Signer of the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Adherents.com |date=2005-11-19 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some sources have identified him as a Deist.&lt;ref&gt;Deism and Social Ethics: The Role of Religion in the Third Millennium - Page 67, Robert Corfe - 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Williamson died and was buried in New York City.

'''Joaquín Amaro Domínguez''' (August 16, 1889 &amp;ndash; March 15, 1952) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]] [[general]] and military reformer. He served as [[Secretariat of National Defense|Secretary of War]] in the [[Mexican Executive Cabinet|cabinets]] of [[President of Mexico|Presidents]] [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], [[Emilio Portes Gil]], and [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]], making him one of the longest-serving cabinet-level officials in [[Mexican history]]. His ambitious reforms of the fractious [[Mexican military]] transformed the armed forces from a political partisan to an armed force loyal to the president and government. He accomplished this "through a process of cultural reeducation that replaced an entrenched tradition of militarism with one emphasizing such values as discipline, duty, honor, and loyalty to the civilian government."&lt;ref name=Carriedo&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carriedo, Robert | title =The Man Who Tamed Mexico’s Tiger: General Joaquin Amaro And The Professionalization Of Mexico’s Revolutionary Army | version = | publisher =University of New Mexico | date =2005-05-01 | url = http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA444102&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-05 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Amaro was born in Corrales de Abrego in the [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of [[Municipality of Sombrerete|Sombrerete]], [[Zacatecas]], the first of Antonio Amaro and Angela Domínguez's ten children. His family was of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] ancestry, although they were probably not [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], as was widely assumed. While Amaro was still a child, the family moved to the nearby state of [[Durango]], where his father worked on an [[hacienda]]. He learned to read and write, although probably without the benefit of formal schooling. Beginning in 1908, he worked in the office of the Saucillo hacienda where his father was employed, assisting with [[bookkeeping]]. With two incomes, the family was able to enjoy a comfortable existence. In 1910, his father sold his possessions and gave the money to his eldest son, advising him, "go to Durango with your mother and siblings, work for Mr. Calderón [a local store-owner], learn the business, get to know the town, and when you feel able, open your own store."{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|p=26}} His father left for [[Torreón]] in November of that year, and although Amaro never saw him again, he read about his exploits with the revolutionary army of Colonel Luis Moya.

== Military career ==

===Early Revolution===
On February 28, 1911, Amaro enlisted in the [[Francisco Madero|Maderist]] army of General [[Domingo Arrieta]]. Shortly after Amaro enlisted, his father was killed in battle. After five months as a [[private (rank)|private]], he was promoted every subsequent month, attaining the rank of [[lieutenant]] by December.

As part of the army of Colonel Gertrudis G. Sánchez, whose forces Arrieta's had joined, Amaro fought against the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] in Morelos, engaging them at least nineteen times. In one of these engagements, the battle of Jojutla de Juárez, he earned the "''Cruz de Segunda Clase''," a heroism medal. From 1913 to 1914, he fought the federal troops under the command of [[Victoriano Huerta]], continuing all the while to rise in rank. By 1914 he had risen to the rank of general.

It was under the command of General Sánchez that Amaro developed the reputation of a fierce warrior. It was rumored that he wore an earring and used the [[battlecry]] "Here is the man of the pendant earring! Here is the Indian!" He also supposedly emulated the fighting style of the Yaqui people. He also developed the reputation of a harsh disciplinarian who occasionally used his [[riding crop]] to mete out corporal punishments to his subordinates. He may have even shot men in his charge or employ for disobeying orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Conventionalists v. Constitutionalists===
After the fall of Huerta, while still under the command of Sánchez, he briefly supported the [[Convention of Aguascalientes|conventionalist]] government of [[Eulalio Gutiérrez]], before breaking with Sánchez to ally with the [[Constitution of 1857|constitutionalist]] army of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Shortly after Sánchez and Amaro joined the Constitutionalists, Sánchez ordered Amaro to attack a column of troops commanded by General [[Francisco Murguía]], who, while also a Constitutionalists, was a rival of Sánchez. While initially successful, Murguía's troops eventually prevailed, and Murguía sought to have Amaro executed for [[treason]], a charge he narrowly escaped. Rather than damaging the reputation of Amaro, however, the incident did more to isolate Sánchez, who Amaro abandoned. The split finally came in 1915, when Amaro advanced the troops under his command on the [[Francisco Villa|Villista]] ''[[Division del Norte|División del Norte]]'', leaving Sánchez in Michoacán. By this time, he had already professed allegiance to General [[Álvaro Obregón]] and the carrancista government.

In April 1915, he led his troops, known as the "''Rayados''" ("striped ones"&amp;mdash;so-called because the only uniforms Obregón could provide were prison uniforms) to support Obregón's defeat of the villistas in the second [[Battle of Celaya]]. Following the battle, Obregón named him ''Comandante militar'' ("military commander") of the 5th Division of the Army of the Northwest, and he was charged of ridding Michoacán of villista influence. At the end of 1915, the area under his command was expanded to include Guanajuato and Querétaro.

In 1916, he again fought the zapatistas in Morelos and Guerrero. In 1917, he was placed under the command of Murguía, and led expeditions against the remaining villistas of Durango and Chihuahua.

===Rebellion against Carranza===
When Obregón proclaimed the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]] against Carranza in 1920, Amaro remained loyal to Obregón, and was rewarded with the rank of ''General de división'', the highest military rank. He became chief military officer of the third military zone, which included the states of Coahuila, Nuevo León and San Luis Potosí. In this capacity, he undertook to professionalize the unorganized ranks under him, gaining experience that would later benefit his reorganization of the entire military.

On September 3, 1921, while chief of operations of the third military zone, Amaro wed Elisa Izaguirre, originally of [[Morelia, Michoacán]]. There the couple had two children, Joaquín and Leonor.

He later became commander of the seventh military zone, which comprised Nuevo León. There he put down the July rebellion of Pablo González. When in 1922 political unrest threatened to 
destabilize Coahuila, Amaro positioned his troops to block the occupation of the state legislature and to protect the governor's palace. In 1923, he was sent to maintain order during Nuevo León's gubernatorial elections. Following a series of violent incidents, Amaro disarmed groups of rural fighters.

After the assassination of Pancho Villa in July 1923, Amaro was widely suspected as one of the planners of the operation.  Today, most historians attribute Villa's death to a well planned conspiracy, most likely initiated by then Minister of War Plutarco Elías Calles, who ordered Amaro to give support to the assassins.&lt;ref&gt;McLynn, Frank, ''Villa and Zapata'', Basic Books (2000), pg. 393&lt;/ref&gt;  Amaro was later instrumental in freeing [[Jesús Salas Barraza]], the leader of the group of assassins, from jail.

Amaro never wavered from his support for Calles and Obregón, and he fully shared Calles' hatred of the clergy.  Calles gave Amaro full support in continuing the latter's plan to reform the Mexican armed forces along anti-clerical and populist lines: &lt;blockquote&gt;I have fought without rest [...] against clericalism, large landowners, the militarism of the ex-Federals, the Spanish, and in general all those that do not contribute to the
enrichment of our beloved homeland and the betterment of the working
class.{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|p=46}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite these sentiments, neither Calles nor Amaro hesitated in taking action against the extreme left-wing.  When José Guadalupe Rodríguez tried to organise "soldier soviets" on the Bolshevist pattern, he was promptly arrested and shot along with some of his soldiers.&lt;ref name="Fehrenbach"&gt;[[T. R. Fehrenbach|Fehrenbach, T.R.]], ''Fire and Blood: A History of Mexico'', Da Capo Press (1995), pp. 572-572&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, when a peasant and labor bloc of the Communist International was formed under the artist [[Diego Rivera]], it was forcibly disbanded.&lt;ref name="Fehrenbach"/&gt;  Many on the extreme left were sent to the [[Marias Islands]] penal colony.&lt;ref name="Fehrenbach"/&gt;

===Delahuertist rebellion===
In 1923, Amaro's chief of staff José Álvarez learned of the plot between generals Enrique Estrada, Guadalupe Sánchez, and Fortunato Maycotte to overthrow Obregón. Álvarez immediately returned to Nuevo León and informed Amaro of the plot, who promptly related the information to Obregón. The conspirators drafted Adolfo de la Huerta, then-Minister of Finance, to run for president against Plutarco Elias Calles, Obregón's chosen successor. Facing a rebellion with armies in the North, South, and East, Obregón relied on loyal generals such as Amaro to block rebel access to resources and the northern border and to put down the insurrection. Amaro, aided by General [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], battled Estrada's forces, defeating them in the decisive battle of Ocotlán. Three days after the battle, Amaro's troops occupied Guadalajara, where Estrada's operation had been based. The rebellion crushed, the 1924 Mexican election was carried out peacefully.

== Post-war career ==
Following the election of Calles, Amaro was appointed Undersecretary of War. Francisco Serrano having been sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission late in Obregón's presidency, the Secretariat was unfilled. Calles may have been waiting to secure the support of generals Eugenio Martínez and Arnulfo Gómez, who were also potential candidates for the post. While undersecretary, Amaro initiated a series of legal reforms to purge the armed forces of "the germ of immorality and corruption."{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|p=115}} After an initial convention of important military figures, the Commission for Studies and Reforms of Military Laws and Regulations was formed. Ten months later, four new laws were promulgated.

===Amaro's four laws===
The first, the Law of Discipline, was divided into three sections: General Duties, Corrective Discipline, and Court of Honor. The first three articles of the General Duties defined military duty in terms of "self-sacrifice, loyalty, guardianship, and adherence to the law."{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|p=120}} The subsequent articles dealt with specific issues. One clarified the officer's duty to maintain order within his ranks; another prohibited soldiers from complaining about orders. One article prohibited servicemembers from interfering in politics. The final articles concerned decorum, and required subordinates to salute and give up their seats to superiors.

The Corrective Discipline section described the circumstances in which soldiers could be arrested for breaking the law, and required that such arrests be recorded in the offender's file.

The Court of Honor section was written for people who committed offenses that threatened the reputation of a unit or of the "dignity of the military." It established a system of courts martial to punish drunkenness, gambling, mismanagement of funds, and negligence. Punishments for those found guilty ranged from transfer to demotion to imprisonment.

The second law, the Law of Retirements and Pensions, allowed servicemembers who had given twenty to thirty-five years of service to retire at will. It also required retirement at a certain age that was dependent on rank. Finally, it provided for pensions for disabled servicemen and their families.

The third law, the Law of Promotions and Rewards, set up two distinct rubrics for promotion: one for peacetime and one for wartime. Peacetime promotions were tied directly to military education. Wartime promotions could be granted for heroic actions such as preventing enemy capture of artillery pieces, and could only be given by high-ranking officers. These promotions had to be approved by higher bodies. These reforms were an effort to end the practice of opportunistic and haphazard promotions which had inflated the number of generals in Mexico's officer corps during the Revolution.

The purpose of the fourth law, the Organic Law, was to organize the armed services. The first section sought to redefine the relationship between generals and the soldiers under them, demanding that all personnel be loyal to the nation and the constitution and take their orders from the President or his designees.

It further delineated the five military branches: high command, combat arms, auxiliary services, special corps, and for the first time, military education establishments, and specified the structures of each. It stratified servicemembers into three classifications: active, reserve, and retired. Another section of the law structured the navy.

===Amaro as Secretary of War===
Amaro was appointed Secretary of War by President Calles on July 27, 1925. Upon his appointment to the Secretariat, Amaro moved to Rancho de la Hormiga, a 40,468 square kilometer (ten acre) ranch that later became the [[presidential palace]] [[Los Pinos]]. There his children Guillermo, Manuel, and Elisa were born. He installed recreational facilities such as stables, polo fields, and tennis courts, as well as a military school at the ranch.

Prior to his appointment as Undersecretary of War, Amaro had laid plans for a Grand Military Academy of the Army. He made arrangements for the government to purchase to tracts of land, but the school never materialized. Rather, he focused his efforts on the [[Heroic Military Academy (Mexico)|Heroic Military Academy]].  Despite its excellent reputation, by the end of the Revolution, the College was in a state of disrepair. On September 30, 1925, Amaro shut it down for a major overhaul that took ten months. In addition to new facilities, it also boasted a new curriculum that emphasized civic and moral virtues. Admission requirements were put into place, and included letters of recommendation that could vouch for an applicant's moral character.

Amaro's efforts to reform the Mexican military and society extended beyond the realm of military education: he also founded publications that combatted the influence of the Catholic Church and of [[latifundista|large landowners]] in the public consciousness. He had already founded two publications, ''Acción'' and ''El Agrarista'', as well as publishing a tract entitled ''El Gato'' in the early 1920s. However, 1925 saw a large increase in the number of military journals published in Mexico. Those already in existence, such as the ''[[Revista del Ejército y de la Marina]]'' (Magazine of the Army and the Navy), took a new editorial stance under the direction of Professor Ignacio Richkarday, who Amaro had appointed editor, to moralize the army. While ''Revista'' was aimed at the officer corps, Amaro founded ''El Soldado'', which emphasized the same themes, as a supplement for enlisted men. 1926 saw the founding of two more publications, ''Revista del Heróico Colegio Militar'' and ''Gladiador''.

In 1927, Generals Francisco Serrano and Arnulfo Gómez conspired with General Eugenio Martínez to seize Calles, Obregón, and Amaro in hopes of igniting a rebellion against the reelection of Obregón. Martínez informed Calles of the plot before it could be enacted, and Serrano and Gómez were caught and executed.

Although Amaro sought to reform all branches of the Mexican military, he remained a political revolutionary general of the old school.  As an army general, he understood little or nothing about aviation.  He was slow to advance the progress of the [[Mexican Air Force]], which had only three squadrons of obsolete aircraft during Amaro's tenure as Minister of War.

When President Obregón was assassinated by pro-clergy forces sixteen days after his 1928 re-election, many generals and other important figures in Mexican politics urged Amaro to run for the office. He always politely declined, stating that he had "never thought to dedicate [his] activities to politics."{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|p=176}} In February 1929, Amaro was injured during a game of fronton. He took a leave of absence from the Secretariat to seek medical attention at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. During his three-month convalescence, which left him with a glass eye, Calles assumed the Secretariat, in which capacity he put down the Escobar rebellion against Emilio Portes Gil, who had been appointed interim president in the wake of Obregon's assassination.

Upon his return to Mexico and the Secretariat in May, he found a situation in which Calles was still attempting to control national politics from behind the scenes. Pascual Ortiz Rubio, Portes Gil's successor, was suspicious of Amaro, as was Calles. Calles, purporting to have received information that Amaro was planning on assassinating him or overthrowing Ortiz Rubio, informed the President of the alleged plot. Ortiz Rubio deferred to Calles to take care of the situation, and the ''Jefe Máximo'' met with three other cabinet officials, convincing them to resign so as to make it appear that the "cabinet crisis" did not center around Amaro. They agreed, and the following day, Calles, Amaro, and the other three secretarys met at Amaro's estate. There, all four cabinet ministers agreed to resign.

Amaro was succeeded by Calles, who appointed him director of the [[Heroic Military Academy (Mexico)|Heroic Military Academy]].

===Target of Rumors===
Amaro's military reforms cut the Mexican military budget from one-third to one-quarter of the total Mexican government budget, and they resulted in the dismissal of numerous junior officers. The reforms, his involvement in suppressing leftists and the now-confirmed suspicion of his role in Pancho Villa's assassination, made Amaro very unpopular in some circles and a target of vicious, false rumors. One example is the tale that Amaro sent Captain [[Emilio Carranza]] a telegram ordering Carranza on July 13, 1928 to begin immediately a non-stop flight from New York City to Mexico City, which ended with the captain's fatal crash in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. However, contemporary news reports in the Evening Courier, Camden, NJ and New York Times show the story of the "fateful telegram" to be a fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;"Mexican Lindy Killed As Plane Falls in South Jersey Pines During Storm, " Evening Courier, July 14, 1928 (Camden, NJ)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"Carranza Killed In Crash As He Flies Into Storm In Mexico Hop," The New York Times, July 14, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the story that Amaro shot and killed a groom whom disobeyed his order to walk his polo pony and instead rode it to the stables, which the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico and his military attache passed to the Department of State.{{sfn|Carriedo|2005|loc=p. 33 &amp; 36}} However, there is good reason to believe that Ambassabor James R. Sheffield loathed the Mexican Revolutionary leaders and would have passed on any rumor to discredit them regardless of its veracity. He used racial stereotypes to describe them, calling Calles "an Armenian and Indian" and "Amaro, Secretary of War, a pure blooded Indian and very cruel." &lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Buchenau, Plutarco Elias Calles and the Mexican Revolution 117-18 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Amaro sought to create a Superior War College along the lines of [[France]]'s [[École Supérieure de Guerre]] to train an elite group of officers. To this end he sent a number of generals to study the militaries and military academies of European and South American states. Amaro led the Heroic Military Academy from 1931 until 1935, and directed military education for the Secretariat of War from 1931 to 1936.

During [[World War II]], he was responsible for defending the region of the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] aggressions.

==Legacy==
Amaro died in 1952 and was buried in the [[Panteón Francés|Panteón Francés de la Piedad]]. In 1966, his body was exhumed and reburied in Panteón Francés de San Joaquín. In the 1960s, a statue of Amaro on horseback was erected in [[Mexico City]]'s [[Chapultepec Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21062">A number of individuals whose backgrounds are important to the understanding of the '''[[Olympus scandal]]''', which was precipitated on 14 October 2011 when the company's British-born chief executive, [[Michael Woodford (executive)|Michael Woodford]] was suddenly ousted as chief executive of [[Olympus Corporation]]. He had been only two weeks into the job when he exposed "one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese corporate history", according to ''[[the Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=wsj20111107&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111107-719199.html "Olympus President: Will Do Utmost To Avoid Delisting"] (subscription). ''The Wall Street Journal''. Dow Jones. 7 November 2011. Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The US$2.2&amp;nbsp;billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, and the US$687&amp;nbsp;million paid to a middle-man were questioned. After initial denials, the company admitted that prior acquisitions had been used to cover investment losses. As regulators and police on three continents begin to investigate and trace the movement of the money, there was speculation that organised crime was involved in the missing millions. Olympus defended itself against allegations of impropriety, citing its Audit Board's view that "no dishonesty or illegality is found in the transaction itself, nor any breach of obligation to good management or any systematic errors by the directors recognised."

=== Tsuyoshi Kikukawa ===
Kikukawa, Tsuyoshi "Tom" (菊川剛), born on  27 February 1941, was educated at [[Keio University]], where he graduated in Political Science, Dept. of Law in March 1963.&lt;ref name=ngmf20111008&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63UKOpTot?url=http://www.ngmf.com/speakers/17.html "Profile: Tsuyoshi Kikukawa"]. 13th Nikkei Global Management Forum, 24–25 October 2011. Archived from [http://www.ngmf.com/speakers/17.html the original] on 26 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His management style is regarded as a 'Western', and is credited with having considerably changed the corporate culture of Olympus.

Kikukawa joined Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. (as Olympus Corporation was then known) in October 1964. In June 1993, he became Managing Director responsible for Public Relations &amp; Advertising Dept. and DI Project and was made director and member of the main board.&lt;ref name=ngmf20111008/&gt; Kikukawa spent considerable time in the United States, where he foresaw the demand for the digital SLR. He is credited with the company's strategy in digital photography &amp;ndash; he fought for commitment by Olympus to enter the market in high-resolution photographic products. As a result of his efforts, Olympus released an 810,000-pixel digital camera for the mass market in 1996, when the resolution of rivals' offerings was less than half. The very next year, Olympus hit the market with a 1.41 million pixel camera. By 2001, the company's annual turnover from digital photography was in excess of ¥100 billion.&lt;ref name=nikkei20111031&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63RvtFax0?url=http://business.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/eng/20111031/223514/ "Dismissed CEO Turns Focus on Troubles at Olympus"], ''Nikkei Business''. 31 October 2011.

Kikukawa remained chairman when Woodford was promoted to CEO on 30 September 2011. Kikukawa re-assumed the titles of president and CEO two weeks later when Woodford was ousted.

'''Maria Goeppert Mayer''' (June 28, 1906 – February 20, 1972) was a German-born American [[theoretical physicist]], and [[Nobel laureate]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]] for proposing the [[nuclear shell model]] of the [[atomic nucleus]]. She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics, the first being [[Marie Curie]].

A graduate of the [[University of Göttingen]], Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.

Maria Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]] and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Strict rules against [[nepotism]] prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on [[double beta decay]] in 1935. In 1937, she moved to [[Columbia University]], where she took an unpaid position. During [[World War II]], she worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] at Columbia on [[isotope separation]], and with  [[Edward Teller]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] on the development of the [[Teller's "Super" bomb]].

After the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the [[University of Chicago]] (where Teller and her husband worked) and a senior physicist at the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with [[J. Hans D. Jensen]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

== Early life ==
Maria Göppert was born on June 28, 1906, in [[Kattowitz]] (now Katowice, [[Poland]]), a city in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the only child of [[:de:Friedrich Göppert|Friedrich Göppert]] and his wife Maria née Wolff.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} In 1910, she moved with her family to [[Göttingen]] when her father,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=311}} a sixth-generation university professor,{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=236}} was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the [[University of Göttingen]].{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} Goeppert was closer to her father than her mother. "Well, my father was more interesting," she later explained. "He was after all a scientist."{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=312}}

Göppert was educated at the ''Höhere Technische'' in Göttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=23}} In 1921, she entered the ''Frauenstudium'', a private high school run by [[suffragettes]] that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the ''[[abitur]]'', the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=233–234}}

In the Spring of 1924, Göppert entered the University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, [[Emmy Noether]], but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=250}}

Instead, Goeppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a [[Ph.D.]] In her 1930 doctoral thesis&lt;ref name=Goeppert-Mayer_1931&gt;{{cite journal | author =Goeppert-Mayer M | title = Über Elementarakte mit zwei Quantensprüngen | journal = Annals of Physics | year = 1931 | volume = 9 | issue =3| pages = 273–295 | bibcode=1931AnP...401..273G | doi = 10.1002/andp.19314010303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she worked out the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} [[Eugene Wigner]] later described the thesis as "a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=314}} At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a [[europium]]-doped crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. |last=Kaiser |first2=C.G.B. |last2=Garrett |title=Two-photon excitation in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229–232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }}&lt;/ref&gt; To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the "GM". One GM is 10&lt;sup&gt;−50&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s photon&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA473083 |title=Two-Photon Absorption Measurements: Establishing Reference Standards. |date=June 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 14, 2013 |publisher=[[Australian National University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her examiners were three [[Nobel prize]] winners: [[Max Born]], [[James Franck]] and [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] (in 1954, 1925, and 1928, respectively).{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=264}}

On January 19, 1930, Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]], an American Rockefeller fellow who was one of James Franck's assistants.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Maria Goeppert-Mayer | url=http://www.epigenesys.eu/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/811-maria-goeppert-mayer |publisher=EpiGeneSys | accessdate=September 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had met when Mayer had boarded with the Goeppert family.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=258–259}}  The couple moved to Mayer's home country of the United States, where he had been offered a position as associate professor of chemistry at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=265}}  They had two children, Maria Ann (who later married [[Donat Wentzel]]) and Peter Conrad.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}

== United States ==
Strict rules against [[nepotism]] prevented Johns Hopkins University from hiring Goeppert Mayer as a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wigner, Eugene P.|authorlink=Eugene Wigner|title=Maria Goeppert Mayer|journal=Physics Today|date=May 1972|volume=25|issue=5|pages=77–79|doi=10.1063/1.3070875|bibcode = 1972PhT....25e..77W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules, created at many universities to prevent patronage, had by this time lost their original purpose and were primarily used to prevent the employment of women married to faculty members.{{sfn|Simon|Clark|Tifft|1966|p=344}} She was given a job as an assistant in the Physics Department working with German correspondence, for which she received a very small salary, a place to work and access to the facilities. She taught some courses,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}{{sfn|Ferry|2003|pp=40–45}} and published an important &lt;!--landmark--&gt; paper on [[double beta decay]] in 1935.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=315}}

|quote=Some [schools] even condescended to give her work, though they refused to pay her, and the topics were typically 'feminine', such as figuring out what causes colors … the University of Chicago finally took her seriously enough to make her a professor of physics. Although she got her own office, the department still didn't pay her … When the Swedish academy announced in 1963 that she had won her profession's highest honor, the San Diego newspaper greeted her big day with the headline "S.D.

There was little interest in [[quantum mechanics]] at Johns Hopkins but Goeppert Mayer worked with [[Karl Herzfeld]] in this area. They collaborated on a number of papers, including a paper with Herzfeld's student A.L. Sklar on the spectrum of [[benzene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/research-profile/laureate-goeppert-mayer#page=all|title=Research Profile – Maria Goeppert Mayer|publisher=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goeppert‐Mayer|first=M.|last2=Sklar|first2=A.L.|date=1938|title=Calculations of the Lower Excited Levels of Benzene|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=6|issue=10|pages=645–652|doi=10.1063/1.1750138|issn=0021-9606}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the ''Handbuch der Physik''. This ended when the [[NSDAP]] came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}{{sfn|Ferry|2003|pp=40–45}}

Joe Mayer was fired in 1937. He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=283}} Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=284}} Mayer took up a position at [[Columbia University]], where the chairman of the Physics Department, [[George B. Pegram]], arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with [[Harold Urey]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the [[valence shell]] of the undiscovered [[transuranic elements]]. Using the [[Thomas–Fermi model]], she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the [[rare earth elements]]. This proved to be correct.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=317}}

== Manhattan Project ==
[[File:HD.3A.050 (10481713035).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Goeppert Mayer]]
In December 1941,  Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part-time at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in [[World War II]], she joined the [[Manhattan Project]]. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of [[uranium hexafluoride]] and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of [[separation of isotopes by laser excitation]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}

Through her friend [[Edward Teller]], Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the  properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the [[Teller's "Super" bomb]], the wartime program for the development of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}} In February 1945, Joe was sent to the [[Pacific War]], and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller's group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected, and they returned to New York together in July 1945.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=296–299}}

In February 1946, Joe became a professor in the Chemistry Department and the new [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]] at the [[University of Chicago]], and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of physics at the school. When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]] was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the theoretical physics division. She responded "I don't know anything about nuclear physics."{{sfn|Schiebinger|1999|p=59}}  She programmed the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]'s [[ENIAC]] to solve criticality problems for a [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] using the [[Monte Carlo method]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=319–320}}

During her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s, Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]], which she published in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |date=April 1950 |last=Goeppert-Mayer |first=Maria |title=Nuclear configurations in the spin-orbit coupling model.

II. Theoretical Considerations |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.22|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78...22M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations. These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called ''[[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]'': 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. Enrico Fermi provided a critical insight by asking her: "Is there any indication of [[spin orbit coupling]]?"{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=322}} She realised that this was indeed the case, and postulated that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=320-321}}&lt;ref name="nndb" /&gt; She described the idea as follows:
{{quote|Think of a room full of waltzers. Suppose they go round the room in circles, each circle enclosed within another. Then imagine that in each circle, you can fit twice as many dancers by having one pair go clockwise and another pair go counterclockwise. Then add one more variation; all the dancers are spinning twirling round and round like tops as they circle the room, each pair both twirling and circling. But only some of those that go counterclockwise are twirling counterclockwise. The others are twirling clockwise while circling counterclockwise. The same is true of those that are dancing around clockwise: some twirl clockwise, others twirl counterclockwise.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=316}}}}

Three German scientists, [[Otto Haxel]], J. Hans D. Jensen, and [[Hans Suess]], were also working on solving the same problem, and arrived at the same conclusion independently. While their results were announced in an issue of the [[Physical Review]] before Goeppert Mayer in June 1949, Goeppert Mayer's work was received for review in February 1949, while the work of the German authors was received later in April 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=75 |issue=11  |pages=1766 |date=June 1949|last=Haxel |first=Otto |authorlink=Otto Haxel |last2=Jensen |first2=J.

Hans Jensen co-authored a book with Goeppert Mayer in 1950 titled ''Elementary Theory of Nuclear Shell Structure''.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=323}} In 1963, Goeppert Mayer, Jensen, and Wigner shared the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] "for their discoveries concerning nuclear shell structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maria Goeppert Mayer – facts |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1963/mayer-facts.html |work=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1963 |publisher=NobelPrize.org |accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second female Nobel laureate in physics, after [[Marie Curie]],{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=87}} and would be the last for over half a century, until [[Donna Strickland]] was awarded the prize in 2018.&lt;ref name="sandiegouniontribune2018" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
In 1960, Goeppert Mayer was appointed full professor of physics at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Although she suffered from a stroke shortly after arriving there, she continued to teach and conduct research for a number of years.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=322–323}}{{sfn|Ferry|2003|pp=84–86}} She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goeppert Mayer died in [[San Diego, California]], on February 20, 1972, after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] that had struck her the previous year left her [[coma]]tose. She was buried at [[El Camino Memorial Park]] in San Diego.&lt;ref name="nndb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/847/000099550/ |title=Maria Goeppert-Mayer |publisher= Soylent Communications |accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her death, the [[Maria Goeppert Mayer Award]] was created by the [[American Physical Society]] to honor young female physicists at the beginning of their careers. Open to all female physicists who hold Ph.D.s, the winner receives money and the opportunity to give guest lectures about her research at four major institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/awards/goeppert-mayer.cfm |title=Maria Goeppert Mayer Award |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=September 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of her former universities also honor her.

'''Nicolas Ferry''' (known as '''Bébé) '''(1741–1764) was a [[France|French]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] who became renowned throughout Europe as the [[court dwarf]] of King [[Stanisław Leszczyński]].

==Early life and discovery==
Nicolas Ferry was born on 14 October 1741 in [[Plaine, Bas-Rhin|Plaine]], [[Bas-Rhin]], [[France]], the son of a farmer and his wife.  He was unusually small at birth and continued to grow slowly, although all contemporary sources and surviving portraits agree that his limbs and features were in proportion to his height ("proportionate dwarfism").  His fame spread, and in 1746 he was visited by ladies from the court of Stanisław, who was also the Duke of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and maintained a court at [[Lunéville]], although he was no longer King of [[Poland]].  Stanisław sent his physician to examine the child, who was now five years old and approximately 24&amp;nbsp;inches (60&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, and subsequently sent for him.  He offered Ferry's parents money in return for their son, who was to be maintained and educated in the Leszczyński household as the court dwarf.

==Life at court==
At court Ferry quickly acquired the nickname Bébé ("Baby"). He was given to the queen as a birthday present in 1747, and, after her death in 1748, he became the property of her cousin, the [[Princesse de Talmont]]. He had tutors, but proved to be of relatively low intelligence and is reported never to have learned to read or write.   A small wooden house was built for him in one of the halls of the [[Chateau de Lunéville]], and he was spoiled and indulged by his master and the entire court.  He played practical jokes on visitors and often behaved very badly, but he was the king's favourite and a great attraction.&lt;ref name="Bondeson1" /&gt;  Those entertained by his antics included the [[Louis François Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu|Duc du Richelieu]] and [[Voltaire]].

In 1759 the Polish dwarf [[Józef Boruwłaski]] visited the court.  He was a witty, urbane young man of 20, shorter than Ferry and well versed in court manners.  Unflattering comparisons were drawn, and Ferry became so angry that he attacked Boruwłaski and tried to throw him onto the fire.  The indulgent Stanisław ordered Ferry beaten for this outrage, reportedly to his severe shock and mortification.

Ferry was also compared unfavourably with Boruwłaski by the aristocratic writer, scientist and physician [[Louis-Élisabeth de La Vergne de Tressan]], who visited the Lunéville court to receive an honour from Stanisław.  De Tressan later delivered a paper to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] likening Ferry to an animal in comparison with the intelligent, well-educated Polish dwarf.

Ferry remained at Stanisław's court throughout his life, eventually growing to a height of 34&amp;nbsp;inches (86&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=Davson /&gt;

==Decline and death==
Ferry's health declined in his late teens.  He developed a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]] and had difficulty walking, and he suffered [[wasting]] of the soft tissues and signs of premature aging.&lt;ref name="Bondeson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bondeson|first=Jan|title=The Two-headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2004|pages=198–203|isbn= 978-0-8014-8958-7
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLGkqgeasHUC&amp;pg=PA204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually he became [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]] and a chronic invalid, and died on 8 June 1764 aged 22.  His skeleton was prepared and mounted for study, and is currently kept at the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris. The rest of his remains were buried in the church at Lunéville; when the church was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]], Ferry's inscribed mausoleum was preserved and is now at the Chateau de Lunéville.  Some of Ferry's outfits are preserved in the historical museum at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and there are a number of wax statues of him still in existence.  A unique [[Luneville Faience]] statue of Ferry, 22&amp;nbsp;inches (56&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, modelled from life, was kept at the Chateau de Lunéville, but was destroyed in a fire in 2003.&lt;ref name="Davson"&gt;Foster, Kate (Lady Davson) (2004). [http://www.thefrenchporcelainsociety.com/asp4/pdf/spr04.pdf IN MEMORIAM BÉBÉ alias Nicolas Ferry]. ''The French Porcelain Society Spring 2004 newsletter'', pp 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 and 2008, French researchers published detailed studies of Ferry's skeletal remains, with particular attention to his jaws and facial bones.  They concluded that Ferry suffered from a rare genetic form of primordial dwarfism characterised by small, abnormal teeth without roots, and dubbed the condition ''NMOSR''.&lt;ref name="Actes 2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Granat, Jean |author2=Peyre, Évelyne |last-author-amp=yes |title=Bébé, entre norme et pathologie, biométrie d'un nain (XVIIIe siècle) |journal=Actes.

==Death==
Beich died on October 16, 1991, drowning in [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|Sankt Jørgens Lake]] in the center of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="Ole Beich Politiken"/&gt; Not long before, on August 19, Guns N' Roses had performed in the city.  His family believe that he became depressed after leaving Guns N' Roses in 1985 and was heavily abusing drugs before returning to Denmark in 1988.  Heroin, and a [[blood alcohol content]] of .148, are thought to have contributed to his drowning, but his family still believes it was suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://underholdning.tv2.dk/2016-04-08-ole-var-en-del-af-guns-n-roses-musikerven-fortaeller-om-den-vilde-tid-i-la |title=Ole var en del af Guns N' Roses: Musikerven fortæller om den vilde tid i L.A. |last1=Bleeg |first1=Maria Thuesen |last2=Mathiasen |first2=Marie Holm |date=April 8, 2016 |website=TV2.DK |access-date=May 12, 2018 |language=DA |trans-title=Ole was part of Guns N 'Roses: The music cell tells about the wild time in L.A. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412043956/http://underholdning.tv2.dk/2016-04-08-ole-var-en-del-af-guns-n-roses-musikerven-fortaeller-om-den-vilde-tid-i-la |archivedate=April 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert-michels.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Michels]]
'''Robert Michels''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɪçəls|lang}}; 9 January 1876, [[Cologne]], [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] – 3 May 1936, [[Rome]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Italy|Italian]] [[sociologist]] who contributed to [[elite theory]] by describing the political behavior of intellectual elites. He belonged to the [[Italian school of elitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Nye, ''The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels'', Sage, 1977, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Chambliss (ed.), ''Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia'', Routledge, 2013, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his book ''[[Political Parties (book)|Political Parties]]'', published in 1911, which contains a description of the "[[iron law of oligarchy]]." He was a friend and disciple of [[Max Weber]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Achille Loria]]. Politically, he moved from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] to the [[Italian Socialist Party]], adhering to the Italian [[revolutionary syndicalist]] wing and later to [[Italian Fascism]], which he saw as a more democratic form of [[socialism]]. His ideas provided the basis of [[moderation theory]] which delineates the processes through which radical political groups are incorporated into the existing political system.

==Biography==
Michels born to a wealthy [[Germans|German]] family, studied in [[England]], [[Paris]] (at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]), and at universities in [[Munich]], [[Leipzig]] (1897), [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1898), and [[Turin]]. He became a [[Socialist]] while teaching at the [[University of Marburg]] and became active in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] for whom he was an unsuccessful candidate in the [[German federal election, 1903]]. In Italy, he associated with [[:it:sindacalismo rivoluzionario#Il sindacalismo rivoluzionario in Italia|Italian revolutionary syndicalism]], a leftist branch of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI). He left both parties in 1907.&lt;ref name="PC71"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=Philip|date=August 1971|title=Robert Michels's Political Parties in Perspective|journal=Journal of Politics|publisher=University of Chicago Press {{Subscription required}}|volume=33|issue=3|pages=777–778|jstor=2128281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He achieved international recognition for his historical and sociological study, ''Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie. Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens'', which was published in 1911;  its title in English is ''[[Political Parties (book)|Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy]]''. In it, he presented his "[[Iron law of oligarchy]]" theory that political parties, including those considered socialist, cannot be democratic because they quickly transform themselves into bureaucratic oligarchies.

Michels was considered a brilliant pupil of [[Max Weber]], who began publishing his writings in the ''[[Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik]]'' in 1906&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scaff|first=Lawrence|date=May 1981|title=Max Weber and Robert Michels|journal=American Journal of Sociology|publisher=University of Chicago Press {{Subscription required}}|volume=86|issue=6|page=1269|jstor=2778815|doi=10.1086/227385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed him as co-editor in 1913, but they disagreed over Michels' opposition to [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="PC71"/&gt;

Michels criticized what he perceived to be [[Karl Marx]]'s [[materialistic]] [[determinism]]. Michels borrowed from [[Werner Sombart]]'s historical methods. Because Michels admired Italian culture and was prominent in the [[social sciences]], he was brought to the attention of [[Luigi Einaudi]] and [[Achille Loria]]. They succeeded in procuring for Michels a professorship at the [[University of Turin]], where he taught [[economics]], [[political science]] and [[socioeconomics]] until 1914. He then became professor of economics at the [[University of Basel]], Switzerland, a post he held until 1928.&lt;ref name="CA04"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3412600198.html|title=Michels, Robert 1876-1936|date=January 2004|work=Contemporary Authors {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 he joined the [[Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]], former director of the Italian Socialist Party's newspaper "[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|''Avanti!'']]". Michels was convinced that the direct link between [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[charisma]] and the working class was in some way the best means to realize a real lower social class government without political bureaucratic mediation. In 1928, he became professor of economics and the history of doctrines at the [[University of Perugia]]&lt;ref name="CA04"/&gt; and occasionally lectured in [[Rome]] where he died on May 3, 1936.

[[File:robin-ramsay-lobster.jpg|thumb|right|Robin Ramsay in 2007]]
'''Robin Ramsay''' (born 1948, [[Edinburgh]], Scotland) is a Scottish [[author]], and co-founder and [[editing|editor]] of the magazine, ''[[Lobster (magazine)|Lobster]]''. Ramsay writes about politics and conspiracy theories. His books have been published by [[HarperCollins]] and [[The Pocket Essentials|Pocket Essentials]]. His writings have resulted in him receiving death threats from the fascist group [[Combat 18]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Elliott, "New Labour unshelled", ''Hull Daily Mail'', 1 June 1998, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsay studied at [[Stirling University]] but left after a term and moved to [[London]]. He later took a degree at [[Hull University]]. While there, he became interested in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].

While investigating the case Ramsay met fellow Kennedy assassination enthusiast Stephen Dorril and together they started a magazine about [[parapolitics (disambiguation)|parapolitics]]. ''[[Lobster (magazine)|Lobster]]'' first appeared in September 1983 as a 24-page [[ISO 216|A5]] magazine. He also draws on his research and writes a regular monthly column in the ''[[Fortean Times]]''.

==Conspiracy theories==
Although Ramsay's magazine Lobster includes articles on conspiracy theories, and he has written a book on the subject, [[Gareth Mclean]] writing ''[[The Scotsman]]'' newspaper, says that Ramsay "hates conspiracy theories", quoting him as saying "The term 'conspiracy theory' is used by various intellectual establishments to dismiss people like me. It's irritating but there's nothing you can do about it."&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Mclean, "They're Out to Get You", ''The Scotsman'', 9 October 1999, Saturday, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Ramsay is the eldest child of a food chemist father and housewife mother.&lt;ref&gt;"Shock Lobster", ''Sunday Herald'', 17 August 2003. [http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/a-list/2003w33/msg00042.html Online at U. Utah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227034314/http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/a-list/2003w33/msg00042.html |date=27 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Robert McCrum]] describes Ramsay as "an extrovert, fast-talking Scot with jack-of-all-trades experience in alternative journalism, jazz music and the theatre".&lt;ref&gt;Robert McCrum, "Inside Story: In the lair of the lobster - Stephen Dorril and Robin Ramsey edit a left-wing journal that offers succour to conspiracy theorists and keeps the professionals on their toes", ''The Guardian'' (London), 31 August 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1988, Ramsay made [[After_Dark_(TV_series)#.22British_Intelligence.22|an extended appearance]] on the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After_Dark_(TV_series)|After Dark]]'', alongside [[Merlyn Rees]], [[H. Montgomery Hyde]] and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3861">'''Rozena Maart''' (born 1962&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=nr98-1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a South African writer, and professor, currently living in Durban. She is the Director for the Centre for Critical Research on Race and Identity. She has been recognized for her writing, and for her work opposing [[apartheid]] and violence against women. She has lectured throughout Canada, the United States and many parts of the world.

She was born in [[District Six, Cape Town]], South Africa, the old slave quarter of Cape Town. Her family was forcibly removed from District Six in 1973 as a result of the government’s Forced Removal Act. In 1987 when she was 24, Maart was nominated for the “Woman of the Year” award hosted in [[Johannesburg]], for her work opposing violence against women and for starting, with four women, the first Black feminist organization in Cape Town, Women Against Repression (WAR).

She moved to Canada in 1989 and published her first book of poetry in 1990, ''Talk About It!''. She won the [[Journey Prize]] in 1992 for her short story "No Rosa, No District Six", which later appeared in her debut short story collection "Rosa's District Six." She is the author of several books of poetry, short fiction, non-fiction and novels, most recently the novel ''The Writing Circle'', published in 2007 ([[TSAR Publications]]), which is being made into a feature film.  ''Rosa's District Six'' made the weekly bestseller list in Canada in 2006 and the HOMEBRU 2006 list in South Africa.

She has a PhD from the [[University of Birmingham]], U.K. (1993–1996) Centre for Cultural Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rozenamaart.wordpress.com/resume/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223135734/http://rozenamaart.wordpress.com/resume/ |archivedate=2014-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work examines relationships between and among Political Philosophy, Black Consciousness, Derrida and Deconstruction, Psychoanalysis, Feminist
Theory, and Critical Theories of race and racism.

Maart recently served on the UNESCO Scientific Committee for the South-South Philosophical Dialogues, which produced a Philosophical textbook
covering four regions—Africa, Asia, South and Central America and the Arab region—in four languages (English, French, Spanish and Arabic)

In 2010 The Writing Circle was noted as one of the ten top books in South African literature in her homeland, South Africa and nominated by the African Studies Association for the Aidoo-Snyder Book Prize

==Career==

===1992–2007: Career beginnings and ''Jesus Is Magic''===
After beginning her stand-up comedy in 1992, Silverman was part of the [[Saturday Night Live (season 19)|1993–94 season]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to [[Rehearsal|dress rehearsal]] and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. [[Bob Odenkirk]], a former ''SNL'' writer, explained, "I could see how it wouldn't work at ''SNL'' because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her."&lt;ref name="newyorker"/&gt; She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job.&lt;ref name="freshair"/&gt; She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career.&lt;ref name="freshair"/&gt; Later, she was grateful that her ''SNL'' time was short because it didn't end up defining her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=Sarah|title=The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; She parodied the situation when she appeared on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' episode "The New Writer" (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of ''Larry Sanders'' during its final two seasons.

She also starred in the [[HBO]] [[sketch comedy]] series ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]'' (1995–1997) and had the leading role for the 1997 [[independent film]] ''[[Who's the Caboose?]]'', about a pair of New York comedians (Silverman and director [[Sam Seder]]) going to Los Angeles during pilot season to try to get a part in a television series; the film features numerous young comedians in supporting roles but never received a widespread theatrical release. Silverman and Seder later made a six-episode television series sequel entitled ''[[Pilot Season (TV series)|Pilot Season]]'' in which Silverman stars as the same character and Seder again directed. She made her network standup comedy debut on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on July 3, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Late Show with David Letterman (a Guest Stars &amp; Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/LateShowwithDavidLetterman/|website=''epguides.com''|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHL49CcBXQ|title=YouTube|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(TV series)|VIP]]'' in the episode "48{{frac|1|2}} Hours" (2002); ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' as a series regular (2002); and on the puppet television comedy ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' as the voice of Hadassah Guberman (2003, 2007). She had small parts in the films ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Say It Isn't So (film)|Say It Isn't So]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'', ''[[The Way of the Gun]]'', ''[[Overnight Delivery]]'', ''[[Screwed (2000 film)|Screwed]]'', ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]],'' and ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]],'' playing a mixture of comic and serious roles.

In 2005, Silverman released a [[concert film]], ''[[Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic]]'', based on her one-woman show of the same name. [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]] directed the film, which was distributed by [[Roadside Attractions]]. It received 64% positive ratings based on 84 reviews on the [[Film criticism|film critics]] aggregator Web site [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sarah_silverman_jesus_is_magic/ | title=Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic (2005) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned approximately $1.3&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jesusismagic.htm | title=Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic | work=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=February 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the film's publicity campaign, she appeared online in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as the cover subject of ''[[Heeb]]'' magazine and in [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] on Comedy Central of [[Pamela Anderson]] and [[Hugh Hefner]].

Silverman played a therapist in a skit for a bonus DVD of the album ''[[Lullabies to Paralyze]]'' by the band [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. Silverman also appears at the end of the video for American glam metal band [[Steel Panther]]'s "Death To All But Metal." On ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', Silverman parodied sketches from ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', replaying [[Dave Chappelle]]'s characterizations of [[Rick James]] and "Tyrone" as well as a [[Donnell Rawlings]] character based on the miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''. In 2006, Silverman placed 50th on ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Hot 100 List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?imgCollectId=94&amp;slideId=1955 |title=Maxim 2006 Hot 100 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=February 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102084323/http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?imgCollectId=94&amp;slideId=1955 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she placed 29th and appeared on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3575&amp;imgCollectId=190 | title= Maxim 2007 Hot 100 | work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] | accessdate=February 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517045104/http://www.maximonline.com/slideshows/index.aspx?slideId=3575&amp;imgCollectId=190|archivedate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–2010: ''The Sarah Silverman Program''===
[[File:Sarah Silverman.jpg|thumb|Silverman at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2007]]
Her television sitcom ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' debuted on Comedy Central in February 2007, the series had 1.81&amp;nbsp;million viewers&lt;ref name="mediaweek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6414787.html?title=Article&amp;spacedesc=news| title= ''Silverman'' Scores on Comedy | first=Rebecca | last=Stropoli | work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] | date=February 8, 2007 | accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and portrays the day-to-day adventures of fictionalized versions of Silverman, her sister [[Laura Silverman|Laura]], and their friends. A number of comedic actors from ''Mr. Show'' have appeared on ''The Sarah Silverman Program''. Silverman was nominated for a [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/sarah-silverman|title=Sarah Silverman – Television Academy|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her acting on the show. At the awards ceremony, she wore a fake mustache. Comedy Central canceled ''The Sarah Silverman Program'' after three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sarah Silverman Program: TV Show Cancelled; No Season Four |url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/sarah-silverman-program-canceled-14887/ |publisher=TV Series Finale |date=May 12, 2010 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, she hosted the [[MTV Movie Awards]]. During her opening act, she commented on the upcoming jail sentence of [[Paris Hilton]], who was in the audience, saying: "In a couple of days, Paris Hilton is going to jail. As a matter of fact, I heard that to make her feel more comfortable in prison, the guards are going to paint the bars to look like [[human penis|penises]]. I think it is wrong, too. I just worry she is going to break her teeth on those things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/ma07/videos.jhtml| title=2007 MTV Movie Awards | publisher=MTV | format=Video | accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, she appeared at the ''[[MTV Video Music Award]]s''. Following the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards#Britney Spears performance|comeback performance]] of [[Britney Spears]], Silverman mocked her on stage, saying: "Wow, she is amazing. I mean, she is 25 years old, and she has already accomplished everything she's going to accomplish in her life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2007/videos.jhtml |title=2007 VMA |publisher=MTV |format=Video |accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, she appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' to show [[Jimmy Kimmel]], her boyfriend at the time, a special video. The video turned out to be a song called "[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#"I'm Fucking Matt Damon" video|I'm Fucking Matt Damon]]" in which she and [[Matt Damon]] sang a duet about having an affair behind Kimmel's back. The video created an "instant YouTube sensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20175789,00.html|title=Behind Matt Damon's Raunchy Payback to Jimmy Kimmel|first=Julie|last=Jordan|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=February 2, 2008|accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Music and Lyrics at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards.

She returned in the sixth-season premiere and for the [[Monk (season 7)#ep7|100th episode of ''Monk'']]. According to the audio commentary on the ''[[Clerks II]]'' DVD, director [[Kevin Smith]] offered her the role that eventually went to [[Rosario Dawson]], but she turned it down out of fear of being typecast in "girlfriend roles". However, she told Smith the script was "really funny" and mentioned that if the role of [[List of View Askewniverse characters#Randal Graves|Randal Graves]] was being offered to her she "would do it in a heartbeat." She appeared in ''Strange Powers'', the 2009 documentary by Kerthy Fix and [[Gail O'Hara]] about cult songwriter Stephin Merritt and his band [[The Magnetic Fields]]. Silverman wrote a comic memoir, ''[[The Bedwetter|The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee]]'', which was published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/books/04book.html|title=Starting Early, Swearing Often: A Smart Aleck's Story|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff|work=The New York Times|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a [[public service announcement]] (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the [[Jewish Council for Education &amp; Research]] (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mik Moore: Co-creator of Sarah's PSAs|url=http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/2012/09/22/mik-moore-co-creator-of-sarahs-psas|accessdate=September 22, 2012|date=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ari Wallach]] (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dermody|first=Katrine|title=Let My People Vote: Sarah Silverman demystifies voter ID laws (Q&amp;A video)|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/120927/let-my-people-vote-sarah-silverman-voter-id-video|work=The Global Post|accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[HBO]] announced that Silverman would star with [[Patti LuPone]] and [[Topher Grace]] in a situation comedy pilot called ''People in New Jersey'', produced by ''SNL''{{'}}s [[Lorne Michaels]].&lt;ref name="Sarah Silverman, Topher Grace, Patti LuPone to star in HBO's Lorne Michaels pilot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=Sarah Silverman, Topher Grace, Patti LuPone to star in HBO's Lorne Michaels pilot|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sarah-silverman-topher-grace-patti-643435|accessdate=October 9, 2013|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was not picked up for a series order.

Since 2017, she has hosted the [[Hulu]] [[web television]] [[late-night talk show]], ''[[I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman]]''.

==Controversies==

===Media Action Network for Asian Americans incident===
[[File:Sarah Silverman (7588066284).jpg|left|thumb|Silverman at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International]]
In a July 2001 interview on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Silverman used the ethnic slur "[[chink]]" in explaining that a friend advised her to avoid jury duty by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something inappropriate, like 'I hate chinks.'" Silverman said she decided that she did not want to be thought of as a racist, so "I wrote 'I love chinks'&amp;nbsp;– and who doesn't?"&lt;ref name=“eonline”&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/41903/pc-police-bust-conan-o-brien-show|title=PC Police Bust Conan O'Brien Show|first=Josh|last=Grossberg|publisher=E!|date=July 18, 2001|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman said the joke satirizes the racist thought process. [[Guy Aoki]] of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) objected to her use of the slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaa.org|title=Manaa: Media Action Network for Asian Americans|publisher=Manaa.orgsked|accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=“eonline”/&gt; NBC and O'Brien apologized, but Silverman did not. Later, appearing on ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' in July and August 2001, Silverman questioned Aoki's sincerity, accusing him of exploiting the opportunity for publicity. On a later episode, Aoki appeared with Silverman and stated he did not accept Silverman's explanation, saying that it was not successful satire and that comedians should consult groups such as his before performing such material. She stated in an [[&lt;!-- National Public Radio| --&gt;NPR]] ''[[Fresh Air]]'' interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on ''Politically Incorrect'', among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.&lt;ref name="freshair"&gt;{{cite news|first=Terry|last=Gross|authorlink=Terry Gross|title=Sarah Silverman: 'Jesus Is Magic'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4994761|work=[[Fresh Air]]|date= November 9, 2005|accessdate=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman has since turned the complaint into grist for her standup act, saying that the experience helped teach her the important lesson that racism is bad: "And I mean ''bad'', like in that black way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Thorpe|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/9067|title=Is America Ready for Sarah Silverman?|work=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=January 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Aristocrats===
A minor controversy arose over Silverman's performance in the documentary film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' (2005). The film shows her doing the [[The Aristocrats|Aristocrats joke]] – a sample of [[transgressive art]] told by numerous comedians since the [[vaudeville]] era – like it was an autobiographical account of her life as a [[Child pornography|child sex performer]].  As part of the routine, she mentioned that [[Joe Franklin]], a long-time New York radio and TV personality, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment, and as the punchline, [[Deadpan|deadpanned]] that "Joe Franklin raped me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2005/11/irony_maiden.html | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | title = Irony Maiden | first = Sam | last = Anderson | date = November 10, 2005| accessdate = November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the film's release, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted he remained undecided but had said, "The best thing I could do is get Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/nyregion/08bold.html|work=The New York Times|title=Now We Feel We Really Know Her|first=Paula|last=Schwartz|date=September 8, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She credited her subsequent emotional health to taking the prescription drug [[Sertraline|Zoloft]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate_paul"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Pamela|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129955|title=Sarah Silverman|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=November 10, 2005|accessdate=February 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usmagazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hancock|first=Noelle|date=May 15, 2007|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/sarah_silverman|title=Sarah Silverman's Depression Confession|work=[[Us Weekly]]|page=10|id=Issue 642|accessdate=February 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104212407/http://usmagazine.com/sarah_silverman|archivedate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She struggled with [[Nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]] from the time she was young until well into her teens and stated in a 2007 interview that she had wet the bed recently.&lt;ref name="jkl"/&gt;

Silverman's autobiography, published in April 2010, entitled ''[[The Bedwetter]]'', explores the subject of bed wetting, among other subjects. She stated she did not want to get married until [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex couples]] were able to.&lt;ref name="advocate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/People/Sarah_Silverman|title=Sarah Silverman|first=Brandon|last=Voss|authorlink=Brandon Voss|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210104626/http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/People/Sarah_Silverman/|archivedate=February 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she tweeted "Just read that I wanna get married which is hilarious b/c I will never get married," adding, "Why would I want the govt involved in my love life?

==Politics and activism==
[[File:Sarah Silverman Introduces Bernie Sanders in L.A..webm|thumb|Silverman introduces [[Bernie Sanders]] at an August 2015 [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|campaign]] rally in Los Angeles]]
In 2015, she signed an open letter which the [[ONE Campaign]] had been collecting signatures for; the letter was addressed to [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]], urging them to focus on women, as they serve as the head of the G7 in Germany and the AU in Ethiopia, respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/07/povert-sexist-letter-women-equality-gaga-sandberg-beyonce |title=Poverty is sexist: leading women sign up for global equality &amp;#124; Life and style |work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], she became increasingly politically active. In 2015, Silverman endorsed Vermont Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for [[President of the United States]], saying, "He says what he means &amp; he means what he says &amp; he's not for sale". She had previously introduced Sanders at a rally in Los Angeles, California that drew an audience of over 27,500 people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meet-bernie-sanders-top-celebrity-backers/story?id=33020601|title=Meet Bernie Sanders' top celebrity backers|first1=Summer|last1=Fields|first2=Louise|last2=Simpson|publisher=ABC News|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she initially supported Sanders, she later spoke in support of [[Hillary Clinton]] at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In her convention speech, she urged other Sanders supporters to back Clinton and, later, amid some boos from some Sanders supporters, said, "Can I just say?

'''Tudor Vladimirescu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈtudor vladimiˈresku}}; c. 1780 – {{OldStyleDate|7 June|1821|27 May}}) was a [[Romania]]n revolutionary hero, the leader of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and of the [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandur]] [[militia]]. He is also known as '''Tudor din Vladimiri''' (''Tudor of Vladimiri'') or — occasionally — as '''Domnul Tudor''' (''[[Voivode]] Tudor'').

==Background==
Tudor was born in [[Vladimir, Gorj|Vladimiri]], [[Gorj County]] (in the region of [[Oltenia]]) in a family of landed peasants (''mazili''); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to [[Craiova]], in service to [[boyar]] [[Ioan Glogoveanu]], where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the [[Greek language]]. He became administrator of the boyar's estate and, in 1806, was named ''[[vătaf]]'' (leader of the local militias) at [[Cloșani]]. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the [[Phanariotes]]. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Iorga, Izvoarele contemporane asupra mișcării lui Tudor Vladimirescu, Lib. "Cartea Românească" şi Pavel Suru, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

Tudor enrolled in the [[History of Russia|Russian]] army and took part in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812]]. Consequently, he was awarded the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] 3rd degree and given Russian protection and [[immunity from prosecution]] under both [[Wallachia]]n and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] legislation (''see [[Sudiți]]''). This contributed to Tudor's decisions throughout the uprising, alongside his belief that Russia was backing his actions. After the war, Tudor returned to Oltenia. He traveled briefly to [[Vienna]], in 1814, in order to attend a [[lawsuit]] involving Glogoveanu's wife's [[Property|patrimony]]. The trip coincided with the [[Congress of Vienna|Peace Congress]], and it is believed that Vladimirescu followed the treaties' outcome.

Back in the country in 1815, Tudor learned that [[Ada Kaleh]] Ottoman garrison, who roamed [[Mehedinți]] and [[Gorj]], had also destroyed his household from [[Cerneți]].

From 1812 to 1821, Vladimirescu slowly built a follower base. The Pandurs respected his military skills, and many sources point out his [[charisma]] and outstanding negotiating abilities. He would also have been familiarised with the outcomes of the [[First Serbian Uprising|First]] and [[Second Serbian Uprising]].

==Uprising==
[[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexandros Soutzos]]' death in January 1821 led to the forming of a temporary ''Comitet de Ocârmuire'' ("Governing Committee"), three [[regents]] - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Grigore Brâncoveanu]]. The ''Comitet'', motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers' favours, decided to quickly manoeuver anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement between it and the Pandurs was reached on the 15th: [[Dimitrie Macedonski]] was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor.

The very same day, Vladimirescu sent a letter to the Ottoman Court of [[Mahmud II]], stating that his objective was not the rejection of Ottoman rule, but that of the Phanariote [[regime]], and showing his willingness for preservation of the traditional institutions. The statements were meant to buy Tudor time against Ottoman response, as he was already in negotiations with the Greek Anti-Ottoman revolutionary society [[Philikí Etaireía]] (having probably been in contact with it from around 1819). Together, they produced a plan for [[insurrection]], with the two Etairist representatives ([[Giorgakis Olympios]] and [[Iannis Pharmakis]]) assuring the Wallachians of Russian support for the common cause. It is apparent that Tudor was not himself a member of the Etaireía: the rigid command structure of the Brotherhood would have excluded the need for any negotiations.

After fortifying monasteries in Oltenia ([[Tismana]], [[Strehaia]]) that were to serve him in the event of Ottoman intervention, Tudor travelled to [[Padeș]] where he issued his first proclamation (23 January). It included references to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles (notably, the [[Right of revolution|right to resist oppression]]), but was also an almost [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] appeal to peasants, promising a "spring" to follow "winter".

In February the demands were detailed by more documents. They included: the elimination of purchased offices in the administration, with the introduction of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] promotion, the suppression of certain taxes and taxing criteria, the reduction of the main tax, the founding of a [[Wallachian Army]], and an end to internal [[customs|custom duties]]. In line with these, Tudor asked for the [[banishment]] of some Phanariote families and forbidding future Princes to hold a [[retinue]] that would compete with local boyars for offices. Calls by boyars in the [[Sfatul boieresc|Divan]] for Tudor to cease such activities (expressed by envoy [[Nicolae Văcărescu]]) were met with a virulent refusal.

[[File:Eteria - Turkische Treue, 1821.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Etaireía and Ottomans fighting in Bucharest (August 1821).]]

The army, swelled up in numbers as it advanced, occupied [[Bucharest]] on 21 March - here, Tudor issued another important proclamation, one that expressed yet again his commitment to peace with the Ottomans. Previously, the Philikí Etaireía under [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] had emerged in [[Moldavia]], proclaiming a liberation from Ottoman rule that was backed by the then Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Michael Soutzos]] (''see [[Greek War of Independence]]''). However, this coincided with Russian reaction against Greek rebellion, with the Russian army entering Moldavia and enforcing 
[[Holy Alliance]] policies. Ypsilanti's army headed south, reaching Pandur-occupied Bucharest.

Tudor's actions in the meanwhile had destroyed his alliance to local boyars. He had started wearing the ''kalpak'' (a tall, cylindrical, black leather hat; ''see [[Ottoman Clothing]]'') reserved for the Prince, and demanded to be addressed as ''Domn'' ("Master", "Prince"; cf. ''[[Domnitor]]'') - moving away from subordination to the landowners' cause.

The meeting between Ypsilanti and Tudor brought a new compromise. Tudor considered himself liberated from the provisions of the January agreement, as Russia was now an enemy of the Etaireía; Ypsilanti tried to persuade him that Russian support was still possible. The country was divided into a Greek administration and a Wallachian one, with Tudor's declaring itself neutral in the face of large Ottoman armies preparing to cross the north of the [[Danube]]. Ottoman actions had been prompted by Russian threat of intervention in Wallachia.

Tudor's army retreated towards in Oltenia in May, as the Ottomans occupied [[Bucharest]] without meeting resistance. Tudor was no longer capable of maintaining the discipline and cohesion of his own troops, some of whom had resorted to robbery. In an attempt to ensure discipline, he imposed hangings of those found guilty. 
In the meantime, Etaireía members, led by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]] developed a plot to remove Tudor. Following treason, Tudor was arrested in {{ill|Golești, Ștefănești|lt=Golești|ro|Golești (Ștefănești), Argeș}} on 21 May. On the night of 27 to 28 May, following accusations of collaboration with the Ottomans against Etaireía, he was tortured and killed by Etaireía in [[Târgoviște|Targoviste]], his mutilated body being thrown into a cesspit. Tudor's collaboration with the Ottomans was never confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Vasilie Urechiă, "Istoria Romanilor: Revolutiunea lui Tudor Vladimirescu", Bucuresci, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; The Etaireía did not succeed in its goal to assume command of Vladimirescu's army: most of it disbanded on the spot.

Tudor's rebellion ensured that Wallachia would stay under military occupation. Although the situation was stabilized by August, Ottoman troops remained present until 1826. However, as they could no longer trust Phanariote rule in the face of its infiltration by Greek [[nationalism]] (Ypsilanti himself came from a Phanariote family - ''see  [[Alexander Ypsilanti (1725-1805)|Alexander Ypsilanti]], his grandfather, and [[Constantine Ypsilanti]], his father''), the Ottomans returned the two Principalities to rule by and through locals (in 1822): [[Grigore IV Ghica]] in Wallachia, [[Ioan Sturdza]] (Ioniţă Sandu Sturdza) in Moldavia. The changes in the situation were to be confirmed by the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] and Russian occupation (at the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829|Russo-Turkish War]]).

Although the scope of his movement appealed to generations of Romanian nationalists, Tudor Vladimirescu's most favorable treatment came with the official ideology of the ''Romanian People's Republic'' (the first period of [[Communist Romania]], lasting from 1948 to 1965). He was considered [[Progressivism|progressive]], and it also contributed that he viewed himself as an ally to the Russian cause—almost as a precursor of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] alliance. 
The [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian film]] ''[[Tudor (film)|Tudor]]''&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;''[http://imdb.com/title/tt0056620/ Tudor (1962)]'' at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[1962 in film|1962]]) narrated his life from the return home in 1812 to his death. Tudor, portrayed by [[Emanoil Petruţ]], falls from his horse after being shot in the back, claiming to return "as the grass of spring" - a far easier death than what Vladimirescu  had endured in reality. 

[[Tudor Vladimirescu Division|A division bearing his name]] (''Divizia Tudor Vladimirescu'') was formed by the [[Red Army]] with Romanian [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who had fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. They were called on to fight the [[Ion Antonescu]] pro-[[Nazi Germany]] regime, and were absorbed into the [[Romanian Army]] after 1944. The division had its precedent in an [[artillery battery]] of the same name, grouping Romanian volunteers in the [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]&lt;ref&gt;It was customary for units of the International Brigades to be named for a notable past leader of their country, considered a Progressive but not a Communist - e.g. the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]].&lt;/ref&gt;. An [[Order of Tudor Vladmirescu]] was also created.

[[File:Israel Kristal Certificate 1918.jpeg|thumb|right|Kristal's name and date of birth on a 1918 record]]

'''Yisrael Kristal''' (born '''Izrael Icek Kryształ'''; {{lang-he|ישראל קרישטל}}; September 15, 1903 – August 11, 2017) was a Polish-Israeli [[supercentenarian]], recognized in 2014 as the oldest living [[Holocaust survivor]], and after the death of [[Yasutaro Koide]] on January 19, 2016, was the [[Oldest people|oldest living man]] in the world as well as one of [[List of the verified oldest men|the ten oldest men ever]].

Born to religious parents in Poland, then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Kristal remained religiously observant all his life.&lt;ref name=TIbarM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/worlds-oldest-man-marks-bar-mitzvah-100-years-late|title=World’s oldest man marks bar mitzvah, 100 years late|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A devout Jew, he has wrapped phylacteries daily for the past century." That's from Bar Mitzvah age until his passing.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Confectionery|confectioner]] by profession, he experienced  [[World War I]] as an early teen, and [[World War II]] as an adult. After surviving the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], he [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]].

==Early life==
[[File:Yisrael Kristal 1931.png|thumb|150px|left|Yisrael Kristal in [[Poland]], 1931, aged 28]]
Kristal was born to a religious [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Maleniec, Końskie County]] near [[Żarnów]], then part of [[Congress Poland]] of the [[Russian Empire]], on September 15, 1903. His father was a [[Torah]] scholar who ensured his son had a religious education, and Kristal would remain religiously observant all his life. He attended a ''[[cheder]]'' at age three, where he studied Judaism and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. He learned the [[Hebrew Bible]] at four and the [[Mishnah]] at six. In a 2012 interview, he recalled his father waking him at five in the morning to begin his religious instruction.&lt;ref name=haaretz1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.698614|title=Israeli Auschwitz Survivor Could Be Oldest Man in the World|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 24, 2016|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother died in 1910 when he was 7 years old. After [[World War I]] broke out in 1914, he saw Kaiser [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] in person when the monarch rode through his town in a car, and recalled them throwing sweets as he passed. His father was drafted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and died soon after.&lt;ref name=haaretz2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.576348|title=Israeli Confectioner, 110, Inherits Title of World’s Oldest Holocaust Survivor|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=February 25, 2014 |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/world/middleeast/worlds-oldest-man-bar-mitzvah.html|title=World’s Oldest Man, After Century Wait, Celebrates Bar Mitzvah at Last|first=Dan|last=Bilefsky|date=6 October 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Kristal moved in with his uncles.

In 1920, at age 17, he moved to [[Łódź]]. After briefly laboring as a metalworker, he opened a candy store with an uncle. While initially working as a physical laborer, he later became a renowned expert candy-maker. He married Chaja Feige Frucht&lt;ref name=Forward&gt;{{cite news|url=http://forward.com/culture/337136/family-faith-food-and-other-keys-to-becoming-the-worlds-oldest-man|title=Family, Faith, Food and Other Keys to Becoming the World's Oldest Man|work=Forward|author=Jordan Kutzik|date=March 30, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928, and had two children.&lt;ref name=haaretz2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2016/01/22/112-year-old-Holocaust-survivor-believed-to-be-worlds-oldest-man/9631453466037|title=112-year-old Yisrael Kristal believed to be world's oldest man|work=[[UPI]]|date=February 2, 2016|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Holocaust survival==
In 1940, after the Germans had taken over Poland during [[World War II]], Kristal continued to manufacture candy, at times secretly and at other times with the encouragement of the heads of the ghetto&lt;!--presumably Lodz?--&gt;, among them head of the Łódź Ghetto ''[[Judenrat]]'' [[Chaim Rumkowski]]. His two children died in the ghetto, while Kristal and his wife were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during the liquidation of the ghetto in August 1944. 

Kristal's wife died in Auschwitz while he worked as a forced laborer and survived. When the camp was liberated by the [[Red Army]], Kristal weighed {{Convert|82|lb}}.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He was taken to the hospital, where he returned to his profession and made candies for Soviet soldiers, before returning to Łódź, where he rebuilt his destroyed candy shop and met his second wife, Batsheva. They married in 1947. The couple had a son, Chaim, who was born in Poland, and a daughter, Shula, who was born in Israel.&lt;ref name=haaretz2/&gt;

==Life in Israel==
In 1950, the family immigrated to Israel on the ship ''Komemiyut'' and settled in [[Haifa]]. He initially worked at the Palata candy factory, where he was considered an expert and taught the owners to make an entire production line of sweets. He then became self-employed, making boutique sweets at home and selling them at a [[Haifa]] kiosk. Among the sweets he produced were tiny [[liquor]] bottles made of chocolate wrapped in colored foil, jam made from [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]], and chocolate-covered orange peels. In 1952, he began manufacturing his candies at the Sar and Kristal Factory on Shivat Zion Street. After the factory closed in 1970, he returned to making his candies at home before retiring.&lt;ref name=haaretz2/&gt;

Kristal had nine grandchildren. He also had great-grandchildren, but his family preferred not to state his exact number of descendants for fear of the "[[evil eye]]".&lt;ref name=haaretz1/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz2/&gt;

Having been unable to do so at the age of 13 due to World War I, Kristal celebrated his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]] a century later, in September 2016, at the age of 113.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37375629|title=World's oldest man, Yisrael Kristal, 113, to hold bar mitzvah|date=September 15, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2016|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpupdates.com/2016/09/27/auschwitz-survivor-yisrael-kristal-celebrates-bar-mitzvah-at-113|title=Auschwitz Survivor Yisrael Kristal Celebrates Bar-Mitzvah At 113|date=September 27, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2017|publisher=jpupdates.com|author=Menachem Rephun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/worlds-oldest-man-marks-bar-mitzvah-100-years-late|title=World's oldest man marks bar mitzvah, 100 years late|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2017, Kristal died at his home in Haifa at the age of 113 years and 330 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World’s oldest man, an Israeli Holocaust survivor, dies at 113|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/worlds-oldest-man-an-israeli-holocaust-survivor-dies-at-113|work=Times of Israel|date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oldest living man==
Following the death of [[Alice Herz-Sommer]] in [[London]] on February 23, 2014, Kristal became recognized as the world's oldest known Holocaust survivor (though he was actually older than she was).&lt;ref name=haaretz1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.576348|title=Israeli Confectioner, 110, Inherits Title of World’s Oldest Holocaust Survivor|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=February 25, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the world's oldest living man on January 18, 2016, after the death of Japanese supercentenarian [[Yasutaro Koide]].{{efn|name=Yasutaro Koide|Yasutaro Koide died January 19, 2016 12:17 a.m. [[Japan Standard Time|JST]].

On March 11, 2016, Kristal was officially recognized as the world's oldest man by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. His status was verified after documents confirming his age were uncovered in Poland (formerly, the family's oldest document was from his wedding at age 25, but Guinness regulations require documentation from the first 20 years of a person's life to claim the record; the newly found documents were discovered by Jewish Records Indexing – Poland).&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/3/guinness-world-records-announces-holocaust-survivor-israel-kristal-as-worlds-old|title=Guinness World Records announces Holocaust survivor Israel Kristal as world’s oldest living man|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|date=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jri-poland.org |title=Jewish Records Indexing – Poland|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timesofisrael&gt;{{cite news |last=Cortellessa |first=Eric|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-holocaust-survivor-confirmed-as-worlds-oldest-man-at-112|title=Israeli Holocaust survivor confirmed as world's oldest man at 112|work=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yvette Paula Fielding''' (born 23 September 1968) is an English television presenter, producer and actress. She became the youngest presenter on ''[[Blue Peter]]'' aged 18, and one of her episodes was subsequently voted the "Favourite ''Blue Peter'' moment" ever. With her husband [[Karl Beattie]], she presented the ''[[Most Haunted]]'' series on the Living channel, via their own production company, followed by ''[[Ghosthunting With...]]'', establishing Fielding as ‘first lady of the paranormal’.

==Early life==
Fielding was born in [[Manchester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/news/lifestyle/lifestyle-leisure/yvette-fielding-1-1895046|title=...Yvette Fielding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[Bramhall]] where she attended Pownall Green Primary School and [[Bramhall High School]]. She attended Stockport Convent,  [[Hillcrest Grammar School]], [[Davenport, Greater Manchester|Davenport]] and [[South Cheshire College|Dane Bank College]] in Crewe (studying drama).

==Career==

===Early career===
Fielding's first major role came in 1983 when she was cast in the children's [[BBC]] series ''[[Seaview (TV series)|Seaview]]''. The comedy-drama show centred around a teenage girl called Sandy Shelton (played by Fielding), growing up living at her parents' guest house in [[Blackpool]]. The show ran for two series and secured Fielding's popularity with younger audiences. After this, Fielding made a guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Juliet Bravo]]''.

===''Blue Peter'' and beyond===
In 1987, Fielding became a presenter on the BBC children's show, ''[[Blue Peter]]''. To date Fielding holds the record of being the youngest presenter on ''Blue Peter'', starting on 29 June 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/bluepeter/presenters/fielding.shtml |title=BBC Blue Peter Presenters |publisher=BBC |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; three months before her 19th birthday. While on the series Fielding also had an acting role in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' (making an appearance in the series while making a ''Blue Peter'' report on the show). During her time on the show, Fielding won the ''SOS Award'' for the ''Most Popular Woman on Television'', competing with [[Cilla Black]], [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Kylie Minogue]]. Years after Fielding left the show, her trip on a [[rollercoaster]] with fellow presenter [[Mark Curry (television presenter)|Mark Curry]] was voted the ''Favourite Blue Peter moment of all time'' by viewers. After five years of ''Blue Peter'', Fielding co-hosted ''[[What's Up Doc? (TV series)|What's Up Doc?]]'', a Saturday morning children's show on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The series ran for three years and established Fielding with slightly older audiences.

From 1995 Fielding made a successful transition from children's to television for an older audience. After leaving ''What's Up Doc?'' Fielding presented '' [[The Heaven and Earth Show]]'', ''[[The General (TV series)|The General]]'' and ''[[City Hospital (UK series)|City Hospital]]'' for the BBC. She was a regular host of ''Karaoke Challenge'' and contributed weekend continuity for [[Challenge TV]]. Fielding also appeared in the ITV game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (UK game show)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'' in 1995 and 1996. Fielding briefly returned to children's television in 1997, appearing in two episodes of the CBBC drama series ''[[Byker Grove]]'', playing the role of Samantha Fuller.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276172/|title=Yvette Fielding|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2000, Fielding appeared as a regular alongside [[Fred Dinenage]] and [[Toyah Willcox]] on a property-pricing based game-show called ''[[Under Offer]]'' made for [[Meridian Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Under_Offer |title=Under Offer – UKGameshows |publisher=Ukgameshows.com |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Fielding appeared as a guest on the [[Channel 4]] chat show ''[[Richard &amp; Judy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0686031/|title="Richard &amp; Judy" Episode dated 29 October 2003 (TV Episode 2003)|date=29 October 2003|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Fielding appeared as a contestant on the BBC quiz show ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'', with her specialist subject being [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Fielding and her husband were the celebrity subjects of a one-hour documentary for [[Living (UK TV channel)|Living]] called ''Living With Yvette &amp; Karl'' which aired on 1 November 2008. A sequel documentary entitled ''In Bed with Yvette &amp; Karl'' which aired on Living on 17 January 2009, charted Fielding's [[hysterectomy]] operation and recovery. A full-length series of ''In Bed with Yvette &amp; Karl'', was then commissioned, and aired on Living during June and July 2009. In October 2009, a further documentary entitled ''Yvette &amp; Karl: Life begins at 40'' was broadcast. From February to March 2009, Fielding appeared in the [[ITV1]] variety TV show ''[[Saturday Night Takeaway]]''.

===Presenting the paranormal===
In 2002, Yvette Fielding and her husband [[Karl Beattie]] established their own television production company, [[Antix Productions]]. Their first production was ''[[Most Haunted]]'' for the British TV channel [[Living (UK TV channel)|Living]]. In the show, viewers can see Fielding and [[paranormal]] experts investigating various supposedly haunted locations around Britain, in the hopes that paranormal activity may be documented by the crew. ''Most Haunted'' proved popular with audiences and remains to this day one of Living's highest-rated original shows. Leading on from this, in 2006 Fielding presented and produced ''[[Ghosthunting With...]]'', a paranormal show for [[ITV2]] which shows Fielding leading various celebrities around haunted locations. These two shows established Yvette Fielding as British televisions 'first lady' of the paranormal, and somewhat of a [[cult figure]].

Fielding has made many appearances and interviews in the British media in connection with her paranormal investigations and programmes, including  guest appearances on ''[[The Sunday Night Project]]'' ([[Channel 4]]), ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' ([[BBC Radio 1]]) and ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' ([[BBC One]]). Furthering her paranormal franchise, in 2008 Fielding made her first move into radio broadcasting, hosting ''Yvette Fielding's Fright Nights'' on [[Kerrang! Radio]]. Fielding left the radio station a few months later however, due to other work commitments. In 2008 Fielding and Beattie formed a new company called [[Monster Pictures]] to operate the [[Paranormal Channel]]. Fielding acted as anchor to the channel and presented original programming on the station. The channel was subsequently renamed the [[Unexplained Channel]] in 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In October 2009 Living aired a two-part documentary featuring Fielding with [[Paul O'Grady]] entitled ''Death in Venice''. The documentary saw the pair investigating claims of ghost and vampire sightings in [[Poveglia]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published Thursday, 2 July 2009, 00:02 BST |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a162997/ogrady-fielding-for-death-in-venice.html |title=O'Grady, Fielding for 'Death In Venice' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding announced on 25 June 2010, via the Antix Productions website, that she was to step down as presenter of ''Most Haunted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antixproductions.com/ |title=Welcome |publisher=Antix Productions |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent interviews, Fielding also indicated that she would finish presenting ''Ghosthunting with..'' and all other paranormal-based broadcasts in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dianne Bourne |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1302614_yvette_fielding_to_give_up_the_ghost |title=Yvette Fielding to give up the ghost? &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, seemingly contradicting this, in May 2011, Fielding appeared in an episode of the UK version of the ''[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]'' series for the [[Bio. (UK)|bio]] channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/shows/celebrity-ghost-stories-uk/episode-guide.html#bottomOfHeader |title=Episode Guide – Celebrity Ghost Stories UK on Bio |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the entire UK series of ''Celebrity Ghost Stories'' being produced by Fielding's Antix Productions company. Then in September 2011 Fielding presented another episode of ''Ghosthunting with...'' featuring the cast of ''[[The Only Way Is Essex]]''.&lt;ref name="metro1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lougher |first=Sharon |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/875325-planet-dinosaur-ghost-hunting-with-the-only-way-is-essex-and-horizon-tv-picks |title=Planet Dinosaur, Ghost Hunting With The Only Way Is Essex and Horizon: TV preview |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Fielding appeared in an episode of ''Olly: Life on Murs'', in which she and [[Olly Murs]] visited a haunted house. In October 2012, Fielding appeared on [[BBC Radio 2]] and ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' on [[ITV1]] talking about the paranormal and her ghost hunting career. In these interviews Fielding stated that she will return to ''[[Most Haunted]]'' in 2013. In 2014, Fielding once again returned to hosting ''Most Haunted'', when a new series was produced for the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] channel, [[Really (TV channel)|Really]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a575477/most-haunted-to-be-revived-by-really-this-summer-yvette-fielding-to-host.html |title=Most Haunted to be revived by Really this summer, Yvette Fielding to host |publisher=Digital Spy |date=4 June 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Recent career===
In March 2013 Fielding appeared in the ''Peter Kay Sit down for Comic Relief'' comedy sketch as part of [[Red Nose Day 2013]]. In June 2013 she co-hosted [[Real Radio North West]]'s breakfast show, with Glen Hunt, as a stand in for the normal co-host, Lorna Bancroft.

As well as presenting ''Most Haunted'', Fielding now also ran and co-owned a tea shop in Manchester called 'Propertea', near to [[Manchester Cathedral]] until 2016 when she left to start her own tea shop.&lt;ref&gt;http://properteadeveloper.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Fielding was a celebrity homeowner in an episode of ''[[Through the Keyhole]]''.

In November 2015 Fielding took part in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] reality series ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/11/08/oops-im-a-celebrity-2015-star-accidentally-gives-away-that-shes-taking-part-5488198/|title=I'm A Celebrity 2015 line up will include Yvette Fielding after she lets slip on Twitter - Metro News|author=Duncan Lindsay|date=8 November 2015|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finished the show in tenth place after being evicted on 30 November.

Fielding, her husband [[Karl Beattie]], and her two children live on a farm in [[Sandbach]], [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandbach.org.uk/ |title=Sandbach Directory |accessdate=28 June 2008 |publisher=sandbach.org.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512073619/http://www.sandbach.org.uk/ |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is very fond of cars and owns 3 [[Aston Martin]]s, a [[Land Rover]], a [[Range Rover]] and a [[Hackney carriage|London Taxi]] (which she uses in ''Ghosthunting with...''), [[Porsche 911]] and a Porsche Chesil Speedster (which Karl, her husband, gave Yvette as a 40th Birthday present in America).{{cn|date=December 2016}} Fielding has stated that she has [[vitiligo]], a disorder that causes depigmentation in patches of her skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=Biddy |authorlink1=Biddy Baxter |last2=Barnes |first2=Edward |title=Blue Peter: The Inside Story |year=1989 |publisher=Ringpress |location=Letchworth |isbn=0-948955-50-3 |pages=214–216 |chapter=Chapter Nine: Crest of a Wave }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=My skin colour changed from dark olive to a bleach white.
