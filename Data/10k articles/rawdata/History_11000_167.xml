The red outline indicates the extent of the [[Bronze Age]] at the time.]]
The '''3rd millennium BC''' spanned the years 3000 through 2001 BC. This period of time corresponds to the Early to Middle [[Bronze Age]], characterized by the early [[empire]]s in the [[Ancient Near East]]. In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] is followed by the [[Old Kingdom]]. In Mesopotamia, the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] is followed by the [[Akkadian Empire]].

[[World population estimates|World population]] growth relaxes after the burst due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. 
World population is largely stable, at roughly 60 million, with a slow overall growth rate at roughly 0.03% p.a.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25, estimates 40 million at 5000 BC and 100 million at 1600 BC, for an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. over the Chalcolithic to Middle Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Bronze Age}}
The [[Bronze Age]] occurred roughly between 3000 BC and 2500 BC. The previous millennium had seen the emergence of advanced, urbanized civilizations, new [[bronze]] [[metallurgy]] extending the productivity of agricultural work, and highly developed ways of communication in the form of [[writing]]. In the 3rd millennium BC, the growth of these riches, both intellectually and physically, became a source of contention on a political stage, and rulers sought the accumulation of more wealth and more power. Along with this came the first appearances of mega architecture, [[imperialism]], organized absolutism and internal revolution.

The civilizations of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] in [[Mesopotamia]] became a collection of volatile [[city-state]]s in which warfare was common. Uninterrupted conflicts drained all available resources, energies and populations. In this millennium, larger empires succeeded the last, and conquerors grew in stature until the great [[Sargon of Akkad]] pushed his empire to the whole of [[Mesopotamia]] and beyond. It would not be surpassed in size until [[Assyria]]n times 1,500 years later.

In the [[Old Kingdom]] of [[Egypt]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]] were constructed and would remain the tallest and largest human constructions for thousands of years. Also in Egypt, [[pharaoh]]s began to posture themselves as living [[deity|gods]] made of an essence different from that of other [[human]] beings. Even in [[Europe]], which was still largely [[neolithic]] during the same period, the builders of [[megalith]]s were constructing giant monuments of their own. In the [[Near East]] and the [[Western world|Occident]] during the 3rd millennium BC, limits were being pushed by architects and rulers.

Towards the close of the millennium, Egypt became the stage of the first popular revolution recorded in history. After lengthy wars, the Sumerians recognized the benefits of unification into a stable form of national government and became a relatively peaceful, well-organized, complex technocratic state called the [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]. This dynasty was later to become involved with a wave of [[nomad]]ic invaders known as the [[Amorite]]s, who were to play a major role in the region during the following centuries.

In [[Ewe (people)|Ewe]] oral history, '''Amedzofe''' ({{IPA-ee|amedzoɸɛ|lang}}),{{Fix|text=missing tone}} literally 'origin/home of humanity', is one of the names for [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]]. Ketu, in present-day [[Benin]], was a central place in the history of the [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] peoples. The Gbe peoples originally were part of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] people of [[Nigeria]], but they were pressed westward by a series of wars between the 10th and the 13th century. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe-speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.

The '''American–Soviet friendship movement''' arose during the late 1920s and early 1930s among American leftist intellectuals whose goals were to promote the establishment of a joint [[United States|American]]–[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] alliance. From the end of [[World War II]] until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the movement focused on promoting friendly relations between the US and USSR by distributing information to the American public regarding daily life in the Soviet Union.

The movement had an effect in the USSR as well, through programs such as ''Moscow Mailbag'' on [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]].

'''Andreas Moustoxydis''' ({{lang-el|Ανδρέας Μουστοξύδης}}, 1785 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1860), sometimes [[latinisation of names|Latinized]] as '''Mustoxydes''' or in the Italian form '''Andrea Mustoxidi''', was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[historian]] and [[philologist]] from [[Corfu]].
[[File:Sui quattro cavalli della Basilica di s. Marco in Venezia.tif|thumb|''Sui quattro cavalli della Basilica di S. Marco in Venezia'', 1816]]

He studied at [[Pavia]], and in 1804 published a treatise on the history of Corfu titled ''Notizie per servire alla storia Corcirese dai tempi eroici al secolo XII''. This publication led to employment as [[historiography|historiographer]] of the [[Ionian Islands]], a position he maintained until 1819.

As a young man, he undertook an extended scientific journey to [[Italy]], followed by travels to [[France]] and [[Germany]]. In Italy, he discovered manuscripts of the [[rhetorician]] [[Isocrates]] at the [[Ambrosian Library|Ambrosian]] and [[Laurentian Library|Laurentian libraries]]. In the meantime, he published a two-volume work on the history of Corfu called ''Illustrazioni Corciresi'' (1811–14).

In 1820, he was appointed secretary to the Russian envoy at [[Turin]], and nine years later was named director of education by Greek president [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] (1776-1831). Following Kapodistrias' death, he returned to Corfu, and was restored to his former position as historiographer. Here, he founded the philological/historical journal ''Hellenomnemon''. At the time of his death, he was director of the department of education at [[Ionian Academy]].

As a philologist, Mustoxydis edited seven of Isocrates' orations, the [[scholia]] of [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]] on [[Plato]], and in collaboration with Demetrios Schinas of [[Constantinople]], he published a five volume edition of [[Ambrosian Library|Ambrosian]] Anecdota. In addition, he was author of an Italian translation of [[Herodotus]] (1822), and also published a number of papers on the 2nd century author [[Polyaenus]].

'''Barbara Haney Irvine''' (born 1944) is an American advocate for the preservation of women's [[historic site]]s. Irvine is the founding president of the Alice Paul Institute, named after American [[suffragist]] leader [[Alice Paul]], and is the executive director of the [[New Jersey Historic Trust]]. In 2007 she was an honoree for [[Women's History Month]] by the [[National Women's History Project]].&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Barbara Haney Irvine | work=Women's History Month | publisher=[[National Women's History Project]] | url=http://www.nwhp.org/whm/irvine_bio.php | accessdate=14 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic preservation==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"While Barbara Haney Irvine was initially influenced by Alice Paul, she has created her own powerful legacy through her tireless efforts to ensure that the stories of women’s lives and the places where women lived, worked and died will continue to inspire us and all future generations.'' - The National Women's History Project&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Alice Paul Institute and Paulsdale===
[[File:Paulsdale.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Paulsdale]]'', ca. 1958, the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul]]
Finding inspiration in the life of [[Alice Paul]], the [[suffragist]] and women's rights activist who initiated and ran the main actions and events of the 1910s Women's Voting Rights Movement which successfully lobbied for the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]] giving women the [[right to vote]], Irvine co-founded the Alice Paul Centennial Foundation in 1984. Now known as the Alice Paul Institute (API), the organization was formed to celebrate the [[centennial]] of Paul's birth.

For over 16 years Irvine served as volunteer president and board chair for API, leading successful campaigns to preserve historic objects related to Paul's life and to the lives of other women's activists. The group successfully raised over $58,000 to purchase a collection of Paul's books, papers and personal items, including a desk owned by [[Susan B. Anthony]] which Paul also used during her movement. The collection was then donated to the [[National Museum of American History]] in Washington, D.C., and the [[Schlesinger Library|Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;

Less than a year after the collection acquisition, API was offered the chance to purchase ''[[Paulsdale]]'', the birthplace and childhood home of Alice Paul, in [[Mount Laurel, New Jersey]]. The home was threatened by [[Subdivision (land)|housing developments]], which threatened to swallow the six-acre site. Irvine led the national campaign to preserve the site, raising over $1.8 million in private and public funds to purchase and rehabilitate the site, turning it into an interpretive site. In 1991, under the leadership of Irvine, the property was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt; Paulsdale continues to serve as a leadership development center for women and girls attesting to the ongoing inspiration of Paul's vision for women's equality.

===Other opportunities in heritage preservation===
During the Paulsdale campaign, Irvine started and chaired the first national conference about women's historic sites. This conference was held in 1994 at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and in 1999 the National Collaborative for Women's History Sites was founded. The Collaborative serves to preserve and interpret the sites and venues where women were key in [[American history]]. During this time, Irvine also assisted in the creation of the [[New Jersey Women's Heritage Trail]].&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt; Irvine has also served as a program content adviser for the New Jersey history program, ''Our Vanishing Past,'' produced by the [[New Jersey Network]].&lt;ref name="NJN"&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2010 |title=Credits &amp; underwriters |work=Our Vanishing Past |publisher=[[New Jersey Network]] |url=http://www.njn.net/television/specials/ourvanishingpast/about/credits.html |accessdate=14 Aug 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927145027/http://www.njn.net/television/specials/ourvanishingpast/about/credits.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current life==
In 2004 Irvine became the executive director of the [[New Jersey Historic Trust]], seeking to shift the Trusts' focus towards the preservation of [[Urban area|urban]] historic buildings. She is married to Geoffrey Irvine&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt; and lives in [[Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Inquirer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Edward Colimore | year=2004 | title=New Historic Trust leader sees urban sites as a priority Barbara Haney Irvine of Cinnaminson also aims to collaborate with the preservation community. | work=Historic Sites | publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] | url=http://articles.philly.com/2004-10-05/news/25389121_1_historic-preservation-heritage-philadelphia-program-historic-sites | accessdate=14 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2000 Irvine was appointed to the [[Women's Progress Commemorative Commission]], and in 2005 she was named "Woman of the Year" by [[Gamma Sigma Sigma]]. In 2007 she was an honoree for Women's History Month, sponsored by the National Women's History Project.&lt;ref name="WHM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11574">[[File:Chasublepurple.jpg|thumb|An [[Anglican priest]] wearing a modern chasuble over [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]]]]
The '''chasuble''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|zj|ʊ|b|əl}}) is the outermost [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] [[vestment]] worn by [[clergy]] for the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] in Western-tradition [[Christian]] churches that use full vestments, primarily in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] churches.{{efn|see [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]], Article XXIV}} In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the equivalent vestment is the [[phelonion]].

"The vestment proper to the priest celebrant at Mass and other sacred actions directly connected with Mass is, unless otherwise indicated, the chasuble, worn over the [[alb]] and [[Stole (vestment)|stole]]" (''General Instruction of the Roman Missal'', 337). Like the stole, it is normally of the [[Liturgical colours|liturgical colour]] of the Mass being celebrated.

== Origins ==
[[File:ChasubleToluca02.JPG|thumb|Eighteenth-century chasuble from Mexico on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Toluca]] ]]
The chasuble originated as a sort of conical [[poncho]], called in Latin a {{lang|la|casula}} or "little house", that was the common outer traveling garment in the [[late Roman Empire]]. It was simply a roughly oval piece of cloth, with a round hole in the middle through which to pass the head, that fell below the knees on all sides. It had to be gathered up on the arms to allow the arms to be used freely.

In its liturgical use in the West, this garment was folded up from the sides to leave the hands free. Strings were sometimes used to assist in this task, and the [[deacon]] could help the priest in folding up the sides of the vestment. Beginning in the 13th century, there was a tendency to shorten the sides a little. In the course of the 15th and the following century, the chasuble took something like its modern form, in which the sides of the vestment no longer reach to the ankle but only, at most, to the wrist, making folding unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tribe |first=Shawn |url=http://thenewliturgicalmovement.blogspot.com/2006/07/on-origin-and-development-of-vestments.html |title=The Development (and Future?) of Vestments in the Roman Rite |publisher=Thenewliturgicalmovement.blogspot.com |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the sixteenth century the chasuble, though still quite ample and covering part of the arms,{{efn|Images of Saint [[Ignatius Loyola]] and Saint [[Philip Neri]] usually show this form of chasuble. See, for instance, Tiepolo's eighteenth-century picture of the latter in the article [[Philip Neri]].}} had become less similar to its traditional shape than to that which prevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the chasuble was reduced to a broad [[scapular]], leaving the whole of the arms quite free, and was shortened also in front and back. Additionally, to make it easier for the priest to join his hands when wearing a chasuble of stiff (lined and heavily embroidered) material, in these later centuries the front was often cut away further, giving it the distinctive shape often called ''fiddleback''. Complex decoration schemes were often used on chasubles of scapular form, especially the back, incorporating the image of the [[Christian cross]] or of a saint; and rich materials such as silk, cloth of gold or brocade were employed, especially in chasubles reserved for major celebrations.

== Current usage ==

In the 20th century, there began to be a return to an earlier, more ample, form of the chasuble, sometimes called "Gothic", as distinguished from the "Roman" scapular form.{{sfn|Fortescue|O`Connell|Reid|2009|pp=32-33}}{{sfn|James|1934|p=}}{{sfn|Roulin|1950|p=}} This aroused some opposition, as a result of which the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] issued on 9 December 1925 a decree against it,''De forma paramentorum''{{sfn|Bouscaren|O'Connor|1953|p=262}} which it explicitly revoked with the declaration ''Circa dubium de forma paramentorum'' of 20 August 1957,&lt;ref name="AAS"&gt;''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-49-1957-ocr.pdf 49, 1957, p. 762]&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the matter to the prudent judgement of local Ordinaries. There exists a photograph of [[Pope Pius XI]] wearing the more ample chasuble while celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] as early as 19 March 1930.{{sfn|James|1934|p=}}

After the [[Second Vatican Council]], the more ample form became the most usually seen form of the chasuble, and the directions of the [[GIRM]] quoted above indicate that "it is fitting" that the beauty should come "not from abundance of overly lavish ornamentation, but rather from the material that is used and from the design. Ornamentation on vestments should, moreover, consist of figures, that is, of images or symbols, that evoke sacred use, avoiding thereby anything unbecoming" (n. 344). Hence, the prevalence today of chasubles that reach almost to the ankles, and to the wrists, and decorated with relatively simple symbols or bands and [[orphrey]]s. By comparison, "fiddleback" vestments were often extremely heavily embroidered or painted with detailed decorations or whole scenes depicted.

Use of scapular "Roman" chasubles, whether with straight edges or in "fiddleback" form, is sometimes associated with [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalism]].&lt;ref name="tele_Sacr"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Sacred Mysteries: Bring fiddleback chasubles back? | last = Howse | first = Christopher | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 10 May 2013 | accessdate = 2018-03-26 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/10050556/Sacred-Mysteries-Bring-fiddleback-chasubles-back.html | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some priests prefer them simply on grounds of taste and comfort, while for similar reasons some traditionalist priests prefer ampler chasubles of less stiff material.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] sometimes used chasubles of the transitional style common at the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdtprs.com/blog/2008/05/benedict-xvis-pentecost-sunday-again-a-lesson-through-vestments/ |title=Benedict XVI’s Pentecost Sunday: again a lesson through vestments |publisher=Wdtprs.com |date=11 May 2008 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Slavic tradition, though not in the Greek, the [[phelonion]], the [[Byzantine Rite]] vestment that corresponds to the chasuble, is cut away from the front and not from the sides, making it look somewhat like the western [[cope]].

== In Protestantism ==
Many, but not all, Lutheran and Anglican churches make use of the chasuble. &lt;!-- Many Anglicans (aka Episcopalians) would not primarily identify themselves as 'Protestants' but rather as ''Catholic and reformed'' that is, continuing ''both'' traditions. --&gt;  

The chasuble has always been used by the Lutheran denominations of Scandinavia, which also practise weekly Communion. [[German Lutherans]], who also practise weekly Communion, used it for the first two hundred years after the Reformation but later replaced it with the [[Geneva Gown]]. A variety of practices emerged in North America but by the mid-20th century, the alb and stole became widely customary. More recently, the chasuble has been readopted for Communion services in both Germany and North America.&lt;ref name="Lutheran"&gt;{{Cite web | title = What are vestments and paraments | author =  | work = Worship Formation &amp; Liturgical Resources: Frequently Asked Questions | date = 2013 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America | accessdate = 2018-03-27 | url = http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_are_vestments_and_paraments_Why_are_they_used.pdf | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[Stole_(vestment)|stole]], not the chasuble, that is the priestly vestment. 
 
The chasuble was never used by [[low-church]] Anglicans and rarely used by [[high-church]] Anglicans until the [[Oxford Movement]] in the 19th century, and even then not until the second generation of the Oxford Movement.

It is not customary and rarely seen in Protestantism outside of the liturgical churches.

==Life==
The exact date of his birth is unknown. Most probably, he joined Methodius as a young man following him later to the monastery on [[Mysian Olympus]]. According to his hagiography by [[Theophylact of Ohrid]], Clement knew the life of Methodius like no other. That is why most scholars think he was born in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the territory where Methodius served during his political career, i.e. that he was a Slav from Southern Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry3TCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA394 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Saints''], Fifth Edition Revised, David Farmer, OUP Oxford, 2011, {{ISBN|0191036730}}, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; According to others, the area of Southern Macedonia, where he was born, was then part of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&amp;pg=PA220 ''Butler's Lives of the Saints''], vol. 7, Alban Butler, Paul Burns, David Hugh Farmer, A&amp;C Black, 1995, {{ISBN|0860122565}}, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Macedonia became part of Bulgaria in 830s and in 840s, i.e when Clement was born.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia,

III.&lt;/ref&gt; A fringe view on his origin postulates that Clement was born in [[Great Moravia]]. This view is based on the lexicographical analysis of Clement's works.&lt;ref name="povod"&gt;Andrej ŠKOVIERA: Svätí slovanskí sedmopočetníci. Bratislava: Slovenský komitét slavistov - Slavistický ústav Jána Stanislava SAV, 2010,  {{ISBN|978-80-89489-02-2}}, pp. 110-113. Ján STANISLAV: Starosloviensky jazyk I. Bratislava: Slovenské pedagogické nakladateľstvo, 1978, pp. 20-21; 174, 219-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balkans850.png|thumb|right|240px|Southeastern Europe in the late 9th century.]]

Clement participated in the mission of Cyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. In 867 or 868 he became a priest in [[Rome]], ordained along with two other disciples of Cyril and Methodius, [[Saint Gorazd]] and [[Saint Naum]], by bishops [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]] and Gauderic. After the death of Cyril, Clement accompanied Methodius on his journey from [[Rome]] to [[Pannonia]] and Great Moravia. After the death of Methodius himself in 885, Clement headed the struggle against the German clergy in Great Moravia along with Gorazd. After spending some time in jail, he was expelled from Great Moravia and in 885 or 886 reached [[Belgrade]], then in the borders of Bulgaria together with [[Naum of Preslav]], Angelarius and possibly Gorazd (according to other sources, Gorazd was already dead by that time). Thereafter, the four of them were sent to the Bulgarian capital of [[Pliska]] where they were commissioned by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to instruct the future clergy of the state in the [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic language]].

After the adoption of [[Christianity]] in 865, religious ceremonies in Bulgaria were conducted in [[Greek language|Greek]] by clergy sent from the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the adoption of the Old Slavonic language as a way to preserve the political independence and stability of Bulgaria. With a view thereto, Boris made arrangements for the establishment of two literary academies where theology was to be taught in the Slavonic language. The first of the schools was to be founded in the capital, Pliska, and the second in the region of [[Kutmichevitsa]].

According to his hagiography by Theophylact of Ohrid, while Naum stayed in Pliska working on the foundation of the [[Preslav Literary School|Pliska Literary School]], Clement was commissioned by Boris I to organise the teaching of theology to future clergymen in Old Church Slavonic in the southwestern part of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], in the region then known as [[Kutmichevitsa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpVOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA169 ''The entry of the Slavs into Christendom: an introduction to the medieval history of the Slavs''], A. P. Vlasto, CUP Archive, 1970, {{ISBN|0-521-07459-2}}, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; For a period of seven years (between 886 and 893) Clement taught some 3,500 disciples in the Slavonic language and the Glagolitic alphabet. At that time, Clement translated Christian literature into Old Church Slavonic, and in this way, he and his co-workers laid the foundations of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;Alban Butler et al., Butler's Lives of the Saints, Volume 7, A&amp;C Black, 1995, {{ISBN|0860122565}}, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In 893 he was ordained archbishop of Drembica, Velika (bishopric). Upon his death in 916 he was buried in his monastery, [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|Saint Panteleimon]], in Ohrid. Soon after he was canonized as a saint by the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Кирило-Методиевска енциклопедия: И-O, том 2, Институт за литература (Българска академия на науките), Университетско издателство "Св. Климент Охридски", 1995, стр. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the [[South Slavs]] into neighbouring Byzantine culture, which promoted the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, R. J. (2005). A Concise History of Bulgaria (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-61637-9}}. p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first quarter of the 10th century, the [[ethnonym]] “Bulgarians” was adopted by the Slavic tribes in most of Macedonia, while their names were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Early in the tenth century, the name “Bulgarians”, in its wider meaning, was widespread and used throughout the country, while the names of the separate Slav tribes were abandoned. An interesting instance of the use of the name “Bulgarians” is found in the so-called “Expanded Biography of Clement of Ochrida”... It, therefore, mirrors developments and the situation in the south-western Bulgarian territories (Macedonia) in the beginning of the tenth century. It is this disciple of Clement, namely, who wrote in the tenth century, that called himself and his compatriots by the name “Bulgarians”. This is obvious from a text in the biography, which glorifies Clement that he gave everything, related to the church “to us, the Bulgarians”. This means that the name “Bulgarians” was already firmly established among the population in the south-western Bulgarian territories early in the tenth century.'' D. Angelov, The Formation of the Bulgarian Nation, Summary, Издателство Наука и изкуство, София, 1971, pp. 413-414.&lt;/ref&gt; Clement's life's work played a significant role in this transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 1, From Ancient Times to the Ottoman Invasions), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, {{ISBN|1443888435}}, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Saint Clement and Pantheleimon Ohrid. Tomb of Clement.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Tomb of Saint Clement at [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|Saint Panteleimon]] Church, [[Ohrid]]]]
Saint Clement of Ohrid was one of the most prolific and important writers in Old Church Slavonic. He is credited with the ''Panonic Hagiography of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius''. Clement also translated the ''Flower Triode'' containing church songs sung from Easter to Pentecost and is believed to be the author of the ''Holy Service'' and the ''Life of St. Clement of Rome'', as well as of the oldest service dedicated to St. Cyril and St. Methodius. The invention of the Cyrillic alphabet is also usually ascribed to him although the alphabet is most likely to have been developed at the [[Preslav]] Literary School at the beginning of the 10th century (see [[Cyrillic script]]).

The first modern Bulgarian university, [[Sofia University]], was named after Clement upon its foundation in 1888. The Macedonian National and University Library, founded on November 23, 1944, also bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;The official site of the [http://www.nubsk.edu.mk/ National and University Library "St. Kliment Ohridski"], retrieved on October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The University in [[Bitola]] ([[Republic of Macedonia]]), established in 1979, is named after Clement, as well as the Bulgarian scientific base, [[St. Kliment Ohridski Base|St. Kliment Ohridski]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]] of [[Antarctica]].

In November 2008, the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] donated part of Clement's relics to the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as a sign of good will.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ibox.bg/news/id_914559285&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018 was announced that in the ruins of a medieval monastery near the village of [[Ravna, Varna Province|Ravna]] in [[Provadiya Municipality]], the signature of Saint Clement was identified on a stone plate with a large amount of graffiti on it. The signature is dated as of April 24, 889. The finding gives reason to assume that the disciples of Saint Cyril and Methodius were settled here, initially after their reception in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Константин Събчев, Откриха подписа на Климент Охридски.

The '''Duke's Company''' was a theatre company chartered by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at the start of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration era]], 1660. [[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant]] was manager of the company under [[James II of England|Prince James]], [[Duke of York]]'s patronage. During this period, theatres began to flourish again after being closed due to restrictions throughout the [[Interregnum (1649–60)|Interregnum]] and [[English Civil War]].

==History==
The Duke's Company was one of the two theatre companies (the other being the [[King's Company]]) that were chartered by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] at the start of the [[English Restoration]] era, when the London theatres re-opened after their [[London theatre closure 1642|eighteen-year closure]] (1642&amp;ndash;60) during the [[English Civil War]] and the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]].

The Duke's Company had the patronage of the King's younger brother Prince James, [[Duke of York]] and [[Duke of Albany|of Albany]] (later King [[James II of England|James II &amp; VII]]). It was managed by Sir [[William Davenant]]. The company started at the old [[Salisbury Court Theatre]], and occasionally used the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] in [[Drury Lane]]. After a year, the actors moved to a new theatre in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], a building on Portugal Street that had previously been [[Lisle's Tennis Court]] (it opened on 18 June 1661). There they were joined by [[Thomas Betterton]], who quickly became their star.{{Sfn|Halliday|1964|p=145}} In December 1660, the King granted the Duke's Company the exclusive rights to ten of [[Shakespeare's plays]]: ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''.{{Efn|In 1668, five more Shakespearean plays were added: ''[[Timon of Athens]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', and the ''Henry VI'' trilogy.}} In 1661, their first year at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the company revived ''Hamlet'', in a production that employed the innovation of stage scenery. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw their production on 24 August; he described it as "done with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton did the Prince's part beyond imagination".{{Sfn|Halliday|1964|p=62}}

Davenant tried to make the most of the limited Shakespearean materials available to him. In 1662 he staged ''[[The Law Against Lovers]]'', a heavily adapted version of ''Measure for Measure'' that blended in characters from ''Much Ado About Nothing''. It was the earliest of the many Shakespearean adaptations produced during the Restoration era and the eighteenth century.

The company also acted some of the plays in the canon of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and his collaborators. Yet the rival King's Company under [[Thomas Killigrew]] controlled more of the "Old Stock Plays", the traditional repertory of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]] (Davenant even had to petition for the right to perform his own pre-1642 plays). The Duke's Company was driven to seek out new work by a new generation of writers, and to experiment with new forms and styles.{{Sfn|Fisk|2000|pp=43–4}} The company performed the plays of Davenant, [[John Dryden]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[George Etheredge]], [[Thomas Shadwell]] and others; it produced [[Aphra Behn]]'s plays from 1670 to 1682. The company also acted many translations and adaptations of French and other foreign plays; their 1662 production of [[Sir Samuel Tuke, 1st Baronet|Sir Samuel Tuke]]'s ''The Adventures of Five Hours'', a version of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón's]] comedy ''Los Empeños de Seis Horas'', ran for thirteen straight performances and was the first great hit of Restoration drama.

Like the King's Company, the Duke's pioneered the use of the first English actresses in the early 1660s. Their standout performer was [[Mary Saunderson]], later Mrs. Betterton, who acted many of the lead female roles in Shakespeare's plays. Anne Gibbs (later married to [[Thomas Shadwell]]) and Mary Lee  also had noteworthy careers.{{Sfn|Wilson|1958|p=8}}

[[Samuel Pepys]] saw  many of their productions, and recorded them in his Diary. King Charles witnessed many of their productions too; in a break with past practice, the King sometimes came to the theatre to see the plays, which in previous reigns had never happened. (Instead, the acting companies had always gone to Court to perform.) In its busiest seasons, the company staged fifty different plays in a year, ten of them new works.

After Davenant's death in April 1668, Betterton took command of the company, in collaboration with Davenant's widow Lady Mary Davenant.{{Sfn|Bush-Bailey|2006|pp=28–33}} Their management team expanded its strategies to ensure success: the company engaged in three consecutive (and profitable) summer seasons in [[Oxford]] starting in 1669. On 9 November 1671 the company moved into a new theatre in [[Dorset Garden Theatre|Dorset Garden]], sometimes called the Queen's Theatre, "the most elegant of all the Restoration playhouses...".{{Sfn|Fisk|2000|p=6}} The Duke's Company exploited the scenic capacities of the Dorset Garden Theatre to produce many of the [[Restoration spectacular]]s and the early [[opera]]s and semi-operas that characterized the Restoration era. The most successful of the company's semi-operas was the Dryden/ Davenant adaptation of ''The Tempest'', which premiered on 7 November 1667. From 1675 on, [[Elizabeth Barry]] acted with the Duke's Company and became recognized as one of the stars of the era.

Both the Duke's and King's Companies suffered poor attendance during the turmoil of the [[Popish Plot]] period, 1678&amp;ndash;81. When the King's Company fell into difficulties due to mismanagement, the Duke's Company joined with them to form the [[United Company]] in 1682, under the Duke's Company's management. The United Company began performances in November of that year. The King's Company theatre, the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Theatre Royal]] in Drury Lane, was used mainly for plays, while the Duke's Dorset Garden theatre was devoted to operas and spectaculars.

[[John Downes (prompter)|John Downes]] was the [[prompter (theatre)|prompter]] of the Duke's Company from 1662 to 1706. In 1708 he published his ''Roscius Anglicanus'', the "main source of information about the Restoration theatre"{{Sfn|Halliday|1964|p=140}} for later generations.

==Company Structure==
===Management===
====Sir William Davenant====
Sir William Davenant was the first manager for the Duke's Company. Moreover, he was the patent holder and fundamentally the creator of the theatre group. After Killigrew had been granted his patent for the King's Company, Davenant drafted a document to give him and Killigrew duel monopoly over the theatre companies. Davenant could do this because he was rewarded with a warrant from Charles I during 1639 to build his own theatre, which whilst defunct still added gravitas to his claims. Furthermore, his masque work with Charles I, also being the writer for the two operas performed during the Puritan regime certainly cemented him as an accomplished and reliable manager to the second company. Thus the Duke's company was created.

Davenant, with a background in masque, grew to believe that spectacle was the way forward for British theatre. Mary Edmond comments that he "realised very early on that play goers would soon be demanding scenic theatres".{{Sfn|Edmond|1987|p=141}} Thus he went forward with creating theatre spaces that used changeable scenes, as well as always updating these scenes to make performances feel fresh and new for the audiences. During his time as manager he set the standard for the Duke's company. After being lumbered with only 23 plays in comparison to the King's 108,{{Sfn|Van Lennep|1960|p=cxliii}}  Davenant turned his company in the direction of new writing and adaptations of pre-restoration work that he did have. He worked with writers such as George Etheredge, John Dryden and Roger Boyle.

Not only did he attempt to keep the work performed for the Duke's men modern, he also had plans to keep the theatres as functional and of the highest quality. This new and exciting theatre manifested as Dorset Garden. Whilst this was not created until after his death, he managed to fund the project. He did this by selling 7 7/10ths of his shares to people at a price range of £600 - £800. Then sharers then managed to raise the rest of the substantial sum of £9000 which it is roughly considered to have cost.{{Sfn|Van Lennep|1960}}

====Henry Harris and Thomas Betterton====
The theatre house was built under the next set of managers for the Duke's company. This was the collaboration of Thomas Betterton and Henry Harris under the watch of Davenant's wife. Both Betterton and Harris were star players of Davenant. They continued the legacy of the Duke's company well. The theatre house that was erected during their time as managers was state of the art, boasting machinery, something that was no doubt inspired by European theatres. Furthermore, they continued to boast new writers including Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway and once again John Dryden. Unlike Davenant, neither wrote their own work. However, unlike the King's Company, the second managers wanted to make the transition as smooth as possible. Their decisions had "been reviewed by the board of sharing actors as well as by representatives of the Davenant family".{{Sfn|Van Lennep|1960|p=cxliii}}{{Sfn|Milhous|2014}} Thus we see that despite having recognizable influence within the company, the duo didn't want to alienate or anyone involved in the company.

===Ownership===
As for who own the company, it doesn’t appear that there was one owner. Instead the companies were owned by shareholders who all had some say in the running of the company, and who helped with raising funds. Indeed, the main shareholder and patent holder should be considered the principal owner, which would therefore mean William Davenant would be the owner for the period of 1660 – 1668. Thereafter Lady Davenant would be considered the owner, with Betterton and Harris as the managers. William Van Lennep supports this assumption writing "The formal structure, then, of this type of arrangement consisted of a proprietor (the largest shareholder), who was the master of the company in both theatrical and financial affairs; a small number of sharing actors, who received a proportion of the profits after the gross receipts had provided for the major expenses; and a large number of actors on salary."{{Sfn|Van Lennep|1960|pp=lviii–lix}}

===Joining the Company===
People joined the company by buying shares within the company, as "the companies were a business, and shares in them were sold to raise money needed to furnish theatres, hire personnel, and produce plays".{{Sfn|Fisk|2000|p=4}} Therefore, it is assumed that only those of a certain class could join the company.

===Least Influential Member===
In 1660, for the first time women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage. However, the significance of this at the time was evidently not as apparent. One can assume this because the records of this precise actress that performed is yet to be found; therefore suggesting that it was not recorded, undermining the influence of women performing in the theatre. 
An example of one of the women that was first to perform was Mrs. Eastland. Although her name appears on the prompter of Killigrew's original actresses, "her name appears on no dramatis personae until 1669 and she only ever played minor parts".{{Sfn|Howe|1992|p=24}} In addition, she only appears on the cast list in 1669; nine years after the start of the company. 
In spite of the allowance of women in the theatre, it is evident that the patriarchal nature of the theatre was still very apparent. For men, the acting profession was a respected and successful career, however, "no woman with serious pretentions to respectability would countenance a stage career".{{Sfn|Howe|1992|p=8}} But due to the nature and demands of being an actress; learning lines quickly, and needing to have a civilised etiquette meant that the company had to find women of a middle ground; this suggests the class differences, and the overall significance of men compared to women within the company.

==Plays==
The new theatre the Duke's Playhouse opened on 28 June 1661 in Dorset Gardens, with the spectacular The Siege of Rhodes. The new theatre encompassed new possibilities for the company to create rich and dramatic theatre. "A small stage and proscenium arch; the scenery consisted of wings fronting pairs of large painted flats which could be moved along grooves set in the floor and flies of the stage".{{Sfn|Edmond|2004}} This was the first public playhouse in England to use such innovation and so impacted the choice of play. The plays became spectacles; the Siege of Rhodes being a "magnificent production".{{Sfn|Edmond|2004}} Other productions such as Hamlet (1661), Love and Honour (1661) and The Tempest (1667) characterise the Company's restoration spectaculars and operas. Downes remarked that the adaptation of Love and Honour, originally from 1643, in 1661 was "Richly Cloth'd" with Bretterton robed in fine garments and the set extraordinary.

===Shakespeare===
The Duke's Company were granted exclusive rights to ten Shakespearean plays; Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, Measure for Measure, Henry VII and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. This, combined with the talented actors, such as Betterton, allowed the company to create adaptations of the Shakespeare's within the playhouse.

===Davenant===
William Davenant, as a manager and on good terms with the King, was able to use his patency and Betterton's talents to produce performances of his own plays. Killigrew and Davenant planned to put on tragedies, comedies, plays, operas, and all other similar entertainments, setting reasonable admission charges to meet "the great expences of scenes, musick and new decorations as have not bin formerly used".{{Sfn|Edmond|1987|pp=143–4}}

===Censorship===
The King's theatre monopoly was controlled by the legislative power the Lord Chamberlain. Chamberlain had the power to censor dramatic and printed work, having patents submit work 14 days before the performance.
The Duke's Company found themselves subject to Chamberlain's legislation, due to the comic performer and renowned improvisor, Edward Angel. During the run of Dryden and Davenant's The Tempest, 1667-8, Lord Chamberlain issued a warrant for the arrest of the comedian Edward Angel a member of the Dukes Company. Although the reasons behind the order remain unclear, one possible explanation is that Angel had caused offence with his talent for improvisation and unscripted political satire.

The licensing act even controlled the schedule and permitted attendees. For example, on 6 February 1720 he ordered Gay's new pastoral tragedy be acted "immediately after Hughes" The Siege of Damascus.

==Actors==
===Thomas Betterton===
Thomas Patrick Betterton (ca. 1635 – 28 April 1710), English Actor in Dukes Theatre Company, son of an undercook for Charles I, born in London.

====Early Life and Apprenticeship====
As a young boy, Betterton's education is unclear, however he is described to have had a "great propensity" for reading, which may explain why he was bound to Sir William Davenant's publisher, John Holden, in an apprenticeship. He may have performed in Davenant's early-unlicensed plays, however unable to sustain acting as a full career due to the plays infrequency due to the uncertain status of theatre during the Interregnum (1649 - 1660). Documents link Betterton's name to working with John Rhodes, a bookseller, during this time. John Downes, a theatre prompter for Davenant's acting troupe, first documents Betterton's participation in theatre in 1659, Drury Lane. Downes accredited Betterton's talents saying; "His voice being audible strong, full and Articulate, as in the Prime of his Acting".

====Acting career====
On 6 October 1660, Betterton was a part of the Kings Company led by Thomas Killigrew. However, by 5 November, he had moved to a formal sharing agreement with Davenant to constitute the Dukes Company, as he may have felt his talent was overshadowed in the Kings Company. Betterton, in the Dukes Company became one of the most famous actors of the Restoration period. He was Samuel and Elizabeth Pepys's favourite actor; "He is called by us both, the best actor in the world."{{Efn|Pepys, 4 Nov 1661}}

The Dukes theatre, with the help of Betterton's acting, were recognized for passing on a "traditional" and "correct" way to perform older plays, such as Shakespeare. The actors in the company owned some of the repeat roles as long as they remained in the company, which meant the actors could create and sustain their interpretations of the characters. Betterton is noted today as being "the first classical actor".{{Sfn|Roberts|2010|p=1}}

Charles Gildon quotes Betterton as saying the company were "obliged to make [their] Study [their] business", and even learning the parts before rehearsals to "enter thoroughly into the Nature of the Part".{{Sfn|Roberts|2010|p=15}} We can see here an early Stanislavskian approach to acting, where Betterton even "kept his mind in the same temperament as his character required".{{Efn|Cibber, 7.301}}

Betterton undertook the responsibility of many lead roles in both Shakespeare, such as Hamlet, and in newer plays, such as Solyman the Magnificent.  He is described as versatile actor, being able to play both villainous and comedic roles, however he did not play farce. In Milhous's "Census" there are 180 documented appearances of Betterton in the Dukes company however the real figure is most likely higher as 128 plays are left undocumented.

Betterton's most successful role in the Dukes Company was Hamlet, which he first played in the aftermath of Charles II's coronation in 1661. John Downes writes that Davenant had seen Joseph Taylor act the part before the interregnum and then taught Betterton "in every particle of it". The Dukes Companies reparatory system was commercially influenced to catch and shape the social mood of the time. As the Dukes Company had royal monopoly, he created a king in Hamlet to reflect the positive influence of the return of the monarchy; his Hamlet was valiant.

On 7 April 1608 Sir Davenant died, and Betterton and Augustus Harris, being elected by all parties involved in the theatre, took over as administrators until 1677 whilst the heir to the company, Charles Davenant was too inexperienced. They successfully took control and led the construction of the Dorset Garden Theatre in 1671.

Betterton throughout his career travelled to France regularly to learn about the Spectaculars and foreign Operas in order to increase the Dukes repertoire. However, Bettertons role in the spectaculars remained as chief consultant as he could neither sing nor dance, but he continued performing in traditional plays.
 
Betterton as a writer is never recorded to have created any original texts, however he took a key role in production adaptation and revamping old texts, which meant combining plot lines. He worked very closely with contemporary playwrights of the time such as Aphra Behn and John Dryden, and very much encouraged the development of their new works.

====Private Life====
Much of Betterton's private life and character remains a mystery, as he did not leave behind any personal journals or records. His shadowy reputation is encouraged by Pepys description of him as "a very sober, serious man, and studious and humble".{{Efn|Pepys, 2 October 1662}}
Betterton married Mary Saunderson, an actress in the Dukes theatre, on 24 December 1662. Together, they accumulated shares within the Dukes Theatre Company by re-investing their money in part-shares. They never had children of their own, however had two adopted daughters who were both trained for the theatre. There is suggestion that Betterton may have fallen ill from 16 October 1667 to 6 July 1668, as Pepys notes in his diary; "Betterton, ill of fever- did not return for several months".

'''Eugen Joseph Weber''' (April 24, 1925 in [[Bucharest]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] – May 17, 2007 in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles]], [[California]]) was a Romanian-born American historian with a special focus on Western Civilization.

Weber became a historian because of his interest in politics, an interest dating back to at least the age of 12. He described his political awakening as a realization of social injustices: "It was my vague dissatisfaction with social hierarchy, the subjection of servants and peasants, the diffuse violence of everyday life in relatively peaceful country amongst apparently gentle folk".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''My France'', p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber's books and articles have been translated into several languages. He earned many accolades for his scholarship, including membership in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[Fulbright Program]]. His 1,300-page ''Modern History of Europe: Men, Cultures, and Societies from the Renaissance to the Present'' (1971) was described "a phenomenal job of synthesis and interpretation that reflects Eugen's wide and deep learning," by his UCLA history colleague Hans Rogger.&lt;ref&gt;UCLA, In Memoriam&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his distinguished American Awards and honors, he was awarded the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] in 1977 for his contribution to French culture.

==Career==
He was born the son of Sonia and Emmanuel Weber, a well-to-do industrialist. When he was ten, his parents hired a private tutor. But the tutor did not stay long. From the age of 10 Weber was already reading The [[Three Musketeers]] by [[Alexander Dumas]], adventure novels by [[Karl May]], poetry by [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Homer]]. He was also reading [[George Sand]], [[Jules Verne]] and "every cheap paperback I could afford".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} At age 12, he was sent to boarding school in [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]], in south-eastern England, and later to [[Ashville College]], [[Harrogate]].&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;Burns (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, he served with the British Army in Belgium, Germany and India between 1943 and 1947 rising to the rank of captain. Afterward, Weber studied history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]]'' (Sciences Po) in Paris.&lt;ref name="Burns"/&gt;

In 1950, Weber married Jacqueline Brument-Roth.  He graduated with a BA in 1950 and an MA from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1954. He then taught at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]], Cambridge (1953–1954) and the [[University of Alberta]] (1954–1955) before settling in the United States, where he taught first at the [[University of Iowa]] (1955–1956) and then, until 1993 on his retirement, at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At Cambridge University, Eugen Weber studied with the historian [[David Thomson (historian)|David Thomson]]. He studied for his PhD but the dissertation was refused because the outside examiner, [[Alfred Cobban]], of the University of London, gave a negative review of his dissertation, saying it lacked sufficient archival sources.

Eugen Weber wrote a column titled "LA Confidential" for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/20/local/me-weber20&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote for several French popular newspapers and, in 1989, presented an American public television series, ''The Western Tradition'', which consisted of fifty-two lectures of 30 minutes each.

==Methodology==

Weber took a pragmatic approach to history. He once observed: "Nothing is more concrete than history, nothing less interested in theories or in abstract ideas. The great historians have fewer ideas about history than amateurs do; they merely have a way of ordering their facts to tell their story. It isn’t theories they look for, but information, documents, and ideas about how to find and handle them."&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Weber, "History is What Historians Do," ''The New York Times'', July 22, 1984 [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/22/books/history-is-what-historians-do.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Weber is associated with several important academic arguments. His book: ''Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France 1870-1914'' is a classic presentation of [[modernization theory]]. Although other historians such as [[Henri Mendras]] had put forward similar theories about the [[modernization]] of the French countryside, Weber's book was amongst the first to focus on changes in the period between 1870 and 1914. Weber emphasizes that well into the 19th century few French citizens regularly spoke French, but rather regional languages or dialects such as [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Flemish]], [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], and [[Corsican language|Corsican]]. Even in French-speaking areas provincial loyalties often transcended the putative bond of the nation. Between 1870 and 1914, Weber argued, a number of new forces penetrated the previously isolated countryside. These included the judicial and school systems, the army, the church, railways, roads, and a market economy. The result was the wholesale transformation of the population from "peasants," basically ignorant of the wider nation, to Frenchmen.

His book ''Apocalypses: Prophecies, Cults, and Millennial Beliefs through the Ages'' chronicles "apocalyptic visions and prophecies from Zarathustra to yesterday . . . .  beginning with the ancients of the West and the Orient and, especially . . . the Jews and earliest Christians," finding that "an absolute belief in the end of time, when good would do final battle with evil, was omnipresent," inspiring "Crusades, scientific discoveries, works of art, voyages such as those of Columbus, rebellions" and reforms including American abolitionism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674003958&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber proclaimed in "The Western Tradition" lectures of 1989:

"... here we are at the end of the 20th century with a lot of people lonely in a Godless world—and now they are denied not only God but the solid substance of judgment and perception". "The world has always been disgracefully managed but now you no longer know to whom to complain." 
 
After he traversed the whole spectrum of western thought, tradition, civilization, and progress in The Western Tradition, Weber pointed at some of the profound ancient lessons from the Bible and laments the fact that many people today do not read it themselves. As an agnostic, Weber viewed the Bible primarily as an important piece of historical literature, calling it: "the epitome of wisdom, violence, high aspiration, and the hurtful achievements of mankind".  He concluded his final lecture in the Western Tradition series by praising Western man as Promethean and then with Wordsworth's poetic phrase,  "we feel that we are greater than we know."

A 2010 biography by Stanford Franklin, "Eugen Weber The Greatest Historian of our Times: Lessons of Greatness to the Future" presents Weber's life and works in grandiose terms as the greatest modern historian.

'''HMT ''Empire Windrush''''', originally '''MV ''Monte Rosa''''', was a passenger liner and [[cruising (maritime)|cruise ship]] launched in Germany in 1930. She was operated as a German cruise ship under the name ''Monte Rosa'' in the 1930s, and as a German navy [[troopship]] during [[World War II]]. At the end of the war, she was acquired by the United Kingdom Government as a [[prize of war]] and renamed the ''Empire Windrush''. In British service, she continued to be used as a troopship until March 1954, when the vessel caught fire and sank in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the loss of four crew.

''Empire Windrush'' is best remembered today for bringing one of the first large groups of post-war [[British West Indies|West Indian]] immigrants to the United Kingdom, carrying 1027 passengers and two [[stowaway]]s on a voyage from [[Jamaica]] to [[London]] in 1948.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43808007 |title=Windrush: Who exactly was on board? |last1=Rodgers |first1=Lucy|last2=Ahmed |first2=Maryam |publisher=BBC News|date=April 27, 2018 |website=[[BBC News]]|access-date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mead" /&gt; Of these, 802 passengers gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean of whom 693 intended to settle in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BBCNews" /&gt; [[British African-Caribbean people|British Caribbean people]] who came to the United Kingdom in the period after World War II are sometimes referred to as the [[Windrush generation]].

==Background and description==
''Empire Windrush'', under the name MV ''Monte Rosa'', was the last of five almost-identical
[[:de:Monte-Klasse (1924)|Monte-class passenger ships]] (in German) that were built by [[Blohm + Voss|Blohm &amp; Voss]] in [[Hamburg]] between 1924 and 1931 for [[Hamburg Süd]] (Hamburg South American Steam Shipping Company).

During the 1920s, Hamburg Süd believed there would be a lucrative business in carrying German immigrants to South America and the first two ships (MV ''Monte Sarmiento'' and MV ''Monte Olivia'') were built for that purpose. Passenger accommodation was single-class, with space for 1150 in cabins and 1350 in dormitories. In the event, the immigrant trade never materialized and the two ships were re-purposed as [[cruise ship]]s, operating in Northern European waters, the Mediterranean and around South America.&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013" /&gt;

This proved to be a great success. Until then, cruise holidays had been the preserve of the rich. But by providing modestly-priced cruises, Hamburg Süd was able to profitably cater to a large new clientèle.&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013" /&gt; Another ship was commissioned to cater for the demand – the MV [[SS Monte Cervantes|''Monte Cervantes'']]. However, she struck an uncharted rock and sank after only two years in service. Despite this, Hamburg Süd remained confident in the design and quickly ordered two more ships, the MV [[MV Monte Pascoal (1930)|''Monte Pascoal'']] and the MV ''Monte Rosa'';&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Schwerdtner|title=German Luxury Ocean Liners: From Kaiser Willhelm to Aidastella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2GoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT286|date=30 October 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1471-7|pages=286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monte Rosa'' was launched on 4 December 1930.

The five Monte-class vessels were [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] [[motor ship]]s, with four 1,436 [[nominal horsepower|nhp]] four-stroke diesel engines driving two propellers. At the time, the use of diesel engines was highly unusual in ships of this size, which would have been typically [[Steamship|steam-powered]]. The first two to be launched  ''Monte Sarmiento'' and ''Monte Olivia'' were in fact the first large diesel-powered passenger ships to see service with a German operator.&lt;ref name="Prager1977"&gt;{{cite book|last= Prager|first=Hans Georg|title=Blohm &amp; Voss: ships and machinery for the world|year=1977|publisher=Brassey's : Distributed by Seeley|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of diesel engines reflected the experience Blohm &amp; Voss had gained by building Diesel-powered [[U-boats]] during [[World War 1]].&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013" /&gt; The ships' top speed was {{convert|14|kn|km/h}} (around half the speed of the large trans-Atlantic Ocean liners of the era) but this was considered adequate for both the immigrant and cruise business.&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013" /&gt;

''Monte Rosa'' was {{convert|500|ft|3|in|m|2|abbr=on}} long, with a beam of {{convert|65|ft|7|in|m|2|abbr=on}}. She had a depth of {{convert|37|ft|8|in|m|2|abbr=on}}. The ship was assessed at {{GRT|13,882}}, {{NRT|7,788}}.

==Early history==
''Monte Rosa'', was delivered to Hamburg Süd in 1931, which operated her as a cruise ship, traveling to Norway, the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013" /&gt; After the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime came to power in Germany in 1933, she was operated as part of the state-owned ''[[Kraft durch Freude]]'' (Strength Through Joy) programme, which provided leisure activities and cheap holidays. She ran aground off [[Thorshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]], on 23 July 1934,&lt;ref name=Times230734a&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=German liner aground |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=23 July 1934 |page_number=14 |issue=46814 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was refloated the next day.&lt;ref name=Times240734a&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=German liner refloated |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=24 July 1934 |page_number=11 |issue=46815 |column=B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German World War 2 service==
At the start of World War 2, ''Monte Rosa'' was allocated for military use. She was used as a barracks ship at [[Stettin]], then as a troopship for the [[invasion of Norway]] in April 1940. She was later used as an accommodation and recreational ship attached to the [[battleship]] ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'', stationed in the north of [[Norway]], from where ''Tirpitz'' and her flotilla attacked the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied convoys en route to Russia]]. In 1942, she was one of several ships used for the [[Jewish deportees from Norway during World War II|deportation of Norwegian Jewish people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1942-1945/roundups-of-norwegian-jews |title=Roundups of Norwegian Jews — United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |website=www.ushmm.org |language=en |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a total of 46 people from Norway to Denmark, including the Polish-Norwegian businessman and humanitarian [[Moritz Rabinowitz]]. Of the 46 deportees carried on ''Monte Rosa'', all but two died in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=Ottosen&gt;{{cite book |last= Ottosen |first= Kristian |authorlink= Kristian Ottosen |editor= |others= |title= I slik en natt; historien om deportasjonen av jøder fra Norge |year= 1994 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |publisher= Aschehoug |location= Oslo |language= Norwegian|isbn= 82-03-26049-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 334–360 |chapter= Vedlegg 1 |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=regjeringen&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Inndragning av jødisk eiendom i Norge under den 2. verdenskrig |date=June 1997 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/NOUer/1997/NOU-1997-22.html?id=141043 |format= |accessdate=2008-01-16 |edition= |series= Norges offentlige utredninger |publisher=Statens forvaltningstjeneste |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian|isbn= 82-583-0437-2 |oclc= |doi= |id=NOU 1997:22 ("Skarpnesutvalget") |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 1944, ''Monte Rosa'' was attacked by British and Canadian  [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The strike was mounted for the explicit purpose of sinking her after British Intelligence had obtained details of the ship's movements.&lt;ref name="RCAF" /&gt; The ship was traveling south, escorted by two [[Vorpostenboot|flak ships]], a destroyer and by German fighters.&lt;ref name="RCAF"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7596341 |title=The Official history of the Royal Canadian Air Force. |date=1980 |publisher=University of Toronto Press in co-operation with the Dept. of National Defence and the Canadian Govt.

The attack took place close to the Norwegian island of [[Utsira (island)|Utsira]]. The RAF crews claimed two torpedo hits on Monte Rosa; the ship was also struck by eight rockets and by canon-fire.&lt;ref name="Grove2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Grove|title=German Capital Ships and Raiders in World War II: From Scharnhorst to Tirpitz, 1942–1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksn8tNpp0IC&amp;pg=RA2-PA38|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5283-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCAF" /&gt;  One German [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] fighter was claimed shot down and two Beaufighters were lost,&lt;ref name="Times-1944-04-01"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Liner Torpedoed off Norway |day_of_week=Saturday |date=1 April 1944 |page_number=4 |issue=49820}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the two crew of one survived to become prisoners of war.&lt;ref name="RCAF" /&gt; Despite her damage, ''Monte Rosa'' was able to reach [[Aarhus]] in Denmark on 3 April.&lt;ref name="RCAF" /&gt; 

In June 1944, [[Max Manus]] and  [[Gregers Gram]], members of [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] (a British Army sabotage and resistance unit composed of Norwegians), attached [[Limpet mine]]s to ''Monte Rosa's'' hull while the ship was in [[Oslo]] harbour. They had learned the ship was to carry 3000 German troops back to Germany and their purpose was to sink her during the trip.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard O'Connor|title=Sabotage in Norway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmcNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|date=29 June 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-291-38022-4|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair had twice bluffed their way into the dock area by posing as electricians, then hid for three days as they waited for the ship to arrive. After it docked, they paddled out to her from their hiding place on an inflatable rubber boat and attached their mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.lookandlearn.com/blog/31671/max-manus-leader-of-the-norwegian-resistance/ |title=Max Manus – leader of the Norwegian Resistance movement |website=Lopk and Learn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mines detonated when the ship was near [[Øresund]], damaging the ship, she remained afloat and returned to harbour under her own power.&lt;ref name="Tillotson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Tillotson|title=SOE and The Resistance: As Told in The Times Obituaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcZZgoOsSnUC&amp;pg=PA62|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978-1-4411-1971-1|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[:no:Odd Claus|Odd Claus]] (in Norwegian), a Norwegian boy with German parents, who was being forcibly taken to Germany was one of those on-board. In his 2008 memoirs, he wrote that as well as German troops, the vessel was carrying Norwegian women with young children, who were being taken to Germany as part of the [[Lebensborn]] programme. He notes the explosion happened at 5am, and that around 200 on board were trapped and drowned as the ship's captain closed the watertight bulkhead-doors to control flooding and stop the ship from sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/vitne-til-krig-en-norsk-gutts-opplevelser-i-tyskland-1944-1946/oclc/313646489&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Vitne til krig: en norsk gutts opplevelser i Tyskland 1944-1946 | trans-title=Witness to war a Norwegian boy's experiences in Germany |last=Claus |first=Odd |date=2008 |publisher=Cappelen Damm |isbn=9788204142894 |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |oclc=313646489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, the ship was converted into a [[Hospital ship]] but was damaged by a mine explosion in February. She received temporary repairs at the German-occupied Polish port of [[Gdynia]] then traveled to Copenhagen, carrying 5000 German refugees, fleeing from the advancing  [[Red Army]]. In May 1945, she was captured by British forces at [[Kiel]] and taken as a [[prize of war]].

==Post-war British service==
In 1946, ''Monte Rosa'' was assigned to the British [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] and converted into a troopship. By this time, she was the only survivor of the five Monte-class ships. ''Monte Cervantes'' sank near [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1930, one ship was sunk by an air-raid in 1942; one was badly damaged by bombs and scrapped after the war. ''Monte Pascoal'' was scuttled by the British in 1946.&lt;ref name="Schwerdtner2013-288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Schwerdtner|title=German Luxury Ocean Liners: From Kaiser Willhelm to Aidastella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2GoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT286|date=30 October 2013|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1471-7|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Monte Rosa'' was renamed [[Ship prefix|HMT]] ''Empire Windrush'' on 21 January 1947, for use on the [[Southampton]]-[[Gibraltar]]-[[Suez]]-[[Aden]]-[[Colombo]]-Singapore-Hong Kong route, with voyages extended to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in [[Japan]] after the start of the [[Korean War]]. The vessel was operated for the British Government by the [[New Zealand Shipping Company]], and made one voyage only to the Caribbean before resuming normal trooping voyages.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The new name was one of a series of ship names used by the British government for the vessels that were acquired or chartered for the carriage of troops. Many of these ships were second-hand (like ''Empire Windrush''), and were renamed when bought. The names were "Empire" followed by the name of a British river; in this case the [[River Windrush]], a minor tributary of the [[Thames]], flowing from the [[Cotswold Hills]] towards [[Oxford]].

In 1948, ''Empire Windrush'', which was en route from [[Australia]] to England via the [[Atlantic]], docked in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], to pick up servicemen who were on leave. The [[British Nationality Act 1948]] had just been passed, giving the status of [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement was placed in a Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of finding better employment including in some cases rejoining the RAF; others decided to make the journey just to see what the 'mother country' was like.&lt;ref name="Phillips1998"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Phillips |first1=Mike |last2=Phillips |first2=Trevor |publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=1998|title=Windrush: The Irresistible Rise of Multi-Racial Britain |isbn=978-0-00-653039-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/arrival_01.shtml |title=Windrush - Arrivals|date=2001 |website=BBC History.

A commonly given figure for the number of West Indian immigrants on board is 492&lt;ref name="mead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ECBC" /&gt; based understandably on news reports in the media at the time, which variously announced that "more than 400", "430" or "500" Jamaican men had arrived in Britain.&lt;ref name="Pathe1"&gt;[https://www.britishpathe.com/video/pathe-reporter-meets Pathe Report Meets 1948].

The ship also carried 66 people whose last country of residence was Mexico - they were a group of  Polish people who had travelled from Siberia via India and the Pacific, and who had been granted permission to settle in the United Kingdom under the terms of the [[Polish Resettlement Act 1947]].&lt;ref name="BBCNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mead"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mead |first=Matthew |date=2017-10-17 |title=Empire Windrush: Cultural Memory and Archival Disturbance |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1572362/ |journal=A Moveable Type |doi=10.14324/111.1755-4527.027 |issn=1755-4527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritishFuture"&gt;{{cite web|date= 2015-03-27| url= http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/windrush-poles/|title = Who Were the Windrush Poles?| work= British Future| access-date = 2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multicultural-matters.com/polish_community.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108055002/http://www.multicultural-matters.com/polish_community.htm |archivedate=8 January 2010 |title=Polish Community Focus |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been among a group of Polish people who had been living in Mexico since 1943&lt;ref name="BritishFuture" /&gt; and ''Empire Windrush'' had called at [[Tampico, Mexico]] in order to pick them up.&lt;ref name="BBCNews" /&gt;

Of the other passengers, 119 were from England and 40 from other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="BBCNews" /&gt;

The arrival of the ship immediately prompted complaints from some members of parliament, but the first [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|legislation controlling immigration]] was not passed until 1962. Among the passengers was [[Sam Beaver King]] who helped found the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] and went on to become the first black [[Mayor of Southwark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36566990 | title=Sam King: Notting Hill Carnival founder and first black Southwark mayor dies | work=BBC News | date=18 June 2016 | accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also the [[Calypso music|calypso]] musicians [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]], [[Lord Beginner]], [[Lord Woodbine]] and [[Mona Baptiste]].

Those who had not already arranged accommodation were temporarily housed in the [[Clapham South tube station|Clapham South]] [[London deep-level shelters|deep shelter]] in south-west London, less than a mile away from the [[Coldharbour Lane]] Employment Exchange in [[Brixton]], where some of the arrivals sought work.

Many of ''Empire Windrush'''s passengers only intended to stay for a few years, although a number did return the majority remained to settle permanently. Those born in the West Indies who settled in the UK in this migration movement over the following years are now typically referred to as the "Windrush Generation".&lt;ref&gt;Saffron Alexander,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/goodlife/11683233/Windrush-Generation-They-thought-we-should-be-planting-bananas.html "Windrush Generation: 'They thought we should be planting bananas'"], ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 22 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later service==
In May 1949, ''Empire Windrush'' was on a voyage from Gibraltar to Port Said when a fire broke out on board. Four ships were put on standby to assist if the ship had to be abandoned. Although the passengers were placed in the [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], they were not launched and the ship was subsequently towed back to Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=Troopships&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suezveteransassociation.org.uk/troopships.html |title=Troopships.

On 7 February 1953, around {{convert|200|mi|km}} south of the [[Nicobar Islands]], ''Windrush'' sighted a small cargo-ship, the  ''Holchu'', adrift and sent out a general warning. The ''Holchu'' was later boarded by the crew of a British cargo ship, alerted by ''Windrush's'' warning. They found no trace of the crew and the ''Holchu'' was towed to [[Colombo]].

==Last voyage and sinking==
[[File:Empire Windrush on fire March1954 A32891.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial photograph of the burning ''Empire Windrush'', March 28–29, 1954]]
''Empire Windrush'' set off from [[Yokohama]], Japan, in February 1954 on what proved to be her final voyage. She called at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and was to sail to the United Kingdom, calling at [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Colombo]], [[Aden]] and [[Port Said]]. Her passengers included recovering wounded [[United Nations]] veterans of the [[Korean War]], some soldiers from the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] wounded at the [[Third Battle of the Hook]] in May 1953.

However, the voyage was plagued with engine breakdowns and other defects, including a fire after the departure from Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2017-04-05 |title=Windrush engineer warned that ship was unsafe – archive, 1954  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/apr/05/windrush-empire-ship-unsafe-fire-1954 |work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=2018-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took 10 weeks to reach Port Said, from where the ship sailed for the last time.&lt;ref name=Dockerill&gt;Dockerill, Geoffrey, "On Fire at Sea" essay in compilation ''The Unquiet Peace: Stories from the Post War Army'', London, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; On board were  222 crew and 1276 passengers, including military personnel and some women and children, dependents of some of the military personnel.&lt;ref name=Times52964a /&gt;

At around 6:15am on Sunday March 28, there was a sudden explosion and fierce fire in the engine-room that killed the [[Third Engineer]], two other members of the engine-room crew and the [[Electro-technical officer|First Electrician]]; a fifth crew-member in the engine room and one in the boiler-room, both [[Oiler (occupation)|Greasers]], managed to escape.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt; The ship quickly lost all electrical power as the four main [[electrical generator]]s were located in the burning engine room; the back-up generator was started, but problems with the main circuit-breaker made its power unusable.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;

The ship did not have a [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]] system. The [[Chief mate|Chief officer]] heard the explosion from the ship's bridge and assembled the ship's fire-fighting squad, who happened to be on deck at the time doing routine work. However they were only able to fight the fire for a few minutes before the loss of electrical power stopped the water pumps that fed their fire-hoses. The [[First assistant engineer|Second Engineer]] was able to enter the engine room by wearing a [[smoke hood]], but was unable to close a water-tight door that might have contained the fire, due to a lack of electrical power. Attempts to close all water-tight doors using the controls on the bridge had also failed.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;

At 6:23am, the first distress calls were transmitted; further SOS calls used the emergency radio transmitter as electrical power had been lost. The order was given to wake the passengers and crew and assemble them at their emergency stations, but the ship's public address system was not working, nor were its [[Air horn|air]] and [[steam whistle]]s, so the order had to be transmitted by word-of-mouth. At 6:45am, all attempts to fight the fire were halted and the order was given to launch the lifeboats, with the first ones away [[Women and children first|carrying the women and children on-board]].&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times52964a&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Troopship Blaze Inquiry |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=22 June 1954 |page_number=3 |issue=52964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ship's 22 lifeboats could accommodate all on board, thick smoke and the lack of electrical power prevented many of them from being launched. Each set of lifeboat [[davit]]s accommodated two lifeboats and without electrical power, raising the wire ropes to lower the second boat was an arduous and slow task. With fire spreading rapidly, the order was given to drop the remaining boats into the sea.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;

Many of the crew and troops on board abandoned the ship by climbing down ladders or ropes and jumping into the sea.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt; However, they were quickly picked up by Windrush's lifeboats and also by a boat from the first rescue ship, which reached the scene at 7.00am.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times52964a /&gt; The ships responding to Windrush's distress call were the Dutch ship {{MV|Mentor}}, the British [[P&amp;O (company)|P&amp;O]] [[Cargo liner]] {{MV|Socotra}}, the Norwegian ship {{SS|Hemsefjell}} and the Italian ships {{SS|Taigete}} and {{SS|Helschell}}.&lt;ref name=Ships&gt;{{cite book | first = and Sawyer, L.

[[File:HMS Saintes.jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''Saintes'' in 1946]]
The rescue vessels took the passengers and crew to [[Algiers]], where they were cared for by the [[French Red Cross]] and the [[French Army]].  They were taken to [[Gibraltar]] by the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Triumph|R16|6}}, and from there returned to the United Kingdom by air.

Around 26 hours after ''Empire Windrush'' had been abandoned, she was reached by {{HMS|Saintes|D84|6}} of the [[Royal Navy]]'s Mediterranean Fleet at a position {{coord|37|05||N|02|02||E|display=inline}}. The fire was still burning fiercely more than a day after it started, but a party from ''Saintes'' managed to get on board ''Empire Windrush'' and attach a tow-cable. At about midday, ''Saintes'' began to tow the ship to Gibraltar, at a speed of around {{convert|3.5|kn|km/h}}, but ''Empire Windrush'' sank in the early hours of the following morning, Tuesday, 30 March 1954 at a position {{coord|37|00||N|02|11||E|display=inline}}.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plimsoll.southampton.gov.uk/SOTON_Documents/Plimsoll/20626.pdf |title=The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 Report of Court (no. 7933) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=27 June 1954 |website= |publisher=Local history &amp; Maritime Digital Archive, Southampton City Council |access-date= 20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having been towed a distance of only around {{convert|16|km|nmi}}.

==Inquiry into the sinking==
An inquiry into the sinking of ''Empire Windrush'' was held between the 21 June and 7 July 1954. No firm cause for the fire was established, but it was thought the most likely cause was corrosion in one of the ships funnels, or ''uptakes'', may have led to a panel failing, causing incandescently hot soot to fall into the engine room, where it damaged a fuel oil supply pipe and ignited the leaking oil.&lt;ref name=Times52995a&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Cause Of Ship's Fire Unknown |day_of_week=Wednesday |date=28 July 1954 |page_number=5 |issue=52995}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative theory was that a fractured oil pipe deposited oil onto a hot exhaust pipe.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt; As the ship was government property, she was not insured.&lt;ref name=Times52982 /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Windrush_sign_1.JPG|right|thumb|Windrush Square, London (2006)]]
In 1954, several of the military personnel on board ''Empire Windrush'' during her final voyage received decorations for their role in the evacuation of the burning ship. A military nurse was awarded the [[Royal Red Cross]] for her role in evacuating the patients under her care.&lt;ref name=Times53052a&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Army Nurse's Courage Rewarded|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=2 October 1954 |page_number=3 |issue=53052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, an area of public open space in [[Brixton]], London, was renamed [[Windrush Square]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of ''Empire Windrush'''s West Indian passengers. To commemorate the "Windrush Generation", in 2008, a Thurrock Heritage plaque was unveiled at the [[Port of Tilbury#London Cruise Terminal|London Cruise Terminal]] at [[Tilbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock-history.org.uk/windrush.htm |title=The Empire Windrush |publisher=Thurrock-history.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter in the boat's history was also commemorated, although fleetingly only, in the Pandemonium sequence of the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony#Pandemonium (21:09–21:25)|Opening Ceremony of the Games of the XXX Olympiad]] in London, 27 July 2012. A small replica of the ship plastered with newsprint was the facsimile representation in the ceremony.

[[Hamburg Süd]] commemorates ''Empire Windrush'' by operating a modern [[container ship]] with her original name, ''Monte Rosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cargo-vessels-international.at/MONTE_ROSA_IMO9283215.pdf | title=Monte Rosa | publisher=Cargo Vessels International | accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engines and auxiliary machinery==
[[File:Monte Cervantes 02 Engine room.jpg|thumb|right|The engine-room of ''Windrush's'' sister-ship, ''Monte Cerventes'' (1928)]] 
Windrush carried four, oil-burning, four-stroke single-acting [[MAN SE|MAN]] Diesel engines of {{convert|6880|hp|kW}} total, They were  single reduction geared in pairs to two propellers. The ship's maximum speed was {{convert|14.5|kn|lk=in}}.

Electrical power was initially provided by three, 350&amp;nbsp;kW DC generators, powered by internal combustion engines and installed in the engine room; a fourth generator was installed in 1949. There was also an emergency generator. The ship also carried two [[Scotch marine boiler]]s to produce high-pressure steam for some auxiliary machinery. These could be heated either by burning oil, or by using the hot, exhaust gases from the main engines.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;

==Official number and code letters==
Official Numbers are ship identifier numbers assigned to merchant ships by their country of registration. Each country developed its own official numbering system, some on a national and some on a port-by-port basis, and the formats have sometimes changed over time. National Official Numbers shouldn't be confused with [[IMO ship identification number|IMO Numbers]]. Flag states still use national systems, which also cover those vessels not subject to the IMO regulations. ''Monte Rosa'' had the German Official Number 1640. She used the [[Maritime call sign]] RHWF until 1933&lt;ref name=Monte&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=31b0831.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS (RHWF)|publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data|accessdate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then DIDU until 1945.&lt;ref name=Rosa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34b0581.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VAPEUR ET A MOTEURS (DIDU)|publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data|accessdate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ship sank in 1954 she had the British Official Number 181561.&lt;ref name=inquiry-report /&gt;

'''Haruko Nawata Ward''' is a [[religious historian]] currently teaching church history at [[Columbia Theological Seminary]]. She is known primarily for her work on women religious leaders, history of [[Christianity]] in Asia, history of the Christian [[Reformation]], encounter of cultures and religions and [[justice]] issues throughout the history of the church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctsnet.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WardHarukoCV2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ward received a B.F.A. from [[Tokyo University]] of Fine Arts and Music (1976), a M.A. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of [[New York University]] (1980), a M.Div. from [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]] (1983), a Th.M.

She was ordained as a minister of the Word and Sacrament in the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] and began teaching at [[Columbia Theological Seminary]] as the Assistant Professor of Church History (2002-2008) and then Associate Professor of Church History (2008-2016). She is currently the Professor of Church History at Columbia Theological Seminary.

==Thought==

She states the "social historians have surveyed the activities of lay Kirishitan male leaders, but not paid attention to their female counterparts."&lt;ref name="The American Historical Review (Book Review)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nam‐lin|first1=Hur|title=Women Religious Leaders in Japan's Christian Century, 1549–1650 Review.|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/116/1/157.2.extract|website=oxfordjournals.org|publisher=The American Historical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this research Ward seeks to re-emphasize the voice of women throughout history and to reinterpret Christian history through these voices. Additionally, her work also seeks to reveal how the "Christian mission had a significant cultural and social impact on Japan"&lt;ref name="Catholic Historical Review (Book Review)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farge|first1=William|title=Women Religious Leaders in Japan's Christian Century, 1549-1650 Review|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2218234861/women-religious-leaders-in-japan-s-christian-century|website=questia.com|publisher=Catholic Historical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout its history.

'''Hassiba Ben Bouali''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;حسيبة بن بوعلي&lt;/big&gt;}}) (18 January 1938 – 9 October 1957) was a militant in the [[Algerian independence war]] (1954–62).

She was born in [[Chlef|El-Asnam]], [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ghada Talhami |title= Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa |page= 55 |date= December 19, 2012 |publisher= Scarecrow Press | isbn= 978-0810868588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents moved to [[Algiers]] in 1947, where she studied at the Lycée Delacroix (high-school). She joined the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]], and her travels made her aware of the conditions of the Algerian people under the colonial government. This motivated her to join the ''Union générale des étudiants musulmans algériens'' (General Union of Algerian Muslim Students) in 1954, at the age of 16. She participated in the [[Anti-imperialism|nationalist struggle]] until her death. In the 1957 [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]], she and three companions including [[Ali La Pointe|Ali Ammar]] (aka ''Ali La Pointe'') were killed when French forces bombed their hideout in the [[Casbah of Algiers|Casbah]].

Benbouali was depicted in the movie ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' by Italian director [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]. One of the largest avenues in Algiers and the University of [[Chlef]] were named after her.

== Woodblock printing ==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing. "On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries", in ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', 1997, Vol. 42, No. 12: 976–981. ISSN 1001-6538. Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

Rightreading.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea - Silla. Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150" /&gt;

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

== Movable type ==
{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], there is mention of [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|[[Jikji]], "Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters", the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, printed in [[Korea]] in 1377. Bibliothèque Nationale de France.]]

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

=== Movable type in Japan ===
Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961). ''A History of Japan: 1334–1615''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1893 Scanned Image.jpg|right|250px|thumb|upright|Swami Vivekananda]]
'''[[Swami Vivekananda]]''', the nineteenth-century Indian [[Hindu]] [[monk]] is considered as one of the most influential people of modern India and [[Hinduism]]. [[Rabindranath Tagore]] suggested to study Vivekananda's works to learn about India. Indian independence activist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] regarded Vivekananda as his spiritual teacher. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] said that after reading the works of Vivekananda his love for his nation became a thousand-fold.

[[Barack Obama]], the President of the United States quoted Vivekananda's words in his speech delivered in India in November 2010. [[Jayalalitha]], the Chief Minister of [[Tamil Nadu]] said that Vivekananda inspired her to enter politics. 

Vivekananda's birthday, on 12 January is celebrated as the [[National Youth Day]] in India. In 2012, a three-day [[150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda#World Congress of Religions 2012|world conference]] was organised by the Institute of World Religions to commemorate the [[150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda]] to mark the days Vivekananda delivered his historic lectures in 1893. In 2013, [[Indian railways]] started [[Vivek Express]], four pairs of express trains as a tribute to Vivekananda on his 150th birth anniversary.

== Influence on notable Indian people ==
Vivekananda, after he became a "sannyasin of high intellect, action, and devotion" in 1886, had a deep desire to spread the message of “divine unity of existence and unity in diversity’ throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oocities.org/neovedanta/sv8.html|title= Life and Teachings of Swami Vivekananda: Part 7 The Soul Wanted to Soar High|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=International Forum for NeoVedantins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda then as a ''Parivrajaka'', meaning: "a wandering monk", travelled the length and breadth of the country. For nearly two years, he travelled  all over India  from north to west, and befriended many notable people and influenced them with his Vedanta philosophy and many of them even encouraged and supported him to travel to the US to attend the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago; some of the prominent names are [[Ajit Singh of Khetri]] of [[Rajasthan]], Dewan of Porbandar and Junagadh in Gujarat, Raja of Ramnad of Madras,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/neovedanta/sv9.html|title=Life and Teachings of Swami Vivekananda: Part 8:Parivrajaka Sadhu: The 'wandering monk'|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=International Forum for NeoVedantins}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K.

[[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], the Indian nationalist, journalist, teacher, social reformer, lawyer and an independence activist who was the first popular leader of the Indian Independence Movement observed :”Twelve centuries ago Sankaracharya was the only great personality, who not only spoke of the purity of our religion, not only uttered in words that this religion was our strength and wealth, not only said that it was our sacred duty to preach this religion in the length and breadth of the world&amp;nbsp;– but also brought all this into action. Swami Vivekananda is a person of that stature—who appeared towards the last half of the 19th century."

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] suggested "If you want to know India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative."{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=196}} [[Sri Aurobindo]] has said: "Vivekananda was a soul of puissance if ever there was one, a very lion among men, but the definite work he has left behind is quite incommensurate with our impression of his creative might and energy.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=197}} [[Brahmabandhav Upadhyay]] told, Vivekananda and his mission encouraged him to go to England and propagate Hinduism and [[Vedanta]] there. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] praised Vivekananda for taking the responsibility to re-establish the glory of Hinduism.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|pp=198–199}} [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] felt, Vivekananda's message was "the message of modern humanity".{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|pp=201–203}}

On 6 February 1921, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] came to [[Belur Math]] and paid homage to Vivekananda. On this occasion he said: {{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=206}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have come here to pay my homage and respect to the revered memory of Swami Vivekananda, whose birthday is being celebrated today. I have gone through his works very thoroughly, and after having gone through them, the love that I had for my country became a thousand-fold.&lt;ref name=swamigov&gt;{{cite web|title=about Swami Vivekananda|url=http://vivekananda.gujarat.gov.in/influence.aspx|publisher=Gujurat.gov|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; I ask you, young men, not to go away empty-handed without imbibing something of the spirit of the place where Swami Vivekananda lived and died.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also told that Vivekananda's writings needed no introduction.&lt;ref name=MGquote&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahatma Gandhis'q quotes on Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2013/11/mahatma-gandhis-quotes-and-comments-on.html|publisher=Swami Vivekananda Quotes|accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, during the journey from [[Yokohama]] to Canada on the ship ''Empress'', Vivekananda accidentally met [[Jamsetji Tata]] who was also going to Chicago. During the conversation Vivekananda told Tata about the necessity of establishing a world class scientific Institution in India and this encouraged Tata to establish the [[Indian Institute of Science]], which gradually became one of India's best-known research university of India.{{Sfn|Rajadhyaksha|2007|p=31}} [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first Prime Minister of [[Independent India]], praised Vivekananda's personality and dignity and said that his heart carried fire: "it was no empty talk he was indulging in. He was putting his heart and soul into the words he uttered." Nehru also recounted that "his generation" was widely influenced by Vivekananda.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=206}}

{{Double image|right| Rabindranath Tagore in 1909.jpg|200|C Rajagopalachari Feb 17 2011.JPG|200|Left: Rabindranath Tagore (left) suggested to read Vivekananda's writing to learn about India. Right: C Rajagopalachari told, Vivekananda saved Hinduism and India.}}
Indian independence activist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] considered Vivekananda as his spiritual teacher. He called Vivekananda a "full-blooded masculine personality&amp;nbsp;– and a fighter to the core of being". Bose told, under the "sacred influence" of [[Ramakrishna]] and Vivekananda his own life got awakened.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|pp=209–210}}

[[Vinoba Bhave]] praised Vivekananda's contribution to make Indians' conscious of their strength and said that he showed them their shortcomings and defects and taught them to overcome these. He further mentioned that at the time of Vivekananda people of India were shrouded in ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'', ignorance and unwisdom, and failed to distinguish between weakness and non-attachment and peace. In such a situation Vivekananda brought new light and he taught "The same Soul resides in each and all" and suggested to serve mankind considering them manifestations of God ''[[daridranarayan]]'' (meaning: "poverty stricken god").{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|pp=211–212}}

According to Indian independence activist and social worker [[C. Rajagopalachari]] who became the first Indian [[Governor General of India]], Vivekananda saved Hinduism and India.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=218}} He stated that we owe everything to Vivekananda. The first Vice-President and the second President of independent India [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] said that Vivekananda's was born in a "critical period" when the nation and her people were collapsing in "despair, frustration and hopelessness" and in such circumstances Vivekananda's teachings gave them new hope and taught them to rely on spiritual resources.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|pp=218–219}} Indian historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar told, Vivekananda preached the best parts of Hinduism and Indian spirituality to the world.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=220}} According to Majumdar's studies, Vivekananda's ideals added spiritual basis in the Indian nationalism. Majumdar also noted, though Vivekananda was an ascetic, his patriotism was remarkable. He said:{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=221}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though an ascetic, Vivekananda was a patriot of patriots. The thought of restoring the prehistoric glory of India by resuscitating among her people the spiritual vitality which was dormant, but not dead, was always the uppermost though in his mind...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pranab Mukherjee]], the President of India, suggested in a speech delivered on 31 May 2013 at the Convocation Hall, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, to remember the call of Vivekananda to reconstruct India's national character. He also told :—
&lt;blockquote&gt; Swamiji unhesitatingly appreciated the positive aspects and accomplishments of the Western Societies&amp;nbsp;– and refrained from being dogmatic as he made his point, he was able to build a robust new bridge of understanding and goodwill for India.

[[Narendra Modi]], the Prime minister of India, is an ardent admirer of Vivekananda. In April 2013, he visited [[Belur Math]] and meditated at the room of Vivekananda.&lt;ref name="Modi meditates OneIndia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Narendra Modi meditates in Vivekananda's room in Kolkata |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2013/04/10/narendra-modi-meditates-in-vivekananda-s-room-kolkata-1190491.html |accessdate=28 September 2013 |newspaper=One India |date=10 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130928184549/http://news.oneindia.in/2013/04/10/narendra-modi-meditates-in-vivekananda-s-room-kolkata-1190491.html |archivedate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jayalalithaa]], the Chief Minister of [[Tamil Nadu]] told, Vivekananda inspired her to enter politics. She said:&lt;ref name="Jayalalithaa's inspiration"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vivekananda my inspiration to enter politics: Jayalalithaa |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article1481716.ece |accessdate=28 September 2013 |newspaper=The New Indian Express |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130928185116/http://newindianexpress.com/states/tamil_nadu/article1481716.ece |archivedate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; She further said that there are "some people who made public life a profession. The profession can be transformed into service, but service cannot be turned into a profession. As far as I am concerned, Swami Vivekananda was a great inspiration for me to enter politics. When I took the first step into politics in 1982, I mentioned Swami Vivekananda in an interview."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mamata Banerjee]], the Chief Minister of [[West Bengal]] was inspired by Vivekananda's writings which she said helped her in the difficult times of her political career. Banerjee stated:&lt;ref name="Mamat Banerjee drew inspiration"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mamata drew inspiration from Vivekananda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mamata-drew-inspiration-from-vivekananda/article4300918.ece |accessdate=28 September 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=12 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130928185747/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mamata-drew-inspiration-from-vivekananda/article4300918.ece |archivedate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the course of the several movements that I led, there would be moments of doubt. There were some who were critical of me and even I wondered that there were so many people who had pinned their hopes on me. What if I were to fail them? I would read books written by Swami Vivekananda to gather my strength.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, [[Yoga]] [[guru]] [[Ramdev]] told he feels Vivekananda spread "India's cultural message" to the world.&lt;ref name="Ramdev's comment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Vivekananda gave India's cultural message to world: Ramdev |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1896086/report-vivekananda-gave-india-s-cultural-message-to-world-ramdev |accessdate=2 October 2013 |newspaper=Daily News and Analysis |date=30 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131002001629/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1896086/report-vivekananda-gave-india-s-cultural-message-to-world-ramdev |archivedate=2 October 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social activist [[Anna Hazare]] was motivated by the works of Swami Vivekananda and took inspiration for all the social work he did from Swami Vivekananda only.&lt;ref name="Anna Hazare On Swami Vivekananda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anna Hazare On Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/04/anna-hazare-on-swami-vivekananda.html|publisher=Swami Vivekananda Quotes|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arvind Kejriwal]] read about Swami Vivekananda during his [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|IIT]] days and was very much inspired from him.

[[Kangana Ranaut]] considers Swami Vivekananda as her Spiritual Guru and is an ardent follower of his teachings.

== Influence on non-Indian people ==
Vivekananda, during and after his tour of western countries in Europe and the United States had profound influence on notable personalities, who either became his ardent devotees or friends and some even his ardent disciples and many of whom even became ascetics. Right at the beginning of his visit to Chicago to address the Parliament of World Religions Professor [[John Henry Wright]] of [[Harvard University]], invited him to speak at Harvard.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{Harvnb|Minor|1986|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out to Vivekananda the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation.&lt;ref name="Bhuyan 2003 16"/&gt; Wright's reasoning was "To ask for your credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine in the heavens".&lt;ref name="Bhuyan 2003 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bhuyan|2003|p = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of such well-known luminaries are: [[Max Müller]] (Indologist), [[J. J. Goodwin]], [[John Henry Barrows]], [[Mark Twain]], Sturdy, [[Romain Rolland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda_biography/11_northern_india.htm|title= In Northern India|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher= Ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sara Chapman Bull]], his American mother and benefactor, [[Mary Hale]], [[Josephine MacLeod]], Christine Greenstidel (who later came to be known as [[Sister Christine]]), Maragaret Noble ([[Sister Nivedita]] in later years), [[William James]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Lord Kelvin]], [[Harriet Monroe]], [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Emma Calvé]] and [[Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz]] {{sfn|Badrinath|2006|p=x}} He initiated several followers : Marie Louise (a French woman) became [[Swami Abhayananda]], and Leon Landsberg became Swami Kripananda,&lt;ref name="bruke-618"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burke|1958|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American industrialist [[John D. Rockefeller]] reportedly made his first large donation for public welfare and later became a notable philanthropist after a meeting with Vivekananda. Vivekananda succinctly explained to Rockfeller that his philanthropy would only be a channel to help the poor and distressed people.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=178}}

Vivekananda influenced French Opera singer [[Emma Calvé]], who wrote in her autobiography:{{Sfn|Calvé|1922|p=185}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my good fortune and my joy to know a man who truly "walked with God," a noble being, a saint, a philosopher, and a true friend. His influence upon my spiritual life was profound. He opened up new horizons before me, enlarging and vivifying my religious ideas and ideals, teaching me a broader understanding of truth. My soul will bear him an eternal gratitude.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vivekananda's life and works have influenced many scholars, writers, politicians worldwide. French writer [[Romain Rolland]] wrote that Vivekananda was "energy personified". Rolland felt "kingliness" was Vivekananda's characteristics, "He was a born king and nobody ever came near him in India or America without paying homage to his majesty."{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=212}} American writer, historian, philosopher [[Will Durant]] told, the speeches of Vivekananda were more "virile" than the ones delivered in the Vedic times.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=218}}

The nationalist leader and the first president of independent Indonesia [[Sukarno]] said that it was Swami Vivekananda who inspired him to become strong and to serve God and mankind.{{Sfn|Grover|2000|p=479}} Historian and [[Indologist]] [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham]] compared Vivekananda with other eminent religious figures of India such as [[Kabir]], [[Adi Shankara]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]].{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=218}} Russian academician and public figure [[Eugene Chelyshev]] was an ardent admirer of Swami Vivekananda. He said:{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=226}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reading and re-reading the works of Vivekananda each time I find in them something new that helps deeper to understand India, its philosophy, the way of the life and customs of the people in the past and the present, their dreams of the future...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chelyshev also predicted that the memory of Vivekananda will never fade away.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=227}} Chinese scholar Huan Xin Chuan stated that Vivekananda was the most renowned social figure of modern China and Chinese socialists carefully study the works of Vivekananda.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|Lokeswarananda|1996|p=228}}

[[Barack Obama]], the President of the United States, quoted Vivekananda's words in his speech delivered in India in November 2010. He said:&lt;ref name="US President Barack Obama’s Parliament address"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. President Barack Obama's Parliament address |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-president-barack-obamas-parliament-address/article874394.ece |accessdate=28 September 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130928195753/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-president-barack-obamas-parliament-address/article874394.ece |archivedate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Instead of succumbing to division, you have shown that the strength of India—the very idea of India—is its embrace of all colors, castes and creeds. It's the diversity represented in this chamber today. It's the richness of faiths celebrated by a visitor to my hometown of Chicago more than a century ago—the renowned Swami Vivekananda. He said that, "holiness, purity and charity are not the exclusive possessions of any church in the world, and that every system has produced men and women of the most exalted character."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Notable memorials and observations ==

=== National Youth Day ===
{{Main|National Youth Day (India)}}
Swami Vivekananda's birthday, i.e. 12 January, is celebrated as the [[National Youth Day]] in India.

The circular stated: "it was felt that the philosophy of Swamiji and the ideals for which he lived and worked could be a great source of inspiration for the Indian Youth."{{Sfn|Goel|2008|p=103}}

=== World Brotherhood Day ===
The "World Brotherhood Day" is observed on 11 September, on the day when Vivekananda delivered his first speech at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] Chicago in 1893 and addressed the American people and his audience as "Sisters and brothers of America".&lt;ref name="A saffron monk who introduced India to the world"&gt;{{cite news|title=A saffron monk who introduced India to the world |url=http://zeenews.india.com/blog/a-saffron-monk-who-introduced-india-to-the-world_251.html |accessdate=28 September 2013 |newspaper=Zee News |date=11 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130928201222/http://zeenews.india.com/blog/a-saffron-monk-who-introduced-india-to-the-world_251.html |archivedate=28 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==

=== Films ===
Bengali
Swami Vivekananda has been the primary topic of many films, dramas ad folk-plays. Bengali film director [[Amar Mullick]] made two different movies: [[Swamiji (film)|Swamiji]] (1949) and its adaptation in Hindi, ''[[Swami Vivekananda (1955 film)|Swami Vivekananda]]'' (1955). The film ''Swami Vivekananda'' (1955) is considered a "faithful and memorable documentation feature" on Vivekananda.&lt;ref name="Indian Express Take a little"&gt;{{cite news|title=Take a little, leave most behind... |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/take-a-little-leave-most-behind.../1074204/0 |accessdate=26 September 2013 |newspaper=The Indian Express |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130926024421/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/take-a-little-leave-most-behind.../1074204/ |archivedate=26 September 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Ellen Harrison''' (9 September 1850 – 15 April 1928) was a British [[classics|classical]] scholar, [[linguistics|linguist]].  Harrison is one of the founders, with [[Karl Kerenyi]] and [[Walter Burkert]], of modern studies in [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]].  She applied 19th century [[archaeology|archaeological]] discoveries to the interpretation of ancient Greek religion in ways that have become standard. She has also been credited with being the first woman to obtain a post in England as a ‘career academic’.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/harrison-jane-1850-1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;grbs.library.duke.edu/article/download/9611/4523&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard [http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2009/05/living-with-jane-harrison.html#more "Living with Jane Harrison",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527091358/http://timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life/2009/05/living-with-jane-harrison.html |date=27 May 2009 }} ''A Don's Life'' blog, ''The Times'' website, 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison argued for [[women's suffrage]] but thought she would never want to [[vote]] herself.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/04/mary-ellen-harrison-mary-beard "My hero: Jane Ellen Harrison"], ''The Guardian]], 4 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, later second wife of Sir [[Francis Darwin]], was Jane Harrison's best friend from her student days at Newnham, and during the period from 1898 to her death in 1903.

==Personal life==
Harrison was born in [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]], Yorkshire on 9 September 1850. Her mother died shortly after she was born and she was educated by a series of [[governess]]es. Her governesses taught her German, [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but she later expanded her knowledge to about sixteen languages, including [[Russian language|Russian]].

Harrison spent most of her professional life at [[Newnham College]], the progressive, recently established college for women at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. At Newnham, one of her students was [[Eugenie Sellers Strong|Eugenie Sellers]], the writer and poet, with whom she lived in England and later in Paris and possibly even had a relationship with in the late 1880s.
{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=August 2018}}

Between 1880 and 1897 Harrison studied Greek art and archaeology at the [[British Museum]] under [[Charles Thomas Newton|Sir Charles Newton]].{{clarify|date=December 2017|readson=How could she have spend most of her life in Oxford and London?}} Harrison then supported herself lecturing at the museum and at schools (mostly private boy's schools). Her lectures became widely popular and 1600 people ended up attending her Glasgow lecture on Athenian gravestones.  She travelled to Italy and Germany, where she met the scholar from Prague, [[Wilhelm Klein]]. Klein introduced her to [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]] who invited her to participate in his archaeological tours in Greece. Her early book ''The Odyssey in Art and Literature'' then appeared in 1882. Harrison met the scholar [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|D. S. MacColl]], who supposedly asked her to marry him and she declined. Harrison then suffered a severe depression and started to study the more primitive areas of Greek art in an attempt to cure herself.

In 1888 Harrison began to publish in the periodical that [[Oscar Wilde]] was editing called ''[[The Woman's World]]'' on "The Pictures of Sappho." Harrison also ended up translating ''Mythologie figurée de la Grèce'' (1883) by [[Maxime Collignon]] as well as providing personal commentary to selections of ''Pausanias, Mythology &amp; Monuments of Ancient Athens'' by [[Margaret Verrall]] in the same year. These two major works caused Harrison to be awarded honorary degrees from the universities of [[Durham University|Durham]] (1897) and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] (1895).

Harrison was then engaged to marry the scholar R. A. Neil, but he died suddenly of appendicitis in 1901 before they could marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robinson, Annabel|title=Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison|year=2002|page=141|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iulICaUvUhsC&amp;pg=PA141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neil, Robert Alexander|journal=Who's Who|year=1901|pages= 880–881|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnzpsu;view=1up;seq=856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became the central figure of the group known as the [[Cambridge Ritualists]]. In 1903 her book ''Prolegomena on the Study of Greek Religion'' appeared. Harrison became close to [[F. M. Cornford|Francis MacDonald Cornford]] (1874–1943), and when he married in 1909 she became extremely upset. She then made a new friendship with [[Hope Mirrlees]] whom she referred to as her "spiritual daughter".

Harrison retired from Newnham in 1922 and then moved to Paris to live with Mirrlees. She and Mirrlees returned to London in 1925 where she was able to publish her memoirs through [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]] and [[Virginia Woolf]]'s press, [[Hogarth Press|The Hogarth Press]]. She lived three more years, to the age of 77, and passed away at her house in [[Bloomsbury]]. She is now buried in [[St Marylebone Cemetery]], [[East Finchley]].&lt;ref&gt;"Jane Harrison – Dictionary of Art Historians." Jane Harrison – Dictionary of Art Historians. N.p., n.d.

Harrison was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="Wright2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rita R.

===Suffragist===

Harrison was, at least [[ideologically]], a moderate [[suffragist]]. Rather than support women's [[suffrage]] by protesting, Harrison applied her scholarship in [[anthropology]] to defend women's right to vote.  In responding to an [[anti-suffragist]] critic, Harrison demonstrates this moderate ideology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The Women's Movement] is not an attempt to arrogate man's prerogative of manhood; it is not even an attempt to assert and emphasize women's privilege of womanhood; it is simply the demand that in the life of woman, as in the life of man, space and liberty shall be found for a thing bigger than either manhood or womanhood – for humanity. (84–85, ''Alpha and Omega'') {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harrison, Jane Ellen|title=Alpha and Omega|year=1915|location=London|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015011434878;view=1up;seq=96|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To this end, Harrison's motto was [[Terence]]'s ''homo sum; humani nihil mihi alienum est'' ("I am a human being; nothing that is human do I account alien.")

==Scholarship==

Harrison began formal study at [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], where she gained a Certificate, and, in 1874, continued her studies in [[the classics]] at [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Newnham College]].  Her early work earned Harrison two honorary doctorates, an [[Legum Doctor|LLD]] from [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1895 and [[DLitt]] from the [[University of Durham]] in 1897.  This recognition afforded Harrison the opportunity to return to [[Newnham College]] as a lecturer in 1898, and her position was renewed continuously until Harrison retired in 1922.

===Early work===

Harrison's first monograph, in 1882, drew on the thesis that both [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[motif (visual arts)|motifs]] of the Greek vase-painters were drawing upon similar deep sources for mythology, the opinion that had not been common in earlier classical archaeology, that the repertory of vase-painters offered some unusual commentaries on myth and ritual.

Her approach in her great work, ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' (1903),&lt;ref&gt;"Once or twice in a generation a work of scholarship will alter an intellectual landscape so profoundly, that everyone is required to re-examine normally unexamined assumptions," Robert Ackerman begins his ''Introduction'' to the Princeton University Press reprint, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; was to proceed from the ritual to the myth it inspired.: "In theology facts are harder to seek, truth more difficult to formulate than in ritual."&lt;ref&gt;''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'' [https://archive.org/stream/prolegomenatostu00harr#page/163/mode/1up  p. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus she began her book with analyses of the best-known of the [[Athenian festivals]]: [[Anthesteria]], harvest festivals [[Thargelia]], [[Kallynteria]], [[Plynteria]], and the women's festivals, in which she detected many primitive survivals, [[Thesmophoria]], [[Arrophoria]], [[Skirophoria]], [[Stenia]] and [[Haloa]].

===Cultural evolution (or social Darwinism)===

Harrison alluded to and commented on the cultural applications of [[Charles Darwin]]'s work.  Harrison and her generation depended upon anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (who was himself influenced by Darwin and evolutionary ideas) for some new themes of [[cultural evolution]], especially his 1871 work, ''Primitive Culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom''.  After a [[Social Darwinism|socially Darwinian]] analysis of the [[origins of religion]], Harrison argues that religiosity is [[anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] and [[dogma]]tic, yet she defended the cultural necessity of religion and mysticism.  In her essay ''The Influence of Darwinism on the Study of Religion'' (1909), Harrison concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every dogma religion has hitherto produced is probably false, but for all that the religious or mystical spirit may be the only way of apprehending some things, and these of enormous importance. It may also be that the contents of this mystical apprehension cannot be put into language without being falsified and misstated, that they have rather to be felt and lived than uttered and intellectually analyzed; yet they are somehow true and necessary to life. (176, ''Alpha and Omega''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harrison, Jane Ellen|title=Alpha and Omega|year=1915|location=London|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015011434878;view=1up;seq=188|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later life==

[[World War I]] marked a deep break in Harrison's life.  Harrison never visited Italy or [[Greece]] after the war: she mostly wrote revisions or synopses of previous publications, and [[pacifism|pacifist]] leanings isolated her.  Upon retiring (in 1922), Harrison briefly lived in Paris, but she returned to London when her health began to fail.

==Devotees==

The critic [[Camille Paglia]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paglia's ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (passim), and the long essay  "Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders: Academe in the Hour of the Wolf" in Paglia's ''Sex, Art and American Culture: New Essays''.&lt;/ref&gt; has written of Harrison's influence on her own work. Paglia argues that Harrison's career has been ignored by [[second wave feminism|second-wave feminists]], who Paglia thinks object to Harrison's findings and efface the careers of prominent pre-WWII female scholars to bolster their claims of male domination in academe. [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]]&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard, ''The Invention of Jane Harrison'', Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;'s numerous essays and book on Harrison's life, as well as several other biographies of Harrison, have moved the needle however toward much more appreciation of Harrison's achievements, as well as further understanding of the context in which she worked. She remains a controversial figure, with several biographies giving rival accounts of her life and loves.

&lt;/ref&gt; Webb was the only child of grazier Charles Webb, originally from [[New Zealand]], and his wife Jessie Webb, née Watson, of Scotland, who died shortly after childbirth.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Webb was orphaned at age nine when her father died after an accident, and Webb was sent to live with her mother's family in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

Webb attended Balaclava College, in Melbourne's inner south-eastern suburbs, and passed her [[matriculation]] exams in October 1896 at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name="australian women" /&gt; She enrolled at the [[University of Melbourne]] on [[Valentine's Day]] 1898.&lt;ref name="australian women" /&gt; During her undergraduate study she won the Cobden Club medal, and a share of the [[J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Webb also operated an independent coaching college, staffed with other female university graduates, who ran tutoring programs catering for students from matriculation level through the whole duration of undergraduate courses.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; In May 1906 she registered with the government as a teacher.&lt;ref name="australian women" /&gt;

===Night lecturer===
In December 1908, after her third application to the University, Webb was employed as a night lecturer with the history department – the first woman to be appointed to such a position in Australia – teaching ancient and British history.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; At her appointment, Webb was the only other teacher in the department, aside from Professor [[John Simeon Elkington]].&lt;ref name="bate prov"&gt;{{Cite book

===Full-time lecturer===
On Elkington's retirement in 1913, she was elevated to a full-time lecturer, after [[Ernest Scott]], the new professor, successfully lobbied the University to provide for a full-time assistant.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Under Scott, and later under Scott's successor, [[Max Crawford]], Webb served as acting professor whenever the professor himself was on leave, taking over their classes and their administrative duties too.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Webb had extensive teaching responsibilities of her own; in 1914, for example, she gave two lectures each week in Ancient History, and two further evening lectures in both Ancient History and British History Part I weekly, in addition to a tutorial class with the honours students and consultations on the students' work.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Webb was primarily responsible for communicating with the correspondence students, and she even "sent her own books out on rotation to these students as the university provided no funding to buy books for circulation."&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Webb did not underestimate the importance of those students, comprising as they did about a quarter of the faculty's enrolment in 1913, "and she knew that many of them were teachers trying to improve their qualifications."&lt;ref name="selleck"&gt;{{cite book

Webb was promoted to become a senior lecturer within the history department in 1923; in 1925 she was an acting professor.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Webb was an acting professor again in 1933–34 and in 1942–44.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; However, despite Max Crawford recommending Webb for an associate professorship in his 1937 report to the University, Webb was never permanently promoted beyond the position of lecturer, only ever acting as a fill-in.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Her friend Dr Sweet had been appointed to an associate professorship in 1919, the first female to hold such a position at the University, though only after being passed over in the search for a full professor to succeed [[Baldwin Spencer]], despite extensive support and recommendation from within the local and international academic community.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Discrimination against women in academia was not uncommon at the time. In a speech to the University's Historical Society in 1928, reported in ''[[Farrago (newspaper)|Farrago]]'', Webb spoke sardonically of the systematic exclusion of women from the archaeological profession.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Webb's friend Ella Latham could no longer continue in her own teaching career after her marriage.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Indeed, Webb herself was only employed by the University on her third application, having been beaten twice prior by male candidates with, on paper, lesser qualifications than she.&lt;ref name="carey &amp; grimshaw"&gt;{{cite book

==Literary anthology==
Webb joined in 1909 with her friend Ella Latham – fellow 1902 Melbourne Arts graduate, fellow tutor at her coaching academy, and wife of [[John Latham (jurist)|John Latham]], future [[Chief Justice of Australia]] – in editing a literary anthology designed for school students, ''Phases of Literature: From Pope to Browning''.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; The book was small, but included substantial notes on the selected texts which, evincing Webb's influence, were peppered with classical and historical references.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; It was to be the only work that Webb ever published.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

==Community activities==
Aside from her academic employment, Webb was involved in a variety of community activities during this time. When the [[Royal Historical Society of Victoria]] was founded in 1909, it met in Webb's rooms in the [[Block Arcade, Melbourne|Block Arcade]].&lt;ref name="bate prov" /&gt; Webb was a founding member of the [[Lyceum Club, Melbourne|Lyceum Club]] in 1912, and from 1920 to 1922 was the Club's president.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; In 1922 Webb was a founding member of the Victorian Women Graduates' Association (now the Australian Federation of University Women, Victoria); she was president of this body also, from 1924 to 1925.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; During the [[First World War]], Webb campaigned for [[conscription in Australia|conscription]] along with a group of other university staff; she and [[William Harrison Moore|Harrison Moore]] produced a pro-conscription pamphlet.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

In late 1922 and early 1923 Webb joined Dr [[Georgina Sweet]], fellow lecturer and also a founding Lyceum Club and Women Graduates' Association member, on a journey through Africa, crossing the continent from [[Cape Town]], [[Cape Colony]] to [[Cairo]], Egypt.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Webb had a strong interest in Greek history, and following her trip to Africa, she spent eight months at the [[British School at Athens]].&lt;ref name="unimelb 150"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she visited archaeological sites in [[Mycenae]] and [[Knossos]] (where she was taken on a tour by [[Arthur Evans]]&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;), and toured [[Crete]] on the back of a [[mule]].&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Later in 1923, Webb was an alternate delegate for Australia to the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;

[[File:1926.Austin.Seven.saloon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Austin 7, of a sort akin to that in which Webb and Anderson drove to Alice Springs.]]

==Travel==
In August 1926, Webb and her friend and fellow Lyceum member Alice Anderson travelled to central Australia, driving to [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] and back in an [[Austin 7]].&lt;ref name="unimelb 150" /&gt; Anderson, a pioneering female mechanic and motor garage owner-operator, died shortly after returning from the six-week trip, after accidentally shooting herself while cleaning some guns borrowed for the journey.&lt;ref name="anderson adb"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb returned to Europe again in 1936 – sailing out on a Norwegian cargo ship&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; – beginning in England, North Africa (where she visited Greek and Roman settlements) and France, then travelling to [[Athens]] by train, and onwards to [[Turkey]]'s [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast and then inland to [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref name="australian women" /&gt; She returned via Germany, [[Syria]] and Mesopotamian sites in [[Iraq]] such as [[Ur]] and [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="australian women" /&gt; For most of the journey Webb travelled alone, by bus and by train.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Webb did not neglect her teaching duties during this time, however, composing nine exam papers for her subjects and posting them back to Australia ready to be sat by her students.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

==Death==
During her last stint as acting professor, Webb continued to exercise her administrative duties in running the history department despite being hospitalised with cancer.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Webb died at the Linden Private Hospital in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] in 1944.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Following her death, the library in the history department at the University was named after her.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Webb bequeathed £7128 to the University in her will, which is used to fund the Jessie Webb Scholarship, which provides funding for a student to emulate Webb's own experience at the British School, to study and research for a season in [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="scholarship"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Webb's contribution to history and the teaching of history in Melbourne has been little noticed by subsequent generations. That Webb did not publish any historical work has contributed to this, though [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Australian academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]] has said that Webb "underestimated her ability and scholarship, and probably felt handicapped by distance from ancient sites, great libraries and professional colleagues which could not be bridged by rare periods of overseas leave."&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; Susan Janson has posited that the strong focus on the publication of research is an aspect of later generations, and that Webb "was trained in an older tradition that stressed the pedagogical imperative for history".&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

Though Webb did not publish, she was for the most part well regarded for the quality of her teaching and the scholarship that went into her lectures. To the practice of history as taught at Melbourne, Webb brought an emphasis on [[historiography]], and critical investigation of secondary material, alongside an associated emphasis on the use of primary sources.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Richard Selleck argues that for the quality of her teaching, Webb "was respected in her time and honoured after her career finished," distinguishing herself particularly in delivering an excellent standard of education to the night students and the correspondence students, two groups not favoured by the central administration of the University.&lt;ref name="selleck" /&gt; Ronald Ridley has praised the scope of her teaching, encompassing not just political but economic, social and cultural history, and covering not merely Greek and Roman civilisation but their antecedents in the region also, the introduction of which into the curriculum Ridley regards as her "most fundamental contribution to the students' awareness".&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{cite book

Phillips]] praised her knack for human observation, which he compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], and [[Sir (William) Keith Hancock|Keith Hancock]] rated her among the best three teachers he had at Melbourne.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

While Webb's speciality was Ancient Greek history, she was well read in all classical history; she had a strong interest in Roman history, and followed the rapidly developing fields of Egyptian and Mesopotamian history and archaeology throughout her career.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Former students noted the breadth of Webb's interests and reading, and her frequent inclusion of the best contemporary research in her lectures.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; Susan Janson has praised the sustained quality and variety of the large number of exam papers Webb set over the course of her career, and argued that "[i]f we take [them] as our evidence of Jessie Webb's productivity, we can revalue her work as a historian."&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt;

The [[Awards for numismatics|Jessie Webb Award]] is presented annually by the Numismatic Association of Victoria for the best article by a female author in the Victorian Numismatic Journal.

'''John Bernard Duff''' (July 1, 1931 - October 1, 2013) was an [[United States of America|American]] historian born in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] on July 1, 1931 to John Bernard Duff, Sr. and Mary Cunningham Duff. He was the oldest of four brothers:  Thomas, Joseph and Peter Duff. He graduated from [[Our Lady of the Valley High School]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John B. Duff, former Chicago Public Library commissioner, 1931-2013|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-07/news/ct-met-obit-duff-20131008_1_chicago-public-library-columbia-college-chicago-mark-kelly|accessdate=24 September 2015|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, he married Helen Dorothy Mezzanotti, to whom he was married for 33 years.

A historian, he received a B.A. from [[Fordham University]] ([[New York City|New York]]), a M.A. from [[Seton Hall University]] ([[South Orange, New Jersey]]), and a PhD from [[Columbia University]] ([[New York City|New York]]). In 1970, following a decade as a professor of history at [[Seton Hall University]], he was appointed vice-president for Academic Affairs. In 1973, Duff became the first lay provost and executive vice-president in the history of Seton Hall.

In 1976, he became the first president of the new University of Lowell, in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], which would later become the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umass.edu/pubaffs/chronicle/archives/03/03-14/history.html accessed February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Duff was elected as the first chancellor of the Board of Regents in Massachusetts in 1981 and served there until 1986. On November 12, 1985, he was the first non-librarian appointed as the commissioner of the [[Chicago Public Library|Chicago Public Library system]]. While at that post, he supervised the construction of the [[Harold Washington Library]], the world’s largest public library.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotraveler.com/attractions/harold-washington-library-center.html accessed February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Duff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. John B. Duff|url=http://about.colum.edu/archives/college-history/presidents/john-duff.php|publisher=Columbia College Chicago Archives|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  became president of [[Columbia College Chicago]] in September 1992. During his tenure at Columbia College, he oversaw the acquisition of the College's first modern [[residence hall]], led its first long-range planning effort and expanded its local and national development initiatives. He also served as vice-chairman from 1994–1996 and as chairman from 1996-1998 of the Federation of Independent Illinois Colleges and Universities. Also during his time, the institution changed its name from Columbia College to Columbia College Chicago, effective October 28, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.colum.edu/archives/presidents/duff.php accessed February 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Malinche''' ({{IPA-es|la maˈlintʃe}}; c. 1496 or c. 1501 – c. 1529), known also as '''Malinalli''' {{IPA-nah|maliˈnalːi|}}, '''Malintzin''' {{IPA-nah|maˈlintsin|}} or '''Doña Marina''' {{IPA-es|ˈdoɲa maˈɾina|}}, was a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican Gulf Coast, who played a key role in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], acting as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for the Spanish conquistador, [[Hernán Cortés]]. She was one of 20 women slaves given to the Spaniards by the natives of [[Tabasco]] in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortés, and the Fall of Old Mexico''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993, pp. 171–172&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she gave birth to Cortés's first son, [[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martín]], who is considered one of the first [[Mestizos]] (people of mixed [[European ethnic groups|European]] and [[indigenous American]] ancestry).

The historical figure of Marina has been intermixed with Aztec legends (such as ''[[La Llorona]]'', a ghost woman who weeps for her lost children).&lt;ref&gt;Cypess, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Her reputation has been altered over the years according to changing social and political perspectives, especially after the Mexican Revolution, when she was portrayed in dramas, novels, and paintings as an evil or scheming temptress.&lt;ref&gt;Cypess, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico today, La Malinche remains iconically potent. She is understood in various and often conflicting aspects as the embodiment of treachery, the quintessential victim, or simply as symbolic mother of the new Mexican people. In a recent book&lt;ref&gt;https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062427267/when-montezuma-met-cort-and-233s/&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnohistorian Matthew Restall views Malinche as representative of one of the darkest aspects of the Conquest in which Spaniards routinely trafficked in young women by acquiring slaves and capturing and selling young women into slavery, including sex slavery. The term ''[[malinchista]]'' refers to a disloyal compatriot, especially in Mexico. 

Because of her controversial symbolization, a statue of La Malinche, Cortés, and their son Martín was removed soon after it was erected in Coyoacan, in the outskirts of Mexico City, in 1982. The statue was intended to be respectful of her trials and to emphasize the mestizo (or mixed-blood) character of the nation. However, student protests erupted: the protesters wanted no monument that presented Malinche in a positive light, for in their minds she was too closely associated with domination by outsiders and with betrayal.&lt;ref&gt; Townsend, Camilla (2006). Malintzin's choices: an Indian woman in the conquest of Mexico. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press. pp.4&lt;/ref&gt;

La Malinche (also known as Malinalli, Malintzin or doña Marina) was born sometime between 1496 and 1501,&lt;ref&gt;

The Xicalango gave the child to the Tabascans.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|85}}Before she was 20, she was renamed Marina by Spanish newcomers and called Malintzin by other indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The conquest of Mexico ===
[[File:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|left|[[Codex Azcatitlan]], [[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Malinche]](far right), early 16th-century indigenous pictorial manuscript of the conquest of Mexico]]
Malintzin was introduced to the Spanish in April 1519, when she was among 20 slave women given by the [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] of [[Potonchán]] (in the present-day state of [[Tabasco]]) after the Spaniards defeated them in battle.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; At this time, she was probably in her late teens or early 20s. It isn't clear how Malintzin was treated or how she felt about her captors at the time. Bernal Díaz del Castillo remarked on her beauty and graciousness; she was the only one of the slaves whose name he remembered. (He called her Marina, the Christian name she took upon being baptized in 1519.) Cortés singled her out as a gift for [[Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero]], perhaps the most well-born member of the expedition.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} Soon, however, Puertocarrero was on his way to Spain as Cortés' emissary to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and Cortés kept her by his side for her value as an interpreter who spoke two native languages: Mayan and Nahuatl.

According to Díaz, she spoke to emissaries from Moctezuma in their native tongue [[Nahuatl]] and pointed to Cortés as the chief Spaniard to speak for them. Cortés had located a Spanish priest, [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who had spent several years in captivity among the [[Maya peoples]] in Yucatán following a shipwreck. Thus, he had learned some Mayan, but he did not speak Nahuatl. Cortés used Marina for translating between the [[Nahuatl language]] (the common language of central Mexico of that time) and the [[Chontal Maya language]]. Then Aguilar could interpret from Mayan to Spanish&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|86}} until Marina learned Spanish and could be the sole interpreter.

Cortés kept her by his side so much so that Aztec codices always show her picture drawn alongside of Cortés. The natives of Tlaxcala, who formed an alliance with Cortés against Moctezuma, called both Marina and Cortés by the same name: Malintzin. (The -tzin suffix was the Nahuatl equivalent of "sir" or "lady" bestowed on them by the Tlaxcalans.)

According to surviving records, Marina learned of a plan by natives of [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] to cooperate with the Aztecs to destroy the small Spanish army. She alerted Cortés to the danger and even pretended to be cooperating with her native informants while Cortés foiled their plot to trap his men. Cortés turned the tables on them and slaughtered many Cholulans.&lt;ref name="Diaz"/&gt; In this manner, she is often considered as a traitor by many and her name is not revered among many locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://malincheinfo.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/hero-or-traitor-the-controversy-of-la-malinche/|title=Hero or Traitor? The Controversy of La Malinche|date=2011-05-02|work=Malinche Info|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the fall of Tenochtitlán in late 1521 and the birth of her son [[Martín Cortés (son of doña Marina)|Martín Cortés]] in 1522, Marina stayed in a house Cortés built for her in the town of Coyoacán, eight miles south of Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital city, while it was being rebuilt as Mexico City. Cortés took Marina to quell a rebellion in [[Honduras]] in 1524–1526 when she is seen serving again as interpreter (suggestive of a knowledge of Maya dialects beyond Chontal and Yucatán.) While in the mountain town of Orizaba in central Mexico, she married [[Juan Jaramillo]], a Spanish [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Helen. ''Voice of the Vanquished: The Story of the Slave Marina and Hernan Cortes''. Chicago: University Editions, 1995, page 454.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians such as [[William H. Prescott|Prescott]] generally lost track of Marina after her journey to Central America. Some contemporary scholars have estimated that she died less than a decade after the conquest of Mexico-Tenochtitlan at some point in 1529.&lt;ref&gt;Chaison, Joanne. "Mysterious Malinche: A Case of Mistaken Identity," ''The Americas'' 32, N. 4 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Sir Hugh Thomas in his book "Conquest" reports the probable date of her death as 1551, deduced from letters he discovered in Spain alluding to her as alive in 1550 and deceased after 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. "Conquest:Mocteuma, Cortes, and the Fall of the Aztec Empire". New York: Simon and Schuster, 1993, page 769.&lt;/ref&gt; She was survived by her son Don Martín, who would be raised primarily by his father's family, and a daughter Doña María who would be raised by Jaramillo and his second wife Doña Beatriz de Andrada.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Camilla. ''Malintzin's Choices: An Indian Woman in the Conquest of Mexico.'' University of New Mexico Press, 2006, pp. 168–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of La Malinche in the conquest of Mexico ===
[[File:Malinche Tlaxcala.jpg|thumb|250px|right|La Malinche and Hernán Cortés in the city of Xaltelolco, in a drawing from the late 16th-century [[Aztec codices|codex]] ''[[History of Tlaxcala]]'']]
For the [[conquistador]]es, having a reliable interpreter was important enough, but there is evidence that Marina's role and influence were larger still. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]], a soldier who, as an old man, produced the most comprehensive of the eye-witness accounts, the ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'' ("True Story of the Conquest of New Spain"), speaks repeatedly and reverentially of the "great lady" Doña Marina (always using the honorific title Doña). "Without the help of Doña Marina," he writes, "we would not have understood the language of New Spain and Mexico." [[Rodríguez de Ocaña]], another conquistador, relates Cortés' assertion that after God, Marina was the main reason for his success.

The evidence from indigenous sources is even more interesting, both in the commentaries about her role, and in her prominence in the codex drawings made of conquest events. Although to some Marina may be known as a traitor, she was not viewed as such by all the Tlaxcalan. In some depictions they portrayed her as "larger than life",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Malintzin's choices: an Indian woman in the conquest of Mexico|last=Townsend|first=Camilla|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2006|isbn=0-8263-3405-9|location=New Mexico|pages=74-76}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes larger than Cortés, in rich clothing, and an alliance is shown between her and the Tlaxcalan instead of them and the Spaniards. They respected and trusted her and portrayed her in this light generations after the Spanish conquest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In the ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala (History of Tlaxcala)]]'', for example, not only is Cortés rarely portrayed without Marina poised by his side, but she is shown at times on her own, seemingly directing events as an independent authority. If she had been trained for court life, as in Díaz's account, her relationship to Cortés may have followed the familiar pattern of marriage among native elite classes. The role of the Nahua wife acquired through an alliance would have been to assist her husband achieve his military and diplomatic objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mesolore.org/viewer/view/2/Lienzo-de-Tlaxcala&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's historians give great credit to Marina's diplomatic skills, with some "almost tempted to think of her as the real conqueror of Mexico."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=William|title=The Rise and Fall of North American Indians|year=2003|publisher=Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lde5K93ozuMC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, old conquistadors on various occasions would remember that one of her greatest skills had been her ability to convince other Indians of what she herself could see clearly, which was that it was useless in the long run to stand against Spanish metal and Spanish ships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast with earlier parts of Díaz del Castillo's account, after Marina's diplomacy began assisting Cortés, the Spanish were forced into combat on one more occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=William|title=The Rise and Fall of North American Indians|year=2003|publisher=Roberts Rinehart Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lde5K93ozuMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had La Malinche not been part of the Conquest of Mexico for her linguistic gift, communication between the Spanish and the Indigenous would have been much harder. La Malinche knew to speak in different registers and tones between certain Indigenous tribes and people. For the Nahua audiences, she spoke rhetorically, formally, and high-handedly. This shift into formality give the Nahua the impression that she was a noblewoman who knew what she was talking about.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Camilla (2006). Malintzin's choices: an Indian woman in the conquest of Mexico. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press. pp.58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name La Malinche ==
The many uncertainties which surround Malinche's role in the Spanish conquest begin with her name and its several variants. At birth she was named Malinalli or Malinal after the Goddess of Grass, on whose name-day she was born. Later, her family added the name Tenepal which means “one who speaks much and with liveliness”.&lt;ref name="Cypess, p. 2"&gt;Cypess, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

After being baptized, the 20 slave girls were distributed by Cortes among his Spanish captains. Malinalli then took the Christian name of Marina, to which the soldiers of Cortés added the Doña, meaning lady.&lt;ref name=Diaz/&gt;{{rp|80–82}}

It is not known whether Marina was chosen because of a phonetic resemblance to her actual name, or chosen randomly from among common Spanish names of the time. A Nahuatl mispronunciation of Marina as Malin plus the reverential "-tzin" suffix, formed the compounded title of Malintzin, which the natives used for both Marina and Cortes, because he spoke through her.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz 1963, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in Mexican Spanish the word [[malinchism]]o  and malinchista is used to denounce Mexicans who are perceived as denying their own cultural heritage by preferring foreign cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Fortes De Leff, J. (2002). Racism in Mexico: Cultural Roots and Clinical Interventions1. Family Process, 41(4), 619-623.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians believe that La Malinche saved her people from the Aztecs, who held a hegemony throughout the territory and demanded tribute from its inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Some Mexicans also credit her with having brought Christianity to the New World from Europe, and for having influenced Cortes to be more humane than he would otherwise have been. It is argued, however, that without her help, Cortes would not have been successful in conquering the Aztecs as quickly, giving the Aztec people enough time to adapt to new technology and methods of warfare. From that viewpoint, she is seen as one who betrayed the indigenous people by siding with the Spaniards. Recently a number of feminist Latinas have decried such a categorization as scapegoating.&lt;ref name="Cypess, p. 2"/&gt;

== Malinche’s figure in contemporary Mexico ==
[[File:Monumento al Mestizaje.jpg|thumb|Modern statue of Cortés, Marina, and their son Martín, which was moved from a prominent place of display to an obscure one, due to protests]]

Malinche’s image has become a mythical [[archetype]] that [[Hispanic America]]n artists have represented in various forms of art. Her figure permeates historical, cultural, and social dimensions of Hispanic American cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Cypess, Intro.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times and in several genres, she is compared with the [[La Llorona]] (folklore story of the woman weeping for lost children), and the Mexican soldaderas (women who fought beside men during the [[Mexican Revolution]])&lt;ref&gt;Salas{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their brave actions.

La Malinche's legacy is one of myth mixed with legend, and the opposing opinions of the Mexican people about the legendary woman. Some see her as a founding figure of the Mexican nation. While others, however, continue to find the legends more memorable than the history, seeing her as a traitor, as may be assumed from a legend that she had a twin sister who went North and the pejorative [[nickname]] [[La Chingada]] associated with her twin.

Feminist interventions into the figure of Malinche began in 1960s. The work of [[Rosario Castellanos]] was particularly significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castellanos|first=Rosario|title=Otra vez Sor Juana" ("Once Again Sor Juana")|date=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent poem La Mallinche recast her not as a traitor but as a victim.&lt;ref name="Romero2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando Romero|title=Feminism, Nation and Myth: La Malinche|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfesWiXwkdQC&amp;pg=PA28|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Arte Publico Press|isbn=978-1-61192-042-0|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican feminists defended Malinche as a woman caught between cultures, forced to make complex decisions, who ultimately served as a mother of a new race.&lt;ref name="CoerverPasztor2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Don M. Coerver|author2=Suzanne B. Pasztor|author3=Robert Buffington|title=Mexico: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary Culture and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSred4NyOKoC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-132-8|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
*A reference to La Malinche as Marina is made in the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' by the Polish author [[Jan Potocki]], in which she is cursed for yielding her "heart and her country to the hateful Cortez, chief of the sea-brigands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potocki|first=Jan|title=The Manuscript Found at Saragossa|year=1995|publisher=Penguin Books|author2=trans. Ian Maclean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*La Malinche appears in the adventure novel ''[[Montezuma's Daughter]]'' (1893) by [[Henry Rider Haggard|H. Rider Haggard]].

*Doña Marina appears in the Henry King film adventure ''[[Captain from Castile (novel)|Captain from Castile]]'' (1947) played Estela Inda.

*La Malinche is portrayed as a Christian and protector of her fellow native Mexicans in the novel ''Tlaloc Weeps for Mexico'' (1939) by [[László Passuth]], and is the main protagonist in such works as the novels ''The Golden Princess'' (1954) by [[Alexander Baron]] and ''Feathered Serpent: A Novel of the Mexican Conquest'' (2002) by [[Colin Falconer (writer)|Colin Falconer]]. In contrast, she is portrayed as a duplicitous traitor in [[Gary Jennings]]' novel ''[[Aztec (novel)|Aztec]]'' (1980).  A novel published in 2006 by [[Laura Esquivel]] portrays the main character as a pawn of history who becomes ''Malinche''.

*In 1949, choreographer José Limón premiered the dance trio "La Milanche" to music by Norman Lloyd.  It was the first work created by Limón for his own company, and was based on his memories as a child of Mexican fiestas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://limon.org/dances/ "Repertory"] ''Limón''&lt;/ref&gt;

*The story of La Malinche is told in ''Cortez and Marina'' (1963) by [[Edison Marshall]].

[[File:La Malinche statue.jpg|right|thumb|267px|La Malinche, as part of the ''Monumento al Mestizaje'' in Mexico City]]

*In the 1973 Mexican film ''Leyendas macabras de la colonia'', La Malinche's mummy is in the possession of Luisa, her daughter by Hernán Cortés, while her spirit inhabits a cursed painting.

*La Malinche is referred to in the songs "[[Cortez the Killer]]" from the 1975 album ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' by [[Neil Young]], and "La Malinche" by the French band [[Feu! Chatterton]] from their 2015 album ''Ici le jour (a tout enseveli)''

*In the animated television series ''[[The Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'' (1982), which chronicles the adventures of a Spanish boy and his companions traveling throughout South America in 1532 to seek the lost city of [[El Dorado]], a woman called Marinche becomes a dangerous adversary. The series was originally produced in [[Japan]], and when translated into English.

*In the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, a starship, the USS ''Malinche'', was named for La Malinche, and appeared in the 1997 "[[For the Uniform]]" episode of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.  This was done by [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]], a native of [[Mexico City]], who together with friend [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] later wrote a screenplay based on La Malinche called ''The Serpent and the Eagle''.

*La Malinche is a key character in the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'' (2005) by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]].

*Malinalli is the main character in a 2011 historical novel by Helen Heightsman Gordon, ''Malinalli of the Fifth Sun: The Slave Girl Who Changed the Fate of Mexico and Spain''.

*Author [[Octavio Paz]] addresses the issue of La Malinche's role as the mother of Mexican culture in ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]''. He uses her relation to Cortés symbolically to represent Mexican culture as originating from rape and violation.

*Malinal is a character in [[Graham Hancock]]'s series of novels ''War God: Nights of the Witch'' (2013) and ''War God: Return of the Plumed Serpent'' (2014), which is a fictional story describing the events related to the Hernan Cortes' expedition to Mexico and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire.

The '''Lumières''' (literally in English: ''Enlighteners'') was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement of the second half of the 18th century, originating in France and spreading throughout Europe. It included philosophers such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[John Locke]], [[Pierre Bayle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Over time it came to mean the {{lang|fr|Siècle des Lumières}}, in English the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref group="Note" name="definition"/&gt;

Members of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, [[obscurantism]] and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revolution-francaise.net/2006/07/07/56-contre-nous-de-la-tyrannie-des-relations-ideologiques-entre-lumieres-et-revolution-par-josiane-boulad-ayoub|title=Contre nous de la tyrannie...

Ces pensées influenceront les révolutionnaires français de 1789.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe, and was almost exclusively a development of the ideas of [[Renaissance humanism]]. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of "enlightenment" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.

In the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over [[faith]] and [[belief]]; in politics and economics, the triumph of the [[bourgeois]] over [[nobility]] and [[clergy]].

==== Advances in scientific method ====

[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice section 256px.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Encyclopédie frontispice section 256px.jpg|Detail from the frontispice of Diderot and D’Alembert's ''Encyclopédie''. Truth radiates light; on the right, Reason and Philosophy try to capture it. 1772 engraving by [[Benoît-Louis Prévost]], from a drawing by [[Charles Nicolas Cochin]].]]

The Lumières movement was in large part an extension of the discoveries of [[Nicolas Copernicus]] in the 16th century, which were not well known during his lifetime, and more so of the theories of [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1642). Inquiries to establish certain [[axiom]]s and [[mathematical proof]]s continued as [[Cartesianism]] throughout the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Seelig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seelig|first1=Peter|title=Science and Technology in the 17th and 18th Centuries|journal=Daily Life through History, ABC-CLIO|date=2010|url=http://dailylife2.abc-clio.com/Search/Display/1426548|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]] (1646&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1716) and [[Isaac Newton]] (1642&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1727) had independently and almost simultaneously developed the [[calculus]], and [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1650) the idea of [[Monad (philosophy)|monads]]. British philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Hume]] adopted an approach, later called [[empiricism]], which preferred the use of the [[senses]] and [[experience]] over that of [[pure reason]].

[[Baruch Spinoza]] took Descartes' side, most of all in his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|language=fr|first1=Franc̜ois|last1=Pillon|author1link=|journal=L'Année philosophique|title=Bibliothèque de philosophie contemporaine|editor-first=Félix|editor-last=Alcan|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1903|volume=13|page=257|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MnVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he demurred from Descartes in {{lang|la|[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]}} ("On the Improvement of the Understanding"), where he argued that the process of [[perception]] is not one of pure reason, but also the senses and [[intuition]]. Spinoza's thought was based on a model of the universe where God and Nature are one and the same. This became an anchor in the [[Age of Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Antoine Eugène|last1=Genoude|author1link=|title=La Raison du christianisme, ou, Preuves de la verité de la religion tirées des écrits des plus grands hommes de la France, de l'Angleterre et de l'Allemagne|trans-title=Christian Reason, or, Thoughts on the Truth of Religion, by the Greatest Writers in France, England and Germany|publisher=Pourrat Frères|place=Paris|year=1836|chapter=2|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ADYUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; held across the ages from Newton's time to that of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s (1743–1826).

A notable change was the emergence of a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist philosophy]], spreading across Europe, embodied by Newton. The [[scientific method]] &amp;ndash; exploring experimental evidence and constructing consistent theories and axiom systems from observed phenomena &amp;ndash; was undeniably useful. The predictive ability of its resulting theories set the tone for his masterwork ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687). As an example of scientific progress in the [[Age of Reason]] and the Lumières movement, Newton's example remains unsurpassed, in taking observed facts and constructing a theory which explains them [[A priori knowledge|a priori]], for example taking the motions of the planets observed by [[Johannes Kepler]] to confirm [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|his law of universal gravitation]]. Naturalism saw the unification of pure [[empiricism]] as practiced by the likes of [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]] with the axiomatic, "pure reason" approach of Descartes.

Belief in an intelligible world ordered by a Christian God became the crux of philosophical investigations of knowledge. On one side, religious philosophy concentrated on [[piety]], and the omniscience and ultimately mysterious nature of God; on the other were ideas such as [[deism]], underpinned by the impression that the world was comprehensible by human reason and that it was governed by universal physical laws. God was imagined as a "Great Watchmaker"; experimental [[natural philosopher]]s found the world to be more and more ordered, even as machines and measuring instruments became ever more sophisticated and precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=J. S.|last1=Flotte|author1link=|title=Leçons élémentaires de philosophie|chapter=|publisher=Brunot-Labbé|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1819|volume=2|page=226|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q=Dieu%20Grand%20Horloger&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous French natural philosopher of the 18th Century, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon]], was critical of this natural theology in his masterwork ''[[Histoire Naturelle]]''. Buffon rejected the idea of ascribing to [[Miracle|divine intervention]] and the "supernatural" that which science could now explain. This criticism brought him up against the [[Sorbonne]] which, dominated by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], never stopped trying to censor him. In 1751, he was ordered to redact some propositions contrary to the teaching of the Church; having proposed 74,000 years for the [[age of the Earth]], this was contrary to the Bible which, using the scientific method on data found in [[biblical concordance]]s, dated it to around 6,000 years.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} &lt;!-- true but not part of the translation. Can quote Orwell quoting his concordance, that it was 4,004 BC at 3 oçlock in the afternoon --&gt; The Church was also hostile to his no less illustrious contemporary [[Carl von Linné]], and some have concluded that the Church simply refused to believe that order existed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yves|last=Zarka|first2=Marie-France|last2=Germain|url=http://www.bouquineo.fr/products/buffon-le-naturaliste-philosophe-1|title=Buffon, le naturaliste philosophe|publisher=Chemins de tr@verse|year=2014|accessdate=30 October 2015|isbn=978-2-313-00466-1|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individual liberty and the social contract ====
This effort to research and elucidate universal laws, and to determine their component parts, also became an important element in the construction of a philosophy of [[individualism]], where everyone had rights based only on [[fundamental human rights]]. There developed the philosophical notion of the thoughtful [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], an individual who could make decisions based on pure reason and no longer in the yoke of custom. In ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', [[John Locke]] argued that [[property rights]] are not held in common but are totally personal, and made legitimate by the work required to obtain the property, as well as its protection (recognition) by others. Once the idea of [[natural law]] is accepted, it becomes possible to form the modern view of what we would now call [[political economy]].

In his famous essay ''[[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]'' ({{lang-de|Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?}}, {{lang-fr|Qu'est-ce que les Lumières ?}}), [[Emmanuel Kant]] defined the Lumières thus:
{{quote|{{lang|fr|Les Lumières c’est la sortie de l’homme hors de l’état de tutelle dont il est lui-même responsable. L’état de tutelle est l’incapacité de se servir de son entendement sans la conduite d’un autre. On est soi-même responsable de cet état de tutelle quand la cause tient non pas à une insuffisance de l’entendement mais à une insuffisance de la résolution et du courage de s’en servir sans la conduite d’un autre}}. {{lang|la|Sapere aude!}} {{lang|fr|Aie le courage de te servir de ton propre entendement! Tel est la devise des Lumières}}.

Enlightenment is the release of man from a state of bondage for which he is himself responsible. In this state of bondage he is unable to fulfill his intentions without the help of another. He is himself responsible for this bondage, where the cause is not a lack of understanding but a lack of resolution and courage to use it unguided. {{lang|la|Sapere Aude!}} Have the courage to use your own understanding! Such is the motto of the Lumières.}}

The Lumières' philosophy was thus based on the realities of a systematic, ordered and understandable world, which required Man also to think in an ordered and systematic way. As well as physical laws, this included ideas on the laws governing human affairs and the [[divine right of kings]], leading to the idea that the monarch acts with the consent of the people, and not the other way around. This legal concept informed [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s theory of the [[social contract]] as a reciprocal relationship between men, and more so between families and other groups, which would become increasingly stronger, accompanied by a concept of individual inalienable rights. The powers of God were moot amongst atheist Lumières.

The Lumières movement redefined the ideas of liberty, property and rationalism, which took on meanings that we still understand today, and introduced into political philosophy the idea of the free individual, liberty for all guaranteed by the State (and not the whim of the government) backed by a strong [[rule of law]].

To understand the interaction between the Age of Reason and the Lumières, one approach is to compare [[Thomas Hobbes]] with [[John Locke]]. Hobbes, who lived for three quarters of the 17th century, had worked to create an ontology of human emotions, ultimately trying to make order out of an inherently chaotic universe. In the alternate, Locke saw in Nature a source of unity and universal rights, with the State's assurance of protection. This "culture revolution" over the 17th and 18th centuries was a battle between these two viewpoints of the relationship between Man and Nature.

This resulted, in France, in the spread of the notion of human rights, finding expression in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which greatly influenced similar declarations of rights in the following centuries, and left in its wake global political upheaval. Especially in France and the United States, [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[freedom of thought]] were held to be fundamental rights.

=== Social values and manifests ===
[[File:Rousseau.jpg|thumb|150px|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]

==== Representation of the people ====
The core values supported by the Lumières were [[religious tolerance]], liberty and [[social equality]].
In England, America and France, the application of these values resulted in a new definition of [[natural law]] and a separation of [[political power]]. To these values may be added a love of nature and the cult of reason.
{{quote|{{lang|fr|Aujourd’hui nous recevons trois éducations différentes ou contraires : celles de nos pères, celles de nos maîtres, celle du monde. Ce qu’on nous dit dans la dernière renverse toutes les idées des premières.}}&lt;br/&gt;Today we receive three different, conflicting, educations: those of our fathers, those of our masters, and those of the world. It is only when we know the last that we can reject the first two.|[[Montesquieu]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L’Esprit des lois (part I)|language=fr|volume=4|chapter=IV. Différence des effets de l’éducation chez les Anciens et parmi nous|trans-title=Difference of the Effects of Education among the Ancients and Ourselves|last=Montesquieu|authorlink=Montesquieu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Philosophical goals ====
[[File:Histoiredesdeuxindes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover of Raynal's ''[[Histoire des deux Indes]]'', an encyclopaedia of 18th-century anticolonialism]]
The ideal figure of the Lumières was a philosopher, a [[man of letters]] with a social function of exercising his reason in all domains to guide his and others' conscience, to advocate a [[value system]] and use it in discussing the problems of the time. He is a committed individual, involved in [[society]], an {{lang|fr|honnête homme qui agit en tout par raison}} (''[[Encyclopédie]]''; "Honest man who approaches everything with reason"), {{lang|fr|qui s’occupe à démasquer des erreurs}} ([[Diderot]], "Who concerns himself with revealing error").

The rationalism of the Lumières was not to the exclusion of aesthetics. Reason and [[Feeling|sentiment]] went hand-in-hand in their philosophy. The thoughts of the Lumières were equally capable of intellectual rigour and sentimentality.

Despite controversy about the limits of their philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Sala-Molins|title=Le Code Noir ou le calvaire de Caanan|language=fr|place=Paris|publisher=PUF|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Louis|last=Sala-Molins|title=Les misères des Lumières; sous la raison l'outrage''|place=Paris|publisher=Flammarion|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when they denounced black [[slavery]], many Lumières criticised slavery, or [[colonialism]], or both, including [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[De l'Esprit des Lois]]'' (while keeping a "personal" slave), [[Denis Diderot]] in ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville]]'', [[Voltaire]] in ''[[Candide]]'' and [[Guillaume-Thomas Raynal]] in his encyclopaedic ''[[Histoire des deux Indes]]'', the very model of 18th-century [[anticolonialism]] to which, among others, Diderot and [[Paul Henri Thiry d'Holbach|d’Holbach]] contributed. It was stated without any proof that one of their number, [[Voltaire]], had shares in the [[slave trade]].

==== Encyclopaedic goals ====
At the time, there was a particular taste for compendia of "all knowledge". This ideal found an instance in Diderot and d'Alembert's {{lang|fr|Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers}} ("Encyclopaedia, or Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts"), usually known simply as the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. Published between 1750 and 1770 it aimed to lead people out of ignorance through the widest dissemination of knowledge.

=== Criticism ===
The Lumières movement was, for all its existence, pulled in two directions by opposing social forces: on one side, a strong [[spiritualism]] accompanied by a traditional faith in the religion of the Church; on the other, the rise of an [[anticlerical]] movement, critical of the differences between religious theory and practice, which was most manifest in France.

Anticlericism was not the only source of tension in France: some noblemen contested monarchical power and the upper classes wanted to see greater fruit from their labours. A relaxing of morals fomented opinion against absolutism and the Ancient Order. According to Dale K. Van Kley, [[Jansenism]] in France also became a source of division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Dale K.|last1=Van Kley|author1link=|title=Les Origines religieuses de la Révolution française, 1560–1791|publisher=Seuil|volume=|isbn=9782020855099|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French judicial system showed itself to be outdated. Even though commercial law had become codified during the 17th century, there was no uniform, or codified, civil law.

==== Voltaire ====
[[File:voltaire.jpg|thumb|150px|Voltaire ([[Circa|c.]] 1745) by the school of [[Nicolas de Largillière]]]]
This social and legal background was criticised in works by the likes of [[Voltaire]]. Exiled in [[England]] between 1726 and 1729, he studied the works of John Locke and Isaac Newton, and the English monarchy. He became well known for his denunciation of injustices such as those against [[Jean Calas]], [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], [[François-Jean de la Barre]] and [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally]].

The Lumières philosophy saw its climax in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|langue=|first1=Patrick|last1=Cabanel|author1link=Patrick Cabanel|first2=|last2=|author2link=|title=Histoire de France, 1750–1995|chapter=Monarchies et républiques|publisher=Presses Univ. du Mirail|lien publisher=|place=Toulouse|day=|month=|year=|volume=1|page=27|isbn=9782858162741|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5i9J2iRbkcC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Voltaire, it was obvious that if the monarch can get the people to believe unreasonable things, then he can get them to ''do'' unreasonable things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Impie|title=Dictionnaire philosophique}}&lt;/ref&gt; This axiom became the basis for his criticism of the Lumières, and led to the basis of [[romanticism]]: that constructions from pure reason created as many problems as they solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Bénichou|title=L'École du désenchantement. Sainte-Beuve, Nodier, Musset, Nerval, Gautier|place=Paris|publisher=Gallimard|year=1992|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lumières philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lise|last=Andriès|title=Le Partage des savoirs XVIIIeme-XIXeme siecles|chapter= Littérature et idéologies|language=fr|place=Lyon|publisher=Presses Universitaires de Lyon|year=2003|isbn=9782729707330}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crucial point of intellectual progress consisted of the synthesis of knowledge, enlightened by human reason, with the creation of a sovereign moral authority. A contrary point of view that developed, arguing that such a process would be swayed by social conventions, leading to a "New Truth" based on reason that was but a poor imitation of the ideal and unassailable truth.

The Lumières movement thus tried to find a balance between the idea of a "natural" liberty (or autonomy) and the freedom ''from'' that liberty, that is to say, the recognition that the autonomy found in nature was at odds with the discipline required for pure reason. At the same time, with various monarchs' reforms, there was a piecemeal attempt to redefine the order of society, and the relationship between monarch and subjects. The idea of a natural order was equally prevalent in scientific thought, for example, in the works of the biologist [[Carl von Linné]].

==== Kant ====
In [[Germany]], [[Emmanuel Kant]] (like Rousseau, defining himself among the Lumières) heavily criticised the limitations of pure reason in his work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' ({{lang-de|Kritik der reinen Vernunft}}), but also that of English empiricism in ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' ({{lang-de|Kritik der praktischen Vernunft}}). Compared with the rather subjective [[metaphysics]] of Descartes, Kant developed a more objective viewpoint in this branch of philosophy.

==== Adam Smith ====
Great thinkers at the end of the Lumières movement ([[Adam Smith]], Thomas Jefferson and even the young [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]) adopted into their philosophy the ideas of self-organising and evolutionary forces. The Lumières' stance was then presented with reference to what was seen as a universal truth: that Good is fundamental in nature, but it is not self-evident. On the contrary, it is the advance of human reason that reveals this constant structure. [[Romanticism]] is the exact opposite of this stance.

=== Aestheticism ===
{{POV section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Boullée - Projet d'Opéra - élévation.jpg|thumb|150px|Redevelopment of the [[Opéra de Paris]] by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], 1781]]

{{quote|
In its general view, the aestheticism of the Lumières took on a moral aspect, the times of Voltaire's satire had passed, and Rousseau (in ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' of 1776) and the paintings of [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] sought the beautiful and the everlasting. As the century grew older, more literature and art turned its back on free forms and a lightness of touch, regarding them as aristocratic and worldly. They turned towards the serious, the authentic and the natural, that fit the utilitarian morality of the bourgeois public whose taste was for neoclassicism: still having antiquity as subject-matter, but not the allegorical antiquity; a more realistic, sober antiquity, such as in the works of the painter [[Jacques-Louis David]].
}}

This resulted in reflections about [[urbanism]]. The Lumières' model town would be a joint effort between public provision and sympathetic architects, to create administrative or utilitarian buildings (town halls, hospitals, theatres, commisariats) all provided with views, squares, fountains, promenades, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L.|last=Hautecoeur|title=Histoire de l'architecture classique en France|volume=III, IV|date=1950–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The French [[Académie royale d'architecture]] was of the opinion that {{lang|fr|le beau est ce qui plait}} ("The beautiful is the pleasant"). For [[Abbé Laugier]], on the contrary, the beautiful was that which was in line with rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laugier|first=Marc-Antoine|title=Essai sur l'architecture|place=Paris|date=1753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural model for all architecture was the log cabin supported by four tree trunks, with four horizontal parts and a roof, respectively [[column (architecture)|columns]], [[entablature]], and [[pediment]]s. The model of a [[Greek temple]] was thus extended into the décor and the structure. This paradigm resulted in a change of style in the middle of the 18th century: [[Rococo]] was dismissed, [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Palladian architecture]] became the principal references for [[neoclassical architecture]].

[[File:UVa Rotunda.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The rotunda of the [[University of Virginia]], designed by Thomas Jefferson.]]
The [[University of Virginia]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], was founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. He drew up plans for parts of the campus based on the values of the Lumières.

The [[Place Stanislas]] at [[Nancy, France]] is the focus of an array of neoclassical urban buildings, and has been on the UNESCO [[List of World Heritage Sites in France]] since 1983, as well as several other sites in the town, such as the [[Place de la Carrière]] and the [[Place d’Alliance]], the administrative centre of the time.

[[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]] (1736&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1806) was a member of the Académie d'Architecture was without doubt the architect whose projects best represented the utopian, purely rational environment. (That which is rational, and thus based in the understanding of nature, cannot be at the same time utopian.) Starting in 1775 he built the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans]], a very industrial city in [[Doubs]].

The bourgeosie had learned nothing from the Lumières, even though they saw Rousseau, Montesquieu and Kant as honest men who approved of the "élite": a vague concept, and one of which the Lumières amongst others disapproved.{{cite book|title=Le Discours sur la Servitude Volontaire|first=Étienn|last=de La Boétie}}

There was considerable coverage in the English and French Press, but less so in Germany and Italy; in Spain and Russia very few knew about it save a few intellectuals, senior officials and grand families participated in the movement. The mass of the people could not care less: the vast majority of the common people, even in France, had never heard of Voltaire or Rousseau.

Nevertheless, the Lumières had disrupted the old certainties. This did not stop at social and political upheaval: the Enlightenment inspired a revolutionary generation, which is not to say they explicitly encouraged the [[French Revolution of 1789]].

==== Origins ====

As [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]], the philosophers of the Lumières movement&lt;ref group="Note" name="definition"&gt;In French, the term {{lang|fr|Lumières}} (as a collective noun) is used to designate the free-thinkers, writers and philosophers who embraced a particular philosophy; it might be regarded as an abuse of language to use it to refer to the philosophy itself.&lt;/ref&gt; came with many different talents: [[Thomas Jefferson]] had had a legal education but was equally at home with [[archaeology]] and [[architecture]]; [[Benjamin Franklin]] had been a career diplomat and was a physicist. Condorcet wrote on subjects as wide-ranging as commerce, finance, education and science.

The social origins of the philosophers were also diverse: many were from middle-class families (Voltaire, Jefferson), others from more modest beginnings ([[Emmanuel Kant]], Franklin, Diderot) or from the nobility (Montesquieu, Condorcet). Some had had a religious education (Diderot, [[Louis de Jaucourt]]) or one in the law (Montesquieu, Jefferson).

The philosophers formed networks and communicated in letters; the vitriolic correspondence between Rousseau and Voltaire is well known.{{who|date=November 2015}} The great figures of the 18th century met and debated in the salons, cafés or [[Academy#Literary-philosophical academies|academies]]. These thinkers and {{lang|fr|savants}} formed an international community. Franklin, Jefferson, [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Ferdinando Galiani]] all spent many years in France.

Because they criticised the established order, the philosophers were chased by the authorities and had to resort to subterfuge to escape prison. François-Marie Arouet took on the pseudonym Voltaire. In 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote a report on behalf of the Virginia delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]], which was convened to discuss the grievances of [[Great Britain]]'s American colonies. Because its content, he could only publish it anonymously. Diderot's {{lang|fr|Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient}} ("[[Letter on the Blind|Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who can See]]")  landed him in prison at the [[Château de Vincennes]].&lt;!-- French says [[Fort de Vincennes]] which is the ''New'' fort in both FR and EN; this is not right, since it wasn't built then. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Gamarra|authorlink=Pierre Gamarra|language=fr|title=L"Histoire de la laïcité|place=Paris|publisher=IDLivre|date=2005|isbn=2747900576|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire was accused of writing pamphlets criticising [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (1674–1723), and imprisoned in the [[Bastille]]. in 1721, Montesquieu published {{lang|fr|Lettres persanes}} ("[[Persian Letters]]") anonymously in [[Holland]]. From 1728 to 1734, he went to many European countries.

Faced with [[censorship]] and in financial difficulty, the philosophers often resorted to the protection of aristocrats and patrons: [[Chrétien Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]], chief mistress of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], supported Diderot. [[Marie-Thérèse Rodet Geoffrin]] (1699&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1777) paid part of the publishing costs of the ''Encyclopédie''. From 1749 to 1777 she held a fortnightly {{lang|fr|salon}}, inviting artists, intellectuals, men of letters and philosophers. The other great ''salon'' of the time was that of [[Claudine Guérin de Tencin]]. In the 1720s, Voltaire exiled himself in England, where he absorbed Locke's ideas.

The philosophers were, in general, less hostile to monarchical rule than they were to that of the clergy and the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Jacques|last1=De Cock|authorlink=|title=Politique des Lumières|publisher=Fantasques|page=116|isbn=9782913846166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keTyGJQPpO4C&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his defence of [[Jean Calas]], Voltaire defended Royal justice against the excesses of fantastical provincial courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gérard|last=Lahouati|chapter=Voltaire, la Henriade et l’histoire|language=fr|title=Voltaire|volume=2|place=Université de Pau et des Pays de lAdour|publisher=Presses Paris Sorbonne|year=2002|isbn=9782840502555|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European monarchs – [[Charles III of Spain]], [[Maria Theresa]] of the House of Habsburg, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Catherine II of Russia]], [[Gustave III of Sweden]] – met with philosophers such as Voltaire, who was presented to the Court of [[Frederick the Great]], and Diderot, who was presented to the Court of [[Catherine the Great]]. Philosophers such as d'Holbach were advocates of "[[enlightened absolutism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=D'Holbach, qui a étudié à Leyde, est beaucoup plus au courant que Voltaire du développement des sciences … tout en prônant lui aussi le despotisme éclairé|first=Jacques J.|last=Natanson|title=La Mort de Dieu : essai sur l’athéisme moderne|language=fr|trans-title=The Death of God: On Modern Atheism|place=Paris|publisher=Presses universitaires de France|date=1975|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that their ideas would spread more quickly if they had the approval of the Head of State.

=== Dissemination ===
The spread of literacy and reading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Roche|title=Le Peuple de Paris : essai sur la culture populaire au XVIIIeme siecle|language=fr|trans-title=The people of Paris: On 18th-century popular culture|place=Paris|publisher=Librairie Arthème Fayard|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean|last=de Viguerie|title=Une Forme nouvelle de vie consacrée : enseignantes et hospitalières en France aux XVIIeme-XVIIIeme siecles|chapter=Femmes et pouvoirs sous l’ancien régime|language=fr|editor1-first=Danielle Haase|editor1-last=Dubosc|editor2-first=Éliane|editor2-last=Viennot|place=Paris|publisher=Rivages|year=1991|pages=175–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the development of what may be called an {{lang|fr|espace public}}, "public space"; intellectual and political debate was no longer confined to the inner circle of the administrative class and the élite, encompassing larger parts of society. This process of dissemination of new ideas was increased by new methods of communication. Parts of the ''Encyclopédie'', were read by the nobility and the upper class in [[literary salon]]s, with those present giving their opinions on the writings of philosophers. Newspapers and the postal service allowed a more rapid exchange of ideas throughout Europe, resulting in a new form of cultural unity.

==== Encylopédistes ====
[[File:Jean d'Alembert.jpeg|thumb|150px|Jean le Rond d’Alembert (1753) by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]]]]
A second important change by the Lumières movement, looking back to the previous century, had its origin in France with the ''[[Encyclopédistes]]''. This intellectual movement supported the idea that there was a structural model of both scientific and moral knowledge, that this model was innate and that its expression was a form of human liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Domenech|title=L'éthique des Lumières|publisher=Vrin|year=1989|isbn=9782711609987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting 1751, [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] published the {{lang|fr|[[Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]}} ("Systematic Encyclopaedia or Dictionary of Science, Arts and Crafts"). This raised questions on who should have the [[liberty]] to get hold of such information; the Press played an important role in the dissemination of ideas during the [[French Revolution]].

==== Salons and cafés ====
{{main article|Salon (gathering)|Literary café}}
[[File:Salon de Madame Geoffrin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Une soirée chez Madame Geoffrin'' (1812) by [[Anicet Charles Gabriel Lemonnier]]]]
At first, literary cafés such as the [[Café Procope]] in Paris, were the favoured night-time haunt of young poets and critics, who could read and debate, and bragg about their latest success in the theatre or bookshops. But these were eclipsed by {{lang|fr|salons littéraires}} ([[Literary café]]s), open to all who had some talent, at least for public speaking. Their defining characteristic was their intellectual mix; men would gather to express their views and satisfy their thirst for knowledge and to establish their world-view. But it was necessary to be "introduced" into these salons: {{lang|fr|grandes dames}} received artists, thinkers and philosophers. Each hostess had her day, her speciality and her special guests. The model example is the hotel of [[Madame de Lambert]] (Anne-Thérèse de Marguenat de Courcelles) at the turn of the century.

Talented men regularly decamped there to expound their ideas and test their latest work on a privileged public. Worldly and cultured, the ''grandes dames'' who set up these salons enlivened the ''soirées'', encouraging the timid and cutting short arguments. Having strong, relatively liberated personalities, they were often writers and diarists themselves.

This social mixing was particularly prominent in 18th-century France, in the "{{lang|fr|États Généraux de l’esprit humain}}" ("General States of Human Spirit") where the Lumières philosophy flourished. Some cultured women were treated as equal to the men on questions of religion, politics and science, and could bring a certain stylishness to debate, for example the contributions of [[Anne Dacier]] to the [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]], and the works of [[Émilie du Châtelet]].

==== Academies, libraries and clubs ====
{{main article|Academy|Masonic lodge}}
[[Image:Image-Jean-Honoré Fragonard 018.jpg|thumb|150px|''La Lecture'' ([[Circa|c.]] 1770) by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]
The {{lang|fr|Académies}} were [[learned society|learned societies]] which were formed to collate and disseminate works of literature and science. In France, several Royal institutions were set up in the 17th century (the [[Académie française]] in 1634; the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]] in 1663; the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie royale des sciences]] in 1666; the [[Académie royale d'architecture]] in 1671),; other societies were set up in Paris, such as the [[Académie nationale de médecine]] in 1731 and the [[Académie nationale de médecine]] in 1776. Clergy and, to a lesser extent, nobility formed the majority of the membership.

Provincial societies acted to bond together the intellectual élite of French towns. Their social composition shows that privileged men were less prominent than in Paris: 37% from the nobility, 20% from the Church. Commoners represented the other 43%. Merchants and manufacturers were a small minority (4%).

Neighbouring academies, public libraries and lecture halls flourished, often involving the same enthusiastic men of learning. They were often supported by individual rich men, or funded by public subscription. They collected scientific works, the great dictionaries, had a lecture hall and, nearby, a discussion room.

All learned societies functioned as open ''salons'' and formed provincial, national and Europe-wide networks, exchanging books and letters, welcoming visiting members, and launching research and teaching programmes in subjects such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], [[agronomy]], and [[demography]].

In the British [[Thirteen Colonies]] of North America, [[James Bowdoin]] (1726–1790), [[John Adams]] (1735–1826) and [[John Hancock]] (1737–1793) founded the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Boston]] during the [[American War of Independence]]. In 1743, [[Benjamin Franklin]] founded the [[American Philosophical Society]]. At the start of the 19th century, Thomas Jefferson had one of the largest private libraries in the country.

Of all the learned societies, the most advanced was that of the [[Freemasons]], although restricted to the upper classes. Having its origin in [[Great Britain]], [[freemasonry]] embraced all the characteristics of the Lumières: God-fearing, tolerant, liberal, humanist, aesthetic. It took Europe by storm, where it had thousands of lodged by 1789. In civil, military and even religious walks of life, it did particularly well in becoming part of the State apparatus. Neither anticlerical (which they became in the 19th century) nor revolutionary, [[masonic lodge]]s helped to expand on philosophical ideas and the spirit of reform in their political strategies. Intellectual discussion took on an esoteric, or sectarian, nature. Masonic lodges, even more than the Academies, emphasised the importance of equality according to ability rather than privilege by birth.

==== Hawkers and printers ====
The spread of ideas of the Lumières relied just as heavily on the actions of travelling traders. As they moved from town to town, they took their ideas and news with them, and could spread it by word of mouth to the [[illiterate]].

The Press had helped to spread philosophical tracts (notably Diderot and d'Álembert's ''Encyclopédie''), and encouraged the habit of reflective thought in the populace. In the end, the Press helped form public opinion, in spite of the ever-present censorship. Periodicals included the ''[[Journal des savants]]'', also known as the ''Journal des Sçavans'', the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', and economic periodicals such as the  ''[[Éphémérides du citoyen]]'' under [[Nicolas Baudeau]] of the ''[[Économistes]]'' party and [[François Quesnay]] of the ''[[Physiocrates]]''. By cataloguing books and with subscriptions to learned societies, a public far from the centre of political activity could keep up with new ideas, discoveries and debates every month, if not every day.

=== Political influence ===
By the end of the 17th century, John Locke had defined the [[separation of powers]] of government as between the [[executive branch]] and [[legislative branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|langue=|first1=Adhémar|last1=Esmein|author1link=|title=Éléments de droit constitutionnel français et comparé|chapter=|publisher=Sirey|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1921|volume=|page=458|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QABAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA458#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748) [[Montesquieu]] resurrected the idea of the separation of powers and extended it to include a third power, the [[judicial branch]].

In the 1750s attempts were made in England, Austria,  Prussia and France to "rationalise" their monarchs and their laws.

The "enlightened"' ({{lang-fr|lumineuse}}) idea of a "rational" (or "systematic"; {{lang-fr|rationnel}}) government was cast into the [[American Declaration of Independence]] and, to a lesser extent, in the manifesto of [[Jacobinism]] during the French Revolution. It propagated to the [[United States Constitution]] of 1787.

==== American Revolution ====
[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|200px|''Thomas Jefferson'' (1791) by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]
[[Thomas Jefferson]], a cultured and learned man and one of the original planters of the [[State of Virginia]], was well known to the English philosopher John Locke, and the Genevan Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He presided over the drafting of the [[Constitution of Virginia]] in 1776, from which he took certain parts when drafting the [[American Declaration of Independence]], proclaimed on 4 July 1776 at the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. In the summer of 1784, he travelled to Europe to take over the duties of [[Benjamin Franklin]] as Ambassador of the United States to France, and during this time he met many of the Lumières, becoming a frequent visitor to literary salons and bookshops in Paris.

The influence of the Lumières'philosophy is apparent in the Declaration of Independence, with the proclamations that all men are created equal and its opposition to [[tyranny]]. The 1787 [[United States Constitution]] restates Montesquieu's principle of the [[separation of powers]]  into [[legislative branch|legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]] and [[judicial branch|judicial]] branches, which together form the foundations of modern democracy.

==== French Revolution ====
As the philosophy took hold in the salons, the cafés and the clubs,  the [[absolute rule]] of the monarch disintegrated, in part because of opposition by the [[French nobility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Mornet|language=fr|title=Les Origines intellectuelles de la Révolution française (1715–1787)|place=Paris|publisher=Armand Colin|year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; who saw no future for themselves in reform.

During the [[French Revolution]], philosophical ideas informed political debate. The majority of deputies to the National Assembly were from the cultured [[bourgeois]] class, who aspired to ideas of liberty and equality. For example, [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] was an enthusiastic follower of Rousseau. But most of the French philosophers died before seeing their seedlings planted during the Revolution bear fruit, with the exception of [[Nicolas de Condorcet]], [[Louis Sébastien Mercier]] and [[Abbé Raynal]]. The first two of these three [[Girondist]]s fell out of favour; only the third came out with honour, even, after his death in 1796, having a bust made in honour of his essays on the abolition of black [[slavery]], on 4 February 1794 (in the Gregorian calendar; 16 pluviôse of year II in the [[French Republican Calendar]]). He was also the uncle of a {{lang|fr|conventionnel régicide}}, [[Simon Camboulas]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

The French Revolution in particular represents a violent application of the Lumières' philosophy, especially during the [[Reign of Terror]], the [[interregnum]] of the [[Jacobin]]s. Descartes characterised the desire for a "rational" and "spiritual" revolution as one that aimed to eradicate the Church, and Christianity, entirely.

The [[National Convention (France)|National Convention]] revoked the [[French Republican Calendar]], the system of measurement of time, and the system of [[currency]], while making the goal of equality, both social and economic, the highest priority of the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|first1=Prosper|last1=Poullet|author1link=Prosper Poullet|title=Les institutions françaises de 1795 à 1814|chapter=|publisher=Plon-Nourrit|place=Paris|day=|month=|year=1907|volume=|page=223|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgrAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, between 1919 and 1920, Baker served with the [[American Friends Service Committee]] in [[France]], where she ran an Embroidery Depot for refugees at [[Verdun]] and [[Clermont-en-Argonne]], in northeast France near the Belgian border.  In August, 1920, she returned to Philadelphia with E. Constance Allen, of Dublin, Ireland.

==Major illustrations and travel==
{{Quote frame |quote=Before color photography was widely available, archaeologists brought illustrators to the excavation sites to document the paint schemes on vessels, shards, architectural ornaments and murals.

M. Louise Baker undertook her first work for the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] in 1908 on the Museum's Nubian pottery collection.  This work was at the request of [[David Randall-MacIver]], who was then the director of the Museum’s Nubian expedition.  She earned $80 a month.&lt;ref name="Danien 2017" /&gt;  These illustrations were subsequently published in [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[David Randall-MacIver| David Randall-MacIver's]] reports on ''Karanôg: the Romano-Nubian cemetery'' (1910) and ''Buhen'' (1911).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Woolley |first1= Leonard C. |last2= Randall-MacIver |first2= David|date= 1919|title= Karanòg: Plates. |url= |location= Philadelphia |publisher= University Museum |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Woolley |first1= Leonard C. |last2= Randall-MacIver |first2= David |date= 1911 |title= Karanòg: the Romano-Nubian cemetry : Plates. |url= https://archive.org/details/karanogromanonub00wool_0|location= Philadelphia |publisher= University Museum |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Baker's work at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] attracted wider notice, leading many "other ... archaeologists, who had only seen examples of her published work, [to] request... her participation in future efforts."&lt;ref name="Price 2010" /&gt;  Baker worked in  pen and ink, charcoal and watercolor.

===Mayan ceramics===
In 1931, M. Louise Baker traveled to New Orleans, where she painted Maya material at [[Tulane University | Tulane University’s]] [[Middle American Research Institute]].  Next she traveled to [[Mérida, Yucatán]], in [[Mexico]], and painted and drew Maya pottery in the State Museum and private collections.  Next she traveled to Guatemala City, Guatemala, to make ink and watercolor illustrations of pots from the Carnegie Institution of Washington expedition to Uaxactun and from Cobán, held in the private collection of Erwin Paul Dieseldorff.  Her paintings and illustrations of Maya pottery were subsequently published by the University of Pennsylvania Museum between 1925 and 1943 in several volumes of ''Examples of Maya Pottery in the Museum and Other Collections'';&lt;ref name="Danien 2017" /&gt;  several others appeared in the second volume of E.P.

In 1932, Baker traveled to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], England, and then on to [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], to paint materials held there from the Joint Expedition of the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology| Penn Museum]] and [[British Museum]]to [[Mesopotamia]].  [[Leonard Woolley]] served as the excavation director for the Expedition, which uncovered the [[Ur| Royal Tombs of Ur]].  

During her return from Iraq, Baker visited museums and private collections in Germany, Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and England to add to her illustrations of Maya ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Dosker |first1= Caroline G. |date=1985| title= Mary Louise Baker and the Maya, From the Archives |url= https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/mary-louise-baker-and-the-maya/ |journal=  Expedition Magazine |volume= 27 |issue= 3|pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
M. Louise Baker left the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology| Penn Museum]] in 1936 when, owing to her failing eyesight, she had difficultly producing illustrations.  She retired from the George School two years later, in 1939, together with E. Constance Allen, who was dean there from 1925 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.georgeschool.org/about-george-school/our-history/history-timeline/george-school-in-1935-1939/|title= George School in 1935-1939 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 2017 |website= georgeschool.org|publisher= George School|access-date= June 6, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baker and Allen purchased a home together in [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]].  For the next ten years, Baker taught classes on writing and illustration, carpentry, furniture making, metal working, and ceramics.  She also gave talks on local and Quaker history and her archaeological adventures, acted in amateur theater productions in Chester County, and led tours to European museums.&lt;ref name="Danien 2017" /&gt;   

Baker suffered eye problems ranging from cataracts to glaucoma throughout her life. Doctors hit upon the idea of applying leeches to her temples to alleviate her symptoms.&lt;ref name=Crimmins /&gt;

{{Quote frame |quote= "The huge leeches were ravenous when released from the box, and quickly fastened themselves to my temples by triangular incisions," she wrote. "In my most successful nightmares, I recall these leeches."  |author=M. Louise Baker |source= quoted in Crimmins, 2017&lt;ref name=Crimmins /&gt;}}  &lt;!--this also gives me nightmares--&gt;

She was completely blind by 1949.  Baker and E. Constance Allen spent their final years together at The Hickman, a Quaker retirement home in West Chester, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Danien 2017" /&gt;  M. Louise Baker died in her ninetieth year on July 15th, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= August 15, 1962 |title= Deaths |url= https://www.friendsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/emember/downloads/1962/HC12-50292.pdf |journal= Friends Journal|volume=8 |issue=16 |pages= 359|doi= |access-date= June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3399">'''Makarios Melissenos''' ({{lang-el|Μακάριος Μελισσηνός}}), born '''Makarios Melissourgos''' (Μακάριος Μελισσουργός), was a [[Greeks|Greek]] scholar and [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Monemvasia]]. He died in 1585.

==Life==
Born Makarios Melissourgos in the [[Morea]] to a wealthy landowning family, Makarios was [[metropolitan bishop]] of [[Monemvasia]]. In 1571, he was forced to flee his homeland for [[Naples]] when he became involved in a plot for an uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Lepanto]].{{sfn|ODB|loc="Melissenos, Makarios" (E. M. Jeffreys, A. Kazhdan), pp. 1335–1336}}

At Naples, he changed his name to Melissenos, echoing the [[Melissenos|Byzantine aristocratic family]], and produced several works. Among them was a list of the bishops of Monemvasia, a history and description of the city, and a list of members of the Melissenos family.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Melissenos, Makarios" (E. M. Jeffreys, A. Kazhdan), pp. 1335–1336}} He also collaborated with [[Andreas Darmarios]] to produce the ''Chronicon Majus'' (1573–75), an expanded revision of [[George Sphrantzes]]' ''Chronicon Minus'' with additional material from [[George Akropolites]], [[Nikephoros Gregoras]], and other writers (whence he is also called '''Pseudo-Sphrantzes'''). Covering the period 1258 to 1477, it is an important historical source, particularly for his eyewitness account of the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, although doubts regarding the authenticity of his material remain.{{sfn|ODB|loc="Melissenos, Makarios" (E. M. Jeffreys, A.

'''Mark Griep''' (born 1959) is a chemistry professor at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. He has a bachelor’s and doctorate in biochemistry from the [[University of Minnesota]]. He studies the enzymes [[primase]] and [[DnaB helicase]] in his search for antibiotics that inhibit them. He is co-author with [[Marjorie Mikasen]] of the nonfiction book [[ReAction! Chemistry in the Movies|Re''Action!'' Chemistry in the Movies]].

==Biochemist==
Griep studies the proteins that synthesize DNA, namely [[primase]] and [[DnaB helicase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.unl.edu/faculty/eachfaculty/griep.shtml |title=University of Nebraska-Lincoln Department of Chemistry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102192516/http://www.chem.unl.edu/faculty/eachfaculty/griep.shtml |archivedate=2009-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these, most of his work concerns primase, the enzyme that initiates DNA synthesis during [[DNA replication]]. His goal is to discover the next generation of [[antibiotics]] by searching for inhibitors of bacterial primase.  To help him do this, he seeks to understand the structure and function of primase from many bacteria.

For his science outreach efforts, he studies the chemistry found in feature films and then communicates his findings to the other chemists and the public. In recognition of this work, he was awarded a Distinguished Teaching Award from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]].

==Author==
Griep is the coauthor with artist [[Marjorie Mikasen]] of the nonfiction book [[ReAction! Chemistry in the Movies|Re''Action!'' Chemistry in the Movies]] (2009 [[Oxford University Press]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Chemistry/?view=usa&amp;amp;ci=9780195326925 |title=Oxford University Press Site for Re''Action!''

He and Mikasen were awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellowship in the area of Public Understanding of Science to research and write the book. The appendix describes ways to use movies or movie clips in the chemistry classroom.

Griep also contributed 10 movie boxes to the chemistry textbook "The World of Chemistry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://higher.cengage.com.au/title/0495012130/977 |title="The World of Chemistry" 4th edition by Joesten, Castellion, and Hogg (2007) Thomson Brooks/Cole |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821093248/http://higher.cengage.com.au/title/0495012130/977 |archivedate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His innovative entries relate in-chapter chemistry concepts to eight contemporary and two classic films. Word problems are included in each movie box for possible student assignments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">'''Mbombo''', also called '''Bumba''', is the creator god in the religion and mythology of the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] people of Central Africa in the area that is now known as [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. In the Mbombo [[creation myth]], Mbombo was a giant in form and white in color.&lt;ref name="Budge 2003 page=364"&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|2003|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth describes the creation of the universe from nothing.
==Story==
The story of Mbombo's creation tells that in the beginning, Mbombo was alone, darkness and primordial water covered all the earth. It would happen that Mbombo came to feel an intense pain in his stomach, and then Mbombo vomited the sun, the moon, and stars. The heat and light from the sun [[evaporated]] the water covering the earth, creating clouds, and after time, the dry hills emerged from the water. Then Mbombo vomited once more, bringing forth nine animals: the leopard, called Koy Bumba; the eagle, Ponga Bumba; the crocodile, Ganda Bumba; the fish, Yo Bumba; the tortoise, Kono Bumba; a black leopard-like animal, Tsetse Bumba; a white heron, Nyanyi Bumba; a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]]; and a goat named Budi.  Mbombo also vomited many men, one of them was called Loko Yima and was white like Bumba.&lt;ref name="Budge 2003 page=364"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sproul 1979 page=44"&gt;{{harvnb|Sproul|1979|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These nine animals went on to create all the world's creatures. The heron created all flying birds but one, the [[kite (bird)|kite]], and the crocodile created snakes and the [[iguana]]. The goat, Budi, brought forth all the horned animals, the scarab all insects, and Yo Bumba, all fish.&lt;ref name="Sproul 1979 page=44"/&gt;

Three of Mbombo's sons then said they would finish creating the world.  The first to try, Nyonye Ngana, vomited white ants, but died after.&lt;ref name="Budge 2003 page=364"/&gt;  To honor him, the ants went deep in the earth for dark soil to bury him and transformed the barren sands at the earth's surface.  The second, Chonganda, created the first plant, which in turn gave rise to all trees, grasses and flowers. And Chedi Bumba, the third son, made the last bird, the kite.&lt;ref name="Sproul 1979 page=44"/&gt; 

Tsetse Bumba caused trouble on the earth so Mbombo chased her into the sky where she became the thunderbolt.  This left people without fire, so Mbombo showed them how to make it from trees.  Once the creation was complete and peaceful, Mbombo delivered it to mankind and retreated into the heavens, leaving Loko Yima to serve as "god upon the earth".&lt;ref name="Budge 2003 page=364"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sproul 1979 page=44"/&gt; The woman of the waters, Nchienge, lived in the East, and her son, [[Woto]], became the first king of the Kuba.&lt;ref name="bantu_myths"&gt;{{harvnb|Knappert|1977|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Yakovlevich Marr''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Я́ковлевич Марр}}, ''Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr''; {{lang-ka|ნიკოლოზ იაკობის ძე მარი}}, ''Nikoloz Iak'obis dze Mari''; {{OldStyleDateDY|6 January|1865|25 December 1864}} &amp;ndash; 20 December 1934) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]-born [[historian]] and linguist who gained a reputation as a scholar of the [[Caucasus]] during the 1910s before embarking on his [[Japhetic theory (linguistics)|"Japhetic theory"]] on the [[origin of language]] (from 1924), now considered as pseudo-scientific,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://russcience.chat.ru/papers/alp93sp.htm#_ftnref1 В.М.Алпатов "Марр, марризм и сталинизм"]&lt;/ref&gt; and related speculative linguistic hypotheses.

Marr's hypotheses were used as a rationale in the campaign during the 1920–30s in the [[Soviet Union]] of introduction of [[Latin alphabet]]s for smaller ethnicities of the country. In 1950, the "Japhetic theory" fell from official favour, with [[Joseph Stalin]] denouncing it as anti-Marxist.

==Biography==
[[Image:Marr mother 1870.jpg|frame|Marr with mother, 1870]]
Marr was born in [[Kutaisi]], Georgia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]), in the family of the [[Scot]] James Murray (phonetically adapted: Marr) (aged 71&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britishgeorgiansociety.org/events/11-past/206-nokolai-marr-a-talk-by-donald-rayfield-17-february|title=Nikolai Marr - a talk by Donald Rayfield 17 February|publisher=British Georgian Society|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who founded the [[botanical garden]] of the city, and a young [[Georgians|Georgian]] woman (Agrafina Magularia). His parents spoke different languages, and neither of them understood [[Russian language|Russian]]. Having graduated from the [[St Petersburg University]], he taught there beginning in 1891, becoming dean of the [[Oriental]] faculty in 1911 and member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1912. Between 1904 and 1917 he undertook yearly excavations at the ancient [[Armenia]]n capital of [[Ani (Armenia)|Ani]].&lt;ref name="marr"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn =978-2-914571-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Leningrad]].

==Japhetic theory==
{{Main|Japhetic theory}}
Marr earned a reputation as a maverick genius with his Japhetic theory, postulating the common origin of [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]], [[Afro-Asiatic|Semitic-Hamitic]], and [[Basque language|Basque]] languages. In 1924, he went even further and proclaimed that all the languages of the world descended from a single [[proto-language]] which had consisted of four "diffused exclamations": ''sal, ber, yon, rosh''. Although the languages undergo certain stages of development, his method of ''linguistic paleontology'' claims to make it possible to discern elements of primordial exclamations in any given language. One of his followers was [[Valerian Borisovich Aptekar]], and one of his opponents was [[Arnold Chikobava]].

'''Nora Josefina Astorga Gadea de Jenkins''' (10 December 1948 &amp;ndash; 14 February 1988) was a [[Nicaraguan]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter in the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]], a lawyer, politician, judge and the [[Nicaragua]]n ambassador to the [[United Nations]] from 1986 to 1988.

==Early life and education==
Astorga was born to a religious, upper-middle-class family in [[Managua]]. She was the first child of Segundo Astorga, a lumber exporter and rancher with connections to the powerful ruling [[Somoza]] familyand his wife, Mierrel Gadea.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | first=Wolfgang | last=Saxon | title= Nora Astorga, a Sandinista Hero and Delegate to U.N., Dies at 39 | date= 1988-02-15 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DF1F31F936A25751C0A96E948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her youth she was a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often doing charitable work in the poor neighborhoods of Managua.

In 1967, Astorga announced to her family's dismay that she supported [[Fernando Agüero]], not his opponent [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], in the presidential election. For her personal safety and to "straighten her out," her family sent her to study medicine in the [[United States]], where she remained from 1967 to 1969. However, the animal dissections disturbed her and she had to abandon her studies. She said of the years she spent in [[Washington, D.C.]], "What impressed me most about the [[United States]] were the social contrasts and above all the [[racism]]. I had never seen racism like that in Nicaragua ... [m]y political consciousness was born then."&lt;ref name="RE"&gt;{{cite news | title=Nora Astorga In Her Own Words | date=April 1988 | publisher=Central American University (UCA) | url =http://www.envio.org.ni/articulo/3134 | work =Envío | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astorga married Jorge Jenkins when she was 22. Astorga had four children, two with her husband, two with Jose Maria Alvarado, a member of the Sandinistas.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==A revolutionary==
{{quote box |width=15em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right  | quote="...Revolutions are not exportable like Coca-Cola or paperbacks or something like that... You don't produce it internally and send it away. Revolutions are made in a country when the conditions in that particular country are for a process of change." |source= Nora Astorga&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;}}

Astorga later returned to Nicaragua and studied law at the [[Universidad Centroamericana]] in Managua. Her association with Nicaragua's [[Sandinista]] revolutionaries began during her years as a university student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houghton Mifflin Company |title=The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography |year=2003 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location= |isbn=0-618-25210-X |page= 76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1969 to 1973, she was responsible for finding safe houses and transportation for the revolutionary leader Oscar Turcios.

At age 22, she married Jorge Jenkins, a student activist. The young couple spent the following year in [[Italy]], where he studied [[anthropology]], and she studied [[banking law]] and [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; They had two children and separated after five years of marriage. During this time, Astorga led a double life as a mother of two and a [[corporate lawyer]] for one of Nicaragua's largest construction companies, while [[clandestine operation|clandestinely]] aiding the Sandinistas.

After the assassination of newspaper editor [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal|Pedro Chamorro]] in 1978, Astorga decided to take up arms against the Somoza regime. "I finally understood that armed struggle was the only solution, that a rifle cannot be met with a flower, that we were in the streets, but if that force didn't get organized we wouldn't achieve much", she said. "For me, it was the moment of conviction: either I took up arms and made a total commitment or I wasn't going to change anything."&lt;ref name="RE"/&gt;

She gained national attention for her participation in the botched kidnapping and murder of General Reynaldo Pérez Vega (nicknamed "El Perro," or "the dog"). Pérez Vega was deputy commander of Anastasio Somoza’s [[Guardia Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Nora and the Dog | date=1984-04-02 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954189-1,00.html | work =TIME | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 1978, Astorga invited the general to her apartment in [[Managua]], hinting to him that the sexual favors he had long sought would be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mahan, Sue |author2=Griset, Pamala L. |title=Terrorism in perspective |publisher=Sage Publications |year=2003|isbn=0-7619-2404-3 |page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived, however, three members of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) &amp;mdash; Hilario Sánchez, Raúl Venerio and Walter Ferreti &amp;mdash; burst out of her bedroom closet and seized the general. The plan was to [[ransom]] him for jailed Sandinista revolutionaries, but Pérez Vega put up a struggle and was murdered. Later, with his throat slit, he was found wrapped in a Sandinista flag. Astorga said of his murder, "It was not murder. He was too much of a monster."&lt;ref&gt;Sciolino, Elaine (September 28, 1986) "Nicaragua's U.N. Voice." New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview shortly before her death, she described her feelings about her role in the Pérez Vega murder this way:

{{Quotation|...Sometimes people ask me why I don't have any guilty feelings in regard to "the dog." They want to know how I could do something so fierce without feeling guilty. I believe I don't feel guilty for three reasons. First, we were supposed to kidnap him, not kill him. Second, I wasn't there at the moment of his death. And third, he represented repression. He was practically Somoza's second in command, the one who conducted all those murderous operations in the north, the one who massacred so many in [[Masaya]]. He really was a monster. I understood his death as part of the liberation struggle...|Nora Astorga&lt;ref name="RE"/&gt;}}

She became the subject of a national manhunt and next appeared to the Nicaraguan public on the pages of ''La Prensa'', the nation's opposition newspaper. She was wearing jungle fatigues and carrying an [[AK-47|AK-47 assault rifle]]. Astorga had escaped to the jungle and joined the Sandinista revolutionaries. There, she became pregnant with her third child by José María Alvarado, a leading Sandinista.

==Justice Minister and UN Representative==
After the Sandinistas took power in July 1979, Astorga was appointed Vice Minister of Justice. In that position she oversaw the trials of some 7,500 members of Somoza's National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Randall |first= Margaret|title= Todas estamos despiertas: Testimonios de la mujer Nicaragüense de hoy |url= |publisher= |language= Spanish |isbn= 968-23-1011-3 |chapter= 5 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5cOH6jbq9w4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA167&amp;lpg=RA1-PA167&amp;dq=nora+astorga+7500&amp;source=web&amp;ots=07OiBXZVkq&amp;sig=YJ8gt7TNOhIU6grMwpZaFlEyAKU|quote= Nora Astorga -Militante Sandinista, abogada, madre de tres niños -es la fisical especial de justicia encargada de enjuciar a los más de 7500 somocistas que se enfrentan a la justicia popular. |page= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, her appointment as ambassador to the United States was refused by the [[Reagan administration]] because of her involvement in the killing of General Reynaldo Pérez Vega. Vega had been a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 800 Attend Mass for Nicaraguan | date= 1988-02-24| publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7DA173EF937A15751C0A96E948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-16 | quote = In 1984, the United States refused to accept Miss Astorga as Nicaragua's Ambassador to Washington, citing her role during the Sandinista revolution in luring a Nicaraguan general who had worked with the Central Intelligence Agency to her bedroom, where he was killed by assailants who had hid there. She later maintained that the operation was an attempted kidnapping that went wrong when a struggle developed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astorga became a deputy representative to the [[United Nations]] in 1984, and in March 1986, became the Nicaraguan ambassador to that body, a position she held until her death in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Nora Astorga| date =| publisher =MADRE.org| url =http://www.madre.org/about/noraastorga.html| work =| pages =| accessdate =2007-10-16| language =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20070803141116/http://www.madre.org/about/noraastorga.html| archivedate =2007-08-03| df =}} &lt;/ref&gt; She was instrumental in getting the United Nations to recognize a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]], ''[[Nicaragua v. United States]]'', that declared the United States' support for the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]] illegal.

==Death==
On February 14, 1988, "La Norita" died of [[cervical cancer]] in [[Managua]], aged 39. She was awarded the title "Hero of the Fatherland and Revolution" and the Order of [[Carlos Fonseca]] on  July 1987, which was the highest order of Nicaragua at the time.&lt;ref name="RE"/&gt;

She appears as one of the twelve apostles in the mural of the Visitación at Casa Ave Maria in Managua. A [[barrio]], or neighborhood, in Managua was named for her.

The 1986 song "Mariel" by the [[KBC Band]] was inspired by Nora Astorga.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeffersonstarshipsf.com/ndiary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; KBC members Jack Casady and Paul Kantner played this song at her memorial service.

"'''Only a God Can Save Us'''" ({{lang-de|Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten}}) refers to an interview given by [[Martin Heidegger]] to [[Rudolf Augstein]] and [[:de:Georg Wolff (Journalist)|Georg Wolff]] for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine on September 23, 1966. Heidegger agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously. It was published five days after his death, on 31 May 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Rudolf|last1=Augstein|first2=Georg|last2=Wolff|first3=Martin|last3=Heidegger|title=''Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten''|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41238349.html|journal=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=31 May 1976|pages=193–219|accessdate=2013-06-14}} [http://www.ditext.com/heidegger/interview.html English translation] by [[William J. Richardson]] in {{cite book|title=Heidegger. The Man and the Thinker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC|editor-first=Thomas|editor-last= Sheehan|year=1981|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|location=[[Piscataway, New Jersey]]|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qIrWZajVZuwC&amp;pg=PA45 45–67]|id={{ISBN|1-41281537-1}}|isbn=978-1-412-81537-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is translated by [[William J. Richardson]] into English.

==Summary==
In the interview, Heidegger defended his entanglement with [[National Socialism]] in two ways: first, he argued that there was no alternative, saying that he was trying to save the university (and science in general) from being politicized and thus had to compromise with the Nazi administration. Second, he admitted that he saw an "awakening" (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a "new national and social approach," but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]].

In his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the "inner truth and greatness of this movement." He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by "movement" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthesis that he did not read out yet claimed in the interview was present from the beginning (and included in his ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953)), namely, "the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity."

The Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies.&lt;ref&gt;For critical readings of the interview (published in 1976 as "Only a God Can Save Us," ''Der Spiegel''), see the "Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]]. The issue includes partial translations of Derrida's ''Of Spirit'' and Lacoue-Labarthe's ''Of Spirit'' and ''Heidegger, Art, and Politics: the Fiction of the Political''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, some politicians and activists in the [[Anglophone]] world, including U.S. Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]], as well as U.K. Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], have described [[Islam]] as a '''religion of peace''' in an effort to distance it from [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[Islamism]].

== Usage of the term ==
In the past the epithet "religion of peace and good will towards men" has been applied to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''Defensive War not Inconsistent with a Religion of Peace'', a sermon, Seeley, Jackson, &amp; Halliday, 1860, [https://books.google.com/books?id=al1u2i6q5aQC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11] Quote: "While however it is manifest and unquestionable that Christianity is emphatically a religion of peace and good will towards men &amp;mdash; men of all countries and of all climes  &amp;mdash; it is assuredly not a religion of absolute and passive non-resistance."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Malcolm X]], acting as a spokesman for the [[Nation of Islam]], said on multiple occasions that Islam was a "religion of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nessen|first1=Stephen|title=Remembering Malcolm X: Rare Interviews and Audio|url=https://www.wnyc.org/story/87636-remembering-malcolm-x-rare-interviews-and-audio/|website=WNYC - New York Public Radio|publisher=WNYC - New York Public Radio|accessdate=1 April 2018|quote=The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us the religion of Islam, which is a religion of peace.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malcolm X: Speech excerpt from Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite AV media | year=1962 | title=Malcolm X: Speech excerpt from Los Angeles | medium=speech | publisher=Educational Video Group | url=https://search.alexanderstreet.com/view/2787248 | quote=They also say that, uh, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was a draft dodger. No he wasn't. He just refused to go to the army because he was a man of peace. He was a minister of a religion of peace. He was teaching peace, so he outright refused to go to the army. | accessdate=1 April 2018 | subscription=yes | via=[[Alexander Street]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Muhammad Ali]] used similar phrasing to indicate the relationship between Islam and peace in his justification for why he had joined the [[Nation of Islam]], saying, "You call it Black Muslims, I don't. The real name is Islam. That means peace,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/25/specials/ali-islam.html|title=Clay Says He Has Adopted Islam Religion and Regards It as Way to Peace|publisher=New York Times|date=February 28, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "I believe in Allah and in peace"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gass|first1=Henry|title=The religious journey of Muhammad Ali, 'ambassador' of Islam|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2016/0610/The-religious-journey-of-Muhammad-Ali-ambassador-of-Islam|website=www.csmonitor.com|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=1 April 2018|date=10 June 2016|quote=As he adopted a more mainstream interpretation of Islam, he maintained his overriding principle that it was a religion of peace.  "I believe in Allah and in peace," he said after announcing his conversion in 1964.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of The Islamic Conference]] agreed to call for "pragmatic and constructive steps to counter the negative propaganda against Islam; to remove and rectify misunderstandings; and to present the true image of Islam: the religion of peace and tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/477/islamism-grows-stronger-at-the-united-nations|title=Islamism Grows Stronger at the United Nations|last=Littman|first=David|publisher=The Middle East Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] said: "The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam.  That's not what Islam is all about.  Islam is peace.  These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war."&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/27669652/merskin_the_construction.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1514452963&amp;Signature=rSiQXAH2iIoRvEEzqkdlNYMIwjw%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_construction_of_Arabs_as_enemies_Pos.pdf Merskin, Debra.

[[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], the former Prime Minister of [[Malaysia]] said in 2002, "Islam, as I said, is a religion of peace. However through the centuries, deviations from the true teachings of Islam take place. And so [people who call themselves] "Muslims" kill despite the injunction of their religion against killing especially of innocent people.&lt;ref name=MALAY&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiasociety.org/islam-terrorism-and-malaysias-response?page=0,1 |title=Islam, Terrorism, and Malaysia's Response (page 2) |website=Asia Society |date=4 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dalil Boubakeur]], ''[[mufti]]'' of the [[Paris Mosque]], said in 2006, "[[Muhammed|The prophet]] did not found a terrorist religion, but a religion of peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prophet cartoons enraging Muslims |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=2 February 2006 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/02/news/toon.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204165912/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/02/news/toon.php |archive-date=4 February 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], US President [[Barack Obama]] used the term, as part of his efforts to counter a perceived anti-Muslim bias, in an address following the attack,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/us/us-muslims-begin-to-publicly-confront-questions-on-islam-and-violence.html?mcubz=0 U.S. Muslims Reach Out to Address Questions on Islam and Violence], New York Times, Laurie Goodstein, 22 Dec 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in his first visit to a US mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/us/politics/obama-muslims-baltimore-mosque.html?mcubz=0 Obama, in Mosque Visit, Denounces Anti-Muslim Bias], New York Times, Gardiner Harris, 3 Feb 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 18th, 2016, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] called Islam a religion of peace and called terrorism a dividing force, lauding the peaceful message of [[Sufism]], at World Sufi Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At Sufi meet, Modi lauds Islam as a religion of peace|URL=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-narendra-modi-at-world-sufi-forum/article8366628.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
[[File:2012 Sydney protest.jpg|thumb|Muslim protesters carry signs reading "[[Decapitation|Behead]] all those who insult the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]" and "Our dead are in Paradise. Your dead are in HELL!"]]
[[Sherman Jackson]] says that the expression does not imply a rejection of [[Jihad|the laws of Jihad]], but rather the idea that [[Islam]] desires a "a state of permanent, peaceful coexistence with other nations and peoples who are not Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Jackson | first = Sherman | title =Jihad and the Modern World | date = December 2001 | url =http://www.lamppostproductions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/JIHAD_MOD_WLD.pdf | accessdate = 2017-09-10 |quote="... Religion of peace" connotes, rather, that Islam can countenance a state of permanent, peaceful coexistence with other nations and peoples who are not Muslims. In other words, contrary to the belief that Islam can only accept a world that is entirely populated by Muslims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "The Religion of Peace" is used mockingly by [[Criticism of Islam|critics of Islam]], such as right-wing commentator [[Ann Coulter]].&lt;ref name=counterp&gt;{{cite web |last=Siddiqi |first=Imraan |title =Ann Coulter's Foul Mouth: The Blond Hate Machine |publisher=Counterpunch |date=5 June 2003 |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/siddiqi06052003.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030613090741/http://counterpunch.org/siddiqi06052003.html |archive-date=13 June 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-22 |quote=Ann on the other hand, apparently missed this Sunday school lesson, and continues to ridicule Islam sarcastically as the "religion of peace" whenever a negative story arises within the Muslim world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] writer [[Sam Harris]] wrote, "The position of the Muslim community in the face of all provocations seems to be: Islam is a religion of peace, and if you say that it isn't, we will kill you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/losing-our-spines-to-save_b_100132.html |first=Sam |last=Harris |title=Losing Our Spines to Save Our Necks |website=Huffingtonpost.com |access-date=19 March 2011 |date=5 May 2008}} (updated 25 May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by reporters in 2005 if Islam was a religion of peace, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated that some elements of Islam can favor peace, but it also has other elements. 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news 
| title = Pope says terror attacks cannot be defined as anti-Christian

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamist]] [[Sayyid Qutb]] wrote that Islam is the religion of peace in the sense of submitting all of mankind to [[Allah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Qutb | first =Sayyid| authorlink =Sayyid Qutb | title = Fiqh al-Da'wah | work =Fiqh al-Da'wah | publisher = [[IslamQA]]| url =http://www.islamqa.com/index.php?ref=43087&amp;ln=eng| pages =217–222 | accessdate = 2007-11-22 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017053855/http://www.islamqa.com/index.php?ref=43087&amp;ln=eng | archivedate = 2006-10-17|quote=The defeatists should fear Allah lest they distort this religion and cause it to become weak on the basis of the claim that it is a religion of peace. Yes, it is the religion of peace but in the sense of saving all of mankind from worshiping anything other than Allah and submitting all of mankind to the rule of Allah. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2015, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released an audio message by [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], who asserted that Islam is not a religion of peace, but rather the religion of fighting.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =ISIS Caliph Baghdadi in New Audio Message: 'Islam Was Never a Religion of Peace,' Our Jihad Is 'The War of All Muslims' | work=The Christian Post | date =2015-05-15 | url =http://www.christianpost.com/news/isis-caliph-baghdadi-in-new-audio-message-islam-was-never-a-religion-of-peace-our-jihad-is-the-war-of-all-muslims-139166/ | accessdate =  2015-05-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150517001734/http://www.christianpost.com/news/isis-caliph-baghdadi-in-new-audio-message-islam-was-never-a-religion-of-peace-our-jihad-is-the-war-of-all-muslims-139166/ |archivedate = 2015-05-17|quote=Islam was never a religion of peace.

It is the war of Muslims against infidels. O Muslims, go to war everywhere. It is the duty of every Muslim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2017 Barcelona attacks]], the cover of ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' ran with an image of a van driving away from bloodied victims with the caption "Islam, religion of peace... Eternal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/islam-religione-pace-charlie-sfida-i-musulmani-1433273.html "Islam religione di pace" Charlie sfida i musulmani], Il Giornale, 23 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/sociedad/charlie-hebdo-dedica-portada-atentado-ramblas-barcelona.html 'Charlie Hebdo' dedica su portada al atentado de Las Ramblas de Barcelona], Publico, 23 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/barcelona-attack-charlie-hebdo-publishes-controversial-front-cover-about-islam-653959 BARCELONA ATTACK: CHARLIE HEBDO PUBLISHES CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-ISLAM COVER ART], Newsweek, Jack Moore, 23 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''7th World Congress of the Communist International (Comintern)''' was a multinational conference held in [[Moscow]] from July 25 through August 20, 1935 by delegated representatives of ruling and non-ruling [[communist party|communist parties]] from around the world and invited guests representing other political and [[organized labor]] organizations. The gathering was attended by 513 delegates, of whom 371 were accorded full voting rights, representing 65 Comintern member parties as well as 19 sympathizing parties.

The gathering is best remembered for its endorsement of a [[Popular Front]] of [[Communism|communist]] and non-communist forces against the growing menace of [[fascism]] in Europe, paving the way for advocacy of [[collective security]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and the various capitalist states of Europe. This marked a dramatic reversal of the [[Communist International|Comintern's]] previous orientation towards [[Class conflict|class warfare]] endorsed by the [[Sixth World Congress of the Comintern|6th World Congress]] of 1928, the aggressive line of the so-called "[[Third Period]]."

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Popular Front tactic is closely associated with the initiative of one of its early adherents, Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov (1882-1949).]]

Throughout the early 1930s the Soviet Union's [[People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs]], headed by [[Maxim Litvinov]], had pursued a policy of attempting to win a broad international agreement to bring about military disarmament. This initiative had clearly reached a terminal impasse from the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in January 1933, however, with the new political reality writ large by the October 1933 departure of [[Nazi Germany]] from the [[Geneva]] disarmament negotiations.&lt;ref name=Carr147&gt;E.H. Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern, 1930-1935.'' New York: Pantheon Books, 1982; pg. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, there was little motion among the world communist movement towards construction of a broader [[united front]] with the socialist movement and their affiliated trade unions, with the Comintern continuing to train its rhetorical guns on the [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement, which was held to have sabotaged the effort of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] to wage battle against fascism by propagating what the communists characterized as its "anti-Marxist theory of a 'peaceful,' 'democratic' road to socialism" among the German workers' movement.&lt;ref&gt;The quoted words are those of an unsigned editorialist in the official magazine ''The Communist International,'' no. 9 (1935), cited in Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some within the communist movement who began feeling their way to a new more collaborative orientation, however. The [[Austrian Civil War|February 1934 Uprising]] of [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialists]] against right wing forces in [[Austria]] and movement towards cooperation between Socialists and Communists in [[France]] in fighting a nascent fascist movement there convinced Bulgarian Communist [[Georgi Dimitrov]], a leading figure in the Communist International that the Comintern's hostility towards joint action between Communists and Socialists was ill considered.&lt;ref name=Haslam54&gt;Jonathan Haslam, ''The Soviet Union and the Struggle for Collective Security in Europe, 1933-39.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1984; pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimitrov made his triumphant return to Moscow in April 1934 following acquittal in the [[Reichstag fire#Reichstag fire trial|Reichstag Fire trial]] determined to change the Comintern's fundamental strategy from one of antagonistic opposition to [[social democracy]] to one of cooperation in a joint struggle.&lt;ref name=Haslam54 /&gt;

Preparations for a 7th World Congress of the Comintern began in Moscow late in 1934, with the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] (ECCI) establishing a commission to draft programmatic resolutions for that body.&lt;ref name=Carr148&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; This body was divided between Dimitrov and others advocating a move towards a "general democratic, anti-Fascist" orientation and hardliners who continued to argue that the battle against fascism was inseparable from the task of overthrowing the [[bourgeoisie]], implying a simultaneous fight against the fascist right and the reformist constitutionalist and socialist movements.&lt;ref name=Carr148 /&gt; With no rapid agreement forthcoming, on March 8, 1935 the scheduled opening of the 7th Congress was moved back to the end of July.&lt;ref&gt;''Voprosy Istorii KPSS'' (Problems of History of the CPSU), no. 8 (1975), pg. 60; cited in Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be the exigencies of Soviet foreign policy which ultimately shaped the Comintern's orientation, when on May 2, 1935, the two countries most concerned about the implications of growing German militarism — France and the Soviet Union — concluded the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]], a mutual aid pact in which each promised to come to the other's defense in the event that aggression violating the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was suffered.&lt;ref name=Carr150&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, two days of consultations in Moscow between French [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Foreign Minister]] [[Pierre Laval]] and Soviet chiefs [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Viacheslav Molotov]], and Maxim Litvinov helped to solemnify the agreement through a joint communique in which the parties agreed "not to allow their means of national defense to weaken in any respect" and which recognized France's right to "maintain her armed forces at a level consonant with her security.''&lt;ref&gt;The communique was broadly published in the world press on May 16, 1935. Cited in Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pp. 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The May 1935 treaty and formal communique between France and the USSR tilted the scale decisively towards a new Comintern policy for the Communist Parties of the world, casting aside the old [[Third Period]] line of "class against class" for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie in favor of a new policy of ''[[realpolitik]],'' defending the Russian revolution by supporting mutual defense agreements between the USSR and various capitalist states.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Further marking this shift in the international political line of the Comintern was the appointment of Popular Front adherent Georgi Dimitrov as new head of the Communist International.&lt;ref name=Haslam54 /&gt; The stage was therefore set for the belated convocation of the Comintern's 7th World Congress.

===Convocation===

The 7th World Congress of the Communist International opened ion the evening of July 25, 1935 in the Hall of Pillars of the [[House of the Unions]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr403&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering, which was convened almost exactly seven years since the conclusion of the last Comintern World Congress, was attended by 513 delegates, of whom 371 were accorded full voting rights, representing 65 Comintern member parties as well as 19 sympathizing parties.&lt;ref name=Carr403 /&gt; In keeping with his personal tradition and relative lack of interest in Comintern affairs, the proceedings were not attended by [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party]] [[General Secretary]] Joseph Stalin, who had by this time risen to a position of unquestioned supremacy in the Soviet firmament.&lt;ref name=Carr403 /&gt;

Despite his absence, Stalin was lauded in a [[cult of personality|cult-like]] manner, with every mention of the Soviet leader's name being met by "tumultuous applause" from the gathered delegates.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pieck's keynote report===
[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0006016 008 Wilhelm Pieck auf der Demonstrationstribüne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wilhelm Pieck (1876-1960), first President of East Germany, as he appeared in his later years.]]

Setting the stage for the 7th World Congress was the keynote report on the Activities of ECCI, delivered on the second day by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] of the Communist Party of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," in ''VII Congress of the Communist International: Abridged Stenographic Report of Proceedings.'' Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1939; pp. 15-71.&lt;/ref&gt; While lauding the 1928 tactic of "class against class" which was "directed against the bloc of the Social Democrats with the bourgeoisie and aimed at destroying the bloc of the Social Democratic leaders with the bourgeoisie," Pieck nevertheless acknowledged that "a certain number of sectarian mistakes were committed."&lt;ref&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This push for ideologically pure leadership divided the workers' movement during the strike movement of the late 1920s, gaining the support of some workers while alienating others and ultimately failing owing to "clumsy and sectarian tactics."&lt;ref&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieck argued that with the coming of the [[Great Depression]] the bourgeoisie sought to solve its problem of a collapsing internal market and declining profits with a move towards seizure and plunder of foreign territory under the banner of fascism, with the aggression of militarist [[Japanese Empire|Japan]] in [[Manchuria]] and the rise of Nazi Germany said to epitomize the new trend.&lt;ref name=Pieck26&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; "These preparations are simultaneously and primarily designed for the destruction of the Soviet Union, the home, the basis, and the bulwark of the proletarian revolution," Pieck declared.&lt;ref name=Pieck26 /&gt;

Pieck identified the "defeat of the German proletariat" and the rise of Nazism as the "greatest event that marked the first years of the crisis in the capitalist countries," stating that from the spring of 1932 it had "already become evident that the fascists had a considerable advantage over the Communists in the matter of mobilizing the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The communists had attempted to change the situation by proposing a united front with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and its associated trade union federation, the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] (ADGB).&lt;ref&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; This effort had been rebuffed, Pieck said, with the failure of the Social Democratic political and labor movement to join [[general strike]]s following the expulsion of socialist ministers from the government of [[Prussia]] in July 1932 and the coming to power of the Hitler government in January 1933 singled out for specific criticism.&lt;ref name=Pieck39&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omitting the fact that the Comintern's "class against class" line had been targeted directly at the Social Democrats, who had been castigated as "[[social fascism|social fascists]]" in no way better than the actual fascist movement, Pieck declared that the Communists had done "everything in their power to mobilize the laboring masses for a revolutionary struggle to prevent the fascist dictatorship," only to be stymied when the Social Democrats "did not abandon their hostile attitude to the united front and the struggle."&lt;ref name=Pieck39 /&gt; Only now, Pieck declared, had a new era been ushered in with a "turn of the Socialist workers towards a united front with the Communists."&lt;ref name=Pieck41&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of factors had contributed to the new attitude of the Socialists towards the Communists, according to Pieck, including the "final and irrevocable victory of socialism in the Soviet Union" on the one hand and the brutal reality of fascist dictatorship in Germany on the other.&lt;ref name=Pieck41 /&gt; The defense of Communism made by Dimitrov at the Leipzig trial, a general strike in France in February 1934, and armed battles against the fascists in Austria in February 1934 and in [[Spain]] in October 1934 had further consolidated this trend towards interparty cooperation, Pieck declared.&lt;ref name=Pieck41 /&gt; Consequently, Pieck noted, "United Front agreements have been reached between the Communists and Socialists in Austria, Spain, and Italy" with additional mass actions taking place between rank-and-file party members without the blessing of Socialist leaders in Great Britain, the United States, [[Poland]], and [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pieck, "The Activities of the Executive Committee of the Communist International," pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimitrov's report on unity against fascism===

After Pieck's keynote report and the extended discussion which ensued came on August 2 a second watershed report, this by Georgi Dimitrov on the task of building unity of the working class in opposition to fascism.&lt;ref name=Carr405&gt;Carr, ''Twilight of the Comintern,'' pg. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of Dimitrov on the platform, a great hero of the communist movement since his victory at the Leipzig trial, was met by a resounding ovation of the gathered delegates and a rousing singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=Carr405 /&gt;

Dimitrov began with an analysis of fascism, which he characterized as "the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, and most imperialist elements of finance capital," intent upon wreaking organized "terrorist vengeance against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry and intelligentsia."&lt;ref name=Dimitrov126&gt;Georgi Dimitrov, "The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International," in ''VII Congress of the Communist International: Abridged Stenographic Report of Proceedings.'' Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1939; pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to its foreign policy, Dimitrov condemned fascism as "jingoism in its most brutal form, fomenting bestial hatred of other nations."&lt;ref name=Dimitrov126 /&gt;

In marked juxtaposition to the previous international communist line, which intentionally muddied the difference between "fascism" and "social fascism" in an effort to break common workers away from their social democratic political and trade union leadership, Dimitrov depicted the establishment of fascism as a definite break in the fundamental form of governance from "one state form of class domination of the bourgeoisie — bourgeois democracy — by another form — open terrorist dictatorship."&lt;ref name=Dimitrov127&gt;Dimitrov, "The Fascist Offensive and the Tasks of the Communist International," pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism's victory would suppression of the "democratic liberties of the working people," curtail "the rights of parliament," and intensify repression of the revolutionary movement, Dimitrov warned.&lt;ref name=Dimitrov127 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10746">The '''Shelburne riots''' were a series of mob attacks in July 1784 by landless [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|British Loyalist]] veterans of the [[American Revolution]] against [[Black Loyalists]] and government officials in the town of [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] and the nearby village of [[Birchtown]]. They are considered the first race riots in Canada and one of the first recorded race riots in North America.&lt;ref&gt;While the Shelburne Riot is the first recorded race riot in Canada and is often described as North America's first race riot, see [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-shelburne-race-riots/ "The Shelburne Race Riots", ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''], race was a factor in many of the forty riots and six black rebellions recorded in pre-revolutionary America. [https://libcom.org/history/peoples-history-american-revolution  Howard Zinn, A people's history of the American revolution – reviewed in libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|right|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]] in 1788.]]
The town of Shelburne was created in 1783 as a settlement for [[United Empire Loyalists]], British soldiers, supporters and families who fought for the British in the American Revolution.  Briefly the fourth largest city in North America and the largest British city in the continent, the city of 10,000 people included over 1,500 African Americans known as [[Black Loyalists]] who had escaped slavery during the American Revolution and joined the British side.&lt;ref&gt;James W. St. G. Walker, ''The Black Loyalists'', University of Toronto Press (1992) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Black Loyalists were given land in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]] six miles outside town but many also worked and lived in Shelburne. Tensions rose in Shelburne in the spring of 1784. Delays in awarding land grants created anger and frustration among many disbanded soldiers who sought jobs while they waited for grants promised for their military service. They found many Black Loyalists, who received even fewer land grants and smaller rations, were willing to work for smaller wages.

A popular Black clergyman [[David George (Baptist)|David George]] became a lightning rod for racist anger. He founded a Baptist church in Shelburne and attracted many followers, both black and white. In the spring of 1784, as David George prepared to baptize a white couple, William and Deborah Holmes, a small mob of Deborah Holmes's relatives disrupted the service to stop her baptism. Shelburne magistrates were called and ruled that the couple were free to be baptised in a church of their choosing. The baptism went ahead but racial tension grew among landless white Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Kimber, ''Loyalists and Layabouts'', p. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Riot==
On the night of July 25, the riot began as a large group of men attacked David George and the Black Loyalists in Shelburne.

{{quote box |quote = Several of the black people had houses upon my lot, but forty (40) or fifty (50) disbanded soldiers were employed, who came with the tackle of ships, and turned my dwelling house, and every one of their houses, quite over, and the meeting house they would have burned down, had not the ringleader of the mob himself prevented it. But I continued to preaching it till they came one night, and stood before the pulpit, and swore how they would treat me If I preached again. But I stayed and preached, and the next day they came and beat me with sticks and drove me into the swamp. I returned in the evening, and took my wife and children over to the river to Birchtown.|source= — David George&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackloyalist.com/cdc/documents/diaries/george_a_life.htm “An Account of Life of Mr. David George from S. L. A. given by himself. In a conversation with Brother Rippon of London and Brother Pearce in Birmingham”, ''Black Loyalists: Our History, Our Heritage'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David George's home and 20 other homes of free Blacks in Shelburne were destroyed in the first night of rioting.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the free Blacks fled to Birchtown for safety. George stayed and continued to preach in Shelburne but at his next service a number of white rioters stormed into the church and threatened him. The next day they attacked him, beating him with sticks until he escaped into swampy area outside of Shelburne. He returned at night to rescue his wife and children and they sought shelter in Birchtown along with most of the free Blacks who had formerly lived and worked in Shelburne.

The Loyalist land agent in Shelburne Benjamin Marston wrote after the first day of rioting, "Great Riot today. The disbanded soldiers have risen against the free negroes to drive them out of town because they labour more cheaply." The next day the rioters attacked Marston's house. He escaped to the military barracks across the harbour and that afternoon was able to board a coastal schooner headed for Halifax shortly before rioters arrived at the barracks reportedly planning to hang him.&lt;ref&gt;Kimber, 185-186&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks by rioters continued in town for ten days targeting some white Loyalists, such as Thomas and James Courtney who had received large land grants on the Roseway River to set up a sawmill. The Courtneys were wealthy enough to hire armed guards to protect their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Kimber, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Attacks continued for another month against Black Loyalists as rioters made incursions against the Black settlement at Birchtown.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Black Loyalists, many of whom were army veterans organized into militia companies, were able to defend themselves in Birchtown initially, but as the riots continued the militias were no longer able to quell the violence. Attacks on Blacks traveling along the road between Birchtown and Shelburne for work and supplies continued for a month. Reports of the attacks spread around Nova Scotia with Simeon Perkins in the town of Liverpool to the east writing, "An extraordinary mob or riot has happened at Shelburne. Some thousands of people assembled Clubs and Drove the Negroes out of the Town."&lt;ref&gt;[http://link.library.utoronto.ca/champlain/DigObj.cfm?Idno=9_96879&amp;lang=eng&amp;Page=0301&amp;Size=3&amp;query=Simeon%20AND%20Perkins&amp;searchtype=Fulltext&amp;startrow=11&amp;Limit=All Simeon Perkins,‘‘Diary of Simeon Perkins'', Champlain Society Vol. II, July 29, 1784, p. 238]&lt;/ref&gt; The mob was stopped by the arrival of troops from the [[17th Regiment of Foot]], later assisted by a frigate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-shelburne-race-riots/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Dozens of homes, mostly of Black Loyalists, had been destroyed in the riots while others were looted. An unknown number of people were injured. No deaths were recorded. Most rioters limited themselves to injuring and terrifying their victims and few rioters had access to firearms.&lt;ref&gt;All accounts describe rioters armed with clubs and sticks and none describe deaths. While racist bias in official accounts of the time may have overlooked the deaths of Black Loyalists, neither of the two accounts written by Black Loyalists themselves in Shelburne (by [[David George (Baptist)|David George]] or [[Boston King]]) recorded any deaths.&lt;/ref&gt; Free Blacks had essentially been driven out of the town of Shelburne, firmly establishing the two as a segregated white community aside from Blacks slaves and indentured servants. Black Loyalists were forced to seek a livelihood in the poor lands and overcrowded settlement of Birchtown.

The Governor of Nova Scotia, [[John Parr (colonial governor)|John Parr]] also traveled to Shelburne on August 23 to attempt to settle the disputes and delays in land grants. Parr blamed the riot on delays in awarding land. He blamed Martson, calling him "a shark trying to prey on helpless settlers". Marston was dismissed from his post. None of the rioters who attacked the Black Loyalists or Marston were identified or brought to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Robertson, ''Kings Bounty: A History of Early Shelburne, Nova Scotia'', Nova Scotia Museum (1983) p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a fresh round of attacks led to assaults against some [[Mi'kmaq]] people at Shelburne in November, the ringleader Edward Cavan was put in the stocks and sentenced to six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the eventual settlement of Loyalist land grants in 1785, the economy of Shelburne collapsed in the late 1780s as a lack of agricultural land, a collapse of the whale fishery and poor inland trade routes led four fifths of the population to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This included David George and many of the Black Loyalists who fled the racism and poverty of Shelburne in 1792 to settle in [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]] where they became known as [[Nova Scotian Settlers (Sierra Leone)|The Nova Scotian Settlers]].

Scholars such as James Walker have interpreted the riots as caused by the economic predicaments of the Loyalists which aggravated racial hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Marston is regarded by many scholars as a scapegoat for the larger problems of Loyalist land settlements and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Kimber, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions in popular culture==
The Shelburne riots were dramatized in the BBC docudrama series ''[[Rough Crossings]]'' based on the book by [[Simon Schama]]. The riots are also depicted in fiction in the novel ''[[The Book of Negroes (novel)|The Book of Negroes]]'' by [[Lawrence Hill]] and the [[The Book of Negroes (miniseries)|television miniseries of the same name]], although the date of the riot is changed in both works to fit the fictional narrative and the riots are depicted as a mass [[lynching]] with hangings, multiple murders and a church burning.

The '''Stolpersteine in Lomnice u Tišnova''' lists the [[Stolpersteine]] in the town [[Lomnice (Brno-Country District)|Lomnice]] (Brno-Country District) in the [[South Moravian Region]] ({{lang-cs|Jihomoravský kraj}}). Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The name of the Stolpersteine in Czech is: ''Kameny zmizelých'', stones of the disappeared.

&lt;small&gt;The lists are sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

The Jewish community of Lomnice u Tišnova existed since the beginning of the 18th century. But already in 1571 a ″certain Jew″ from Lomnice was mentioned, the first written evidence of the existence of Jewish population in the city. While in the 16th and 17th century there were only few Jews coming to Lomnice, this changed at the beginning of the 18th century. 708 Jews from Lysice were resettled in Lomnice. A first Jewish community with a prayer hall was established. Around 1800 about 80 Jewish families lived in Lomnice with about 611 persons, that was then at least half the inhabitants. In the first half of the 19th century there was also a Yeshiva, a Jewish university in the city. In 1830, the community consisted of 606 persons, more than a third of the population. Thereafter the Jewish portion of the population decreased continuously: in 1848 only 306  (20%), in 1900 merely 88 people (5%), 1930 only 30 persons (2%). A rabbi was active here until 1919. In 1929, der Jewish community was finally dissolved.[[File:Lomnice-synagoga2012f.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Memorial plaque, 1997]] After the destruction of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the German occupation, about 35 Jews from other municipalities in the region sought refuge in Lomnice. Already in autumn of 1941, however, their property was confiscated, their freedom of movement was restricted. Deportations were carried out between December 1941 and April 1942. The first transport took place on 5 December 1941 (Transport K), the last and largest from [[Brno]] on 4 April 1942 (transport Ah). The oldest person on this train was Mrs. Schiller, 86 years old, the youngest was Libuška Tuliss, not even three years old. After the war, only one Jew, Jan Líbezný, returned to Lomnice. He had lost all his relatives in Nazi concentration camps. On the occasion of the reopening of the Lomnic Synagogue in 1997, a memorial plaque for 58 victims of the [[Shoah]] was unveiled. On 17 September 2011, the first collocation of Stolpersteine took place. They were dedicated to the Liebesny family.&lt;ref name=Stolpersteine &gt;''Stolpersteine v Lomnici'' (Stolpersteine in Lomnice), a documentation of Jews in Lomnice, produced by "Okrašlovací spolek pro Lomnici a okolí" (OSLO), online: [http://www.oslomnice.cz/resources/docs/OSLO%20-%20Stolpersteine%20v%20Lomnici%20%5Bcs%5D.pdf oslomnice.cz/...]; abbreviated english version: [http://www.oslomnice.cz/resources/docs/OSLO%20-%20Stolpersteine%20in%20Lomnice%20%5Ben%5D.pdf oslomnice.cz/]&lt;/ref&gt;

*17 March 1992, Moldova had troops under the Ministry of the Interior. On 17 March 1992, they started recruiting troops for the newly created Ministry of Defence. 
*5 April 1992, Vice-President [[Aleksandr Rutskoy|Rutskoy]] of Russia, in a speech delivered to 5,000 people in [[Tiraspol]], encouraged the Transnistrian people to obtain their independence. 
*On June 2, 1992, [[Ilie Ilaşcu]] and three more [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]], members of the "Ilaşcu group" (Ilaşcu together with [[Andrei Ivanțoc]], [[Alexandru Leşco]] and [[Tudor Petrov Popa]]) were arrested by the breakaway [[Transnistria]]n government and charged with the murder of two separatist officials.

'''United Nations Security Council Resolution 362''' was adopted by [[United Nations|the U.N.]] on October 23, 1974. The [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] decided that, although the Middle East remained quiet, the situation was still volatile, and therefore this [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolution]] extended the mandate of the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] for another six months, until April 24, 1975.  The Council commended the Force and those governments supplying men to it for their contributions and expressed its confidence that the Force would be maintained with maximum efficiency and economy.  The Resolution also reaffirmed that the Force must be able to function militarily in the whole [[Egypt]]-[[Israel]] sector of operations without differentiation regarding the UN status of the various contingents. 

The resolution passed with 13 votes to none, while [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Iraq]] did not participate in voting.

A '''universal history''' is a work aiming at the presentation of the [[history]] of humankind as a whole, coherent unit.&lt;ref&gt;What is history?: Five lectures on the modern science of history By [[Karl Lamprecht]]. Pages 181-227.

A '''universal chronicle''' or '''world [[chronicle]]''' traces history from the beginning of written information about the past up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;History begins at the point where monuments become intelligible and documentary evidence of a trustworthy character is fortheoming but from this point onwards the domain is boundless for Universal History as understood. (Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks by [[Leopold von Ranke]]. Preface, pg. x)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Universal history embraces the events of all times and nations in so far as [[Scientific method|scientific treatment]] of them is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold von Ranke. ''Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks''. Scribner, 1884.
''An epitome of universal history'' by A. Harding. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal history in the Western tradition is commonly divided into three parts, viz. [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[Postclassical Era|medieval]], and [[Modern history|modern]] time.&lt;ref name="EoUHfHIiRafSI"&gt;H. M. Cottinger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ Elements of universal history for higher institutes in republics and for self-instruction]. [[Charles H. Whiting]], 1884. pg. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DkVDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 1]+.&lt;/ref&gt; The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with [[Karl Jaspers]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin and Goal of History'', (London: Yale University Press, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish the [[Axial Age]] synchronous to "classical antiquity" of the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel N. Eisenstadt, ''Axial Age Civilizations'', (New York: New York State University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization—prehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods.

G. Wells, ''[[The Outline of History]]''}}

The roots of [[historiography]] in the 19th century are bound up with the concept that history written with a strong connection to the [[primary source]]s could [[Research|be integrated]] with "the big picture", i.e. to a general, universal history. For example, [[Leopold von Ranke]], probably the pre-eminent historian of the 19th century, founder of '''Rankean historical positivism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zubin Meer (ed.), ''Individualism: The Cultural Logic of Modernity'', Lexington Books, 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;, the classic mode of historiography that now stands against [[postmodernism]], attempted to write a Universal History at the close of his career. The works of world historians [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] are examples of attempts to integrate primary [[Source text|source-based]] history and Universal History. Spengler's work is more general; Toynbee created a theory that would allow the study of "civilizations" to proceed with integration of [[Recorded history|source-based history writing]] and Universal History writing.&lt;ref&gt;Donald A. Yerxa. ''Recent Themes in World History and the History of the West: Historians in Conversation''. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2009. Page 1+&lt;/ref&gt; Both writers attempted to incorporate [[teleology|teleological theories]] into general presentations of the history. Toynbee found as the ''telos'' (''goal'') of universal history the emergence of a single [[World State]].

==Instances and description==

===Ancient examples===

====Hebrew Bible====
A project of Universal history may be seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} 
which from the point of view of its redactors{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} in the 5th century BC presents a history of humankind from [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to the [[Noah's flood|Flood]], 
and from there a history of the [[Israelites]] down to [[Second Temple Judaism|the present]]. The [[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]] is a 2nd-century CE rabbinic interpretation of this chronology.

====Greco-Roman historiography====
{{main article|Greco-Roman historiography}}
In [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman antiquity]], the first universal history was written by [[Ephorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century BC).  This work has been lost, but its influence can be seen in the ambitions of [[Polybius]] (203–120 BC) and [[Diodorus]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1st century BC) to give comprehensive accounts of their worlds. [[Herodotus]]' ''History'' is the earliest surviving member of the Greco-Roman world-historical tradition, although under some definitions of universal history it does not qualify as universal because it reflects no attempt to describe an overall direction of history or a principle or set of principles governing or underlying it.  Polybius was the first to attempt a universal history in this stricter sense of the term:
{{quote|
For what gives my work its peculiar quality, and what is most remarkable in the present age, is this: Fortune has gained almost all the affairs of the world in one direction and has forced to incline towards one and the same end; a historian should likewise bring before his readers under one synoptic view the operations by which she has accomplished her general purpose (1:4:1-11).}}
''[[Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] has been considered as a universal history because of its comprehensive chronology—from the [[Cosmogony|creation of mankind]] to the death of [[Julius Caesar]] a year before the poet's birth.&lt;ref name="Solodow 1988, p. 18."&gt;{{cite book|last=Solodow|first=Joseph B.|title=The World of Ovid's Metamorphoses|year=1988|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807817711|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=n0vdulnvcvoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sources+for+ovid%27s+metamorphoses&amp;ots=9nFm-L-j6b&amp;sig=u0-D_k9Ytxi_hf3R6Df9WLImfw0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Leipziger Weltchronik|Leipzig]] are preserved five fragments dating to the 2nd century AD and coming from a world chronicle. Its author is unknown, but was perhaps a Christian. Later, universal history provided an influential lens on the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire in such works as [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]'s ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' ''History Against the Pagans''.

====Chinese historiography====
During the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 220 CE) of [[China]], [[Sima Qian]] (145–86 BC) was the first Chinese historian to attempt a universal history—from the earliest [[Chinese mythology|mythological origins]] of his civilization to [[History of the Han Dynasty|his present day]]—in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''. Although his generation was the first in China to discover the existence of kingdoms in [[Central Asia]] and [[India]], his work did not attempt to cover the history of these regions.

===Medieval examples===

====Western Europe====
The ''universal [[chronicle]]'' traces history from the beginning of the world up to the present and was an especially popular genre of [[historiography]] in [[medieval]] [[Western Europe]]. The universal chronicle differs from the ordinary chronicle in its much broader chronological and geographical scope, giving, in principle, a continuous account of the progress of world history from the creation of the world up to the author's own times, but in practice often narrowing down to a more limited geographical range as it approaches those times.

The [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|''Chronica'']] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 275–339) is considered to be the starting point of this tradition. The second book of this work consisted of a set of concordance tables (''Chronici canones'') that for the first time synchronized the several concurrent chronologies in use with different peoples. Eusebius' chronicle became known to the [[Latin]] West through the translation by [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420).

Universal chronicles are sometimes organized around a central [[ideological]] theme, such as the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] idea of the tension between the heavenly and the earthly state, as depicted in the [[City of God (book)|City of God]], which plays a major role in [[Otto von Freising]]'s ''Historia de duabus civitatibus''. Agustine’s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography as it takes place on planet Earth. In this war God moves (by divine intervention/ Providence) those governments, political /ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God)  in order to oppose by all means—including military—those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of Devil).

In other cases, any obvious theme may be lacking. Some universal chronicles bear a more or less [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] character, with many digressions on non-historical subjects, as is the case with the ''Chronicon'' of [[Helinand of Froidmont]].

Other notable universal chroniclers of the Medieval West include [[Bede]] (c. 672 or 673–735), the [[Christherre-Chronik]], [[Helinand of Froidmont]] (c. 1160—after 1229), [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636), [[Jans der Enikel]], [[Matthew Paris]] (c. 1200-1259), [[Ranulf Higdon]] (c. 1280-1363), [[Rudolf von Ems]], [[Sigebert of Gembloux]] (c. 1030–1112), [[Otto von Freising]] (c. 1114–1158), and [[Vincent of Beauvais]] (c. 1190-1264?).

The tradition of universal history can even be seen in the works of medieval historians whose purpose may not have been to chronicle the ancient past, but nonetheless included it in a local history of more recent times.  One such example is the ''[[Decem Libri Historiarum]]'' of [[Gregory of Tours]] (d. 594), where only the first of his ten books describes creation and ancient history, while the last six books focus on events in his own lifetime and region.  While this reading of Gregory is currently a widely accepted hypothesis in historical circles, the central purpose of Gregory's writing is still a topic of hot debate.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian. Gregory of Tours. (Bangor: Headstart History, 1994.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kathleen and Wood, Ian, eds.. The World of Gregory of Tours. (Boston: Brill, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historiography of early Islam====
{{main article|Historiography of early Islam}}
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (13th century), universal history in this vein was taken up by [[Historiography of early Islam|Muslim historians]] such as [[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini]] ("The History of The World Conqueror") by [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]], [[Jami al-Tawarikh]] ("Compendium of Chronicles") by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] (now held at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) and the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' by Ibn Khaldun.

===Modern historiography===
{{rquote|right|A philosophical attempt to work out a universal history according to a natural plan directed to achieving the civic union of the human race must be regarded as possible and, indeed, as contributing to this end of Nature|[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] - Ninth Thesis&lt;ref&gt;Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early European project was the ''[[Universal History (Sale et al)|Universal History]]'' of [[George Sale]] and others, written in the mid-18th century.

Christian writers as late as [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] in his ''Discours sur l'histoire universelle''  ([[Speech of Universal History]]) are still reflecting on and continuing the Medieval tradition of universal history.&lt;ref&gt;Bossuet, J. B. ''[https://archive.org/details/discourssurlhist01boss Discours sur l'histoire universelle] (Paris, Furne et cie, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;
Speech of Universal History is considered by many Catholics as an actual second edition or continuation of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]]. In this work Bossuet continues to provide an update of universal history according to Augustine’s thesis of universal war between those humans that follow God and those who follow the Devil. This concept of world history guided by [[Divine Providence]] in a universal war between God and Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council']] s [[Gaudium et Spes]] document: "The Church . . . holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings."

In the 19th century, universal histories proliferated.{{dubious|date=April 2015}}
&lt;!--a "general theory of history" is not a "universal history". entirely different topic. But there is much overlapping between the two and universal history can be based on theory of history--&gt;
Philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;"[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]" in On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herder]],&lt;ref&gt;''Universal History'', (tr. F. Wilson, New York: 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schiller]] and [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophy of History'', (tr. Robert S. Hartman, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt; and political philosophers such as [[Marx]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], presented general theories of history that shared essential characteristics with the Biblical account: they conceived of history as a coherent whole, governed by certain basic characteristics or immutable principles. Kant who was one of the earliest thinkers to use the term ''Universal History'' described its meaning in "[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]]":
{{quote|
Whatever concept one may hold...concerning the freedom of the will, certainly its appearances, which are human actions, like every other natural event are determined by universal laws. However obscure their causes, history...permits us to hope that if we attend to the play of freedom of the human will in the large, we may be able to discern a regular movement in it, and that what seems complex and chaotic in the single individual may be seen from the standpoint of the human race as a whole to b a steady and progressive though slow evolution of the original endowment..Each individual and people, as if following some guiding trend, goes toward a natural but to each of them unknown goal...In keeping with this purpose, it might be possible to have a history with a definite natural plan for creatures that have no plan of their own.&lt;ref&gt;On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963, p 11-12); also ''Perpetual Peace'' in: Ibid., (p 106).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed, the beginning of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of [[Hittites|Hittite]] dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is seen. From the 16th to 11th centuries BC the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] dominated the Nile Valley. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed.

The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region.
During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon &amp; Schuster {{ISBN|0-7432-6442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was underway.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the [[Mannaeans]] Kingdom begins in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] forms in [[Mesopotamia]]. In 800 BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded [[Olympic Games]] are held.

{{Main article|Post-classical era}}

The [[post-classical era]], also known as the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_in_the_Middle_Ages.html?id=U1sMAAAAYAAJ The World in the Middle Ages: An Historical Geography, with Accounts of the Origin and Development, the Institutions and Literature, the Manners and Customs of the Nations in Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa, from the Close of the Fourth to the Middle of the Fifteenth Century]. [[Adolphus Louis Koeppen]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[historical]] [[Periodization|period]] following the [[Iron Age]], fully underway by the 5th century and lasting to the 15th century, and preceding the [[early Modern Era]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Tabular_Views_of_Universal_History.html?id=7jtHAAAAIAAJ Tabular Views of Universal History]. [[George Haven Putnam]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Willard. A system of universal history, in perspective: accompanied by an atlas, exhibiting chronology in a picture of nations, and progressive geography in a series of maps. F. J. Huntington, 1835. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=x9gEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR5-IA3 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Lang-la|medius}} + {{Lang-la|aevum}} (middle + age); See [[Centre (geometry)|Middle]] and [[Time|Age]].&lt;/ref&gt; history is the middle period, or the middle age, in a three-period division of history: [[Ancient History|Classic]], Medieval,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and [[Modern history|Modern]]. The precise dates of the beginning, culmination, and end of the medieval history are more or less arbitrarily assumed according to the point of view adopted. Any hard and fast line drawn to designate either the beginning or close of the period in question is arbitrary. The widest limits given, viz., the irruption of the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire, for the beginning, and the Middle Ages of the 16th century, for the close, may be taken as inclusively sufficient, and embrace, beyond dispute, every movement or phase of history that can be claimed as properly belonging to the medieval history.

In Europe, the period saw the large-scale [[Migration Period|European Migration]] and [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In South Asia, the [[middle kingdoms of India]] were the classical period of the region. The "Medieval" period on the Indian subcontinent lasts for some 1,500 years, and ends in the 13th century. During the late medieval history, [[Islamic empires in India|several Islamic empires]] were established in the Indian subcontinent. In East Asia, the [[Mid-Imperial China]] age begins with the reunification of China and ends with China was conquered by the [[Mongol Empire]]. The [[Golden Horde]] invaded North and West Asia and parts of eastern Europe in the 13th century and established and maintained their [[khanate]] until the end of the medieval history.

The Early medieval history saw the continuation of trends set up in [[ancient history]] (and, for Europe, [[late Antiquity]]). The period is usually considered to open with those migrations of the German Tribes which led to the destruction of the Roman Empire in the West in 375, when the Huns fell upon the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea and forced the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire on the lower Danube. A later date, however, is sometimes assumed, viz., when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Roman Emperors of the West, in 476.  Depopulation, deurbanization, and increased [[barbarian]] invasion were seen across the [[Old World]]. [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], once part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], became [[Islamic]]. Later in [[European history]], the establishment of the [[feudal system]] allowed a return to systemic agriculture. There was sustained [[urbanization]] in [[Northern Europe|northern]] and [[western Europe]].

During the High medieval history in Europe, [[Christian]]-oriented art and architecture flourished and [[Crusades]] were mounted to recapture the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim]] control. The influence of the emerging states in Europe was tempered by the ideal of an international [[Christendom]]. The codes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]] set rules for proper European behavior, while the European [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers attempted to reconcile Christian faith and reason.

During the Late medieval history in Europe, the centuries of prosperity and growth came to a halt.
The close of the medieval history is also variously fixed; some make it coincide with the rise of Humanism and the Renaissance in Italy, in the 14th century; with the Fall of Constantinople, in 1453; with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492; or, again, with the great religious schism of the 16th century. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[medieval Great Famine]] and the [[Black Death]], reduced the population around half before the calamities in the late medieval history. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. Western Europe experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism]]. Collectively the events are a [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crisis of the Late medieval history]].

[[Modern history]] describes the historical period after the Middle history.&lt;ref&gt;Intrinsic to the English language, "modern" denotes (in reference to history) a period that is opposed to either ancient or medieval&amp;nbsp;— modern history comprising the history of the world since the close of the Middle history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LaNDmZBcNGQC&amp;pg=PA3814 ''The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', Page 3814]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern history can be further broken down into the ''[[early modern period]]'' and the ''late modern period'' after the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. ''[[Contemporary history]]'' describes the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The [[Great Divergence]]&lt;ref&gt;a term coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the period of time in which the process by which the [[Western Europe]] and the parts of the [[New World]] overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the powerful and wealthy world [[civilization]] of the time, eclipsing [[Qing Dynasty|Qing China]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal India]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The modern era began approximately in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dunan, Marcel. ''Larousse Encyclopedia of Modern History, From 1500 to the Present Day''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Many major events caused [[Europe]] to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the fall of [[Muslim Spain]] and the discovery of the [[Americas]] in 1492, and [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman. ''Early modern British history, 1485-1760: a select bibliography'', [[Historical Association]], 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/rr_gateway/research_guides/history/texts_by_period.shtml#emp ''Early Modern Period (1485-1800)''], Sites Organized by Period, [[Rutgers University]] Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Early modern Europe]]an history is usually seen to span from around the start of the 15th century, through the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th century.

==== Early modern age ====
{{Main article|Early modern period}}
The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:
* The [[Renaissance]]
* [[Protestant reformation|The Reformation]] and [[Counter Reformation]].
* The [[Age of Discovery]]
* Rise of [[capitalism]]

The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of [[mechanization]] in society, the [[American Revolution]], the first [[French Revolution]]; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloy|first=Marjie|title=The Congress of Vienna, 1 November 1814 – 8 June 1815|publisher=The Victorian Web|date=30 April 2002|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/forpol/vienna.html|accessdate=2009-01-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the peace established by [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Hazen, Charles Downer (1910). ''Europe since 1815''. American historical series, H. Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge University Library]]

As a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]s and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of [[Modernism]] emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:
* Increasing role of [[science]] and [[technology]]
* Mass [[literacy]] and proliferation of [[mass media]]
* Spread of [[social movements]]
* Institution of [[representative democracy]]
* [[Individualism]]
* [[Industrialization]]
* [[Urbanization]]

Other important events in the development of the Late modern period include:
* The [[Revolutions of 1848]]
* The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]
* The [[First World War]] and the [[Second World War]]

The contemporary "[[Great Divergence (inequality)|Great Divergence]]" is a term given to a period starting in late 1970s when inequality grew substantially in the [[United States]] and to a lesser extent in other countries such as [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The term originated with [[List of Nobel laureates in Economics|Nobel laureate]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] economist and ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Paul Krugman]],&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''The Conscience of a Liberal'',  W W Norton &amp; Company, 2007, p.124-8&lt;/ref&gt; and is a reference to the "[[Great Compression]]", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.slate.com/media/3/100914_NoahT_GreatDivergence.pdf The Great Divergence.
