      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8507">The following is a list of '''abbots of Abingdon'''. The [[Abingdon Abbey|Abbey of Abingdon]] was in northern [[Berkshire]]. The site is now in [[Oxfordshire]].

==Fictional abbots==
Historian Susan E. Kelly regards the traditional first six abbots as fictional: "There is good reason to think that in most cases their names were simply plucked from early charters available in the abbey's archive, the majority of which would seem to have had no connection with an early minister at Abingdon; there is no very convincing evidence that the historians had access to independent, reliable sources of information. The 'history' of the pre-Æthelwoldian minister seems to a very large extent to represent a fictional reconstruction".&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;Kelly, ''Charters of Abingdon, part 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably fictional abbots:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
!  width="17%" | Name
!  width="83%" | Comments

|- valign="top"
| Hæha, also Hean
|  The legendary first abbot of Abingdon, but, according to Kelly, more probably an abbot of [[Bradfield, Berkshire|Bradfield]], his name having been plucked from a charter dated 704,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+245 S 245]&lt;/ref&gt; with others, in order to replace the lost early history of Abingdon Abbey.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

|- valign="top"
| Cumma
| Cumma is mentioned in a forged charter of King Æthelbald,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+93 S 93]&lt;/ref&gt; but "no Abbot Cumma is known from other sources".&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt; It is, however, generally considered that the village of [[Cumnor]] is named after him.

|- valign="top"
| [[Hræthhun]]
| A Hræthhun was styled abbot of Abingdon in a charter dated 811,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+166 S 166]&lt;/ref&gt; but the charter was forged, probably using the name of Hræthhun (d. 839/40), bishop of Leicester. Kelly therefore excludes him from the list of Abingdon abbots.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

|- valign="top"
| Alhhard
| Kelly suggests that the name was plucked from the witness list of a charter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&amp;query=S+1201 S 1201]&lt;/ref&gt; with others, in order to reconstruct the lost early history of the Abbey of Abingdon.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

|- valign="top"
| [[Cynath]]
| A Cynath, abbot of Evesham, mistakenly listed by the compiler of the ''De Abbatibus Abbendoniae'' as an abbot of Abingdon.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

|- valign="top"
| Godescealc
| Godescealc's name occurs in three charters, all of them forgeries, and was later extracted from these documents and used in the construction of a spurious early history of the Abbey of Abingdon.&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;

The '''''Algemeiner Journal''''', known informally as '''''The Algemeiner''''' is a New York-based newspaper, covering American and international Jewish and Israel-related news. Former Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] described the paper and the Jacobson Foundation as "independent truth telling advocates for the Jewish people and Israel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torahcafe.com/musicvideo.php?vid=8887826a4 "Religion and Politics: Senator Joseph Lieberman,"] TorahCafe.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Algemeiner''{{'}}s Advisory Board was chaired by the late Nobel laureate, writer and activist [[Elie Wiesel]].

== History ==
In 1972, [[Gershon Jacobson]] founded the [[Yiddish]]-language ''Der Algemeiner Journal'', after consulting with the Lubavitcher Rebbe [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]].&lt;ref name="tziviajacobson"&gt;Tzivia Jacobson, [http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3105536/jewish/The-Rebbes-Advice-on-Opening-a-Yiddish-Newspaper.htm "The Rebbe’s Advice on Opening a Yiddish Newspaper,"] ''Chabad.org'', December2014, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as editor and publisher from its inception until his death in 2005.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;Margalit Fox, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/02/nyregion/02jacobson.html "Gershon Jacobson, 70, Founder and Editor of Yiddish Journal, Is Dead"], ''The New York Times'', June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural issue was published by Der Algemeiner Journal Corporation on February 23, 1972. The ten-page paper was priced at 25 cents. Twenty thousand issues were printed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1972/02/25/2960397/new-yiddish-weekly-launched "New Yiddish Weekly Launched,"] [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], February 24, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' intended to fill the gap after the daily Yiddish paper [[Jewish Morning Journal|''Der Tog Morgen Zhurnal'']] closed in 1971. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/24/archives/a-new-yiddish-weekly-makes-its-appearance.html "A New Yiddish Weekly Makes Its Appearance"], ''The New York Times'', February 24, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobson had earlier written and served as its city editor.&lt;ref name="forward1"&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/3587/ "Yiddish Journalist Gershon Jacobson, 71"], ''[[The Forward]]'', June 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest-circulation Yiddish weekly in the United States,&lt;ref name="forward1"/&gt; ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' emphasized Jewish community news, with a politically independent viewpoint, including reporting on tensions between rival [[Hasidic]] sects. Although Jacobson was a Lubavitcher Chasid,&lt;ref name="chaimmiller"&gt;Chaim Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z8MNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=gershon+jacobson+lubavitcher+chasid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WZg3r6LB0K&amp;sig=tJG0Cq4wDNoDYxVcbL4N1GAFpwM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_6ofpzsbPAhUIWj4KHdtRB3oQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=gershon%20jacobson%20lubavitcher%20chasid&amp;f=false "Turning Judaism Outward: A biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, page 208"], ''Turning Judaism Outward: A biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe'', page 208, copyright 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', he "defied easy categorization."&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt; 

At its peak &lt;!-- when? --&gt;, ''Der Algemeiner'''s circulation had neared 100,000 copies. In 1989, in response to the increasing marginalization of the Yiddish language in the changing Jewish community, ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' began printing a four-page English supplement in the middle of the paper, attracting a wider and more diverse Jewish audience.&lt;ref&gt;Elli Wohlgelernter, [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/15693/head-of-yiddish-paper-comes-from-a-different-school "Head of Yiddish paper comes ‘from a different school,’"] ''[[Jweekly]]'', May 18, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2005, after Gershon Jacobson's passing, his elder son, [[Simon Jacobson]], became the Publisher of ''Der Algemeiner Journal''. He founded the Gershon Jacobson Jewish Continuity Foundation (GJCF), a Jewish media organization with the mission to serve as a voice for Jews and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gjcf.net/mission.html |title=GJCF mission statement |access-date=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121024451/http://www.gjcf.net/mission.html |archive-date=2012-01-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he reconceived ''Der Algemeiner Journal'' as an English-language publication, replacing the Yiddish "Der" in its title for "The". That year, Dovid Efune became the Editor-In-Chief of what was called ''The Algemeiner'' and Director of the GJCF.

In 2011, the GJCF launched the website Algemeiner.com. The site has grown rapidly; more than 600 bloggers contribute to it.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} 

== Content and circulation ==
''The Algemeiner''{{'}}s print edition is published weekly every Friday, except for the weeks of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkot]]. The paper's circulation is between 18,000 and 23,000. It is sold at newsstands internationally and is available for subscription. It can also be viewed as an ePaper on Algemeiner.com. The vast majority of ''The Algemeiner'' readership and content is online.

==Annual events and lists==
Since 2006, in conjunction with the Gershon Jacobson Foundation, ''The Algemeiner'' hosts an annual lecture series featuring a politician, Jewish leader or scholar. In 2011, Connecticut Senator [[Joseph Lieberman]] spoke on politics and religion.

Beginning in 2010, ''The Algemeiner'' has put out an annual list of non-Jews who have had a positive influence in shaping the Jewish future. Media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] was named first in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Efune, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2010/05/26/6-most-influential-non-jews-positively-influencing-jewish-future/ "6 Most Influential Non-Jews Positively Influencing Jewish Future,"] ''Algemeiner Journal'', May 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Efune, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2011/08/29/top-10-non-jews-positively-influencing-the-jewish-future/ "Top 10 Non-Jews Positively Influencing the Jewish Future,"] ''Algemeiner Journal'', August 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitt Romney]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Efune, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/08/09/top-10-non-jews-positively-influencing-the-jewish-future-2012/ "Top 10 Non-Jews Positively Influencing the Jewish Future,"] ''Algemeiner Journal'', August 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Efune, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/10/17/top-10-non-jews-positively-influencing-the-jewish-future-2013/ "Top 10 Non-Jews Positively Influencing the Jewish Future,"] ''Algemeiner Journal'', October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a prelude to the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican primaries]], ''The Algemeiner'' ranked the party's eight candidates by assessing their positive effect on Israel.

===Kuikúro-Kalapálo===
Luke was translated into the [[Kuikuro language]] by missionaries with Worldwinds International. It was completed in 2007.

==Aymara==
The [[Gospel of Luke]] in [[Aymara language|Aymara]], translated by [[Vicente Pazos Kanki]], a former priest from [[Alto Perú]], in cooperation with the Scottish baptist pastor [[James Thompson (pastor)|James Thompson]], was published in 1828, which was the first publication of a whole book of the Bible in a Native American language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traducciondelabiblia.org/noticias/aymara/ Aymara]. Sociedades Bíblicas Unidas, Traducciones Bíblicas.&lt;/ref&gt; The first translation of the [[New Testament]] appeared in 1954, and the translation of the whole Bible into Aymara was published the first time in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Qullan Arunaca. Sociedad Bíblica Boliviana, La Paz 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; second time in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Qullan Arunaca. Sociedad Bíblica Boliviana, La Paz 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A modernized edition in the contemporary orthography and with [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonicals]] appeared in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Qullan Arunaka. La Biblia con Deuterocanónicos. Sociedad Bíblica Boliviana, La Paz 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aymara Bible editions from both 1997 and 2011 have been accessible on Bible portals since about 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bible.is: [http://www.bible.is/AYMBSB/Gen/1 Qullan Arunaka] (2011), [http://www.bible.is/AYMSBU/Gen/1 Qullan Arunaca] (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youversion.com: [https://www.youversion.com/es/bible/293/gen.1.ayop Qullan Arunaca] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130802193017/https://www.youversion.com/es/bible/293/gen.1.ayop |date=2013-08-02 }} (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quechuan languages==
The [[Catechism]] and the ''[[Doctrina christiana]]'' were published in 1584, shortly after Spanish conquest, in a version in [[Classical Quechua|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] approved by the Council of Lima (Ciudad de los Reyes) in 1583,&lt;ref&gt;Doctrina Christiana y Catecismo para instrucción de los Indios, ya de las demás personas, que han de ser enseñadas en nuestra sancta Fé. Con un confessionario, y otras cosas necessarias para los que doctrinan, que se contienen en la pagina siguiente. Compuesto por auctoridad del concilio provincial, que se celebró en la Ciudad de los Reyes, el año de 1583. Y por la misma traduzido en las dos lenguas generales, de este Reyno, Quichua, y Aymara. Impresso con licencia de la Real Audiencia, en la Ciudad de los Reyes, por Antonio Ricardo primero Impressor en estos Reynos del Piru. Año de MDLXXXIIII. 1584. For the Quechua translation of the [[Lord's Prayer]], see [http://www.runasimi.de/yayayku2.htm#dcr1584 Runasimi.de: Yayayku].&lt;/ref&gt; but attempts to translate the Bible into these languages were suppressed by the Spanish authorities and the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;F. Rodríguez Molinero, J. L. Vicente Castro: ''Bernardino de Sahagún, primer antropólogo en Nueva España''. Universidad de Salamanca, 1986, {{ISBN|847481412X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn0GOfLtTFMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=bernardino+biblia+nahuatl&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VfLuUNLiK8rBhAfS9oGAAQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=bernardino%20biblia%20nahuatl&amp;f=false p. 152].&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 19th century missionaries began to translate the [[New Testament]] into Quechua. In 1822 the Scottish baptist pastor [[James Thompson (pastor)|James Thompson]] planned to translate the whole Bible into Quechua and [[Aymara language|Aymara]]. During the Peruvian war of independence he was called by [[José de San Martín]] to Peru in 1822. From 1822 to 1824 together with a team of four translators he translated the New Testament into Quechua, but due to the war the manuscript was lost in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Iglesias Evangélicas de Chile (2013): [http://www.iglesiasevangelicas.cl/index.php/cultura-evangelica/86-biografias/99-diego-thompson Diego Thompson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906111242/http://www.iglesiasevangelicas.cl/index.php/cultura-evangelica/86-biografias/99-diego-thompson |date=2014-09-06 }} (alias James Thompson)&lt;/ref&gt; So the first book of the Bible to be published in Quechua was the [[Gospel of John]] in [[Classical Quechua]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Apunchis Yesus-Kiristup, Santu Yoancama ehuangeliun; Santo evangelio de nuestro Señor Jesu-Cristo según San Juan.

A revision of the Turner 'Classical' (Cuzco) Quechua version, prepared by George Allan, Antonio Salazar, and Moisés Orruel. ABS, New York 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1917 and 1929, parts of the Bible in [[South Bolivian Quechua]] and Spanish were published: a bilingual Quechua-Spanish edition of the four Gospels in 1917, a bilingual [[New Testament]] in 1922&lt;ref&gt;''Tahua evangeliocuna apostolcunaj ruaskasnin.

In 1923 the first translation of the four Gospels into a [[Central Quechua]] dialect appeared in [[Huallaga Quechua]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Apunchic Jesucristoc Chuscu Evangeliocuna o sea los cuatro Evangelios traducidos al Quechua de los departamentos de Huanuco-Ancash, junto con el correspondiente Castellano.

It was not until the last quarter of the 20th century that translations of the whole Bible from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] into Quechua were done, but since then several Quechua Bible translations have been completed. Most work has been done by Protestant groups with international support, but two Catholic translations have also appeared. The first translation of the whole Old and New Testament into Quechua, but without [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonicals]], was published in 1986 in Bolivian Quechua.&lt;ref&gt;''Qheshwa Biblia''.

Casa de la Biblia, 2010. 1903 pp. {{ISBN|9972985830}}, 9789972985836&lt;/ref&gt; which was realized under the guidance of the [[Wycliffe Translators|Wycliffe Translator]] and linguist David Weber of [[SIL International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casadelabiblia.org/2009/04/23/muy-pronto-la-biblia-del-huallaga/ Muy pronto La Biblia del Huallaga]. La Casa de la Biblia, 23 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], two translations of the whole Bible including the Deuterocanonicals into Quechua and [[Kichwa]] have been done, both published as bilingual Quechua-Spanish editions. In contrast to the other Bible translations into Quechua, no reference to a specific variety (language according to [[SIL International]]) has been made. First Catholic translations of the four Gospels were published as bilingual Quechua-Spanish editions in 1972 in [[Kichwa language|Quichua of Ecuador]], translated under the guidance of the bishop of Riobamba, [[Leonidas Proaño]],&lt;ref&gt;Jesucristopaj Alli Huillai Evangelio Nishca. Los Evangelios en Quichua. Editorial Don Bosco, Quito 1972. 437 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and, including the [[Acts of the Apostles]], in 1974 in [[Southern Quechua|Quechua of Southern Peru]], translated under the bishops of [[Abancay]] and [[Huancavelica]], [[Enrique Pélach y Feliu]] and [[William Dermott Molloy McDermott]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos Evangelios y Hechos de los Apóstoles: Primera versión católica en quechua y castellano. Chainatan Cuyahuarccanchic. Editorial Andina, Lima 1974. 494 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the Catholic missionary [[Bernarda Ortiz]] (“Coronita”), later the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] priest [[Antonio Brescuani]] and the [[Jesuits]] Miguel and Francisco Ramos in cooperation with indigenous Christians speaking several dialects of [[Kichwa]], started in [[Latacunga]] to translate the Bible into Kichwa of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/01/03/1/1363/biblia-quichua-pachacamac-quillcashca-shimi.html Biblia en quichua 'Pachacámac Quillcashca Shimi'].

[[Florencio Coronado]] in Huancavelica translated the Bible into Quechua, which appeared in 2002 as a bilingual edition, with the support of the bishop of Huancavelica Mons. Dermott Molloy.&lt;ref&gt;Sagrada Biblia quechua-castellano. Edición quechua realizada por Mons. Florencio Coronado C.Ss.R.

Dickinson Press, Grand Rapids (Michigan, USA) 2002. 2500 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other modern translators, Coronado used the New [[Vulgate]] for his translation. Both these Catholic translations are written in a Hispanic orthography. There is also a translation of the four Gospels by the priests of the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]] (province of Peru) [[Hilario Huanca Mamani]] und [[Hermann Wendling]] into [[Puno Quechua]] of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698669191.doc Mateopaq qelqasqan evangelio (doc)] [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698669192.pdf (pdf)], [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698658901.doc Marcospaq qelqasqan evangelio (doc)] [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698658902.pdf (pdf)], [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698667011.doc Lucaspaq qelqasqan evangelio (doc)], [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698671361.doc Juanpaq qelqasqan evangelio (doc)] [http://sscc.pe/archivos/13698671362.pdf (pdf)], Griego simimanta runa simiman t’ikrasqa Puno hap’iypi tiyaq runamasikunapaq, 2007.

The '''clurichaun''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|uː|r|ᵻ|k|ɔː|n}}) or clúrachán (from {{lang-ga|clobhair-ceann}}&lt;ref name=Yeats&gt;[[W. B. Yeats|Yeats, W. B.]] (1888). ''Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry''. London: Walter Scott. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a mischievous [[fairy]] in [[Irish mythology|Irish folklore]] known for his great love of drinking and a tendency to haunt [[wine cellar]]s.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is related to the [[leprechaun]] and has sometimes been conflated with him as a [[shoemaker]] and a guardian of hidden treasure.&lt;ref name=Briggs2&gt;Briggs (1976), pp. 264–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some [[folkloristics|folklorists]] to suppose that the clurichaun is merely a leprechaun on a [[binge drinking|drinking spree]],&lt;ref name=Yeats/&gt; while others regard them as regional variations of the same being.&lt;ref&gt;Croker, Thomas Crofton (1844, 1825). ''Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (Vol. 1)''. Lea and Blanchard. p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the leprechaun the clurichaun is a solitary fairy, encountered alone rather than in groups, as distinct from the [[Classifications of fairies|trooping fairies]].&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

==Folklore==
In the [[folklore|folktale]] "The Haunted Cellar", recorded by [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] in 1825, a clurichaun named Naggeneen haunts the wine cellar of an [[Ireland|Irish]] lord, drinking everything in sight and playing frightening pranks on the servants. He is described as a little man measuring six inches in height with a face like a withered apple. He has twinkling eyes and a nose that is red and purple from heavy drinking. He wears a red nightcap, a short leather apron, light blue stockings, and shoes with large silver buckles. When he is discovered by the master of the house, Naggeneen talks him out of moving elsewhere by implying that he would simply move with him.&lt;ref&gt;Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 63–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other descriptions have him wearing red like other solitary fairies.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanlon&gt;[[John O'Hanlon (writer)|O'Hanlon, John]] (1870). ''Irish Folk Lore''. Cameron &amp; Ferguson. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another tale, "Master and Man", a young man named Billy Mac Daniel is on his way home one winter night when he is offered a glass of [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] by a clurichaun to warm himself. He takes the drink but when he refuses to pay for it he is compelled by the clurichaun to serve him for seven years and a day. Billy, however, is eventually able to break his servitude by invoking the blessing of God. In this story, the clurichaun is able to pass through keyholes to invade homes and wine cellars and can transform [[bog]] [[Juncaceae|rushes]] into horses to be used as mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 70–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Clurichauns can also fly through the air on rushes similar to [[witchcraft|witches]] and their broomsticks.&lt;ref&gt;Croker, Thomas Crofton (1828). ''Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland (Vol. 3)''. John Murray. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Keightley]] in his ''Fairy Mythology'' (1828) presents the story of a clurichaun named Little Wildbean who was more helpful than others of his kind, but also quick to anger and violence when slighted. He haunted the wine cellar of a [[Quakers|Quaker]] gentleman named Harris, and if one of the servants was negligent enough to leave the beer barrel running then Little Wildbean would wedge himself inside to stop the flow until someone came to turn it off. His dinner was left for him in the cellar, but one night the cook left him nothing but part of a herring and some cold potatoes. At midnight Wildbean dragged the cook out of her bed and all the way down the hard cellar stairs, leaving her battered and bruised so that she was bedridden for three weeks. In a common folktale [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] Mr. Harris tried to rid himself of Wildbean by moving elsewhere but decided to turn back when he discovered the clurichaun had moved with him.&lt;ref&gt;Keightley, Thomas (1884, 1828). ''The Fairy Mythology''. London: George Bell &amp; Sons. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklorist Nicholas O'Kearney described the clurichaun in 1855 as follows:

{{cquote|The Clobhair-ceann was another being of the same class: he was a jolly, red-faced, drunken little fellow, and was ever found in the cellars of the debauchee, [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]-like, astride of the wine-butt with a brimful tankard in hand, drinking and singing away merrily. Any wine cellar known to be haunted by this sprite was doomed to bring its owner to speedy ruin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=O'Kearney |editor-first=Nicholas |title=Transactions of the Ossianic Society, for the year 1854. Vol. II. Feis Tithe Chonain. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkQIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Clobhar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JwrnrQ-Q-9&amp;sig=GWGCB_6AHpwquWzbIfFrjo9U3pc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JgWkUoepConroATA4oCABA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Clobhar&amp;f=true |location=Dublin |publisher=The Ossianic Society |publication-date=1855 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]] stated that he was "a kind of [[buttery (room)|buttery]] spirit, feasting himself in the cellars of drunkards or scaring dishonest servants who steal the wine."&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

He is also described as a trickster and practical joker, and a disturber of order and quietness in a household, making noise day and night. Despite his often troublesome nature, the clurichaun takes special care of the family to whom he has attached himself, endeavoring to protect their property and lives provided he is not interfered with. This dual nature makes him similar to the domestic [[hobgoblin]].&lt;ref name=Hanlon/&gt;

Besides his love of drinking, the clurichaun also enjoys pipe smoking, and the small disposable clay pipes known as "fairy pipes" that are often found while digging or plowing are said to belong to him. He also knows the secret of making beer from [[Ericaceae|heather]].&lt;ref name=Croker2&gt;Croker (1828), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate spellings include '''cluracan''',&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt; '''cluracaun''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Evans-Wentz|Evans-Wentz, Walter]] (1911). ''The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries''. Henry Frowde, Oxford University Press. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; '''cluricaun''',&lt;ref&gt;Frost, William Henry (1900). ''Fairies and Folk of Ireland''. Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''cluricaune'''.&lt;ref&gt;Croker (1844, 1825), p. 63–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clurichauns and leprechauns==
Though generally regarded as separate beings, certain characteristics of the leprechaun have sometimes been merged with those of the clurichaun, particularly as a shoemaker and treasure guardian.&lt;ref name=Briggs2/&gt; The clurichaun is sometimes portrayed wearing a leather apron with hammer in hand, whistling as he works on a little shoe.&lt;ref name=Croker3&gt;Croker (1844, 1825), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; He also carries a magical purse with varying properties. It may contain a [[shilling]] (known as the "lucky shilling" or ''spre na skillenagh'') that always returns to the purse no matter how often it is spent,&lt;ref name=Croker2/&gt; or it may always be full of money, and for this reason mortals will often try to capture the clurichaun.&lt;ref name=Croker3/&gt; Even if he is caught he has the power to vanish if he can make his captor look away even for an instant.&lt;ref name=Croker4&gt;Croker (1828), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently carries two such purses, one containing the magic shilling and the other containing a normal copper coin, and if captured he will present the latter before vanishing.&lt;ref name=Croker2/&gt; Like the leprechaun he is sometimes said to have knowledge of hidden treasure and can be forced to reveal its location. In such instances one of his tricks is to create the illusion of multiple treasure markers so that the seeker will not know its exact whereabouts.&lt;ref name=Croker4/&gt;

==Literature==
A clurichaun named Kweequel is a prominent character in the first story of the book ''Four Different Faces'' by C.J. Cala.&lt;ref&gt;Cala, C.J. (2014). [https://books.google.com/books?id=w7AtBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Four Different Faces''] p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clurichaun appears as a regular character (under the name Cluracan) in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s acclaimed comic series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' and its spin-off series ''[[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]]''. Cluracan continues the tradition of constant drunkenness but is portrayed as a tall, elegant blond fairy.

The clurichaun Naggeneen ("a little drink") magically associates himself with "Mary's Place", the successor to [[Callahan's_Crosstime_Saloon|Callahan's Bar]] in [[Spider Robinson]]'s stories. The word is spelled 'cluricaune' there. 'Naggeneen' is used in place of his [[True_name#Folklore|true name]] which is unwise for magical beings to reveal. Naggeneen saves the bar from bankruptcy through his ability to drink tremendous quantities of alcohol—and to pay for it honestly.

'''Dwarbasini''' ("দ্বারবাসিনী") is a [[Shakti]] goddess. She is the form of goddess [[Durga]]. The Dwarbasini temple is situated on the bank of [[Dwarka River]] and at the end of [[Deucha]]-Boliharpur road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bristii.wapka.mobi/site_39.xhtml |title=DWARBASINI TEMPLE |first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here 
[[Dwarka River]] is flowing twords north, and according to [[tantra]] '''Dwarbasini''' is a [[shakti]]pith.

==Etymology==
From a folk story we get the name of 'Raja Umacharan Roy'. He was a great devotee of the goddess 'Dwarbasini' ani had died by [[Santhal people|Santhal]]s at [[Santhal rebellion]]. He had donated lands to allocate flowers, woods, rices, sweets, milk etc at the village [[chondrapur]]([[Chondrapur|চন্দ্রপুর]])&lt;ref&gt;folk story&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Goddess Dwarbasini is a stone idol with no image. She here is goddess [[Durga]] with [[Laxmi]], [[Saraswati]], [[Kartikeya|Kartik]], and [[Ganesha]].  This temple was built near about 30 years ago. Before this temple was made, Dwarbasini was covered with the [[bamboo]] umbrella, made by [[Santhal people|Santhal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Subrata Majumdar, maternal relation with Dwarbasini priest family&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Dwarbasini is a 'sini' goddess like palashbasini, duarsini etc. Probably she was worshiped by [[Santhals]], and pahria [[Mal (caste)|Mal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;birbhumer katha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
From a folk story we have the name of 'Raja Umacharan Roy'. He was a great devotee of goddess 'Dwarbasini'. He had no son. So he had adopted a son who was the forefather of the '[[Banerjee|Bondopadhaya]]' priest family. At the time of [[Santhal rebellion|The santhal Rebellion]] Umacharan had killed by [[Santhal people|santhal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;folk story and 'kursinama' of priest family&lt;/ref&gt;

{{zoroastrianism}}
The '''Gathas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɑː|t|ə|z|,_|-|t|ɑː|z}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gatha "Gatha"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are 17 [[Avestan language|Avestan]] [[hymn]]s believed to have been composed by [[Zoroaster|Zarathusthra (Zoroaster)]] himself. They form the core of  the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] liturgy (the [[Yasna]]). They are arranged in five different modes or metres.

The Avestan term ''{{lang|ae|gāθā}}'' (𐬔𐬁𐬚𐬁 "hymn", but also "mode, metre") is cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[gatha|gāthā́]]'' (गाथा), both from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] word ''*gaHtʰáH'', from the root ''*gaH-'' "to sing".

== Structure and organization ==
The Gathas are in verse, metrical in the nature of ancient [[proto-Iranian|Iranian]] religious poetry, that is extremely terse, and in which grammatical constructs are an exception.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The 17 hymns of the Gathas consist of 238 [[stanza]]s, of about 1300 lines or 6000 words in total. They were later incorporated into the 72-chapter ''[[Yasna]]'' (chapter: ''ha'' or ''had'', from the [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''ha'iti'', 'cut'), that in turn is the primary liturgical collection of texts within the greater compendium of the [[Avesta]]. The 17 hymns are identified by their chapter numbers in the ''Yasna'', and are divided into five major sections:
{|
|-
|28–34 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Ahunavaiti'' Gatha || &amp;nbsp; || (cf. [[Ahuna Vairya]]), 100 stanzas, (3 verses, 7+9 syllable meter)
|-
|43–46 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Ushtavaiti'' Gatha     || &amp;nbsp; || 'Having Happiness', 66 stanzas (5 verses, 4+7 syllable meter)
|-
|47–50 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Spenta Mainyu'' Gatha  || &amp;nbsp; || 'Bounteous Spirit', 41 stanzas (4 verses, 4+7 syllable meter)
|-
|   51 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Vohu Khshathra'' Gatha || &amp;nbsp; || 'Good Dominion', 22 stanzas (3 verses, 7+7 syllable meter)
|-
|   53 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Vahishto Ishti'' Gatha || &amp;nbsp; || 'Best Beloved&lt;!-- or Desired --&gt;', 9 stanzas (4 verses, two of 7+5 and two of 7+7+5 syllables)
|-
|   54 || &amp;nbsp; || ''Airyaman ishya'' Gatha || &amp;nbsp; || 'The invocation of the divinity Airyaman'
|}

With the exception of ''Ahunavaiti'' Gatha, that is named after the ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' prayer (''Yasna'' 27, not in the Gathas), the names of the Gathas reflect the first word(s) of the first hymn within them. The meter of the hymns is historically related to the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] ''tristubh-jagati'' family of meters.&lt;ref name="Schlerath_1969"&gt;{{citation|last=Schlerath|first=Bernfried|title=Der Terminus aw. Gāθā|journal=Münchener Studien zur Sprachwissenschaft|volume=25|year=1969|pages=99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hymns of these meters are recited, not sung.

The sequential order of the Gathas is structurally interrupted by the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'' ("seven-chapter ''Yasna''", chapters 35–41, linguistically as old as the Gathas but in prose) and by two other minor hymns at ''Yasna'' 42 and 52.

== Language ==
The language of the Gathas, ''Gathic'' or ''Old'' [[Avestan language|Avestan]], belongs to the old [[Iranian languages|Iranian language group]] that is a sub-group of Eastern families of the [[Indo-European languages]]. The dependency on Vedic Sanskrit is a significant weakness in the interpretation of the Gathas, as the two languages, though from a common origin, had developed independently. [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] era translations and commentaries (the ''[[Zend]]'') have been used to interpret the Gathas, but by the 3rd century the Avestan language was virtually extinct, and a dependency on the medieval texts is often discouraged as the commentaries are frequently conjectural. While some scholars argue that an interpretation using younger texts is inadvisable ([[Karl Friedrich Geldner|Geldner]], [[Helmut Humbach|Humbach]]), others argue that such a view is excessively skeptical ([[Friedrich von Spiegel|Spiegel]], [[James Darmesteter|Darmesteter]]). The risks of misinterpretation are real, but lacking alternates, such dependencies are perhaps necessary.

"The [[Middle Persian]] translation seldom offers an appropriate point of departure for a detailed scholarly approach to the Gathas, but an intensive comparison of its single lines and their respective glosses with their Gathic originals usually reveals the train of thought of the translator. This obviously reflects the Gatha interpretation by the priests of the [[Sasanian]] period, the general view of which is closer to the original than what is sometimes taught about the Gathas in our time."&lt;ref name="EI_Humbach"&gt;{{Citation|last=Humbach|first=Helmut|title=Gathas: The texts|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=10|year=2001|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gathas-i-texts|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four monumental English translations of the Gathas worth noting{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}: The earlier James Darmesteter version (''Le Zend-Avesta'', 1892–1893&lt;!--; translated from the French by [[Lawrence Heyworth Mills]] in [[Sacred Books of the East|SBE]] 31'', 1887--&gt;) that is based on a translation "from below", that is, based on the later middle Persian commentaries and translations. The other three are Christian Bartholomae's ''Die Gathas des Awesta'' (1905, Strassburg: Trübner), Helmut Humbach's ''The Gathas of Zarathushtra'' (1959, Heidelberg: Winter), and Stanley Isler's ''The Gathas of Zarathustra'' (1975, Acta Iranica IV, Leiden: Brill). These three texts exploit the "Vedic" approach, and Bartholomae's was the first of its kind.

The problems that face a translator of the Avestan Gathas are significant: "No one who has ever read a stanza of [the Gathas] in the original will be under any illusions as to the labour that underlies the effort [of translating the hymns]. The most abstract and perplexing thought, veiled further by archaic language, only half understood by later students of the seer's own race and tongue, tends to make the Gathas the hardest problem to be attempted by those who would investigate the literary monuments."&lt;ref name=Moulton_on_Bartholomae&gt;{{citation|last=Moulton|first=James Hope|title=Bartholomae's Lexicon and Translation of the Gathas (Review)|journal=The Classical Review|volume=20|issue=9|year=1906|pages=471–472|doi=10.1017/s0009840x00995398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Some of the verses of the Gathas are directly addressed to the Omniscient Creator [[Ahura Mazda]]. These verses, devotional in character, expound on the divine essences of truth (''[[Asha]]''), the good-mind (''[[Vohu Manah]]''), and the spirit of righteousness. Some other verses are addressed to the public that may have come to hear the prophet, and in these he verses, he exhorts his audience to live a life as Ahura Mazda has directed, and pleads to Ahura Mazda to intervene on their behalf.

Other verses, from which some aspects of Zoroaster's life have been inferred, are semi-(auto)biographical, but all revolve around Zarathustra's mission to promote his view of the Truth (again ''[[Asha]]''). For instance, some of the passages describe Zarathustra's first attempts to promote the teachings of Ahura Mazda, and the subsequent rejection by his kinsmen. This and other rejection led him to have doubts about his message, and in the Gathas he asked for assurance from Ahura Mazda, and requests repudiation of his opponents.

Aspects of Zoroastrian philosophy are distributed over the entire collection of Gathas. There is no systematic arrangement of doctrine in the texts.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Excerpts ==
&lt;small&gt;''The following excerpts are from the translation by ''Humbach &amp; Ichaporia.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{citation|last=Humbach|first=Helmut|first2=Pallan|last2=Ichaporia|title=The Heritage of Zarathustra, A new translation of his Gathas|publisher=Winter|location=Heidelberg|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Zoroaster asks Mazda for guidance
* Where and which part of land shall I go to succeed?  They keep me away from the family and the tribe. The community that I wish to join does not gratify me, nor do the deceitful tyrants of the lands. How shall I gratify you, [[Ahura Mazda|O Mazda Ahura]]? (46.1)

;Zoroaster asks Mazda for blessings
* I approach you with good thought, O Mazda Ahura, so that you may grant me (the blessing) of two existences (i.e. physically and mentally), the material and that of thought, the blessing emanating from Truth, with which one can put (your) support in comfort. (28.2)
* With these entreaties, O Mazda Ahura, may we not anger you, nor [[Asha|Truth]] or [[Vohu Manah|Best Thought]], we who are standing at the offering of praises to you. You are the swiftest (bringer of) invigorations, and (you hold) the power over benefits.
* I ask you, O Ahura, about the punishment for the evil-doer who delegates power to the deceitful one and who does not find a livelihood without injury to the cattle and men of undeceiving herdsman.
* Grant us (a share) of it both this (material) existence and the spiritual one, that (share) of it through which we may come (and be in) Your shelter and that of [[Asha|Truth]], for all time. (41.6)
* Let good rulers assume rule (over us), with actions of [[Daena|Good Insight]], O right mindedness.  Let not bad rulers assume rule over us. The best (insight), which purifies progeny for mankind, let it also be applied to the cow.  Her You breed for us for food. (48.5)

;Rhetorical questions posed by Zoroaster
* This I ask you, O Ahura, tell me truly: Of what kind is the first (stage) of [[Asha|Best Existence]]? The desired one who implements it so that we may enjoy benefit, that one indeed, holy through truth, watching with His spirit the outcome left for all, is the healer of existence, (our) ally, (you), O Mazda. (44.2)
* This I ask you, O Ahura, tell me truly: Who, by procreation, is the primal father of [[Asha|Truth]]? Who created the course of the sun and stars? Through whom does the moon waxe and wane?  These very things and others I wish to know, O Mazda. (44.3)

;Zoroaster to his own followers
*[[Asha|Truth]] is best (of all that is) good. As desired, what is being desired is truth for him who (represents) the best truth. (27.14)
* The person who is pure-in-heart towards me, I for my part assign to him the best things in my command, through [[Vohu Manah|Good Thought]], but harm to him who schemes to harm us. O Mazda, thereby gratifying your will by [[Asha|Truth]]. Such is the discrimination made by my intellect and thought.&lt;!--
*** What follows is an excellent translation of the Airyema-Ishyo, but not a good example of a Gathas excerpt ***

;Invocation to the spirit of well being
* Let the vigorous people (of [[Vishtaspa]]) come to support of the men and women of Zarathustra, to the support of good thought, (following) the religious view that will deserve a prize worthy of being chosen.  I ask for the invigorating [[Ashi|Reward of Truth]], which Mazda Ahura has devised. (54.1)
--&gt;

;Zoroaster to the followers of the ''[[druj]]''
* Brilliant things instead of weeping will be ([[ashi|the reward]]) for the person who comes to the [[ashavan|truthful one]]. But a long period of darkness, foul food, and the word 'woe' – to such an existence your religious view will lead you, O deceitful ones, of your own actions. (31.20)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20056">[[File:St Maria Sehnde Gottesdienst.jpg|thumb|Genuflection on one knee, during a Catholic Mass]]

'''Genuflection''' or '''genuflexion''' is the act of bending at least one knee to the ground. From early times, it has been a gesture of deep respect for a superior. Today, the gesture is common in the Christian religious practices of the [[Anglican Church]],&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; [[Lutheran Church]],&lt;ref name=Armstrong/&gt; [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name=Ingram/&gt; and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=SMPC/&gt; The [[Latin]] word ''genuflectio'', from which the English word is derived, originally meant [[kneeling]] rather than the rapid dropping to one knee and immediately rising that became customary in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]]. It is often referred to as "going down on one knee" or "bowing the knee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saintpaul.episcopaloklahoma.org/About%20US/the-sign-of-the-cross-bowing-and-genuflecting-what |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210613/http://saintpaul.episcopaloklahoma.org/About%20US/the-sign-of-the-cross-bowing-and-genuflecting-what|archive-date=18 February 2018|dead-url=no|title=The Sign of the Cross, bowing and genuflecting, what is it? |newspaper=Saint Paul's Episcopal Church|location=Oklahoma, US |date=  |author= |accessdate= 10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mrs. Reagan.jpg|thumb|left|Capt. [[James Symonds|James A. Symonds]], Commanding Officer of the [[USS Ronald Reagan]], presenting the former President's casket flag to former [[First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]]]]
In 328 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] introduced into his court-etiquette some form of genuflection already in use in [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=S-cTfNjEhrcC&amp;pg=PA103 Andrew Chugg, ''Alexander's Lovers'']  {{ISBN|978-1-4116-9960-1}}, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Byzantine Empire]] even senators were required to genuflect to the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pK1NsxtW0dcC&amp;pg=PA101 James Allan Stewart Evans, ''The Age of Justinian''] {{ISBN|978-0-415-23726-0}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, one demonstrated respect for a king or noble by going down on one knee, often remaining there until told to rise.  It is traditionally often performed in western cultures by a man making a [[proposal of marriage]].

The custom of genuflecting, as a sign of respect and even of service, arose out of the honor given to medieval kings. In modern times, when the folded flag of a fallen veteran is offered to the family, the presenting officer will go down on his left knee, if the recipient is seated.&lt;ref name=Compass/&gt;

== In Christianity ==
Genuflection, typically on one knee, still plays a part in the [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox]] traditions, among other churches; it is different from kneeling in prayer, which is more widespread.

Those for whom the gesture is difficult, such as the aged or those in poor physical condition, are not expected to perform it. 

Except for those people, genuflection is still today mandatory in some situations, such as (in the Catholic Church) when passing in front of the Blessed Sacrament, or during the Consecration in the Mass.

=== In front of the Blessed Sacrament ===
Genuflection is a sign of reverence to the Blessed Sacrament. Its purpose is to allow the worshipper to engage his whole person in acknowledging the presence of and to honor Jesus Christ in the Holy Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysgloucestercity.org/genuflection|title=St Mary's Roman Catholic Church|website=www.stmarysgloucestercity.org|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is customary to genuflect whenever one comes into or leaves the presence of the Blessed Sacrament reserved in the Tabernacle. "This venerable practice of genuflecting before the Blessed Sacrament, whether enclosed in the tabernacle or publicly exposed, as a sign of adoration, ...requires that it be performed in a recollected way.

Genuflection to the [[Blessed Sacrament]], the consecrated [[Eucharist]], especially when arriving or leaving its presence, is a practice in the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=John|title=Desmond Tutu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3P9AAItwS0C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=genuflecting+Anglican&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gcM26l2L8w&amp;sig=PHTrc0juF9l1K6VCsAnMpI37Slo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MH5aUNX3HujgyQGWuIGQCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=genuflecting%20Anglican&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=1556527985|quote=Devout "high church" Anglicans genuflect as they pass the reserved sacrament.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Latin Rite]] [[Catholic Church]],&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ingram |first1=Kristen Johnson |last2=Johnson|first2=Kristin J |title=Beyond Words|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsOehcciTHkC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=8 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=0819219738|page=27|quote=Episcopalians, Roman Catholics, and Lutherans may already take their souls through the slow dance of the Eucharist, kneeling, standing, genuflecting, making the sign of the cross, walking forward to receive the body and blood, walking back to the pew, standing for the last hymn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lutheran Church]],&lt;ref name=Armstrong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=John H.|last2=Eagle |first2=Paul E.|title=Understanding Four Views on the Lord's Supper |date=26 May 2009|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=0310542758|quote=Lutherans worship Christ wherever he is, including the sacraments, and thus Luther genuflected before the baptismal font and the sacrament.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Western Rite Orthodoxy|Western Rite Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=SMPC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernorthodox.com/stmark/customs|title=Customs - Western Orthodox|publisher=Saint Mark's Parish Church|language=English|accessdate=29 March 2015|quote=To "genuflect" (kneel down briefly and then arise) is the Western Orthodox way of venerating the sacrament or the altar. To take your place in church, walk quietly down the center aisle, and then genuflect before moving to the left or right into the pew. The same is done when leaving the pew, either to go up to communion or to leave after the service is over. The clergy and faithful also genuflect or bow when passing by the vessel in which the blessed sacrament is reserved. Another time to genuflect is at these words of the creed: "Who for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man."}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a comparatively modern replacement for the profound bow of head and body that remains the supreme act of liturgical reverence in the East.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06423a.htm Bergh, Frederick Thomas. "Genuflexion." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 7 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Since in many Anglican, Roman Catholic and Western Orthodox Churches the Blessed Sacrament is normally present behind the altar, genuflection is usual when arriving or passing in front of the altar at the communion rail. When genuflecting, making the sign of the cross is optional&lt;ref name=Schulman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsccatl.com/Growing-in-Faith/Why-Do-Catholics-Do-That|title=Why Do Catholics Do That - Holy Spirit Church|website=www.hsccatl.com|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, the [[Sign of the Cross]] usually ends with a genuflection in the same direction of the [[Blessed Sacrament]].



Only during the later Middle Ages, centuries after it had become customary to genuflect to persons in authority such as bishops, was genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament introduced. The practice gradually spread and became viewed as obligatory only from the end of the fifteenth century, receiving formal recognition in 1502. The raising of the consecrated Host and Chalice after the Consecration in order to show them to the people was for long unaccompanied by obligatory genuflections.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The requirement that genuflection take place on both knees before the Blessed Sacrament when it is unveiled as at Expositions (but not when it is lying on the [[corporal (liturgy)|corporal]] during Mass)&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; was altered in 1973 with introduction of the following rule: "Genuflection in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, whether reserved in the [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]] or exposed for public adoration, is on one knee."&lt;ref&gt;''De Sacra Communione et de Cultu Mysterii Eucharistici extra Missam'', 84&lt;/ref&gt; "Since a genuflection is, per se, an act of adoration, the general liturgical norms no longer make any distinction between the mode of adoring Christ reserved in the tabernacle or exposed upon the altar. The simple single genuflection on one knee may be used in all cases."&lt;ref name=zenit/&gt; However, in some countries the [[episcopal conference]] has chosen to retain the double genuflection to the Blessed Sacrament, which is performed by kneeling briefly on both knees and reverently bowing the head with hands joined.&lt;ref name=zenit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur92.htm|title=Tabernacles, Adoration and Double Genuflections|website=www.ewtn.com|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] practice===
Although prayer comes from the heart it is often expressed naturally through the body. Genuflection is an act of personal piety and is not required by the Prayer Book. In some parishes it is a customary gesture of reverence for Christ's real presence in the consecrated eucharistic elements of bread and wine, particularly in parishes with an Anglo-catholic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/genuflection-or-genuflexion|title=Genuflection, or Genuflexion|date=22 May 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, if the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in the church, it is customary to acknowledge the Lord's presence with a brief act of worship on entering or leaving the building: normally, a genuflection in the direction of the place of reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saintpaul.episcopaloklahoma.org/About%20US/the-sign-of-the-cross-bowing-and-genuflecting-what|title="What is Genuflection?", St. Paul's Episcopla Church, Holdenville, Oklahoma|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Liturgy==
[[File:Roi Manuel agenouillant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Manuel II of Portugal]] during Missa de Campanha, c. 1910]]
The [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] lays down the following rules for genuflections during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]:
:Three genuflections are made by the priest celebrant: namely, after the showing of the host, after the showing of the chalice, and before Communion. Certain specific features to be observed in a concelebrated Mass are noted in their proper place.
:If, however, the tabernacle with the Most Blessed Sacrament is present in the sanctuary, the priest, the deacon, and the other ministers genuflect when they approach the altar and when they depart from the sanctuary, but not during the celebration of Mass itself.
:Otherwise all who pass before the Most Blessed Sacrament genuflect, unless they are moving in procession.
:Ministers carrying the processional cross or candles bow their heads instead of genuflecting.&lt;ref name=GIRM/&gt;

=== Other genuflections in the liturgy ===
In the [[Byzantine Rite]], most widely observed in the [[Orthodox Church]], genuflection plays a smaller role and [[prostration]], known as ''[[proskynesis]]'', is much more common. During the holy mystery of reconciliation, however, following confession of sins, the penitent is to genuflect with head bowed before the [[Gospel Book]] or an [[icon]] of Christ as the confessor - either a bishop or a presbyter - formally declares God's forgiveness.

Genuflection or kneeling is prescribed at various points of the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy, such as after the mention of [[Jesus]]' death on the cross in the readings of the Passion during Holy Week.

A right knee genuflection is made during and after the Adoration of the Cross on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=Compass/&gt;

A genuflection is made at the mention of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in the words ''et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto, ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est'' ("and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man") in the [[Creed]] on the solemnities of [[Christmas]] and the [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref name=Schulman/&gt;

====Tridentine Mass====
In the [[Tridentine Mass]] this genuflection is made on any day on which the Creed is recited at Mass, as well as at several other points:
* at the words ''et Verbum caro factum est'' ("and the Word became flesh")&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|1:1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the prologue of the Gospel of John, which is the usual [[Last Gospel]], as well as the Gospel for the third Mass on Christmas.
* at the words ''et procidentes adoraverunt eum'' ("and falling down they adored him") in the Gospel for the Epiphany, Matthew 2:1-12 (which before 1960 was also the Last Gospel of the third Mass on Christmas)
* at the words ''Adiuva nos ...'' during the (identical) Tract said on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in [[Lent]], except on Ember Wednesday. But no genuflection is envisaged when after Septuagesima the same Tract is used in the votive Mass at a time of Mortality (''Missa votiva tempore mortalitatis'')
* at the words ''et procidens adoravit eum'' ("and falling down he adored him") at the end of the Gospel for Wednesday in the Fourth Week of Lent, John 9:1-38
* at the words ''ut in nomine Iesu omne genu flectatur caelestium, terrestrium et infernorum'' ("that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth") in the Epistle ({{bibleverse||Philippians|2:5-11}}) of Palm Sunday, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September (and also, before 1960, the Feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross on 3 May) and in the Epistle ({{bibleverse||Philippians|2:8-11}}) of the votive Mass of the Passion of the Lord.
* at the words ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus|Veni, sancte Spiritus]]'' in the Alleluia before the Sequence on Pentecost Sunday and the Octave of Pentecost and in the votive Mass of the Holy Spirit

In the [[Maronite Catholic Church]], there is an evocative ceremony of genuflection on the feast of [[Pentecost]]. The congregation genuflects first on the left knee to [[God the Father]], then on the right knee to [[God the Son]], and finally on both knees to [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]].

=== Genuflecting to a bishop ===
From the custom of genuflecting to kings and other nobles arose the custom by which lay people or clergy of lesser rank genuflect to a prelate and kiss his [[ecclesiastical ring|episcopal ring]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reu.org/public/ssbdocs/ssb0003.txt Canons of the Holy Orthodox Church, American Jurisdiction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220010620/http://www.reu.org/public/ssbdocs/ssb0003.txt |date=February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a sign of acceptance of the [[bishop]]'s [[Apostolic succession|apostolic authority as representing Christ]] in the local church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfoMPgke_YAC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22bishop's+ring%22+kiss&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kQvlwg12eq&amp;sig=XzvYCXlJjOqJIAywz8MZ4X_ZAq8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q02YSfvoLYeO0AWX1eG4Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result|title=The Catholic Answer Book|first=Peter M. J.|last=Stravinskas|date=3 March 1994|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor|accessdate=3 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and originally their social position as lords.  Abbots and other senior monastics often received genuflection from their monks and often others. 

Genuflecting before ''greater prelates'' (i.e. Bishops in their own dioceses, Metropolitans in their province, Papal Legates in the territory assigned to them, and Cardinals either outside of Rome or in the church assigned to them in Rome) is treated as obligatory in editions of the ''[[Caeremoniale Episcoporum]]'' earlier than that of 1985;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceremoniaire.net/print/caer_ep/Caeremoniale_Ep-latin.pdf|title=Book 1, chapter XVIII of the 1886 edition|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Liturgy|liturgical]] functions [[Tridentine Mass|according to these prescriptions]], clergy genuflect when passing before such prelates, but an officiating priest and any more junior prelates, canons, etc. substitute a bow of the head and shoulders for the genuflection.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The present Catholic liturgical books exclude genuflecting to a bishop during the liturgy: "A genuflection, made by bending the right knee to the ground, signifies adoration, and therefore it is reserved for the Most Blessed Sacrament, as well as for the Holy Cross from the solemn adoration during the liturgical celebration on [[Good Friday]] until the beginning of the [[Easter]] Vigil."&lt;ref name=GIRM&gt;[http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf The General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 274] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091216/http://www.acbc.catholic.org.au/documents/200707031933.pdf |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But outside of the liturgy some continue to genuflect or kneel to kiss a bishop's ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dappledphotos.blogspot.com/2005/11/baciamano.html Baciamano] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705134743/http://dappledphotos.blogspot.com/2005/11/baciamano.html |date=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is frequently asserted that genuflections are to be made on the left knee when made to merely human authorities,&lt;ref name=Compass&gt;[http://www.thecompassnews.org/2011/03/genuflection-which-knee-is-which/ "Genuflection — which knee is which?", ''The Compass'', March 19, 2011, Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no such prescription in any liturgical book.

'''George Him''', (4 August 1900 – 4 April 1982), was a Polish born British designer responsible for a number of notable posters, book illustrations and advertising campaigns for a wide range of clients.

==Biography==
Him was born '''Jerzy Himmelfarb''' in 1900 to  a Polish-Jewish family in [[Lodz]], which was then in the [[Russian Empire]] and is now in Poland.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After  schooling and further education  in [[Warsaw]] Him studied Roman Law in Moscow but left in 1917 when the [[Russian Revolution]] forced the closure of the university he was attending. He moved to [[Bonn]] and by 1924 had completed a PhD at the [[University of Bonn]] on the comparative history of religions before deciding to study graphic art in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Horne|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1994|title=The Dictionary of 20th Century British Book Illustrators |ISBN=1 85149 1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Him studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Art but even before he graduated in 1928 was already undertaking commercial commissions.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; Him returned to Poland where, in 1933, he changed his name and also established a design partnership with [[Jan Le Witt]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Slocombe|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2014|title=British Posters of the Second World War |ISBN=978-1-904897-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as Lewitt-Him, the two established a distinctive design style which combined cubist and surrealist elements, often in a humorous context.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Their most notable work in Poland were illustrations for an experimental poetry group known as ''Skamander''.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;
[[File:Think Ahead Art.IWMPST8414.jpg|thumb|''Think Ahead Telegraph and Telephone Less'' (Art.IWM PST 8414) (1944) by LeWitt-Him for the [[General Post Office|GPO]] ]]

Him and Le Witt worked together in Poland for several years before, in 1937, they relocated the Lewitt-Him design business to London, following an exhibition of their work there by the publishers Lund Humphries. The pair quickly gained commercial contracts with [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] and [[Imperial Airways]] as well as illustrating children's books, such as ''The Little Red Engine Gets a Name'' (1942) by [[Diana Ross (author)|Diana Ross]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; In London during [[World War II]] the partnership received notable commissions for information and public safety posters from, among others, the [[General Post Office]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt;

Him was naturalized as a British citizen in 1948 and the Lewitt-Him partnership enjoyed great success. Notable commissions included designing the giant umbrella tree for the Wet Weather section of the 1946 ''Britain Can Make It'' exhibition, the [[Guinness]] clock tower for [[Battersea Park]] Pleasure Gardens and murals for the Education Pavilion of the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/collections/design-archives/resources/rdis-at-britain-can-make-it,-1946/george-him |title=George Him|date= |accessdate=1 December 2017|work=University of Brighton Design Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lewitt-Him partnership was dissolved in 1954, when Le Witt decided to focus on developing his abstract paintings and artworks. Him continued to work as a commercial designer. Among the advertising campaigns he illustrated was the 1950s ''Schweppeshire'' campaign for the [[Schweppes]] drinks company.&lt;ref name="RSlocombe"/&gt; Him's other clients numbered several airlines, including [[Pan-American Airways]], [[El Al]] and [[American Overseas Airlines]] plus the publishers of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' and [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt; He continued to illustrate books but also designed exhibition stands, such as the Australia stand at the 1960 [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] and large window displays, notably for the [[De Bijenkorf]] store in [[Rotterdam]] and the 1961 Christmas windows for the [[Design Centre]] in London.&lt;ref name=UOBDAgh/&gt;

From 1969 until 1977, Him taught graphic design at [[Leicester Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Him was an active artist up until the very end of his life. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work have been held, one in 1976 at the [[London College of Printing]] and another in 1978 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; In 1977 Him was awarded the Francis Williams Book Illustration Award and in 1978 became a [[Royal Designer for Industry]].&lt;ref name="Horne"/&gt;

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Hagoth''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|ɡ|ɒ|θ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «hā´gäth»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] ship builder who lived in or around 55 BCE. At least two of the ships he built were lost. The occupants of one ship were presumed drowned. Hagoth and his shipbuilding accomplishments are briefly described in the book of [[Book of Alma|Alma]] in the Book of Mormon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp;5  And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;6  And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;7  And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.&lt;br /&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;8  And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not. ([[Book of Alma|Alma]] 63:5-8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Polynesian Theory ==
Non-scriptural sources suggest that Hagoth led an expedition, sailing into the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the Americas. Some leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Lanier Britsch]] stated in the [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]], "Since the days of George Q. Cannon in Hawaii (1851–54), the Church leaders had more and more frequently alluded to the idea that the Polynesians were descendants of Lehi, the early Book Of Mormon prophet. Although the relationship between the Polynesian peoples and the alleged "adventurer" Hagoth (see Alma 63:5–8) is not clear—he being a Nephite and the Polynesians appearing to be Lamanites—Church leaders have time and time again referred to the Polynesians as children of Lehi."

Many members of the LDS Church in Polynesia have come to believe that Hagoth is their ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;For one [[Mormon]] artists portrayal of Polynesian people as the "Children of Hagoth", see [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2000/12/a-worldwide-look-at-the-book-of-mormon "A Worldwide Look at the Book of Mormon]", ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', December 2000. For a mention of Hagoth being considered a "popular hero" by Polynesian Mormon youth, see Kathleen C. Perrin, [http://www.lds.org/liahona/1994/06/tahitian-pearls "Tahitian Pearls"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'' June 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Mormon scholars largely dismiss this hypothesis, citing genetic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence which indicates that Polynesian peoples come from [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Despite general agreement among scholars that the principal ancestors of Polynesian peoples migrated from Southeast Asia, there are a few evidences of the possibility of contact with peoples in the Western Hemisphere. [[Sweet potato]]es, which are native to South America, are a common traditional staple throughout Polynesia. The [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]&amp;nbsp;word for sweet potato is&amp;nbsp;''kumar'', very&amp;nbsp;similar to the Polynesian word ''kumara'' for the same plant''.'' There is also DNA evidence of contact between Polynesian and South American peoples prior to European contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-11-03|title=Genome-wide Ancestry Patterns in Rapanui Suggest Pre-European Admixture with Native Americans|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982214012202|journal=Current Biology|language=en|volume=24|issue=21|pages=2518–2525|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.09.057|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differentiating between scriptural and apocryphal accounts of Hagoth and his ships, one LDS writer makes the following observations:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Book of Mormon does not equate the "west sea" with the Pacific Ocean. The Book of Mormon does not tell us that Hagoth was on board any of the ships that were lost. Scripture does not say that he captained a vessel or that he was an explorer or an adventurer, or that he led people. For all we can tell, the skilled Hagoth's main objective was to profit from the shipping industry. It is possible for peoples in various places to be related to Hagoth's people (the Nephites) without Hagoth personally making an ocean voyage. Coastal and Island hopping colonies, once associated with Nephite shipping, could have built more vessels and traveled very far. It is also important to realize that the peoples of the Pacific islands may have come from more than one direction.&lt;ref&gt;Coon, W. Vincent, [http://www.bookofmormonpromisedland.com/Q%20&amp;%20A.htm Q &amp; A, “Hagoth’s Lost Ships!”]; additionally, Coon notes that the scriptural use of the term "curious" may mean "accomplished with skill and ingenuity" and  does not necessarily imply an inclination for adventure.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One problem with considering Polynesia to be at least partly peopled by "Nephite" descendants is that the Book of Mormon itself does not insist upon the point, and there is likewise no official doctrine in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] covering it.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3695">'''Herbert Haag''' (born 11 February 1915 in [[Singen am Hohentwiel]], died 23 August 2001 in [[Lucerne]]) was a Swiss Roman Catholic theologian and biblical scholar of German origin.

After studying theology in Paris for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|diocese of Basel]] in 1940, he was ordained a priest and worked for several years as a pastor in Lucerne. In 1942 Haag attained his PhD at the [[University of Fribourg]]. From 1948 to 1960 he taught Old Testament studies at the Theological Faculty of Lucerne, and from 1960 to 1980 he held the chair of Old Testament at the Catholic Theological Faculty at the [[University of Tübingen]]. Haag in particular as biblical scholars and exegete known, among other things, he published a well-known Bible dictionary. He also criticized dogmas of the church doctrine, such as [[original sin]], [[apostolic succession]], [[homosexuality]], [[celibacy of the clergy]] and the ban on the [[ordination of women]]. In his last years he emerged as a critic of the institutional church.

In 1981, he signed an open letter to Swiss newspapers contending that a wrong had been done to [[Hans Küng]] in 1979, when a Vatican decree stripped the church's recognition of Küng as a Catholic theologian due to his critique of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/30/world/herbert-haag-86-priest-who-challenged-vatican.html|title = Herbert Haag, 86, Priest Who Challenged Vatican|website = The New York Times|first = Eric|last = Pace|date = August 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, he established the Herbert Haag Foundation for "freedom in the Church", which awards the Herbert Haag Prize.

==History ==
After [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act]] in the [[British Empire]], the need for labor led to the recruitment of Indians in Guyana and other [[British West Indies|British West Indian]] territories. Upon arrival, the new workers had to adapt to the extreme tropical conditions, along with their new contracts and working conditions. Between 1835 and 1918, 341,600 indentured laborers were imported into British Guyana from India.&lt;ref&gt;Despres, Leo, "Differential Adaptions and Micro-Cultural Evolution in Guyana," ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'', 25:1, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1852, Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the [[Indentured servitude|indenture]] period, but this met with little success. When Christian missionaries started proselytizing, [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] started administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste. This led to the breakdown of the caste system there.

In the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. In 1910, [[Arya Samaj]] arrived in Guyana. Samaj's doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and discrimination against Hindus diminished. 

[[Arya Samaj]] followers often did not get along with [[Sanātanī]]s (orthodox [[Hindus]]). The salience of these differences ebbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_South_America|title=Hinduism in South America - Wikipedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyanaundersiege.com/cultural/hindus%20of%20south%20america.htm |title=Hindus of South America |publisher=Guyanaundersiege.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Hinduism has been decreasing for many decades. In 1991, 35.0% of the Guyanese population adhered to Hinduism, decreasing to 28.4% in 2002&lt;ref name="gov.gy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter2_Population_Composition.pdf |title=Chapter Ii |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 24.8% in 2012.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

[[File:2 mid temple 8.JPG|thumb|300px|Sri Sundareswarara Temple is a South Indian style Hindu temple in Malaysia.]][[Hinduism]] is the fourth largest religion in '''Malaysia'''.

Most Malaysian Hindus are settled in western parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The Malaysian state with highest percentage of state's population as Hindus, according to 2010 Census, is [[Negeri Sembilan]] (13.4%), followed by [[Selangor]] (11.6%), [[Perak]] (10.9%) and Federal Territory of [[Kuala Lumpur]] (8.5%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristics 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011081938/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }} Department of Statistics, Government of Malaysia (2011), Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The state with least percentage of Hindu population is [[Sabah]] (0.1%).

Indians, along with other ethnic groups such as Chinese, began arriving in Malaysia in ancient and medieval era. In 2010, Malaysian Census reported there were 1.91 million citizens of Indian ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf Population Distribution and Basic Demographic Characteristics 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011081938/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf |date=11 October 2012 }} Department of Statistics, Government of Malaysia (2011), Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; About 1.64 million of Indian ethnic group Malaysians (86%) are Hindus.

Malaysia gained its independence from British colonial empire in 1957, thereafter declared its official state religion as Islam, and adopted a constitution that is mixed. On one hand, it protects freedom of religion (such as practice of Hinduism), but on the other hand Malaysian constitution also restricts religious freedom.&lt;ref name=2011report/&gt;&lt;ref name=gandg&gt;Gill &amp; Gopal, Understanding Indian Religious Practice in Malaysia, J Soc Sci, 25(1-2-3): 135-146 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Lee, Patterns of Religious Tension in Malaysia, Asian Survey, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Apr., 1988), pp. 400-418&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, there have been increasing reports of religious persecution of Hindus, along with other minority religions, by various state governments of Malaysia and its [[Sharia]] courts.&lt;ref name=2011report&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/502105a42d.html 2011 Report on International Religious Freedom - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/222357.pdf Religious Freedom Report 2013 - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu temples built on private property, and built long before Malaysian independence, have been demolished by Malaysian government officials in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208456.pdf Religious Freedom Report 2012 - Malaysia] U.S. State Department (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{POV|date=May 2017}}
Similar to the [[Indonesian Archipelago]], the native [[Malay people|Malays]] practised an indigenous [[animism]] and dynamism beliefs before the arrival of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]].
[[File:Lord Subrahmanya Malaysia.JPG|thumb|A Golden Lord Murugan Statue viewed from the ground before entering the Hindu Batu Cave temple.]]
It is unclear when the first Indian voyages across the [[Bay of Bengal]] occurred. Conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals to Malay shores at least 1,700 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Malaysia|page=14 |author=Barbara Watson Andaya, Leonard Y. Andaya |isbn=0-333-27672-8 |id={{ISBN|0-333-27672-8}}|year= 1984|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Lonndon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of the Malay world into contact with [[Hinduism]]. Thus, [[Hinduism]], Indian cultural traditions and the [[Sanskrit]] language began to spread across the land. Temples were built in the Indian style and local kings began referring to themselves as ''[[Raja]]'' and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.&lt;ref name="Zaki Ragman page 1-6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gateway to Malay culture|pages=1–6 |author=Zaki Ragman |isbn=981-229-326-4|year= 2003|publisher=Asiapac Books Pte Ltd|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, small [[Hindu]] Malay states started to appear in the coastal areas of [[Malay peninsular]] notably the [[Gangga Negara]] (2nd century), [[Langkasuka]] (2nd century), and [[Bujang Valley|Kedah]] (4th century). Between 7th and 13th centuries many of these small, often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states came under the loose control of [[Srivijaya empire]], a great [[Hindu]] Malay kingdom centred in [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/early.htm |title=Early Malay kingdoms |publisher=Sabrizain.org |date= |accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Indian settlers came to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] from South India during the British colonial rule from early 19th through mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Sandhu (2010), Indians in Malaya: Some Aspects of Their Immigration and Settlement (1786-1957), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521148139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many came to escape poverty and famines in British India, and work as indentured labourers in initially tin mining operations and coffee, sugar plantations, and later rubber [[plantations]]; they worked with immigrant Chinese laborers on these sites.&lt;ref name=akaur&gt;Amarjit Kaur, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/02/20/aliens-in-the-land-indian-migrant-workers-in-malaysia/ Indian migrant workers in Malaysia – part 1] Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akaur2&gt;Amarjit Kaur, [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2013/02/21/aliens-in-the-land-indian-migrant-workers-in-malaysia-part-2/ Indian migrant workers in Malaysia – part 2] Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt; Some English-educated Indians were appointed to more professional positions. Most were hired through British colonial labor offices in Nagapattinam or Madras (now Chennai).

In early years, the retention rates of Hindus in Malaysia were low and with time, fewer Hindus volunteered to live in Malaysia. The colonial rule adopted a [[Kangani system|''Kangani'' system]] of recruitment, where the trusted Hindu worker was encouraged and rewarded for recruiting friends and family from India to work in British operations in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Sandhu (2010), Indians in Malaya: Some Aspects of Their Immigration and Settlement (1786-1957), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521148139}}, pp. 89-102&lt;/ref&gt; The family and friends peer pressure reduced labor turnover and increased permanent migration into Malaysia. The ''kangani'' system led to vast majority of Hindus coming from certain parts of South Indian Hindu community.&lt;ref name=akaur/&gt; So concentrated was the immigration from South India, that the British colonial Malayan Administration named laws to highlight the focussed group, and enacted the ''Tamil'' Immigration Fund Ordinance in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Sandhu (2010), Indians in Malaya: Some Aspects of Their Immigration and Settlement (1786-1957), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521148139}}, pp. 60-68&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Indian immigrants to Malaysia during this period came from Northern India and [[Sri Lanka]].

The Malaysian Hindu workers during the British era were among the most marginalised. They were forced to live in closed plantation societies in frontier zones and the plantation symbolised the boundary of their existence. Racial segregation was enforced, and British anti-vagrancy laws made it illegal for Indian Hindus (and Chinese Buddhists) to enter the more developed European zoned regions. The Hindus spoke neither English nor Malay languages, and remained confined to interacting within their own community.&lt;ref name=akaur2/&gt;

After Malaysia gained independence in 1957, local governments favored autochthonous ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]'' and refused automatic citizenship to Indians and Chinese ethnic groups who had been living in Malaysia for decades during British colonial era.&lt;ref name=akaur2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orfonline.org/cms/export/orfonline/modules/issuebrief/attachments/malaysia_1203067850658.pdf Malaysian Indian Community: Victim of ‘Bumiputera’ Policy] ORF Issue Report (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; They were declared illegal aliens and they could not apply for government jobs or own land. Sectarian riots followed, targeting Indians and Chinese, such as the 1957 Chingay riot in [[Penang]], 1964 Malaysian racial riots, the 1967 Hartal riots, and [[13 May Incident|13 May 1969 riots]].&lt;ref name=js&gt;Johan Saravanamuttu (2009), Conflict and Compromise in Inter-Religious Issues in Malaysia, Is.

Many Malay Hindus emigrated, quite many to India. The Hindu population of 12.8% of total Malay population in the 1950s, began its decline thereafter.|date=May 2017}}

===Post Independence===
To safeguard the interest of the Hindu organisations and Hindu temples, the [http://www.malaysiahindusangam.org/ Malaysia Hindu Sangam] (MHS) was formed on 23 January 1965. The formation of MHS was greatly due to the ingenuity of the late Shri K. Paramalingam KMN., a barrister at law and was then the Director General of Public Trustee Department, assisted by the late Shri K. Ramanathan, Shri. G. V. Thevar, Shri Hari Chand Saradha, Shri. S. Palanivel Pillai, and Shri S. Dhuraiappah. Shri K. Ramanathan also was the president of Malaysian Indian Congress from 1950 - 1951 and the founder of Malaysian Arulneri Thirukkuttam.

[http://www.malaysiahindusangam.org/ Malaysia Hindu Sangam] is the only Hindu organization that the government of Malaysia consults on matters affecting the Hindu community in Malaysia. It is also a member of the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST) since 1984. MCCBCHST is composed primarily of officials from the main non-Muslim communities in Malaysia and acts as a consultative and liaison body towards more open dialogue and co-operation.
 
Malaysia Hindu Sangam has organised many national Hindu conferences, seminars, Antharyogams and religious discussions and created a strong religious awareness among the Malaysian Hindus. Among the great contribution of MHS towards the upliftment of Hindus in Malaysia was the Gurukal training programme in the 1980s to train local young men as temple priests.

===Samadhis of Siddhas===
Siddhas have traveled to then Malaya and performed austerities and eventually went into Jeeva Samadhi. Jeganatha Swamigal, a disciple of Ramalinga Adigal, is foremost among a handful of saints who ventured to the then Malaya. Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi is located at Tapah, Perak. Presently, the Jeganatha Swamigal's Samadhi and the land adjacent to its temple is owned by Malaysia Hindu Sangam. Other popular Samadhi is of Sannasi Andavar in Cheng, Malacca and Mauna Swamigal in the vicinity of Lord Saturn's temple at Batu Caves.

==Culture==
[[File:Deepavali in Negeri Sembilan Malaysia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diwali|Deepavali]] decorations in [[Negeri Sembilan]], Malaysia]]
Malaysian Hinduism is diverse, with large urban temples dedicated to specific [[deities]], and smaller temples located on estates. The estate temples generally follow the tradition of the Indian region from which the temples' worshippers originate. Many people follow the Shaivite, or Saivite, tradition (worship of [[Shiva]]), of Southern India. However, there are also some Vaishnava Hindus in Malaysia as well, many of them of North Indian extraction, and these Hindus worship in temples such as the Geeta Ashram in Seksyen 52, [[Petaling Jaya]], or the Lakshmi-Narayana Temple in Kampung Kasipillay, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Services in these temples are usually conducted in Hindi and English.

Folk Hinduism is the most prevalent variety, including [[spiritualism]] and worship of [[Village deities of Tamil Nadu|village deities]]. 
[[Image:Thaipusam idols.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thaipusam]] festival celebration by Malaysian Hindus.]]
The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] also has a number of followers in Malaysia, and maintains temples in Kuala Lumpur and also all over Malaysia. The [[Ratha-Yatra]] festival is held once a year in every temple throughout Malaysia approximately 10 to 12 Ratha Yatra which will be held usually end of the Year, when the Deities of Lord Jagannatha, Baladeva and Subhadra are placed on a chariot which is pulled through the streets by devotees, accompanied by a party chanting the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] Mahamantra. There also another group of Hare Krishna such as (The follower of Ritvik, follower of Hansa Duta). There is also Gaudiya math and Saraswath Math.

There are also few devotees of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] of [[Ramanujacharya]] and the [[Madhvacharya]] Sampradaya.

Malaysia also has large followers of several [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] traditions and groups such as [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. Ramakrishna Mission in [[Petaling Jaya]] has been in existence since the 1940s and was officially affiliated to the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and [[Ramakrishna Mission]], India in 2001. In 2015, the Prime Minister of India, Shri [[Narendra Modi]] visited the Ramakrishna Mission and unveiled a statue of [[Swami Vivekananda]]. Another important centre, closely connected with the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement is the Ramakrishna Ashramam, [[Penang]] which came into existence in 1938. The Vivekananda Ashrama, Kuala Lumpur is an institution started by the Jaffna (Sri Lankan) Tamil immigrants in 1904 in honour of [[Swami Vivekananda]] (1863-1902). The building, constructed in 1908, is dedicated to his work in providing education and spiritual development for the youth and community. The Vivekananda Ashram with a bronze statue of [[Swami Vivekananda]] has been declared as a heritage site in 2016.

Other popular Vedanta-based organisations in Malaysia are Divine Life Society (also called Shivananda Ashram) with its headquarters at Batu Caves and Arsha Vijnana Gurukulam.

Since the [[Second World War]] a revival of Hinduism has occurred among [[Indian Malaysian]]s, with the foundation of organisations and councils to bring unity or to promote [[Reform movement|reform]].

===Hindu religious festivals===

Some of the major Hindu festivals celebrated every year include Deepavali (festival of lights), [[Thaipusam]] ([[Lord Murugan]] festival), [[Pongal]] (harvest festival) and [[Navaratri]] (Durga festival).

[[Diwali|Deepavali]] is the primary Hindu festival in Malaysia. The Malaysian Hindus traditionally hold open houses over Deepavali, where people of different ethnic groups and religions are welcomed in Hindu homes to share the festival of light as well as taste Indian food and sweets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mamandram.org/about-us/hinduism-in-malaysia.html Hinduism in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018134325/http://www.mamandram.org/about-us/hinduism-in-malaysia.html |date=18 October 2014 }} Malaysia Hindudharma Mamandram&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution of Hindus==
[[File:Sri Hanuman at Batu Malai Sri Subramaniar Temple.jpg|thumb|Hindu deity Hanuman at Malai Sri Subramaniar Temple in Malaysia.]]

===Malay law===
Islam is the official religion of Malaysia. The constitution of Malaysia declares that Islam is the only religion of true Malay people and that natives are required to be Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Lemiere, [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/17179/ISIM_20_Apostasy_and_Islamic_Civil_Society_in_Malaysia.pdf?sequence=1 apostasy &amp; Islamic Civil society in Malaysia], ISIM Review, Vol. 20, Autumn 2007, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Conversion from Islam to Hinduism (or another religion) is against the law, but the conversion of Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians to Islam is welcomed. The government actively promotes the spread of Islam in the country.&lt;ref name=gandg/&gt; The law requires that any Hindu (or Buddhist or Christian) who marries a Muslim must first convert to Islam, otherwise the marriage is illegal and void.&lt;ref name=gandg/&gt; If one of the Hindu parents adopts Islam, the children automatically become Muslim without the consent of the second parent.&lt;ref name=2011report/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry Smith (2003), Speak No Evil: Apostasy, Blasphemy and Heresy in Malaysian Syariah Law, UC Davis Journal Int'l Law &amp; Pol'y, 10, pp. 357-399&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous cases in Malaysian courts relating to official persecution of Hindus. For example, in August 2010, a Malaysian woman named Siti Hasnah Banggarma was denied the right to convert to Hinduism by a Malaysian court. Banggarma, who was born a Hindu, but was [[Forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to Islam at age 7, desired to reconvert back to Hinduism and appealed to the courts to recognise her reconversion. The appeal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/fmt-english/news/general/8858-us-based-haf-calls-banggarma-verdict-religiously-discriminatory]&lt;/ref&gt;In 2016, an association of eight Hindu NGOs found that about 7,000 Hindus in Malaysia wrongly documented as Muslims.This problem was widespread throughout Peninsular Malaysia and involved mostly practising Hindus from the lower income group who are documented as Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.timesofindia.com/world/rest-of-world/7000-Hindus-in-Malaysia-wrongly-documented-as-Muslims-NGOs/articleshow/51109806.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

===Destruction of Hindu temples===
{{see also|HINDRAF|2007 HINDRAF rally}}
After a violent conflict in [[Penang]] between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s in March 1998, the government announced a nationwide review of unlicensed Hindu temples and shrines. However, implementation was not vigorous and the program was not a subject of public debate.

Between April to May 2006, several Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195228/http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row – a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-malaysia-demolishes-century-old-hindu-temple-1025317 |title=Malaysia demolishes century-old Hindu temple |publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities' excuse was that these temples were unlicensed and squatting on government land.

The president of the Consumers Association of [[Subang Jaya|Subang]] and [[Shah Alam]] in [[Selangor]] had been helping to organise efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of [[Shah Alam]] from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4965580.stm Pressure on multi-faith Malaysia],''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 90-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 3,000 Hindus. The "Hindu Rights Action Force", a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the Malaysian Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;

[[HINDRAF]] chairman, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy]], said:
{{quote|...These state atrocities are committed against the most underprivileged and powerless sector of the Hindu society in Malaysia. We appeal that this Hindu temple and all other Hindu temples in Malaysia are not indiscriminately and unlawfully demolished&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt;}}

Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }},''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a lawyer for the Hindu Rights Action Task Force, a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in [[Malaysia]] once every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30397720071108?pageNumber=1 Malaysia ethnic Indians in uphill fight on religion] Reuters India – 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Malaysian Hindu organisations protested the destruction of Hindu temples by the Malaysian regime. On 30 October 2007 the 100-year-old Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa was demolished by Malaysian authorities. Following that demolition, Works Minister and head of the [[Malaysian Indian Congress]] [[Samy Vellu]], who is of Indian origin, said that Hindu temples built on government land were still being demolished despite his appeals to the various state chief ministers.

Such temple destructions in Malaysia have been reported by the [[Hindu American Foundation]].&lt;ref name=haf&gt;[http://www.hafsite.org/media_press_release_malaysia_temples.htm HAF Condemns Continuing Destruction of Hindu Temples in Malaysia, Calls for Support to Protesting Malay Hindus], HAF report&lt;/ref&gt;

HAF notes that the [[Government of Malaysia]] Restricts Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association contrary to Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and Article 10 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution, and that the application filed by Malaysian Hindus to hold gatherings have been arbitrarily denied by the police. The Government has also tried to suppress a campaign launched by an NGO, the [[Hindu Rights Action Force]] ([[HINDRAF]]) to obtain 100,000 signatures in support of a civil suit against the Government of United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="haf"/&gt; HINDRAF has accused the Malaysian government of intimidating and instilling fear in the Indian community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://policewatchmalaysia.com/ HINDRAF home]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindraf rally prompted the Malaysian government to open dialogue with various Indian and Hindu organizations like the [[Malaysia Hindu Council]], [[Malaysia Hindudharma Mamandram]], and Malaysian Indian Youth Council (MIYC) to address the misgivings of the Indian community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/12/15/nation/19773592&amp;sec=nation NGOs discuss Indian issues with PM in heart-to-heart chat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005084914/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F12%2F15%2Fnation%2F19773592&amp;sec=nation |date=5 October 2012 }} The Star – 15 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; HINDRAF itself has been excluded from these talks and no significant changes have resulted from the discussions.

The Cow head protests was a protest that was held in front of the Selangor state government headquarters at the [[Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Building]], [[Shah Alam]], [[Malaysia]] on 28 August 2009. The protest was called so because the act of a few participants who brought along a cow head, which they later "stomped on the head and spat on it before leaving the site".&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Malaysian Muslims protest against proposed construction of Hindu temple| agency = Associated Press | date = 29 August 2009 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2009/08/29/malaysian_muslims_protest_proposed_hindu_temple| accessdate = 12 September 2010 | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cow is considered a sacred animal to [[Hindu]]s.

The protest was held due to Selangor state government's intention to relocate a [[Hindu]] temple from Section 19 residential area of [[Shah Alam]] to Section 23. The protesters were mainly [[Muslim]] extremists who opposed the relocation due to the fact that Section 23 was a Muslim majority area.

The protest leaders were also recorded saying there would be blood if a temple was constructed in [[Shah Alam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5RWG2ScAdC9V7eo-B6-KfUL3QjgD9ABV6U81 Malaysia Muslims protest proposed Hindu temple] Associated Press – 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was caught on video by the popular Malaysian online news portal ''[[Malaysiakini]]''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytAkNMyGd1M&amp;feature=channel_page Temple demo: Residents march with cow's head] YouTube. 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Revathi Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name, but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith.Revathi Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter.But her marriage is not recognised by the Malaysian government because a Hindu man can't marry a Muslim girl as per the [[Sharia]] law.She was seized by the Islamic authorities  when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim.She was incarcerated for six months in an Islamic re-education camp because of her attempts to renounce Islam in favour of the Hindu religion ,where she was forced to eat beef (which is forbidden to Hindus),forced to make her pray as a Muslim and to wear a headscarf.However, she is adamant that she will remain a Hindu.Islamic officials took the couple's 18-month-old daughter away from Suresh (her Hindu father) and gave her to Revathi's mother (her Muslim grandmother). Officials have ordered Revathi to live with her mother and continue with her Islamic 'counseling'.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6278568.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://m.digitaljournal.com/article/203744&lt;/ref&gt;
===Depiction of Hindus in India as 'unclean' and 'dirty' by Malaysian university===
In 2017, a teaching module published by a leading Malaysian university (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) ) depicted Hindus in India as unclean and dirty in a slide. Another slide aimed at teaching the origins of Sikhism claimed that founder Guru Nanak had a poor understanding of Islam and had combined it with his surrounding Hindu lifestyle in forming the early foundation of the Sikh faith.

===Fatwa against Yoga===

In 2008 , The National Fatwa Council of Malaysia issued fatwa against [[Yoga]] .Abdul Shukor Husim, the council's chairman, said: "We are of the view that yoga, which originates in Hinduism, combines a physical exercise, religious elements, chanting and worshipping for the purpose of achieving inner peace and ultimately to be at one with god. For us, yoga destroys a Muslim's faith".  The [[fatwa]] says Muslims to avoid yoga because it uses Hindu prayers that could erode Muslims’ faith.Following this Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]  moved to contain the damage, telling  that  Muslims could carry on doing yoga but avoiding the chanting.However, the fatwas by  National Fatwa Council are not legally binding on the country's Muslims, unless they also become enshrined in national or sharia laws. But many Muslims abide by the edicts out of deference.But there are many muslims too who go to yoga classes .&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/3509070/Malaysia-bans-Muslims-from-practicing-yoga.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/24/malaysia-islam-muslims-yoga-ban&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-islam-yoga-idUSTRE4AP2CA20081126&lt;/ref&gt;
===Indira Gandhi religion conversion case===
In 2009 ,Indira gandhi's husband Pathmanathan converted to Islam and took up the name Muhammad Riduan Abdullah.Then he unilaterally converted his three children (one of whom was 11 months old) to Islam without the consent of his wife.The Sharia Court also granted custody of children to  Riduan.This sparked a court battle for nine long years, as Indira, a Hindu, fought to gain custody of her three children — Prasana; Karan Dinish, 19; and Tevi Darsiny, 20 — and to quash their conversions.

Atlast ,the Federal Court nullified their conversions and ruled that consent of both parents was needed to convert a minor.The Federal Court on  2016 had ordered the Inspector-General of Police to execute a warrant of arrest for Riduan. Karan and Tevi have declared themselves Hindus.However ,  Riduan escaped taking Prasana along with him,both of them are still not found.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/01/29/indira-gandhi-grateful-for-decision-but-where-is-my-daughter/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.malaymail.com/s/1567409/simplified-the-federal-courts-groundbreaking-indira-gandhi-judgment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.malaymail.com/s/1566063/indira-gandhi-refuses-to-forgive-ex-husband-after-nine-year-court-battle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/34965&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of the Jews in Guernsey''' dates back to well before the events of 1940-5. A London Jew named Abraham was described in 1277 as being from "La Gelnseye" (Guernsey). A converted Portuguese Jew, [[Edward Brampton]], was appointed [[List of Governors of Guernsey|Governor]] of Guernsey in 1482.

[[Guernsey]]'s Jewish population has historically been much smaller than that of neighboring [[Jersey]], and there has never been a [[synagogue]] on the island.&lt;ref name=jcr-uk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shulman|first1=David|title=JCR-UK: The Channel Islands Jewish Community|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Chislands.htm|last2=Messik|first2=Louise|website=JCR-UK|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Enemy aliens, people born in a country with which Britain was at war, were restricted from entering Britain without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F. H. &amp; C. A. G. Simkins |last=Hinsley |title=British Intelligence in the Second World War: Volume 4, Security and Counter-Intelligence |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 1990 |ISBN=9780521394093}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} Accordingly, a few Jews became trapped in Guernsey when the islands were occupied. In addition, a few locals decided to remain in Guernsey rather than evacuate in June 1940.

During the [[occupation of the Channel Islands]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], laws were imposed on the authorities that required registration. All non Guernsey and British foreigners (aliens) had already been required to register with the police, but the records did not mention their faith. An advertisement appeared in the newspaper{{which|date=October 2018}} in October 1941 calling on all Jews to identify themselves.&lt;ref name="WCI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.uab.cat/ablcsma/files/2010/10/War-in-the-Channel-Islands.pdf |title=War-in-the-Channel-Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans issued identity cards to everyone, which listed their nationality and faith.

* Elisabet Duquemin née Fink, 21/7/1899, British by marriage, born Austria

* Therese Steiner, 22/4/191625 German, born Austria 
* Anny (Annie) Wranowsky, 22/4/1894, Czech but held German passport, living on Sark

Marianne Grunfeld, born in Poland in 1912, had studied horticulture at the [[University of Reading]] before going to work on a farm in Guernsey. She was identified in April 1942 as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Fraser |title=The Jews Of The Channel Islands And The Rule Of Law, 1940-1945: |ISBN=9781903900284 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|104}} &lt;ref name="CIOR34"&gt;{{cite book |title=Channel Islands Occupation Review No 34 |publisher=Channel Islands Occupation Society |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}} 

Theresia Steiner, an Austrian, non-practising Jew, who had come to the Islands from England and become trapped in the Islands by the invasion as she had been detained as an alien, amongst 30 enemy aliens who were arrested and detained in June 1940.&lt;ref name=WCI/&gt; She didn't have a UK visa to go to the UK as required for immigrants from Germany and Austria (from 1938).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/221 |title=Whitehall and the Jews, 1933-1948: British Immigration Policy, Jewish Refugees and the Holocaust}}&lt;/ref&gt; A qualified dental nurse, she was then employed as a nurse by the States of Guernsey, working at the Castel Hospital, She went, after 18 months to the German authorities to ask to contact her parents. The First Order Against The Jews was 23 October 1940 and this was the beginning of the adoption of the Nuremberg Race Laws in to the Channel Islands’ legal systems. The Islands' bailiffs collaborated with the Germans. Only Sir [[Abraham Lainé]] protested against the anti-Jewish laws. The deportation of the Jews from the Channel Islands was with the full connivance of the bailiffs and the government authorities. According to the grandson of Bailiff Carey of Guernsey, Winston Churchill did not know whether to hang William G. Carey or knight him. To hush up the level of collaboration,{{fact|date=October 2018}} he was knighted and the history of Guernsey's delivery of the Jews to the Nazis was concealed for decades.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The first group of three Jews were ordered to leave the Island in April 1942.&lt;ref name=WCI/&gt; The three, Marianne Grunfeld, Auguste Spitz, and Therese Steiner, were first sent to [[Saint-Malo]], where they took up local employment, Marianne Grunfeld was reported to be living in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval, France]],&lt;ref name=CIOR34/&gt; until three months later when they were rounded up in a mass deportation of French Jews. They were sent directly to [[Auschwitz]],&lt;ref name=WCI/&gt; where they all died.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|title=Guernsey's Holocaust role 'should be marked'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-30811115|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=BBC News Guernsey|publisher=BBC|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of three, Elda Brouard, Elisabet Duquemin, and Janet Duquemin (18 months old), were sent with Henry Duquemin (husband of Elisabet) in February 1943. Henry was sent to [[Oflag VII-C]] in Laufen, Germany, and the two women and baby went first to a prison in [[Compiègne]] and then after 6 months to Ilag V-B in [[Biberach an der Riss]]. Both of the camps in Laufen and Biberach were civilian camps containing many Channel Island civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guernseypress.com/news/2005/07/09/i-escaped-the-nazi-holocaust/ |title=I escaped the Nazi Holocaust |publisher=Guernsey Press |date=9 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annie Wranowsky lived on Sark throughout the war working as a German language teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Fraser |title= The Jews Of The Channel Islands And The Rule Of Law, 1940-1945: Quite Contrary To The Principles Of British Justice |publisher= Sussex Academic Press, 2000 |ISBN= 9781903900284 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miriam Jay lived in Guernsey throughout the war without being identified.

[[Geoffrey Rowland|Sir Geoffrey Rowland]], the [[Bailiff of Guernsey]] from 2005 to 2012, has stated that the government of Guernsey was powerless to stop the deportations due to the large number of German soldiers on the island.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

Among these Muslims, 6,700,000 or 4.6% of the total population of Russia were not affiliated with any [[Islamic schools and branches]]. Recognized under the law and by Russian political leaders as one of Russia's traditional religions, Islam is a part of [[History of Russia|Russian historical heritage]], and is subsidized by the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bell, I|title=Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EPP3ti4hysUC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=2007-12-27|isbn=978-1-85743-137-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Islam as a major Russian religion, alongside Orthodox Christianity, dates from the time of [[Catherine the Great]], who sponsored Islamic clerics and scholarship through the [[Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly|Orenburg Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Azamatov, Danil D.

The history of Islam and Russia encompasses periods of conflict between Muslims and the Orthodox majority, as well as periods of collaboration and mutual support. Robert Crews's study of Muslims living under the Tsar indicates that "the mass of Muslims" was loyal to that regime after Catherine, and sided with it over its Ottoman rival.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Crews, ''For Prophet and Tsar'', pp. 299-300 (Harvard, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tsarist regime fell, the Soviet Union introduced a policy of [[state atheism]], which impeded the practice of Islam and led to the execution and suppression of various Muslim leaders. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Islam regained a prestigious, legally recognized space in Russian politics. More recently, President Putin consolidated this trend, subsidizing the creation of mosques and Islamic education, which he called an "integral part of Russia's cultural code",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/putin-pledges-support-islamic-schools-russia-791561&lt;/ref&gt; encouraging immigration from Muslim-majority former Soviet bloc states, and condemning what the Russian state considers to be criminal anti-Muslim hate speech, such as caricatures of the [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/188502/why-russia-is-no-place-to-be-charlie&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims form a majority of the population of the [[Republics of Russia|republics]] of [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Tatarstan]] in the [[Volga Federal District]], and predominate among the nationalities in the [[North Caucasian Federal District]] located between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]: the [[Circassians]], [[Balkars]], [[Chechen people|Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Kabardin]], [[Karachay]], and numerous [[Dagestan#Ethnicities|Dagestani]] peoples. Also, in the middle of the [[Volga Region]] reside populations of [[Volga Tatars|Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]], the vast majority of whom are Muslims. Other areas with notable Muslim minorities include [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], the republics of [[Adygea]], [[North Ossetia-Alania]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]], [[Moscow Oblast|Moscow]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]] and [[Ulyanovsk Oblast|Ulyanovsk]] oblasts.

In the mid 7th century AD, as part of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region, parts of which [[Russo-Persian Wars|were later]] permanently incorporated by [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote="(..) It is difficult to establish exactly when Islam first appeared in Russia because the lands that Islam invaded early in its expansion were not part of Russia at the time, but were later incorporated into the expanding Russian Empire.

From the early 16th-century up to including the course of the 19th century, all of [[Transcaucasia]] and southern [[Dagestan]] was ruled by various successive [[History of Iran|Iranian empires]] (the [[Safavids]], [[Afsharids]], and the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]]), and their geo-political and ideological neighbouring arch-rivals on the other hand, the [[Ottoman Turks]]. In the respective areas they ruled, in both the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, [[Shia Islam]] and [[Sunni Islam]] spread, resulting in a fast and steady conversion of many more ethnic Caucasian peoples in adjacent territories.

The period from the Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552 by [[Ivan the Terrible]] to the ascension of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 featured systematic Russian repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination - as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by the elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as [[mosque]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Allen J.

Islamic slavery did not have racial restrictions. Russian girls were legally allowed to be sold in Russian controlled Novgorod to Tatars from Kazan in the 1600s by Russian law. Germans, Poles, and Lithuanians were allowed to be sold to Crimean Tatars in Moscow. In 1665 Tatars were allowed to buy from the Russians, Polish and Lithuanian slaves. Before 1649 Russians could be sold to Muslims under Russian law in Moscow.

While total expulsion (as practised in other Christian nations such as [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and [[Sicily]]) was not feasible to achieve a homogeneous [[Russian Orthodox|Russian-Orthodox]] population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims, making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region and encouraging emigration to other parts such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] and neighboring [[Persia]], and almost annihilating the [[Circassians]], [[Crimean Tatars]], and various [[Peoples of the Caucasus in Turkey|Muslims of the Caucasus]]. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighboring [[Ottoman Empire]]. The explicit Russian goal involved expelling the groups in question from their lands.&lt;ref&gt;Kazemzadeh 1974&lt;/ref&gt; They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire, in Persia, or in Russia far from their old lands. The Russo-Caucasian War ended with the signing of loyalty oaths by Circassian leaders on 2 June [O.S. 21 May] 1864. Afterwards, the Ottoman Empire offered to harbour the Circassians who did not wish to accept the rule of a Christian monarch, and many emigrated to Anatolia (the heart of the Ottoman Empire) and ended up in modern Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Iraq and Kosovo. Many other Caucasian Muslims ended up in neighboring Iran - sizeable numbers of Shia Lezgins, Azerbaijanis, [[Iranian Georgians|Muslim Georgians]], Kabardins, and Laks.&lt;ref&gt;А. Г. Булатова.

[[File:Islam in Russia.png|thumb|left|Areas in Russia with a significant Muslim population]]
There was much evidence of official conciliation toward Islam in Russia in the 1990s. The number of Muslims allowed to make pilgrimages to [[Mecca]] increased sharply after the embargo of the Soviet era ended in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamdag.info/story/1589|title=History of Hajj in Russia from 18th to 21st century - IslamDag.info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the newly established [[Union of Muslims of Russia]], led by Imam [[Khatyb Mukaddas]] of Tatarstan, began organizing a movement aimed at improving inter-ethnic understanding and ending Russians' lingering misconception of Islam. The Union of Muslims of Russia is the direct successor to the pre-[[World War I]] [[Union of Muslims]], which had its own faction in the Russian [[Duma]]. The post-Communist union formed a political party, the [[Nur All-Russia Muslim Public Movement]], which acts in close coordination with Muslim imams to defend the political, economic, and cultural rights of Muslims. The [[Islamic Cultural Center of Russia]], which includes a [[madrassa]] (religious school), opened in Moscow in 1991. In the 1990s, the number of Islamic publications has increased. Among them are few magazines in Russian, namely: "Ислам" ([[Transliteration of Russian into English|transliteration]]: ''Islam''), "Эхо Кавказа" (''Ekho Kavkaza'') and "Исламский вестник" (''Islamsky Vestnik''), and the Russian-language newspaper "Ассалам" (''Assalam''), and "Нуруль Ислам" (''Nurul Islam''), which are published in [[Makhachkala]], Dagestan.

[[Talgat Tadzhuddin]] was the Chief Mufti of Russia. Since Soviet times, the Russian government has divided Russia into a number of Muslim Spiritual Directorates.

===Language controversies===
For centuries, the [[Tatars]] constituted the only Muslim ethnic group in European Russia, with [[Tatar language]] being the only language used in their mosques, a situation which saw rapid change over the course of the 20th century as a large number of Caucasian and central Asian Muslims migrated to central Russian cities and began attending Tatar-speaking mosques, generating pressure on the imams of such mosques to begin using Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chris-kutschera.com/A/islam_russia.htm|title=The Rebirth of Islam in Russia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religare.ru/analytics4454.htm|title=РЕЛИГАРЕ  - "Русский ислам" как явление и как предмет исследования|website=www.religare.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is evident even within Tatarstan itself, where Tatars constitute a majority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allrussia.ru/pressreview/default.asp?id=37870&amp;rub_id=19&amp;VYear=2000&amp;VMonth=4&amp;VDay=18&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Janmangal Namavali''' is the name given in [[Hinduism]] to the 108 names of [[God]] as composed by the [[Swaminarayan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; Bhagwan's saint Shatanand Swami

== Origin ==
Swaminarayan Bhagwan, asked one of his disciples, Shatanand Swami to compose some verses, on chanting, would calm one's mind and protect devotees from evil influences, fear, and obstacles. The result was the Janmangal Namavali, 108 verses consisting of different names of God. Each name refers to a different power or quality attributed to Swaminarayan Bhagwan.

'''Liuhebafaquan''' 六合八法拳; [[Pinyin]]: '''liùhébāfǎquán''') (literally ''Six Harmonies Eight Methods Boxing'') is a [[Neijia|internal]] [[Chinese martial art]].  It has been called "Xinyi Liuhebafa" 心意六合八法拳 and is also referred to as "water boxing" (''shuǐquán'' 水拳) due to its principles.

{{Chinese martial arts}}

== History ==
The Song Dynasty [[Taoist]] sage [[Chen Tuan]] (Chén Tuán 陳摶, also known as Chén Xīyí 陳希夷 or by his nickname, Chen Po) is often credited with its origin and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenn D. Newth|title=Hwa Yu Tai Chi Ch'uan: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Five-Word Song|year=2006|publisher=Blue Snake Books|isbn=1-5839-4161-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was associated with the Huashan Taoist Monastery on [[Mount Hua]] in [[Shaanxi]] Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hua Ching Ni|title=Life and Teaching of Two Immortals: Chen Tuan|year=1992|publisher=Shrine of the Eternal Breath of Tao, College of Tao &amp; Traditional Chinese Healing|isbn=0-9370-6448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liuhebafa form "Zhú Jī 築基" was taught in the late 1930s in [[Shanghai]] and [[Nanjing]] by [[Wu Yihui]] (1887–1958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterspirit6x8.tripod.com/id18.html |title=History: Origins, Nanjing, and Others |publisher=WaterSpirit-6x8 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said he had learned the art from three teachers: Yan Guoxing, Chen Guangdi (who learned the art from a monk, Da Yuan and a Taoist, Li Chan), and Chen Helu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jess O'Brien|title=Nei Jia Quan: Internal Martial Arts|year=2007|publisher=Blue Snake Books|isbn=1-5839-4199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Wu Yihui's students had martial arts backgrounds and modified the form to merge it with their own knowledge. This is one of several explanations for its similarities with other martial arts such as [[Xingyiquan]], [[Baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] and [[Yiquan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3825">''' Mārdava ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मार्दव) means mildness, softness, gentleness, kindness, weakness and pliancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=mArdava&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], there are eight ''aśtopāyas'', or eight ways of attaining [[moksha]], and ''Mārdava'' is one of them, the other seven being – ''[[Yajna]]'' (यज्ञ) (sacrifices), ''[[Dāna]]'' (दान) (charity), ''Vedadhyayana'' (the study of the Vedas), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (तप) (penance, deep meditation), ''[[Uparati|Dama]]'' (दम)  (subduing the senses by restraining the sense-organs), ''[[Satya]]'' (सत्य) (truth in speech and act), and ''[[Tyāga]]'' (त्याग) (renunciation of desire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.3|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=744|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0U2QRpDv2KMC&amp;pg=PA744&amp;lpg=PA744&amp;dq=mardava++hinduism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k1KkDvZVz4&amp;sig=JrPZW-iyRWPazoaz1S0oL9iE_3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VsECVdrPLc-VuASym4GQCA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20hinduism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Jainism]], ''mārdava'' or compassion or supreme tenderness or humility, which is part of Right Belief, is a means to destroy vanity or egotism which gives rise to many evils which defile the virtues of our soul; it is held that humility is the foundation of compassion and the basis for salvation. With the eight kinds of pride totally avoided, knowledge brings humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uttama Mardava Dharma|publisher=Jain Heritage Centres|url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114511/http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tattvārthasūtra]] (IX.6) lists ''mārdava'' (modesty) as one of the ten aspects of the highest '' [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5WHHJ6O7b-IC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=coQBVdy-C4-0uATY9ICoAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bhagavad Gita]] (XVI.1-3) also classifies ''mārdava'' as a divine quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.1|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=124|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zp3n--MlL9wC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CoUBVd-wHc3iuQSJp4GoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Buddhist]]s consider ''mārdava'' as the realization of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-pratipatti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism|author=Bibhuti Barua|publisher=Sarup &amp; sons|page=13|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=s1PZAMD13SMC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=mardava+++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UoMCVYqnAczauQSZzoK4DA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] mentions ''mārdava'' as a low pitch along with ''anvavavasarga'' and ''udutā khasya''; he explains this word as ''svarasya mridutā'' or ''snigdhatā'' (smoothness of sound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EmW96v4gvycC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4MBVYDnM9C1uQSeyIGwAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland Meredith Starr''' (born '''Herbert Close'''; 29 December 1890 – 13 December 1971) was a [[British people|British]] [[occult]]ist and [[poet]]. He is credited with introducing [[Meher Baba]] to the West.

==Life==

Starr was born in Prestbury House, [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in the County of [[Middlesex]], [[England]] to well-to-do land owning parents (''"[[Landed property|landed proprietor]]s"'') William Brooks Close and Mary Baker Brooks Close. When Starr was one year old his parents separated and he was raised by his mother. He received his education at [[Winchester College]] in [[Hampshire]]. Starr was a [[psychologist]], [[Homeopathy|homeopath]], [[occult]]ist and an editorial writer. He was also the principal player in bringing [[Meher Baba]] to the West for the first time at the start of the 1930s, although he himself did not remain a follower for very long.

In the early 20th century, Starr wrote for ''[[The Occult Review]]'', an illustrated monthly journal containing articles and correspondence by many notable occultists of the day, including [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], [[Walter Leslie Wilmshurst|W. L. Wilmshurst]], [[Franz Hartmann]], [[Florence Farr]], and Herbert Stanley Redgrove. He probably changed his name to Meredith Starr when he was twenty in relation to his work as a reviewer and contributor for ''The Occult Review''. He also wrote for Aleister Crowley's publication ''[[The Equinox]]'', publishing ''Memory of Love'' (under the name "Herbert Close"), VII, 291 - Vol 7, in 1911.

Meredith Starr met Meher Baba in Toka, [[India]] on 30 June 1928. In 1931 Starr established a retreat center at East Challacombe, [[North Devon]] (a couple of miles from [[Combe Martin]]), where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in a sense of humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have played a central role in introducing Meher Baba to the western world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Awakener Magazine'' Volume 11, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1932, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba and wrote to him, "Give me either the 400 pounds you owe me or illumination; otherwise, I will leave you and expose you as a fraud!" He then did leave Meher Baba. The money he referred to was money he had spent hosting Meher Baba at his retreat in Devon. Starr disbanded the Devon retreat and sold the property a year and a half later.&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: "Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba", ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 1747&lt;/ref&gt; He later organized 'nature cure and scientific relaxation' courses at Frogmore Hall, Herts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 August 1937; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married firstly on 1 March 1917 at Paddington Register Office to the Honourable Mary Grey, daughter of the [[Harry Grey, 8th Earl of Stamford|8th Earl of Stamford]], by whom he had two sons. He was divorced by ''[[decree nisi]]'' 10 April 1930, on his admission of an adulterous relationship of four years' duration with Margaret Ross of East Challacombe, Combe Martin, Devon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 11 April 1930&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the Municipal Cemetery, [[Kirkley]], [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gravestonephotos.com/public/findfamily.php?name=Starr Gravestone Photos.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

:MEMORY OF LOVE

:''O DREAD Desire of Love! O lips and eyes!''
:''O image of the love that never dies,''
:''But, fed by furtive fire, rages most''
:''When Hope and Faith have been for ever lost!''
:''O oft-kissed lips and soul-remembered eyes,''
:''O stricken heart -- the old love never dies!''

:''O Passion of dead lips that used to cling''
:''To warm red living ones that breathed no pain!''
:''O Passion of dead hours that daily bring''
:''To life some phantom pale that died in vain! ...''
:''Some echo tuned to Memory's dying strain,''
:''Some witness of the immemorial spring!''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7935">'''Muklishgarh''' is a [[rang mahal culture|rang mahal]] fort in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Yamunanagar district]] of [[Haryana]] in [[India]].

== Brief history ==
[[File:Muklishgarh.jpg|thumb|Muklishgarh - The Rang Mahal of Shah Jahan]]
Under Shahjahan (1627–1658), the celebrated Ali Mardan Khan laid down a Rang Mahal named MuKlisgarh, and in it built a royal hunting lodge, known as Badshahi Mahal, on the left bank of the [[Yamuna]], to the north–west of the  Faizabad [[pargana]]. The palace was pleasantly situated opposite to head works of the Delhi Mughal Canal, and its portions were standing till the beginning of the present century. To the same nobleman is due the construction of the canal. He is said to have designed the canal, which was conducted with a considerable knowledge of hydraulics, along the crest of the high ground between Yamuna and Hindan, so as to admit of its water being thrown off on both irrigation purposes. The canal was, however, little used till afterwards. Property in money and jewels left by the powerful minister, Ali Mardan Khan, at his death was estimated at a sum equal to Rs 18,00,000. It was in this reign that the small mahal of Jahangirabad was separated from Raipur Tatar, about the same time that the latter’s name was altered to Faizabad which became for a while the capital of the sarkar Saharanpur.

=== Historian views about Muklishgarh ===
Invine, on the authority of ‘Anonymous Fragments’, says that ‘Islam Khan (Salim Shah) son of Sher Khan Sur, in his days of brief authority, began to build a strong fortress under the name of Pawangarh. It was left unfinished and fell into ruins’.-Later Mughals p.&amp;nbsp;109. But the name Moklespore (mentioned in Rennels map of countries between Delhi and Candhaar, 1792), is itself suggestive of its founder. Iradat Khan calls it Daber.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Scot’s Translation of the Memoirs of Iradat Khan, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Ganda Singh in his book ''Life of Banda Singh Bahadur'' writes on pages 55–56 The fort of Mukhlispur was built by one Mukhlis Khan under instructions from Emperor Shsh Jahan who occasionally spent his summer there. It was a strong hill-fort about halfway between the towns of Sadhaura and Nahan (about 9&amp;nbsp;km from Sadhaura), within the boundary of the village of Amuwal, among the steeps of the Himalayas on an elevated summit which could be approached only by craggy rocks and ravines. It was surrounded by two rivulets, Pamuwali and Daska-wali Khols or Khuds, which originally formed only one stream, parting into two to embrace the hillock of the fort. The fort was in a most neglected condition when [[Banda Singh Bahadur]] occupied it. It was soon repaired and was given the new name of [[Lohgarh]] or Iron Fort.

Surinder Singh in his book ''Discovering Baba Banda Singh Bahadur'', writes on pages 285–286, Banda Bahadur carried out the repairs to the Mukhlispur fortress and renamed it as Lohgarh. He also fortified it by laying 3 to 4&amp;nbsp;ft high and 50- to 100-ft-long stone walls, 52 in number. Sikh soldiers could stay behind these walls and the [[Mughal Empire]] forces trying to reach the fortress and to face their gunshots and arrows about 15 times before they could reach the top. Large-scale troops could not climb and on two occasions when they were able to and large-scale assault is not possible at the Fort, follow Banda Bahadur and his troops up to Lohgarh, the imperial forces lost a large number of soldiers but were not able to catch Banda Bahadur and his men. This small defensive arrangement has been deemed as a capital by a large number of historians form Punjab when the site was hardly about 100 to 200&amp;nbsp;km from major parts of Punjab and could be easily visited and examined. The author had the occasion to visit and examine this-the Sadhaura-Lohgarh-Sitaragarh axis-a large number of times in his capacity as convenor for the raising of a suitable memorial by the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]]. This author is of the opinion that half an acre of land on which Lohgarh has been raised is generally occupied by medium sixed bavelis (large houses). He is also of the opinion that Lohgarh was not declared as the capital of the nascent [[Sikh]] state because three series of the coins issued by Banda Bahadur from 1710–12 do not carry any name of the city or town after the word ''zarb'' meaning ''minted at''. Had it been fixed as a capital, the name of Lohgarh would have certainly come on the coin. The legend after the word ''zarb'', is "place of perfect peace, picture of a beautiful city where the fortunate throne of Khalsa is to be located".

Dr. Harjinder Singh Dilgeer in his book ''Great Sikh General Banda Singh Bahadur'', writes on page no 57, the Sikhs had captured the fort of Mukhlisgarh (Lohgarh) and had established it as capital.

Dr. J.S. Grewal in his book ‘The Sikhs of the Punjab’ writes on page no 83, he adopted Mukhlispur, an imperial fort now given the name of Lohgarh, as his capital and struck a new coin in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh.

Dr. Khushwant Singh in his book ''A History of the Sikhs'' second edition writes on page no 103, Banda was too shrewd to place much reliance on the loyalties of the new converts and he made the old fort of Mukhlisgarh, in the safety of the Himalayas, his headquarters. At Mukhlisgarh, Banda learned that Bahadur Shah, after subjugation of Rajasthan and not likely to return to Delhi before the monsoons. Banda decided to utilize the opportunity to destroy the remaining vestiges of Mughal rule in northern India.

Dr. Hari Ram Gupta in his book ‘ History of the Sikhs, writes on page no 11, he, therefore, established his headquarters, in the beginning of February 1710, at Mukhlispur situated in lower Shiwalik hills south of Nahan, about 20 km from Sadhaura. Its fort stood on a hill top. Two kuhls or water channels flowed at its base and supplied water to it. This fort was repaired and put in a state of defence. All the money, gold and costly material acquired in these expeditions were deposited here. He struck coins and issued orders under his own seal. The name of Mukhlispur was changed to Lohgarh, and it became the capital of the first Sikh state.

=== Lohgarh and Muklishgarh are different sites ===
[[File:Map depicting lohgarh and Muklishgarh.jpg|thumb|map showing Lohgarh and Muklishgarh - Irfan Habib's book Sikh history from Persian sources]]
The contemporary historians were Mughals, therefore they deliberately projected a wrong picture of Lohgarh. Later on, the other historians picked, their references in the context of Lohgarh leading to the depiction of wrong interpretation of history. Muklishgarh is almost 30&amp;nbsp;km away from Lohgarh.

=== Muklishgarh is now a protected site of Archaeological Survey of India ===
Archaeological survey of India Has spent about 2 crore rupees for the preservation and restoration of the site. see serial 261 of the list published by ASI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">[[File:Poster-museumofchristianart.jpg|thumb|Poster from the Museum of Christian Art, Goa.]]The '''Museum of Christian Art''', in the former colonial capital of [[Old Goa]], is a museum of [[Christian art]].

==About==

The [[museum]] is located in the [[Convent of Santa Monica]] in [[Old Goa]], [[Goa]]. It is open from 9.30 am to 5 pm on all days, Monday to Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028221617/http://museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |archive-date=2013-10-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a project of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] and was set up with technical and financial assistance from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] ([[INTACH]]), [[New Delhi]]. Earlier, it was located at the [[Seminary of Rachol]], [[Salcete]], [[Goa]].

==Exhibits==

Its exhibits are divided into the following categories:
* [[Sculptures]]
* [[Furniture]]
* [[Ivory]]
* [[Paintings]]
* [[Textiles]]
* [[Precious Metals]]
* [[Metals]]
* Miscellaneous

==Statuary, paintings, sculptures==

The ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' says: "Within the [[Convent of St. Monica]], the excellent Museum of Christian Art contains statuary, paintings and sculptures transferred here from the [[Rachol Seminary]]. Many of the works of [[Goan]] [[Christian art]] during the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era were produced by local [[Hindu]] artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130092135/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |archive-date=2012-01-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious silverware==

''[[Fodors]]'', another [[travel guide]], notes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207105925/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |archive-date=2013-12-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the museum is located inside the [[Convent of St. Monica]], and "has a number of objects of [[Christian]] interest, including paintings and religious silverware, some dating back to the 16th century." It also notes that this convent was the first nunnery of its kind in the [[East]] and continued until the late 19th century.

==Christian art, elsewhere==

In [[Goa]], the [[Goa State Museum]] also houses a Christian Art Gallery. In August 2011, [[Mumbai]] also announced plans to open its museum of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-16/mumbai/29891827_1_church-artefacts-museum-christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art heist==

In January 2012, a major art heist was reported&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/goa/30666486_1_security-guard-museum-burgled&lt;/ref&gt; at the museum. There was no detailed listing of the items that were stolen, in a case which saw a security guard being killed.

A '''novice''' is a person or creature who is new to a field or activity. It can be seen as a person who has entered a religious order and is under probation, before taking vows. Additionally, it can be an animal, especially a racehorse, that has not yet won a major prize or reached a level of performance to qualify for important events.

==Religion==
===Buddhism===
[[File:NovicesWangdue.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Buddhist novices in Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, [[Bhutan]]]]

{{main|Buddhist Novitiate}}

In many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] orders, a man or woman who intends to take ordination must first become a novice, adopting part of the monastic code indicated in the [[vinaya]] and studying in preparation for full ordination.  The name for this level of ordination varies from one tradition to another.  In Pali, the word is [[samanera]], which means 'small monk' or 'boy monk'.

===Christianity===
====Roman Catholicism====
{{main|Catholic novitiate}}
A novice in [[Roman Catholic]] [[canon law]] and [[tradition]], is a ''prospective'' member of a [[religious order]] who is being tried and being proven for suitability of admission to a religious order of priests, religious brothers, or religious sisters, whether the community is one of [[monk]]s or has an "active" ministry. After initial contact with the community, and usually a period of time as a [[postulant]] (a more or less formal period of candidacy for the [[novitiate]]), the person will be received as a novice in a ceremony that most often involves being clothed with the [[religious habit]] (traditional garb) of the particular religious community. The novice's habit is often slightly different from those of professed members of the order. For instance, in communities of women that wear a dark [[veil]] over the head, novices often wear a white one; among [[Franciscan]] communities of men, novices wear an additional shirt-like chest piece over the traditional Franciscan robe; [[Carthusian]] novices wear a dark cloak over the usual white habit; etc.

Novices are not admitted to [[religious vows|vows]] until they have successfully completed the prescribed period of training and proving, called the [[novitiate]]. This usually lasts one year, the minimum required by Canon Law, though in some orders and communities it is two. Novices typically have dormitories in separate areas within a [[monastery]] or community and are under the direct supervision of a [[novice master]] or novice mistress.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====
{{main|Degrees_of_Orthodox_monasticism#Novice|l1=Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: Novice}}
In the [[Orthodox Church]], a candidate may be clothed as a novice ([[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: послушник, ''poslushnik'', literally "one under obedience") by the [[hegumen]] ([[abbot]]) or hegumenia ([[abbess]]) after at least three days in the monastery. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) is simply given the [[Cassock#Eastern practice (Orthodox and Eastern Catholic)|riassa]], belt and [[skoufos]]. Novice [[nun]]s additionally wear a veil ([[apostolnik]]) that covers the head and neck. A novice is also given a [[prayer rope]] and instructed in the use of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. In large communities, the new novice may be assigned a [[starets]] (spiritual father or spiritual mother) who will guide his spiritual development. Frequent [[Confession (religion)#Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism|confession of sins]] and participation in the [[sacred mysteries]] (sacraments) of the church is an important part of Orthodox monastic life.

A novice is free to leave the monastery at any time, and the superior is also free to dismiss the novice at any time if, for instance, he or she feels the novice is not called to monasticism or if there have been discipline issues. If, however, the novice perseveres, after a period of around three years the hegumen may choose to clothe him in the first (beginning) rank of monasticism: the [[rassaphore]].

==Sports==
In [[National Hunt racing]], a [[Novice (racehorse)|novice]] is a horse that has not won a race under a particular code (either [[National Hunt racing#Types of race|chasing or hurdling]]) before the current season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2805685.stm|title=National Hunt races|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 February 2010 | date=3 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[figure skating competition]]s, novice has two meanings. For the [[U.S. Figure Skating]] Association, it refers to a skill level, while the [[International Skating Union]] uses it to designate age.

Novice is a level of [[Minor hockey#Canada|minor hockey in Canada]]. Novice players are usually between the ages of 7 and 8.

In the sport of crew ([[rowing (sport)|rowing]]), the term is used for an athlete in their first year of competition.

In many sports, a novice athlete competing in their first season or league is often referred to as a [[rookie]], and outstanding novice athletes can win [[Rookie of the Year (award)|Rookie of the Year]].

==Online Communities==
With the rise of the internet, a novice is a person who is a newcomer to a particular website, forum, or other social community. These people are usually inexperienced and unfamiliar with the traditions and protocols surrounding that community.

Thus, it's a difficult task for online communities to get novices to contribute. One way to make novices contribute is to make them feel unique which makes them want to contribute. In a study at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], researchers looked at whether reminding users of their history of rating rarely-rated movies at MovieLens.com increased their contributions.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=hcii|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University Research Showcase : Human-Computer Interaction Institute School of Computer Science|date=2004|title=Using Social Psychology to Motivate Contributions to Online Communities|author1=Gerard Beenen|author2=Kimberly Ling|author3=Xiaoquin Wang|author4=Klarissa Chang|author5=Dan Frankowski|website=Repository.cmu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that reminding users of their uniqueness increased their willingness to contribute.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"/&gt; The study also looked at whether goal-setting could help users contribute more to the community. The study found that users with specific goals contributed more than users with a do-your-best goal.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"/&gt;

Slang terms include "newbie" and the more derogatory "noob." [[Newbie]] is mostly used as a descriptor or qualifier, a name given to novices by more experienced users or community members to indicate someone who just entered the community and is eager to learn and participate. Noob is a word used to insult or deride novices who are disrespectful, uninterested, or unwilling to learn.

In gamer culture, a newbie is an inexperienced player with a low level, rank, or in-game abilities but wants to participate and improve, and a noob is a bad player who seems disinterested in learning or teamwork and [[internet troll|trolls]] other players.

=== Dealing With Newcomers === 
Online communities have five basic problems regarding newcomers: recruitment, selection, retention, socialization, and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recruitment]] in online communities is about advertising to recruits and ensuring there is a healthy amount of newcomers because without newcomers, online communities can fail to survive. There many different methods that online communities use to recruit new members. For example, Blizzard entertainment used both impersonal advertisement (TV, print, online advertisement) and interpersonal advertisement (recruit-a-friend promotion) to recruit new players for [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers will be a good fit in the community. This is very important because a better fit is more likely to be beneficial for the community, since better fit newcomers stay in the group longer when they join and are more satisfied with their membership. One way that selection works in online communities is through the process of self-selection, in which the potential members decide themselves to join a community based on the information about the community available to them. Another way of selection is through screening, in which the community selects certain members who they believe will be a good fit.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention in online communities is about making sure that the newcomers stick around and stay long enough to become more committed members, who take on more important responsibilities and begin to be identify themselves with the group. One way that online communities work on retention is through the use of entry barriers and initiation rituals because making it difficult to join should increase their commitment. For example, in World of Warcraft, newcomers have to play with other guild members for at least about a month to join.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socialization]] in online communities about the rest of community interacting with newcomer and teaching them the guidelines and standards of the community. For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], old member show the newcomers ropes, by coaching them, helping them with quests,and providing mentorship in general.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection in online communities is about protecting the community from the newcomers. Since newcomers still have not established themselves with the group or still may be unfamiliar with the norms of the community, the rest of the community has to beware of the potential damage that they can cause. One way to deal with the threats is through the use of sandboxes, which allows newcomers to try out the features and learn about the tools without causing damage to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kraut, Moira Burke &amp; John Riedl (2012). ''Dealing with Newcomers''. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stelae of Ankh-af-na-khonsu.jpg|right|thumb|Nuit on The [[Stele of Revealing]]]]
'''Nuit'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} (alternatively '''Nu''', '''Nut''', or '''Nuith''') is a goddess in [[Thelema]], the speaker in the first Chapter of ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the sacred text written or received in 1904 by [[Aleister Crowley]].

[[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] is an [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian sky goddess]] who leans over her husband/brother, [[Geb]], the Earth God. She is usually depicted as a naked woman who is covered with stars. She represents the ''All'', pure potentiality both as it flowers into the physical [[universe]] and as it resides beyond embodiment.

==Goddess of Thelema==
[[File:Milano - Museo egizio - sarcof di Pa-di-Khonsu (22-24 din) - Nut.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Goddess Nut in sarcophagus]]
Within this system, she is one-third of the triadic cosmology, along with [[Hadit]] (her masculine counterpart), and [[Ra-Hoor-Khuit]], the Crowned and Conquering Child. She has several titles, including the "[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Infinite Space]]", "Our Lady of the Stars", and "Lady of the Starry Heaven". Nuit represents the infinitely-expanded circle whose circumference is unmeasurable and whose center is everywhere (whereas Hadit is the infinitely small point within the core of every single thing). According to Thelemic doctrine, it is the interaction between these two cosmic principles that creates the manifested universe similar to the [[gnostic]] [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|syzygy]].

Some quotes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Liber AL vel Legis|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''First Chapter'' of ''The Book of the Law'' (''Liber AL vel Legis''):
"Every man and every woman is a [[star]]." (AL I:3).&lt;br/&gt;
"Come forth, o children, under the stars, &amp; take your fill of love!" (AL I:12).&lt;br/&gt;
"For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union." (AL I:29).&lt;br/&gt;
"The word of the Law is ''Θελημα''. Who calls us Thelemites will do no wrong, if he look but close into the word. For there are therein Three Grades, the Hermit, and the Lover, and the [[Geb|man of Earth]]. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." (AL I:39-40).&lt;br/&gt;
"For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect." (AL I:44).&lt;br/&gt;
"Invoke me under my stars! Love is the law, love under will. [...]" (AL I:57).&lt;br/&gt;
"I give unimaginable joys on earth: certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death; peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy; nor do I demand aught in sacrifice." (AL I:58).

In ''[[The Equinox of the Gods (Crowley)|The Equinox of the Gods]]'' (ch. 7, section 6),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=Remarks on the method of receiving Liber Legis, on the Conditions prevailing at the time of the writing, and on certain technical difficulties connected with the Literary form of the Book.|url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/equinox-of-the-gods/eqotg7.html|work=The Equinox of the Gods|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley writes of Nuit in comparison to [[Christianity]]:

:"Nuit cries: "I love you," like a lover; when even [[John the Evangelist|John]] reached only to the cold impersonal proposition "[[Love of God|God is love]]." She woos like a [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]; whispers "To me!" in every ear; [[Jesus]], with needless verb, appeals vehemently to them "that labour and are heavy laden." Yet She who can promise in the present, says: "I give unimaginable joys on [[earth]]," making life worth while; "certainty, not faith, while in life, upon death," the electric light Knowledge for the churchyard corpsecandle Faith, making life fear-free, and death itself worth while: "peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy," making mind and body at ease that soul may be free to transcend them when It will."

The following are quotes from Crowley's commentaries to ''The Book of the Law''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|title=The Old and New Commentaries to Liber AL by Crowley|url=http://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/L_220wcomments.txt|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Note that Heaven is not a place where Gods Live; Nuit is [[Heaven]], itself."
* "Nuit is All that which exists, and the condition of that existence. Hadit is the Principle which causes modifications in this Being. This explains how one may call Nuit Matter, and Hadit Motion."
* "It should be evident that Nuit obtains the satisfaction of Her Nature when the parts of Her Body fulfill their own Nature. The sacrament of life is not only so from the point of view of the celebrants, but from that of the divinity invoked."

==Mythology==
{{Main|Nut (goddess)}}
In [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] was the sky goddess. She is the daughter of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Tefnut]].

The sun god [[Ra]] entered her mouth after the sun set in the evening and was reborn from her vulva the next morning. She also swallowed and rebirthed stars. She was a goddess of [[death]], and her image is on the inside of most sarcophagi. The [[pharaoh]] entered her body after death and was later resurrected.

In art, Nut is depicted as a woman wearing no clothes, covered with stars and supported by Shu; opposite her (the sky), is her husband Geb. With Geb, she was the mother of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], [[Isis]], [[Set (mythology)|Set]], and [[Nephthys]].

The '''onocentaur''' ({{lang-lat|onocentaurus}}, from {{lang-grc-gre|Ὀνοκένταυρος|Onokéntauros|donkey centaur}}) is an animal from [[Bestiary|Medieval bestiaries]].

==Description==
The onocentaur is similar to the [[centaur]], but part [[human]], part [[donkey]]. As with many [[liminal being]]s, the onocentaur's nature is one of conflict between its human and animal components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast550.htm|title=Onocentaur|accessdate=2008-12-28|work=[[The Medieval Bestiary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention by [[Pythagoras]] was in the time of rule of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], as quoted by [[Claudius Aelianus]] in ''De Natura Animalium''. Aelian as well uses the term ''onokentaura'' for description of the female form.&lt;ref name="pgp_meyboom"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. G. P. Meyboom|chapter=The Onokentaura|title=The Nile Mosaic of Palestrina: Early Evidence of Egyptian Religion in Italy|location=Leiden; New York|publisher=Brill|year=1994|pages=111–114|
url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyTFEJ56iTUC&amp;pg=PA111|isbn=90-04-10137-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the onocentaur as: "its body resembles that of an ass, its colour is ashen but inclines to white beneath the flanks. It has a human chest with teats and a human face surrounded by thick hair. It may use its arms to seize and hold things but also to run. It has a violent temper and does not endure capture."&lt;ref&gt;Aelian. ''NA'' VII 9; Ch. III, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Septuagint]]'s translation of the book of [[Isaiah]] mentions onocentaurs twice, in verses 13:22&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/isa/13/22/s_692022|title=Isaiah 13:22 (LXX)|work=Blue Letter Bible|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "and onocentaurs will settle there and hedgehogs will make nests in their homes. It comes quickly and does not delay," and 34:14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/isa/34/14/s_713014|title=Isaiah 34:14 (LXX)|work=Blue Letter Bible|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;: "and the spirits will meet with the onocentaurs and howl one to another, and the onocentaurs will stop because they have found rest."  The corresponding words in the Hebrew are אִי "island-beast, howler, jackal" and שָׂעִיר, "hairy, he-goat, satyr."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/wlc/isa/13/22/t_conc_692022|title=Isaiah 13:22 (WLC)|work=Blue Letter Bible|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/wlc/isa/34/14/s_713014|title=Isaiah 34:14 (WLC)|work=Blue Letter Bible|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Our Lady of Providence Pulzone.jpg|thumb|alt=Our Lady of Providence, Scipione Pulzone|"Mater Divinae Providentiae," by [[Scipione Pulzone]]]]'''Our Lady of Providence''' or '''Our Lady of Divine Providence''' is a title of [[Mary (Mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. Her feast day is celebrated on November 19.

==History==
The title of "Mary, Mother of Divine Providence" is often traced to her intervention at the wedding in Cana. Christ's first public miracle was occasioned in part by the intercession of his mother. She helped through her foresight and concern to avoid an embarrassing situation for the newlywed couple. Our Lady of Providence is sometimes also identified as Queen of the Home.&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/o/our-lady-of-providence.php Tierney, J. C., "Who is Our Lady of Providence?", Marian Library, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotion to Our Lady of Divine Providence originated in Italy, and spread to France and Spain. The devotion was brought to [[Puerto Rico]] in the early 1850s by the Servite Fathers. According to tradition, [[Philip Benizi]] (1233 – 1285) prayed to Mary for help in providing food for his friars, and subsequently found several baskets of provisions left at the door of the convent.&lt;ref name=Ruiz&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_62IjQ-XQScC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;dq=our+lady+of+providence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVn7vlnIfMAhUGOT4KHbElCPcQ6AEIKjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=our%20lady%20of%20providence&amp;f=false Ruiz, Vicki L. and Korrol, Virginia Sánchez. ''Latinas in the United States'', Indiana University Press, 2006] {{ISBN|9780253111692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Lady of Providence was declared the patroness of Puerto Rico by [[Pope Paul VI]] on November 19, 1969. Her feast day is celebrated in many immigrant Puerto Rican communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiabulletin.org/blog/2010/11/a-community-honors-our-lady-of-divine-providence/ "A community honors Our Lady of Divine Providence", ''The Georgia bulletin'', Archdiocese of Atlanta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1580, the Italian painter [[Scipione Pulzone]] created a work titled "Mater Divinae Providentiae," which depicted the [[Blessed Mother]] cradling the [[Infant Jesus]]. Devotion to Mary, Mother of Divine Providence in the first house of the Congregation of the [[Clerics Regular of St. Paul]] (Barnabites) in Rome at [[San Carlo ai Catinari]] church began around year 1611,&lt;ref name=Barnabites&gt;[http://barnabites.com/marymotherofdivineprovidence#origin "Origin of the devotion to Mary, Mother of Divine Providence", Barnabites]&lt;/ref&gt; when one of the clerics traveled to [[Basilica della Santa Casa|Loreto]] to pray for assistance in finding the financial resources to complete the Church of San Carlo. Upon his return, they received the necessary assistance, and the Barnabites began to promote devotion to Our Lady of Providence.&lt;ref name=Ruiz/&gt;

Pulzone's painting was given to the Barnabites in 1663. It was placed on the altar of a chapel on the first floor of the Saint Charles rectory behind the main altar. In 1732, a copy of the painting was placed in a location adjacent to the main altar of the church of [[San Carlo ai Catinari]] in [[Rome]], where it drew many faithful visitors.&lt;ref name="SP OLP History"&gt;[http://spsmw.org/2009/03/19/history-of-devotion-to-our-lady-of-providence/ "History of devotion to Our Lady of Providence", Sisters of the Divine Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, March 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, [[Pope Benedict XIV]] authorized the Confraternity of Our Lady of Providence, a lay organization created for the purpose of promoting special works of Christian charity or piety. [[Pope Gregory XVI]] elevated it to an [[Archconfraternity]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="SP OLP History" /&gt; In 1888, Pope Leo XIII ordered the solemn crowning of the "Miraculous Lady" and approved the Mass and Office of Mary, Mother of Divine Providence.&lt;ref name=Barnabites/&gt; On August 5, 1896, [[Superior General]] of the [[Barnabites]] Father Benedict Nisser decreed that every [[Barnabite]] have a copy of the painting in their home.&lt;ref name=Barnabites/&gt;

==Patronage==
Our Lady of Providence is the [[patron saint|patroness]] of [[Indiana]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]. The chapel of [[Saint Vincent Hospital]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] is dedicated to Our Lady of Providence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourladyofprovidence.net/ "Our Lady of Providence Chapel", St. Vincent's Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Our Lady of Divine Providence is the patroness of [[St. Benedict's Abbey]] in [[Atchison, Kansas]].

Our Lady of Divine Providence is also the patroness of the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.

==National Shrine Our Lady of Providence==
[[Image:OLP-shrine.jpg|thumb|220px|upright|alt=National Shrine Our Lady of Providence|The National Shrine of Our Lady of Providence, [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana]]]]Devotion to Our Lady of Providence came to the United States after a chaplain of the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods]], Indiana, Monsignor A.J. Rawlinson, saw a reproduction of "Mater Divinae Providentiae" at [[Catholic University of America]]. During a trip to [[Rome]] in 1925, Rawlinson gathered historical information on the devotion to Our Lady of Providence and then brought back prints of the painting to [[Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="SP OLP History" /&gt;

On May 1, 1925, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Providence was canonically erected at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods with the purpose of encouraging families to make [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the queen of their homes. A [[Confraternity]] of Our Lady of Providence was erected, and later a certificate of affiliation of the American [[Confraternity]] was established with the [[Archconfraternity]] in [[Rome]].

The hymn "Our Lady of Providence," by Sister of Providence [[Cecilia Clare Bocard]], is sung by the [[Religious sister|sisters]] at various special celebrations.&lt;ref name="HOPE"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Peter Max''' (born '''Peter Max Finkelstein''', October 19, 1937) is an American artist known for using bright colours in his work.  Works by Max are associated with the visual arts and culture of the [[1960s]], particularly [[psychedelic art]] and [[pop art]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
In 1938, Max's parents fled [[Berlin]], Germany, his place of birth, to escape the fomenting Nazi movement, settling in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], where they lived for the next ten years. In 1948, the family moved to [[Haifa]], [[Israel]] where they lived for several years. From Israel, the family continued moving westward and stopped in [[Paris]] for several months—an experience that Max said greatly influenced his appreciation for art.

===1950s===
Max and his parents first settled in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] in 1953 where he attended [[Lafayette High School (New York City)|Lafayette High School]], where he was classmates with future actor [[Paul Sorvino]]. In 1956, Max began his formal art training at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Manhattan]], studying anatomy, figure drawing and composition under [[Frank J. Reilly]] who had studied at the League alongside [[Norman Rockwell]].&lt;ref name='ArtofPeterMax'&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley II | first = Charles A. | authorlink = Charles A.

===1960s===
In 1962, Max started a small Manhattan arts studio known as "The Daly &amp; Max Studio," with friend [[Thomas Aquinas Daly|Tom Daly]]. Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor [[Don Rubbo]], and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. Max's interest in astronomy contributed to his self-described "Cosmic '60s" period, which featured what became identified as psychedelic, counter culture imagery. Max's art was popularized nationally through TV commercials such as his 1968 "un cola" ad for the soft drink [[7-Up]] which helped drive sales of his art posters and other merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8-eLMuCdfI |title='&amp;#39;7-Up video'&amp;#39; |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Max invited [[Satchidananda Saraswati]] to New York in 1966{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} for a two-day visit which turned into a permanent residence for Satchidananda, who became surrounded by many students who formed Integral Yoga International.

Max appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on August 15, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;"Television Log," Long Beach (CA) Press Telegram, 15 August 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]]'s September 5, 1969 edition under with the heading "Peter Max: Portrait of the artist as a very rich man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=1969 June 6 Life Magazine - The Moon - Edward Villella |url=http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1790 |title='&amp;#39;Life Magazine Cover'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lifemagazineconnection.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128080414/http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1790 |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Max designed the cover photo - as well as the 45 (single) picture-sleeve photo - of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s 'Through The Storm' album.

In 1990, Max purchased a [[VH1#VH1_Corvette_Give-away_Sweepstakes|collection]] of [[Chevrolet Corvette]]s for an intended art project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/peter-max-s-forgotten-corvette-collection-emerges-from-the-dust-after-25-years-162558587.html|title=Forgotten Corvette collection emerges from the dust after 25 years|date=23 December 2014|work=Yahoo Autos|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never used them and let them rot in a series of garages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://restomods.com/forgotten-corvette-collection-rediscovered-256/|title=Long Forgotten Corvette Collection Rediscovered|work=Restomods.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Max's art work was first associated with the [[Counterculture|counter culture]], [[Neo-Expressionism|neo-expressionism]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfineartgallery.com/artists/max/max_bio.html|title=Peter Max (German/American, b. 1937)|publisher=American Fine Art Editions, Inc.|accessdate=22 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223065912/http://www.americanfineartgallery.com/artists/max/max_bio.html|archivedate=23 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Psychedelic movement#In popular culture|psychedelic movement]]s in graphic design during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is known for using bursts of color, often containing much or all of the visible spectrum. His work was influenced by others. Max's repeated claims, varying in detail, to have worked on [[Yellow Submarine (film)|''Yellow Submarine'']] have been denied by the production team.&lt;ref&gt;Hieronimus, Robert R. "Inside the Yellow Submarine". Krause Publications, 2002. Pgs 81-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Max works in multiple media including painting, drawing, etchings (including aquatint), collage, print making, sculpture, video and digital imagery. He also includes "mass media" as being another "canvas" for his creative expression.&lt;ref name="ArtofPeterMax"/&gt;

Max often uses American icons and symbols in his artwork. He has created paintings of presidents [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] in addition to his ''100 Clintons''—a multiple portrait installation. Additional commissions have included the creation of the first "Preserve the Environment" postage stamp, in honor of the World's Fair in Spokane, WA, border murals at the entry points Canada and Mexico by the US General Services, and exhibitions in over 40 museums and 50 galleries worldwide.,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He often features images of celebrities, politicians, athletes and sporting events and other pop culture subjects in his artwork.&lt;ref name="ArtofPeterMax"/&gt;

One of [[Continental Airlines]]' [[Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft (registered N77014) sported a livery designed by Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Max Collector|url=http://www.themaxcollector.com/2010/08/continental.html|publisher=Themaxcollector.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His artwork was featured on CBS's ''[[The Early Show]]'' where his "44 Obamas," commemorating [[Barack Obama]], the 44th President of the United States, was debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3682403n|title=Painter Peter Max At Work|publisher=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper Collins in 2013 published a book of the artist's memoirs and thoughts called ''The Universe of Peter Max''. In it, he relates stories of his life as well as descriptions and thoughts surrounding of some of his artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Universe of Peter Max|last = Max|first = Peter|publisher = Harper Design|year = 2013|asin = B007679EDY|location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Max is an [[environmentalist]], [[veganism|vegan]] and supporter of [[human rights|human]] and [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Eric|title=Peter Max Receives Preserve Putnam Award|url=http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2009-09-24/Enterpise/Peter_Max_Receives_Preserve_Putnam_Award.html|publisher=Putnam County Courier|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218001023/http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2009-09-24/Enterpise/Peter_Max_Receives_Preserve_Putnam_Award.html|archivedate=18 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Jolia|title=One on One With Peter Max|url=http://www.vegetariantimes.com/features/901|publisher=Vegetarian Times|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011052349/http://www.vegetariantimes.com/features/901|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max had a nine-year-long relationship with musician and model [[Rosie Vela]] that ended in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pooley |first=Eric |date=Nov 3, 1986 |title=Facing The Music |journal=New York Magazine  |publisher=New York Media, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1997, Max pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal district court to charges of concealing more than $1.1 million in income from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the sales of his works between 1988 and 1991. The plea came two days before he was to go on trial on an 11-count conspiracy and tax fraud indictment. Under the deal, he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS and a charge of tax evasion, telling a federal judge that he had taken payments in cash, deposited customers' checks into his personal account and arranged other transactions to avoid tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/11/nyregion/pop-artist-peter-max-pleads-guilty-to-charges-of-tax-fraud.html|title=Pop Artist Peter Max Pleads Guilty to Charges of Tax Fraud|date=11 November 1997|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, he was sentenced to two months in prison and a $30,000 fine. The federal judge ordered Max to pay the taxes he owed and to perform 800 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Peter-Max-Jailed-for-Tax-Violations/id-dc84ebf5c82005cc43b1fb42c9fc71e5 |title=Peter Max Jailed for Tax Violations |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111543/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Peter-Max-Jailed-for-Tax-Violations/id-dc84ebf5c82005cc43b1fb42c9fc71e5 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Max contributed to rescue efforts for [[Cincinnati Freedom]], a cow that escaped from an Ohio slaughterhouse. The cow jumped over a six-foot fence while the slaughterhouse workers were on break and eluded capture for eleven days. Max donated $180,000 worth of his art to benefit the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, part of a chain of events which finally led to the cow being sent to Farm Sanctuary in [[Watkins Glen, New York]], a permanent home where the cow remained for the rest of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Cincinnati Freedom: The Legendary Cow Who Escaped a Slaughterhouse|url=https://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/remembering-cincinnati-freedom-the-legendary-cow-who-escaped-a-slaughterhouse/|publisher=onegreenplanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max lives in [[New York City]] and has two adult children, Adam Cosmo Max and Libra Astro Max.

'''Religion in the Faroe Islands''' consists largely of the [[Lutheran]] [[Church of the Faroe Islands]], but also includes smaller Protestant groups such as the [[Open Brethren]], as well as a few [[Roman Catholicism in the Faroe Islands|Catholics]] and adherents of non-[[Trinitarian]] religions, such as the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the established religion since it became independent in 2007; previously the [[Church of Denmark]] held that role.

The [[Faroe Islands]], located between Scotland and Iceland, are partly ruled by [[Denmark]], and as such the people long practiced the same religion as the Danes although religious observance is nowadays more widespread and intense among the Faroese.

==History==

The [[Faroe Islands]] became [[Christianity|Christianized]] between 850 and 1000. Evidence exists for conversions by [[Celtic Christian]] missionaries as early as 850,{{fact|date=August 2017}} but the [[Catholic Church]] was not established on the islands by the latter year. The ''[[Færeyinga saga]]'' is often cited with respect to the early spread of [[Christendom]] in the islands. The saga states that the king of Norway told Sigmund to go by ship to the Faroe Islands with orders from the King. Sigmund's orders were clear: he was supposed to make the 18 small islands Christian, which is what he did, according to the saga. This event is believed to have taken place around 1000, but the Faroese did not establish an organised congregation of the Catholic Church before around 1100, so there do appear to be some inconsistencies in the saga.

Originally belonging to [[Norway]], Faroe fell under the jurisdiction of Denmark in 1523. The last [[Catholic Bishop of the Faroe Islands]] was Ámundur Ólavsson (Amund); he was replaced by the first Lutheran bishop, Jens Gregersøn Riber, in 1540.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 Hindus (0.02%), 66 Buddhist (0.19%), 12 Jews (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 Sikh (0.01%), 149 Others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%) and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church has nearly 150 adherents. There are also small groups of [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] in the country.

The '''Siecha Lakes''' are three glacial lakes located in the [[Chingaza Natural National Park]] in [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], [[Colombia]]. The [[Andes|Andean]] lakes are considered sacred in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] who inhabited the area before the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] in the 1530s.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
In the [[Chibcha language]] of the Muisca ''Siecha'' means "House of the Lord".&lt;ref name=Viajandox&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.viajandox.com/colombia/cundinamarca/lagunas-siecha-cundinamarca.htm Description of the Siecha Lakes]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Siecha Lakes consist of three small glacial lakes, from large to small and east to west; '''Siecha''' (63,893 m²),&lt;ref name=AreaCalculator/&gt; '''Guasca''' (56,846 m²)&lt;ref name=AreaCalculator/&gt; and '''De los Patos''' (20,662 m²).&lt;ref name=AreaCalculator/&gt; Alternative names for the smaller two are '''Fausto''' and '''America'''.&lt;ref name=Viajandox/&gt; The lakes belong to the municipality of [[Guasca]]. Fauna around the lakes are the birds [[American purple gallinule]], [[helmeted curassow]], [[torrent duck]], [[Andean cock-of-the-rock]], eagles and [[orange-fronted parakeet]]. In the lakes the birds ''[[Oxyura jamaicensis andina]]'', [[Andean teal]] and the [[American coot]] can be found. Mammals around the lakes include the [[spectacled bear]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[red deer]] and the [[little red brocket]].&lt;ref name=Viajandox/&gt;

=== History ===
In the colonial period, the lakes were partly drained to extract the [[gold]]en artefacts of the Muisca from the water. In 1855 a golden raft was found in one of the lakes, similar to the famous [[Muisca raft]]. It was named ''Balsa de Siecha'' or "Siecha raft" and pictured in the book ''El Dorado'' by [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholar]] [[Liborio Zerda]] in 1883. The discovery of the raft made Zerda believe that the site of the initiation ritual of the new ''[[zipa]]'' was not in [[Lake Guatavita]], yet in the Siecha Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarín Martínez, 2005, p.239&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the raft was more-or-less legally taken from Colombia to Europe. The transporting ship burnt in the harbour of [[Bremen]] and the raft was lost.&lt;ref name=Viajandox/&gt;

=== Tourism ===
To visit the lakes certain rules apply; visits are only possible on Saturdays and Sundays, access at the entrance point needs to be not later than 10:00 AM and exit not after 4:00 PM. A maximum of 30 visitors per day is allowed.&lt;ref name=Viajandox/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5607">{{About|the figure of Native American legend|other uses|Skin-walker (disambiguation)}}
In [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] culture, a '''skin-walker'''  ('''''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}''''') is a type of harmful [[Witch (Navajo)|witch]] who has the ability to turn into, possess, or disguise themselves as an animal. The term is not used for healers.

==Background==
{{main|Witchcraft#Diné / Navajo}}
In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "by means of it, it goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998. {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo [[Witchcraft#Din.C3.A9_.2F_Navajo|witch]], specifically a type of ''{{lang|nv|'ánti'įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt; The legend of the skin-walkers is not well understood outside of Navajo culture, mostly due to reluctance to discuss the subject with outsiders.&lt;ref name="WHQ"&gt;Hampton, Carol M. "[https://whq.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/3/366 Book Review: ''Some Kind of Power: Navajo Children's Skinwalker Narratives'']{{-"}} in ''Western Historical Quarterly''. 01 July 1986. Accessed 17 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Navajo people are reluctant to reveal skin-walker lore to non-Navajos, or to discuss it at all among those they do not trust:&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016. "What happens when [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions...but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I'm sorry if that seems 'unfair', but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What happens when [[J. K. Rowling|Rowling]] pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions...but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I'm sorry if that seems 'unfair', but that's how our cultures survive.&lt;ref name=Keene/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Navajo witches, including skin-walkers, represent the antithesis of Navajo cultural values. While community healers and cultural workers are known as medicine men and women, or by terms in the local, indigenous language, witches are seen as evil, performing twisted ceremonies and manipulating magic in a perversion of the good works medicine people traditionally perform. In order to practice their good works, traditional healers learn about both good and evil magic. Most can handle the responsibility, but some people can become corrupt and choose to become witches.&lt;ref name="Kluckhohn"&gt;Kluckhohn, C. (1944). ''Navaho Witchcraft''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
Animals associated with witchcraft usually include tricksters such as the [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]], but can include other creatures, usually those associated with death or bad omens. They might also possess living animals or people and walk around in their bodies by locking eyes with them.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter, J. (2010, October 28). The Cowboy and the Skinwalker. ''Ruidoso News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teller"&gt;Teller, J., &amp; Blackwater, N. (1999). ''The Navajo Skinwalker, Witchcraft, and Related Phenomena'' (1st Edition ed.). Chinle, Arizona, United States of America: Infinity Horn Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;Brady, M. K., &amp; [[Toelken, B.]] (1984). ''Some Kind of Power: Navajo Children's Skinwalker Narratives''. Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America: University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Skin-walkers may be male or female.&lt;ref name="Kluckhohn"/&gt; 

Skin-walker stories told among Navajo children may be complete life and death struggles that end in either skin-walker or Navajo killing the other, or partial encounter stories that end in a stalemate.&lt;ref name="Kluckhohn"/&gt; Encounter stories may be composed as Navajo victory stories, with the skin-walkers approaching a [[hogan]] and being scared away.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salzman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salzman |first=Michael |title=The Construction of an Intercultural Sensitizer Training Non-Navajo Personnel 
|journal=Journal of American Indian Education |volume=30 |issue=1 |date=October 1990|pages=25–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Native interpretations of skin-walker stories typically take the form of partial encounter stories on the road, where the protagonist is temporarily vulnerable, but then escapes from the skin-walker in a way not traditionally seen in Navajo stories that take place away from home.&lt;ref name="Brunvand"&gt;Brunvand, J. H. (2012). Native American Contemporary Legends. In J. H. Brunvand, ''Encyclopedia of Urban Legends'' (2nd Edition ed.).

''Star Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes Navajo children take Euro-derived folk stories and substitute skin-walkers for generic killers like [[The Hook]].&lt;ref name="Brunvand"/&gt;

'''Spiritual Assembly''' is a term given by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] to refer to elected councils that govern the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Because the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, they carry out the affairs of the community.  In addition to existing at the local level, there are national Spiritual Assemblies (although "national" in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries).

==Nature and purpose==

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], and [[Shoghi Effendi]] stated how Spiritual Assemblies should be elected by the Bahá'ís, defined their nature and purposes, and described in considerable detail how they should function. Since these institutions are grounded in the Bahá'í authoritative texts, Bahá'ís regard them as divine in nature, and contrast the wealth of scriptural guidance with the paucity of scriptural texts on which Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religious institutions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shoghi Effendi]] (1974) [1938]. ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/shoghi-effendi/world-order-bahaullah/ The World Order of Baha'u'llah]''. Bahá'í Publishing Trust, Wilmette, USA. pp. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal House of Justice]] has added that among the responsibilities of Local Spiritual Assemblies are to be “channels of divine guidance, planners of the teaching work, developers of human resources, builders of communities, and loving shepherds of the multitudes.” &lt;ref&gt;[[Universal House of Justice]] (1996). ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/#d=19960421_001&amp;f=f1-2 Message to the Bahá'ís of the World, Ridvan 153]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On a practical level, they organize local Bahá'í communities by maintaining a local Bahá'í Fund, owning the local [[Haziratu'l-Quds|Bahá'í center]] (if one exists), organizing Bahá'í events, counseling Bahá'ís about personal difficulties, assisting with [[Bahá'í marriage]]s and funerals, providing educational programs to adults and children, publicizing the Bahá'í Faith locally, fostering projects for the social and economic development of the region, and enrolling new members of the religion. Spiritual Assemblies appoint individuals, task forces, and committees to carry out many of their functions.&lt;ref&gt;The best general source of information about local spiritual assemblies and their functioning is National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States (1998). ''[http://bahai-library.com/nsa_developing_distinctive_communities Developing Distinctive Bahá'í Communities: Guidelines for Local Spiritual Assemblies]''. Office of Assembly Development, Evanston, Ill.&lt;/ref&gt; National Spiritual Assemblies have a similar mandate at the national level: they coordinate publishing and distribution of [[Bahá'í literature]], direct relations with national organizations and governmental agencies, oversee the work of local spiritual assemblies, and (in some countries) Regional Councils, set local Bahá'í jurisdictional boundaries, provide various educational services and programs, and set the overall tone and direction of the national community.

==Local Spiritual Assemblies==
The origin of the institution of the local Spiritual Assembly originates from [[Bahá'u'lláh]]’s book of laws, the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]:
:The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly.&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh (1992) [1873]. ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/kitab-i-aqdas The Kitab-i-Aqdas]''. Bahá'í World Centre, Haifa. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage gives the institution a name, a minimum number (nine, for “the number of [[Bahá'í symbols#Bahá’|Baha]]” refers to the numerical value of the letters of that word, which is nine), and a general responsibility to take care of the welfare of others even as they would take care of their own. While the resulting institution is local, in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá'u'lláh also spoke about the responsibilities of the supreme or [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the passage, Mírzá Asadu'lláh Isfahání, a prominent Bahá'í teacher, organized an unofficial Bahá'í consultative body in Tehran, Iran, about 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhu'llah Mihrabkhani, “Maháfil-i-shur dar 'ahd-i Jamál-i-Aqdas-i-Abhá,” (“Assemblies of Consultation at the time of Baha'u'llah”), ''Payam-i-Bahá'í,'' nos. 28 and 29, pp 9-11 and pp 8-9 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; The first official Bahá'í consultative body was organized under `Abdu'l-Bahá’s direction by [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Hají Ákhúnd]] in Tehran in 1897; by 1899 it was an elected body. Because of the difficulties in Iran caused by persecution of the Bahá'í Faith, the [[Tehran]] body served to coordinate both local and national Bahá'í activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moojan Momen]], ''[http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/akhund.htm Haji Akhund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507053240/http://www.northill.demon.co.uk/relstud/akhund.htm |date=2006-05-07 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known what name the body was organized under.
 
The development of a Bahá'í community in the [[United States]] in the 1890s necessitated the creation of local Bahá'í consultative bodies there. In 1899 the Bahá'ís of [[Chicago]] elected a local council based on their awareness of the provisions of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (which was circulated in provisional English translation as a typescript as early as 1900).&lt;ref&gt;The translator was Anton Haddad, a Bahá'í of Lebanese background.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Bahá'ís elected a “Board of Counsel” in December 1900. In 1901 the Chicago body was reorganized and re-elected and took the name “House of Justice of Bahais of Chicago, Ills.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stockman|Robert H. Stockman]], ''The Baha’i Faith in America, Early Expansion, 1900-1912, Vol. 2'' (Oxford: George Ronald, 1996), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] revealed three tablets of encouragement and guidance to the body, including prayers to say at the beginning and end of their meetings, prayers that Bahá'ís use around the world today for their Spiritual Assembly meetings.

In 1902 `Abdu'l-Bahá sent a very important tablet to the Chicago governing body where he said “let the designation of that body be ‘Spiritual Assembly’—this for the reason that, were it to use the term ‘House of Justice’, the government might hereafter come to suppose that it was acting as a court of law, or concerning itself in political matters, or that, at some indeterminate future time, it would involve itself in the affairs of government.... This same designation hath been universally adopted throughout Iran.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stockman]]''The Bahá'í Faith in America,'' vol. 2, 72 (the new translated quoted in this article is found in footnote 139, pp. 448-49).&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Bahá'í local and national governing bodies are designated “Spiritual Assemblies” to this day.

The first decade of the twentieth century saw the proliferation of local Bahá'í governing bodies. Often unaware of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s guidance, they had a variety of titles in [[English language|English]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], such as “Council Board, “Board of Consultation,” “House of Spirituality,” and "Executive Committee." Unaware `Abdu'l-Bahá had told the Chicago Bahá'ís to elect their body every five years, they were usually elected annually or even semi-annually. The number of members varied from five to nineteen (except in New York City, where `Abdu'l-Bahá, in 1911, said they should elect twenty-seven members in order to be inclusive of and to foster unity between that city’s diverse Bahá'í groups). They were male only until `Abdu'l-Bahá said, in 1911, that women should be elected to the local governing bodies existing in the United States; their exclusion from local bodies continued in Iran until the 1950s, because of Iranian cultural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stockman]], ''The Bahá'í Faith in America,'' vol. 2, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of 1900 - 1911, consultative bodies are known to have existed in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Spokane, Washington]], northern [[Hudson County]], [[New Jersey]], the greater [[San Francisco]] area, California, in the United States; and in [[Bombay]], [[British Raj]] India; [[Cairo]], [[Khedivate of Egypt]]; [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Ottoman Syria]]; [[Baku]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Ashgabat]] and [[Samarqand]] in the [[Russian Empire]]; and [[Mashhad]], [[Abadih]], [[Qazvin]], and [[Tabriz]], [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]]. Consultative bodies also existed for the [[Judaism|Jewish]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Bahá'ís in Tehran and for the women of a few Bahá'í communities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stockman|Robert H. Stockman]], ''The Bahá'í Faith and American Protestantism,'' Th.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 1990, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because efforts to organize local Bahá'í consultative bodies remained informal, few additional ones had formed by 1921 (notable exceptions being [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and [[London]]), and some of the ones in the United States had lapsed. Upon assuming the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardianship]] of the Bahá'í Faith, [[Shoghi Effendi]] read `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] and made establishment of local spiritual assemblies an early priority. His second general letter to the Bahá'ís of the world, dated March 5, 1922,  referred to the “vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds nine.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Shoghi Effendi]] (1968). ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/shoghi-effendi/bahai-administration Bahá'í Administration - Selected Messages 1922–1932]''. Bahá'í Publishing Trust, Wilmette, Ill. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also quoted extensively from Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá about the purposes and duties of Spiritual Assemblies. 

The result was a rapid proliferation of local Spiritual Assemblies; a 1928 list had the following: Australia, 6; Brazil, 1; Burma, 3; Canada, 2; China, 1; Egypt, 1; England, 4; France, 1; India, 4; Japan, 1; Korea, 1; Lebanon, 1; New Zealand, 1; Palestine, 1; Iran, 5; Russia, 1; South Africa, 1; Switzerland, 1; Syria, 1; Turkey, 1; and the United States, 47, for a total of 85 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'í Publishing Committee (1928). ''[http://www.bahai.org/library/other-literature/periodicals-supplementary-materials/bahai-world The Bahá'í World: A Biennial International Record, Volume II, 1926-1928]''. Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New York City. pp. 182-85. Data for Germany arrived too late to be included in the list; that year, Germany had Bahá'ís in 37 localities.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The number has grown ever since; in 2001 there were 11,740 local Spiritual Assemblies worldwide.

==National Spiritual Assemblies==
National Spiritual Assemblies are first mentioned in `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]], but the fact that they would be established circulated for years before the contents of the Will became publicly available in early 1922. In 1909, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}} wrote extensively about the role of the national House of Justice (as it would have been known then) in his ''The Universal Religion: Bahaism, Its Rise and Social Import.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}}(1909). ''[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/dreyfus/ur.htm The Universal Religion: Bahaism, Its Rise and Social Import]''. Cope and Fenwick, London. pp. 126-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, also, the Bahá'ís of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] elected a nine-member “Executive Committee” for the Bahai Temple Unity, a continental consultative body formed to build the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. Subsequently the Bahai Temple Unity, which held annual conventions, appointed committees to publish [[Bahá'í literature]], coordinate the spread of the Bahá'í Faith across North America, and review Bahá'í publications for their accuracy. By the time of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s passing in November 1921, the Bahai Temple Unity functioned as a “national” Bahá'í coordinating body.

[[File:Bahai-House-New-Delhi-03.JPG|thumb|Bahá'í House, New Delhi.]]
In the same March 5, 1922 letter to the Bahá'ís of the world that called for the election of local Spiritual Assemblies, Shoghi Effendi called on them to “indirectly” elect National Spiritual Assemblies. He also enumerated committees that a National Spiritual Assembly should have in order to carry out its responsibilities. “Indirect” [[election]] referred to the process, mentioned in the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá, of the Bahá'ís electing one or more delegates from each locality, who would represent them at a national convention and would vote for the nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly. The 1928 issue of ''The Bahá'í World'' listed nine National Spiritual Assemblies: Persia ([[Iran]]); the United States and Canada; [[Germany]]; [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]; [[India]] and [[Burma]]; [[Egypt]]; [[Turkistan]]; [[Caucasus]]; and [[Iraq]]. Of these, the Iranian body was still the “Central Spiritual Assembly” in Tehran, elected by the Bahá'ís of that community; it was not until 1934 that a national Bahá'í membership list could be drawn up that allowed the election of delegates and convening of a fully representative national convention. It is possible that the Turkistan and Caucasus bodies were preliminary as well. By 1953 the number of National Spiritual Assemblies worldwide had increased to 12; in 1963, 56; by 1968, 81, by 1988, 148; by 2001, 182. 

An important part of the process was the establishment of “regional” National Spiritual Assemblies; thus in 1951 all of [[South America]] elected a single National Spiritual Assembly, but by 1963 nearly every nation on that continent had its own. National Spiritual Assemblies are still being formed as areas of the world achieve religious freedom. Some National Spiritual Assemblies have been formed in areas smaller than a nation: [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], and [[Puerto Rico]] have their own “national” bodies because they are geographically separated from the lower forty-eight states; [[Sicily]] has its own because [[Shoghi Effendi]] said major islands also like in the Caribbean should elect independent National Spiritual Assemblies. 

Like local Spiritual Assemblies, all National Spiritual Assemblies have nine members and are elected annually, usually during the [[Ridván|Ridván Festival]] (April 21-May 2). All Bahá'í elections occur in an atmosphere of prayer where nominations, campaigning, and all discussion of persons is forbidden.

The members of the National Spiritual Assemblies collectively serve as the electoral college for electing the [[Universal House of Justice]], the supreme governing body of the Bahá'í Faith, which was first formed in 1963.

Born into a Jewish family, he graduated from gymnasium "Ascola" in [[Warsaw]] and entered the Warsaw University but finally left for a  medical study in [[Paris]]. He became a member of [[French Communist Party]] in 1932. Dr. Flato was a volunteer in [[Spanish Civil War]], became a member of [[Spanish Communist Party]] and served as a Major in [[XIII International Brigade]], where he remained until February 1939. He was interned in France but that year he was released and went to China in August 1939. He became a member of [[Communist Party of China]], and served as a head of International Red Cross doctors at [[People's Liberation Army]].

After [[World War II]], he returned to Poland in September 1945. He became a member of [[Polish Workers' Party]], and [[Polish United Workers' Party]]. Colonel Dr. Flato worked in the [[Polish General Staff]] from 1946 to 1952. Then he was arrested (1953-1954). After political rehabilitation, he served as a Chief Adviser at the Polish Ambassy in [[Beijing]] in 1957-1964, and deputy director at the Department for Asia in Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland. After [[1968 Polish political crisis]], he was forced to retire, but not allowed to emigrate from Poland. He died in East Berlin during a trip 
in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3899">The '''Temple of Amenhotep IV''' was an ancient [[Egyptian temple|monument]] at [[Karnak]] in [[Luxor]], [[Egypt]]. The structures were used during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], in the first four years of the [[18th dynasty]] reign of the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]], when he still used the name ''Amenhotep IV''. The edifices may have been constructed at the end of the reign of his father, [[Amenhotep III]], and completed by Akhenaten.&lt;ref name="Thomasp41"&gt;{{cite book|title=Akhenaten and Tutankhamen: the religious revolution|first=Susanna|last=Thomas|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and layout==
The Temple of Amenhotep IV was constructed outside the boundaries of the [[Precinct of Amon-Re]], to its east. The main [[Egyptian temple|temple]] in the complex was named ''Gm&amp;ndash;p3&amp;ndash;itn'' ('''Gempaaten'''), which means "The Sun Disc is Found in the Estate of the God [[Aten]]". The other monuments were named ''Hwt&amp;ndash;bnbn'' ('''Hwt benben''' / "The Mansion of the [[Benben stone]]"), ''Rwd&amp;ndash;mnw&amp;ndash;n&amp;ndash;itn&amp;ndash;r&amp;ndash;nḥḥ'' ('''Rud-menu''' / "Sturdy are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever"), and ''Tni&amp;ndash;mnw&amp;ndash;n&amp;ndash;itn&amp;ndash;r&amp;ndash;nḥḥ'' ('''Teni&amp;ndash;menu''' / "Exalted are the Monuments of the Sun Disc Forever").

Very little of these buildings remain; they were built quickly, using [[Talatat]] blocks, and could therefore easily be demolished and reused as core for later structures.

===Gempaaten===
[[Image:Gempaaten talatats.jpg|Reconstructed Talatats from the Gempaaten|thumb|255px]]
The ''Gempaaten'' appears to have had no roof and its offering tables were exposed to direct sunlight. In this building (or associated with it) were red granite and sandstone statues of [[Akhenaten]], red granite offering tables and other statues, including a [[sphinx]] inscribed with the name of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] Aten. It was of a considerable size (130m x 216m), but it was so completely destroyed that even its foundations have been nearly obliterated.&lt;ref name="blyth121"&gt;Blyth, 2006, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

It stood within a mud-brick enclosure, and was orientated to the east, possibly with an entrance to the west. It led to an open court surrounded by square pillars and [[Colossal Statues of Akhenaten at East Karnak|colossal statues]] of Akhenaten and [[Nefertiti]].&lt;ref name="blyth122"&gt;Blyth, 2006, pp.121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hwt benben===
Erected to the east, the ''Hwt benben'' or Mansion of the Benben was devoted to a [[solar deity|solar cult]] and was closely associated with the Gempaaten.&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, 2006, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teni-menu===

The '''Teni&amp;ndash;menu''' seemed to contain domestic and storage rooms, and may have been a royal residence, although not enough of the structure remains to clarify the use.&lt;ref name="Thomasp41"/&gt;

The walls of the Teni-menu were reused in the [[Precinct of Amun-Re#Ninth Pylon|Ninth Pylon]] of the main Karnak temple.  They have since been identified and reassembled like a giant puzzle and are partly exhibited in the [[Luxor Museum]]. The reassembled walls show residential, administrative and royal scenes and solar Jubilee scenes of the first [[Sed festival]], which Akhenaten was probably celebrating at the same time as his father [[Amenhotep III]].

The '''Ten Year World Crusade''' (10 Year World Crusade'') ''(1953–1963) was launched by [[Shoghi Effendi]] in an effort to facilitate an organized expansion of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. 

Among the goals of the plan, the Bahá'ís began an enormous effort of teaching and consolidating their Faith, and in 1963 the plan culminated with the first election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], which today remains as the highest elected body of the Bahá'í Faith.

The four primary goals of the Ten Year Crusade were outlined as follows:
:*a) the development of institutions at the World Centre;
:*b) consolidation of the twelve countries where the Faith was well established;
:*c) consolidation of all other territories already open; and
:*d) the opening of the remaining "chief virgin territories" around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MBW/mbw-24.html#gr3&lt;/ref&gt;

A further list of goals for the Ten Year Crusade by Shoghi Effendi can be found in his Messages to the Bahá'í World. 

To those Bahá'ís who arose to open new territories to the Faith during the Ten Year Crusade, the title '[[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh|Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]]' was given.

Before the plan was completed, Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 and the [[Hands of the Cause]] continued the Ten Year Crusade following Shoghi Effendi's instructions until the formation of the Universal House of Justice in 1963.

After its election, the House of Justice wrote:
:"The rightness of the time was further confirmed by references in Shoghi Effendi's letters to the Ten Year Crusade's being followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice. ..."
::(''Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986'', p. 50)

'''''The Jewish Press''''' is an American weekly newspaper based in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and geared toward the modern [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish]] community. It describes itself as "America's Largest Independent Jewish Weekly".&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/about/|title=About|work=''The Jewish Press|accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewishpress.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishpress.com|title=The Jewish Press|work=The Jewish Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the company's independent online daily newspaper.

==History==
The paper was founded as a national weekly in January 1960 by Rabbi [[Sholom Klass]] (1916-2000) and his father-in-law, [[Raphael Schreiber]] (1885-1980).&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/about/|title=About us|work=The Jewish Press |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Jewish Press'' was founded to fill the void of Jewish news media left by the declining newspapers in the late 1950s. Approached by Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] and Rabbi [[Simcha Elberg]], Rabbi Klass resolved to publish a newspaper in [[English language|English]] that, he said, "everyone in America will be able to read".&lt;ref name="The Jewish Press website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpressads.com/pageroute.do/42343|title=50 &amp; 10: The Jewish Press and Rabbi Sholom Klass|publisher=jewishpressads.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue was published on January 29, 1960.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Press website"/&gt;

Elliot Resnick serves as the paper's chief editor. Former editors have included Jason Maoz, [[Meir Kahane]], [[Arnold Fine]],&lt;ref name="The Jewish Press website"/&gt; and [[Steve Walz]]. The online edition is run by [[Stephen Leavitt]].

==Editorial policy==
The Jewish Press covers the Jewish news from [[New York City]], the [[United States]], and [[Israel]]. The newspaper has a politically conservative viewpoint and editorial policy.&lt;ref name="JP"/&gt;

'''Tietäjä''' (pl. ''tietäjät'', 'seer', 'wise man', literally 'knower') is a magically powerful figure in [[Finnish paganism|traditional Finno-Karelian culture]], whose supernatural powers arise from his great knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/595428/tietaja |title=Tietäjä |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tietäjät'' have been most extensively studied in recent years by [[Anna-Leena Siikala]]&lt;ref&gt;Anna-Leena Siikala, ''Mythic Images and Shamanism: A Perspective on Kalevala Poetry'', FF Communications, 280 (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laura Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Stark, ''The Magical Self: Body, Society and the Supernatural in Early Modern Rural Finland'', FF Communications, 290 (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==

The activities of a ''tietäjä'' were primarily healing and preventing illness, but also included helping with farming, fishing and hunting; dealing with witchcraft; supporting approved marriages and disrupting disapproved liaisons; identifying thieves; and bringing success to ventures such as journeys or building.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Tolley, ''Shamanism in Norse Myth and Magic'', FF Communications, 296-297, 2 vols (Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 2009), I 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Their incantations might call on helpers such as the dead, ''[[väki]]'', [[Ukko]], Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, or animal spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Anna-Leena Siikala, ''Mythic Images and Shamanism: A Perspective on Kalevala Poetry'', FF Communications, 280 (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 2002), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ''tietäjät'' knew ''[[Kalevala]]''-metre poems, as well as mythical stories, spells, and healing charms. One of the key branches of the ''tietäjä'''s knowledge concerned aetiologies (''[[Synty|synnyt]]'', s. ''synty'') of natural phenomena. It was believed that beings and phenomena could be controlled if their origin was known. For example, disease could be overcome if one recited or sang its ''synty''. This knowledge was closely guarded. ''Tietäjät'', sorcerers and healers were seen as protectors of a kind of cosmic equilibrium. Different kinds of beings had their own place in the universe, and if beings found themselves out of place, problems arose. The healer's role was often to return the beings to the right place. A sage generally knew the different requirements for different spells, in which often one needed to do rituals and recite spells, often also use magical substances or magic items. Their practices have often been compared with [[shamanism]].

==History==

The ''tietäjä'' is first recorded in [[Gabriel Maxenius|Gabriel Maxenius's]] 1733 ''De effectibus fascino naturalibus''.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Tolley, ''Shamanism in Norse Myth and Magic'', FF Communications, 296-297, 2 vols (Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 2009), I 81.&lt;/ref&gt; People known as ''tietäjät'' existed in real life, though the institution is now 'nearly extinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Frog, 'Do You See What I See? The Mythic Landscape in the Immediate World', ''Folklore'', 43 (2009), 7-26 (p. 10), http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol43/frog.pdf; https://www.academia.edu/3687106/Do_You_See_What_I_See_The_Mythic_Landscape_in_the_Immediate_World.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions of Kalevalaic poetry, and the associated institution of the ''tietäjä'', were aggressively opposed in [[Lutheran]] early modern Sweden (which included modern Finland), but became integrated into [[Russian Orthodox]] culture in [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]], partly assimilating to and partly thriving alongside Christian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frog, 'Shamans, Christians, and Things in Between: From Finnic-Germanic Contacts to the Conversion of Karelia', in ''Conversions: Looking for Ideological Change in the Early Middle Ages'', ed. by Leszek Słupecki and Rudolf Simek, Studia Mediaevalia Septentrionalia, 23 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2013), pp. 53–97, https://www.academia.edu/4049431 (at 57).&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants of the ''tietäjä'' tradition also persisted among the [[Forest Finns]] as late as the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nc-chap.org/cranehook/pdfs/forestFinns.pdf |title=The Forest Finns as Transmitters of Finnish Culture From Savo Via Central Scandinavia to Delaware |publisher=Associated University Presses, Inc. |accessdate=2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the institution before the eighteenth century is obscure. The current scholarly consensus, based on [[Ethnology|comparative anthropological]] and [[Comparative linguistics|linguistic]] evidence, is that Finnic-speaking cultures once shared in a wider central and northern Eurasian tradition of [[shamanism]], most distinctively characterised by ritual specialists being believed to leave their bodies in spirit form. Such people were, in the [[Proto-Uralic language]], probably denoted with the word *''nojta'' (cf. Finnish ''noita'' 'witch' and Sámi ''[[noaidi]]''). However, while ''tietäjä'' traditions clearly have important characteristics in common with shamanism, ''tietäjät'' were not believed to leave their bodies; their supernatural power arose rather from their command of memorised incantations and rituals. It is thought that these aspects of the tradition, and so the institution of the ''tietäjä'' as we know it, arose from contact with [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic-speaking]] cultures, which exerted huge linguistic influence on [[Proto-Finnic language]], and on other aspects of Finnic culture, in the first millennia BCE and CE. This is not to say that the ''tietäjä''-institution was identical to its Germanic models, nor that it did not then change over time. Further influences, for example, came from later contact with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Frog, 'Shamans, Christians, and Things in Between: From Finnic-Germanic Contacts to the Conversion of Karelia', in ''Conversions: Looking for Ideological Change in the Early Middle Ages'', ed. by Leszek Słupecki and Rudolf Simek, Studia Mediaevalia Septentrionalia, 23 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2013), pp. 53–97, https://www.academia.edu/4049431 (esp. 61-67).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in myth and literature==

''Tietäjät'' also appear in [[Finnish mythology]], the most famous mythological ''tietäjä'' being [[Väinämöinen]], 'the mythic founder of the institution', who 'provided an identity
model for its practitioners'.&lt;ref&gt;Frog, 'Shamans, Christians, and Things in Between: From Finnic-Germanic Contacts to the Conversion of Karelia', in ''Conversions: Looking for Ideological Change in the Early Middle Ages'', ed. by Leszek Słupecki and Rudolf Simek, Studia Mediaevalia Septentrionalia, 23 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2013), pp. 53–97, https://www.academia.edu/4049431 (at 75).&lt;/ref&gt; In Kalevalaic poetry, he is routinely referred to using the formulaic epithets ''vaka vanha Väinämöinen, | tietäjä ijän ikuinen'' ('trusty old Väinämöinen, | the soothsayer old as time').

'''Tirgan''' ({{lang-fa|تیرگان}}, ''Tirgān''), is a [[summer solstice|mid summer]] [[Iran]]ian festival, celebrated annually on [[Tir (month)|Tir]] 13 ([[July 2]], [[July 3|3]], or [[July 4|4]]). 
It is celebrated by splashing water, dancing, reciting [[Persian poetry|poetry]], and serving traditional foods such as [[spinach soup]] and [[sholezard]]. The custom of tying rainbow-colored bands on wrists, which are worn for ten days and then thrown into a stream, is also a way to rejoice for children.

==Overview==
Tirgan is an ancient Iranian tradition which is still celebrated in various regions of Iran, including [[Mazandaran Province|Mazenderan]], [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]], and [[Arak, Iran|Arak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farahan.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=482:1390-03-17-15-27-03&amp;catid=74:1388-12-01-10-35-03&amp;Itemid=151 Farahan: A Report on Iranian Celebrations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aftabmarkazi.ir/1390/04/1157 Aftab Markazi: Celebrations in Arak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918214424/http://aftabmarkazi.ir/1390/04/1157 |date=2011-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2rism.net/plugins/tagcloud/tagcloud.php?%D8%AC%D8%B4%D9%86_%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%AF%D8%B1_%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86 2rism: Celebrations in Mazandaran] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120718111809/http://www.2rism.net/plugins/tagcloud/tagcloud.php?%D8%AC%D8%B4%D9%86_%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%AF%D8%B1_%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86 |date=2012-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely attested by historians such as [[Abu Sa'id Gardezi|Gardezi]], [[Al-Biruni|Biruni]], and [[Al-Masudi|Masudi]], as well as European travelers during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era. 

[[File:Arash statue in Sa'dābād palace.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Arash|Arash the Archer]] at the [[Sa'dabad Complex]], [[Tehran]].]]
The celebration is dedicated to [[Tishtrya]], an archangel who appeared in the sky to generate thunder and lightning for much needed rain.

Legend says that [[Arash|Arash the Archer]] was a man chosen to settle a land dispute between the leaders of the lands Iran and [[Turan]]. Arash was to loose his arrow, on the 13th day of [[Tir (month)|Tir]], and where the arrow landed, would lie the border between the two kingdoms. Turan had suffered from the lack of rain, and Iran rejoiced at the settlement of the borders, then rain poured onto the two countries and there was peace between them.

It is stated in Biruni's chronology that "by the order of God, the wind bore the arrow away from the mountains of Ruyan and brought the utmost frontier of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] between [[Fergana]] and [[Tabaristan|Tapuria]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', [[Biruni]] – [[Eduard Sachau]] translation (1879)&lt;/ref&gt; Gardizi has given a similar description, although he notes that "the arrow of Arash fell in the area between Fargana and [[Bactria]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8584">[[File:Philmont Scout Ranch Baldy Mountain from Copper Park.jpg|thumb|Philmont]]
The '''Wilderness Grace''', also known as the "Worth Ranch Grace" and the "[[Philmont]] Grace", is the common name of a simple prayer recited before meals at many [[Boy Scout]] camps around the [[United States]]. The original version, the "Worth Ranch Grace", was written in 1929 by A. J. "Jerry" Fulkerson, Camp Director at Worth Ranch Scout Camp in [[Palo Pinto County]], [[Texas]], part of the Longhorn Council in the [[Fort Worth]] Area.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Faust Nobles, a member of the 1929 Worth Ranch Camp Staff, and a Field Scout Executive of the Council. Interviewed Spring 1980 by Pete Normand, author of the book "Palo Pinto Campfires" (1980); Fort Worth, TX: Split Rock Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fulkerson was also the Scout executive of the Fort Worth Area Council, Boy Scouts of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huffman |first=Minor  |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=History of Region Nine, B.S.A.: 1920-1967 |year=1968 |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |publisher= |location= |language= |id= |doi = |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wilderness Grace in its most commonly used form is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For food, for raiment,
For life, for opportunities,
For friendship and fellowship,
We thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Worth Ranch Grace==
The version of the Worth Ranch Grace that most Worth Ranch Scouts are familiar with is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For food, for raiment,
For life, for opportunities
For friends and this fellowship,
We thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that in the present version of The Worth Ranch Grace that the third line is different from "The Wilderness Grace" and refers to "this fellowship" which is a reference to the "Worth Ranch fellowship" which is a line in The Worth Ranch Song, written by Faust Nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Normand, Pete (1980). Palo Pinto Campfires, pp. 107-108. Fort Worth, TX: Split Rock Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Original Version===
The current version of The Worth Ranch Grace is slightly different from the original version:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For food and for raiment,
For life and for opportunity,
For friends and this fellowship,
We thank Thee, O Lord. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the first two lines are different from either the contemporary version or the "Wilderness" version. This original version is copied here verbatim from a handwritten copy of The Worth Ranch Grace written on a small piece of note paper by [[James P. Fitch]], Region Nine Scout Executive, during a trip to Worth Ranch in the 1930s. Fitch was later General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch and Phillips Properties of the Boy Scouts of America. At the top of the paper, also written in Fitch's handwriting, is the title "The Worth Ranch Grace." Fitch kept this filed away in his copy of the small book "Songs Scouts Sing," (Sept. 1935 printing). This is probably the earliest surviving written copy of "The Worth Ranch Grace."&lt;ref&gt;This book and the handwritten copy of the original version of The Worth Ranch Grace are in the possession of Pete Normand of College Station, Texas. Normand is the son-in-law of Fitch's only son, William D. Fitch.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James P. Fitch===
James P. Fitch was Region Scout Executive for Region Nine (Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico) from 1920 to 1945 when he became General Manager of [[Philmont Scout Ranch]], [[Cimarron, New Mexico|Cimarron]], [[New Mexico]], and Phillips Properties for the B.S.A. Fitch was the man who encouraged [[Waite Phillips]] generosity to Region Nine throughout the 1930s, and accepted the gift of [[Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp]] in 1938, and later the larger gift of land in December 1941 that became Philmont Scout Ranch. If it were not for Jim Fitch's interest in recording The Worth Ranch Grace as it was used in the 1930s, we would not have this earliest version.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Lawrence R. (1972). Philmont: A History of New Mexico's Cimarron Country. Albuquerque, NM: Univ. of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor Huffman===
The origin of The Worth Ranch Grace was corroborated by [[Minor S. Huffman, Sr.]], the first General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch in his book ''High Adventure Among the Magic Mountains: Philmont, the First 50 Years''. In that book, Huffman wrote, "Worth Ranch was definitely the earliest camp to use the Grace." Huffman recalls hearing The Worth Ranch Grace on a visit to Worth Ranch in 1930 with Dr. [[James E. West (Scouting)]], Chief Scout Executive from 1911 to 1943; James P. Fitch, Region Scout Executive; and Frank Wozencraft, Region Chairman of Region Nine. (This may have been the visit by Fitch when he made his handwritten copy of "The Worth Ranch Grace.") This visit in 1930 was the occasion of the official dedication of Worth Ranch, although the Ranch had been in operation for over a year. That dedication ceremony is recorded on film, and may be the only visit to the Ranch by the renowned Dr. West.&lt;ref name = "magic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huffman,  Sr. |first=Minor S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=High Adventure Among the Magic Mountains: Philmont, the First 50 Years |year=1988 |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |publisher=TIBS, Inc. |location=Allendale, NJ |language= |id=ASIN B0006ESMJG |doi = |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faust Nobles===
In his book, Huffman recalled that at the time of their 1930 visit to Worth Ranch they thought The Worth Ranch Grace was written by [[Faust Nobles]], a member of the Worth Ranch Camp Staff during its first decade, and a Field Scout Executive of the Council. Nobles was well known for his talent at writing verse, both in poetry and in song. But in the Spring of 1980, prior to the 50th Anniversary celebrations of Worth Ranch, Nobles denied writing The Worth Ranch Grace and identified Jerry Fulkerson as its author.&lt;ref&gt;Normand, Pete (1980). Interview with Faust Nobles in connection with research for the book "Palo Pinto Campfires," publ. 1980, Fort Worth, TX: Split Rock Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobles also served as head Scout Executive of the Cimarron Valley Council. Nobles also wrote "The Worth Ranch Song," and, in 1947, wrote a poem titled "Novitiate" about Philmont Scout Ranch.&lt;ref name = "magic" /&gt;

===Clarence Dunn===
Another piece in the puzzle was filled in by Minor Huffman when he confirmed that The Worth Ranch Grace was brought to Philmont in the Summer of 1943 by [[Clarence E. Dunn]], a Worth Ranch Scouter and a Scoutmaster from the Fort Worth Area Council. Dunn, a school teacher, became a member of the Philmont Staff in the summer of 1945 with the position of Personnel Director. Dunn developed the Ranger Program and held the position of Chief Ranger for 26 years until his retirement at the end of the 1970 season. If it were not for Clarence Dunn, The Worth Ranch Grace would have never been introduced to thousands of Philmont Scouts from every part of the world over the past decades. Dunn was later honored by having an elementary school in Arlington, Texas, named for him.&lt;ref name = "magic" /&gt;

===Epilogue===
Because of its continued use at Philmont Scout Ranch since the 1940s, The Worth Ranch Grace has been carried home to every corner of the U.S. where it has become widely known by two different names: "The Wilderness Grace" and "The Philmont Grace."

===Northern Tier Wilderness Grace===
The [[Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases]], have modified and added to the Wilderness Grace for use in its canoeing programs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For food, for raiment,
For life and opportunity,
For sun and rain,
For water and portage trails,
For friendship and fellowship,
We thank Thee, Oh Lord. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Northern Tier staff claim the Grace originated with them 90 years ago and that Philmont adopted and adapted by dropping the third line, as there's little water and no portage trails in New Mexico.

===The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve===
[[The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve]] has also modified the Wilderness Grace for use in its high adventure/Jamboree programs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;For this time and this place,
For Your goodness and grace,
For each friend we embrace,
We thank Thee, Oh Lord. Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Yihewani''' ({{zh||s=伊赫瓦尼||t=伊赫瓦尼|p=Yīhèwǎní}}), or '''Ikhwan''' ({{lang-ar|الإخوان|d=al-Iḫwān}}), (also known as '''Al Ikhwan al Muslimun''', which means '''Muslim Brotherhood''', not to be confused with the Middle Eastern [[Muslim Brotherhood]]) is an Islamic sect in China. Its adherents are called Sunnaiti. It is of the [[Hanafi]] school, one of the six major [[madhhab|schools of Islam]]. It is also referred to as "new sect" "&lt;ref&gt;chinese Xinjiao pai 新教派&lt;/ref&gt;  or "Latest sect".&lt;ref&gt;chin. Xinxinjiao 新新教&lt;/ref&gt; Ikhwan (Yihewani), together with Qadim ([[Gedimu]]) and [[Xidaotang]], are the three major sects of Islam in China.&lt;ref&gt;Zhongguo de sanda jiaopai 中国的三大教派  bzw. kurz: Sanda jiaopai 三大教派: Gedimu 格底目 (Qadīm), Yihewani 伊赫瓦尼 (Ikhwānī), Xidaotang 西道堂.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yihewani sect was labeled as the new teaching (xinjiao).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSxYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ma+qi+muslim&amp;dq=ma+qi+muslim&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PoGqTKGfJIO88gaWzdj3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgo|title=Papers from the Conference on Chinese Local Elites and Patterns of Dominance, Banff, August 20-24, 1987, Volume 3|author=|year=1987|publisher=|location=|page=29|isbn=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 it divided into two groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/cn_zgwh/2004-06/28/content_53087.htm chinaculture.org: Yihewani pai] (found on March 27, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was the end of the 19th century when the [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]] imam [[Ma Wanfu]] (1849–1934) from the village of [[Guoyuan]] in [[Hezhou]] (now the [[Dongxiang Autonomous County|Dongxiang]] Autonomous County was founded in [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture]], Gansu Province) - who had studied in Mecca and was influenced by the [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] movement. After his return to Gansu, he founded the movement with the ten major [[Ahong]].&lt;ref&gt;chin. shi da ahong 十大阿訇; das ''Cihai'' spricht von zehn großen [[Hadschi]]s (shi da haji 十大哈吉).&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that rites and ceremonies not standing in line with the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] should be abolished. He campaigned against grave and [[Murshid]] (leader / teacher) worship and advocated against preaching and [[dawah]] in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Shoujiang Mi, Jia You ([http://www.aboutxinjiang.com/zt/Islam/CHAPTER%202-2%20Birth%20and%20Growth%20of%20Sects%20and%20Menhuans.htm Kap.2.2.: "Birth and Growth of Sects and Menhuans"])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tenets==
The follower of the sect radically opposed [[Gedimu|Qadeem's]] tradition which was influenced by Chinese culture.They put emphasis on the principle of "following the book and eliminating customs". Though the founder of the movement was inspired by the [[salafi movement]], this reform movement, unlike that of the [[Wahhabis]], did not oppose [[Sufism]], but rather rejected the excessive veneration to Sufi masters and to their graves.They strictly follow [[Hanafi]] school of [[fiqh]] and emphasize the [[Ash'ari]] and [[Maturidi]] creeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamichina.com/sects-a-legal-schools.html Sects And Legal Schools Represented By Muslims In China]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and Relationship with the State==
In the [[Dungan Revolt (1895)]] the Yihewani backed the rebels against the [[Qing dynasty]]. However, the Muslim rebels were crushed by loyalist Muslims.

===Repression in the Qing dynasty===
The Khafiya Sufi General [[Ma Anliang]], especially hated the Yihewani leader [[Ma Wanfu]], so much that when the Han general [[Yang Zengxin]] captured Ma Wanfu, Ma Anliang arranged to have him shipped to Gansu so he could execute him. As Qing authority broke down in China, the [[Gedimu]] Sunnis and [[Khafiya]] Sufis went on a vicious campaign to murder Ma Wanfu and stamp out his [[Wahhabi]] inspired teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvDOudr5M6MC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=imam+wang+daiyu&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r-ukTPK5HsP58AasqvWvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20yuanzhang%20loyalties%20graves%20lives%20china%20jahriyya&amp;f=false|title=Remapping China: fissures in historical terrain|author=Gail Hershatter|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford California|page=106|isbn=0-8047-2509-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4Lp8tgr3esC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=ma+wanfu+exile+xinjiang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6uukTNHyBcG88gbVtZTdCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20wanfu%20exile%20xinjiang&amp;f=false|title=Muslims in China|author=Aliya Ma Lynn|year=2007|publisher=University Press|location=|page=27|isbn=0-88093-861-7|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of menhuans attacked Ma Wanfu, and the Gedimu requested that the Qing governor in Lanzhou inflict punishment upon Ma Wanfu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwuSpFiOFfYC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=gedimu+ma+wanfu+punish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qf6kTJitIoH-8Aaeqf2cDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gedimu%20ma%20wanfu%20punish&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=103|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation with the Kuomintang in the Republic of China===
Eventually, under Imams like [[Hu Songshan]], the Yihewani was transformed from an anti assimilationist, fundamentalist brotherhood, into a modernist, Chinese nationalist sect which was supported by the Chinese Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] party, promoting modern secular education and nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvDOudr5M6MC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=imam+wang+daiyu&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r-ukTPK5HsP58AasqvWvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20wanfu%20al%20ikhwan%20al%20muslimun&amp;f=false|title=Remapping China: fissures in historical terrain|author=Gail Hershatter|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford California|page=106|isbn=0-8047-2509-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/31-1_007.pdf ALLÈS &amp; CHÉRIF-CHEBBI &amp; HALFON 2003], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yihewani was then backed by the [[Ma Clique]] Muslim warlords, who were members of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese National People's Party (Kuomintang)]], which espoused [[Chinese nationalism]], and the [[Three Principles of the People]]. It was favored over the major Sufi [[menhuan]]s such as the Sufi [[Jahriyya]], Sufi [[Khafiya]]. The Salafis were crushed by the Yihewani during this period.

The Yihewani was patronized and backed by [[Ma Lin (warlord)]] and [[Ma Bufang]] to help modernize society, education, and reform old traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confucianism and Spiritual Traditions in Modern China and Beyond|first=|last=|editor1-first=Fenggang|editor1-last=Yang|editor2-first=Joseph|editor2-last=Tamney|volume=Volume 3 of Religion in Chinese Societies|edition=illustrated|year=2011|publisher=BRILL|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbGaMUZ6j5IC&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=222|isbn=9004212396|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Menhuan]] members such as [[Ma Hongbin]], [[Ma Hongkui]], and [[Ma Fuxiang]] supported the Yihewani after they saw it being patronized by Ma Qi.&lt;ref name="Lipman1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Nzux7z6KAC&amp;pg=PA208#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1 July 1998|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80055-4|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yihewani Imams reacted with hostility to Ma Debao and Ma Zhengqing, who attempted to introduce Salafism as the main form of Islam. They were branded as traitors, and Wahhabi teachings were deemed as heresy by the Yihewani leaders. Ma Debao established a Salafi order, called the [[Sailaifengye]] (Salafi) [[menhuan]] in [[Lanzhou]] and [[Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture|Linxia]], and it is a completely separate sect than other Muslim sects in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=ma+anliang&amp;q=wahhabism%20ma%20debao|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=104|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salafis have a reputation for radicalism among the Hanafi Sunni Gedimu and Yihewani. Sunni Muslim Hui avoid Salafis, even if they are family members, and they constantly fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b21aKLh6_KkC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=gedimu+ikhwan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AXmOTNbGOcWqlAf-y8jmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gedimu%20ikhwan&amp;f=false|title=Between Mecca and Beijing: modernization and consumption among urban Chinese Muslims|author=Maris Boyd Gillette|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=|pages=79, 80|isbn=0-8047-3694-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuomintang]] Sufi Muslim General [[Ma Bufang]], who backed the Yihewani, persecuted the Salafi. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become modernist and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be "Heterodox" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEih57-GWQQC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=ma+bufang+secret+war&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lh6YTKKkLYT68AbGy7iKAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20secret%20war&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=|page=79|isbn=0-7656-1747-1|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present day===
The Communist party has continued the policy of patronizing and supporting the Yihewani over all other sects among the Hui.

The Uyghur militant organization [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]]'s magazine ''Islamic Turkistan'' has accused the Chinese "Muslim Brotherhood" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the "infidel Chinese" language is the language of the Hui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zenn  |first=Jacob |last2= |first2= |date=March 17, 2011 &lt;!-- 05:10 PM --&gt;   |title=Jihad in China?

'''Zhu Faya''' ({{zh|s=竺法雅|t=竺法雅|p=Zhú Fǎyǎ|w=Chu Fa-ya|l=Buddhist Dharmic Elegance}}) or '''Faya''' was a Chinese [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265-420 CE) Buddhist monk and teacher from [[Hejian]] (in modern [[Hebei]] province), best known for developing the ''[[Geyi]]'' method of explaining numbered categories of [[Sanskrit]] terms from the [[Tripiṭaka|Buddhist canon]] with comparable lists from the [[Chinese classics]]. The dates of Zhu Faya's life are unknown, but he was a student of the Indian monk [[Fotudeng]] or Zhu Fotudeng 竺佛圖澄 (c. 231-349), and a contemporary of the translators [[Dao An|Dao'an]] 道安 (312-385) and [[Zhu Fatai]] 竺法汰 (320-387).

==Names==
The [[Chinese name]] Zhu Faya combines two Buddhist terms. The [[Chinese surname]] [[Zhu (surname)|Zhu]] [[wikt:竺|竺]], which originally meant "a kind of bamboo" and was later used for "India (abbreviating [[Tenjiku|Tianzhu]]  [[wikt:天竺|天竺]])" and "Buddhism", was adopted by many early [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]], such as the polyglot translator Zhu Fahu 竺法護 or [[Dharmarakṣa]] (c. 230-316). Zhu Faya took this surname in honor of his teacher Zhu Fotudeng, as did several other disciples such as Zhu Fatai (above) and Zhu Senglang 竺僧郎 , who in 351 founded the first Buddhist monastery in [[Shandong]]. The Buddhist [[Dharma name]] (rather than [[Chinese given name]]) of ''Faya'' {{linktext|法|雅}} means "Dharmic Elegance", with the Fa "law; [[Dharma]]" seen in Fatai and Fahu. The [[toponymic]] name Zhu Faya of Zhongshan 中山 (100&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Hejian]]) occurs in the (6th century) ''[[Memoirs of Eminent Monks]]'' biography of Fotudeng (tr. Wright 1948:367), which describes famous monks who travelled great distances to hear Fotudeng's discourses.

==Life==
The primary source for information about Zhu Faya is his ''[[Memoirs of Eminent Monks]]'' biography. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;(Zhu) Faya was a man of Hejian. He was of a staid, tolerant disposition. As a youth, he excelled at non-Buddhist studies, and when he grew up he became proficient in Buddhist doctrine. The sons of gentry families all attached themselves to him and requested that he teach them. At that time, the adherents who followed him were uniformly well-versed in secular works, but did not yet excel in Buddhist principles. Consequently, (Zhu Fa)ya, with Kang Falang and others, correlated the numerations of items (''shishu'' 事數) in the sutras with non-Buddhist writings as instances of lively explication; this was called "categorizing concepts" (''geyi''). Thereupon, Vibhu (?), Tanxiang, and others also debated over the categorised concepts in order to instruct their disciples. (Zhu Fa)ya's manner was unrestrained and he excelled (in getting at) the crux (of the matter). He alternately lectured on secular works and Buddhist sutras. With Dao’an and Fatai, he often explained the doubtful points they had assembled, and together they exhausted the essentials of the sutras. Later, he established a monastery at Gaoyi, where he tirelessly taught a ''saṅgha''-fellowship of more than a hundred. One of (Zhu Fa)ya’s disciples, Tanxi, emulated his master in excelling at discourse, and was honoured by Shi Xuan, heir apparent to the throne of the Latter Zhao [319–351]. (tr. Mair 2012:35-36)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Gaoyi County|Gaoyi]] 高邑 is in southwestern [[Hebei]] province. Shi Xuan 石宣 was the son of [[Empress Du (Later Zhao)|Empress Du]].

The American sinologist [[Arthur F. Wright]] characterizes Zhu Faya.
&lt;blockquote&gt;CHU Fa-ya 竺法雅 was a Chinese monk who, like several of Teng's disciples, took the surname CHU out of respect for his master. Though he was a northerner, his contribution was to the development of the intellectual Buddhism of the south. He was a careful student of both Buddhism and Taoism. Far more earnest than most of the courtier monks of the south, he was dissatisfied with superficial resemblances between Taoist and Buddhist terms and concepts and sought to clarify and regularize the use of Taoist terms in Buddhist exegesis. He called his system ''ko-i''. In the end it contributed to the understanding of Buddhism among educated Chinese and was a step forward in the long process of the Sinicization of Buddhism. (Wright 1948:327-328) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tsukamoto Zenryū 塚本善隆's Japanese-language history of early Chinese Buddhism used Zhu Faya to typify the "homilist-exegete" (tr. Hurvitz 1969:770) among Fotudeng's disciples.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hether accurately or not, Fa-ya is credited with the invention of ''ko i'', a method of interpreting the Buddhist scriptures by appeal to alleged analogues in Chinese secular literature, specifically the I-Lao-Chuang circuit. As indicated above, there was nothing revolutionary in this, for the Taoistically inclined Chinese who found himself receptive to Buddhism automatically assumed that the two gospels were identical. Reading only Chinese, he had no way of knowing what underlay the scriptures familiar to him, and in all likelihood he did not care anyway. ''Ko i'' is significant in that it is an explicit statement to the effect that textual and doctrinal difficulties are properly solved by scrutinizing Taoist analogues. It is also worthy of anticipation that Tao-an, fellow-disciple to Fa-ya, rejected ''ko i'' out of hand—or so he thought. For the Chinese Buddhist monks who read no Sanskrit—hence for the majority of the Chinese saṃgha—''ko i'' was in China to stay. (tr. Hurvitz 1969:770) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Shruti''' or '''Shruthi''' ({{lang-sa|श्रुति}}; {{IAST3|Śruti}}; [[Help:IPA/Sanskrit|IPA/Sanskrit]]: {{IPA-sa|ʃrut̪i|}}) in Sanskrit means "that which is heard" and refers to the body of most authoritative, ancient [[religious text]]s comprising the central canon of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld/&gt; It includes the four [[Vedas]] including its four types of embedded texts—the [[Samhita]]s, the [[Brahmana]]s, the [[Aranyaka]]s and the early [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=wendydof&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-1867-6}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Shruti (''Śruti'') differs from other sources of Hindu philosophy, particularly ''[[smṛti]]''  “which is remembered” or textual material. These works span much of the history of Hinduism, beginning with the earliest known texts and ending in the early historical period with the later Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ''śruti''s, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and the central ideas of the Upanishadic ''śruti''s are at the spiritual core of Hindus.&lt;ref name=wendydoniger&gt;Wendy Doniger (1990), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, 1st Edition, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618470}}, pages 2-3; '''Quote:''' "The Upanishads supply the basis of later Hindu philosophy; they alone of the Vedic corpus are widely known and quoted by most well-educated Hindus, and their central ideas have also become a part of the spiritual arsenal of rank-and-file Hindus."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanisads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195352429}}, page 3; '''Quote''': "Even though theoretically the whole of vedic corpus is accepted as revealed truth [śruti], in reality it is the Upanishads that have continued to influence the life and thought of the various religious traditions that we have come to call Hindu.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word "{{lang|sa|श्रुति}}" ({{IAST3|Śruti}}; [[Help:IPA/Sanskrit|IPA/Sanskrit]]: {{IPA-sa|ɕrut̪i|}}) has multiple meanings depending on context. It means "hearing, listening", a call to "listen to a speech", any form of communication that is aggregate of sounds (news, report, rumor, noise, hearsay).&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt; The word is also found in ancient geometry texts of India, where it means "the diagonal of a tetragon or hypotenuse of a triangle",&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt; and is a synonym of ''karna''.&lt;ref&gt;TA Amma (1999), Geometry in Ancient and Medieval India, {{ISBN|978-8120813441}}, page 261&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''śruti'' is also found in ancient Indian music literature, where it means "a particular division of the octave, a quarter tone or interval" out of twenty-two enumerated major tones, minor tones, and semitones.&lt;ref name=monierwilliams&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche zruti] Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; In music, it refers the [[Shruti (music)|smallest measure of sound]] a human being can detect, and the set of twenty-two ''śruti'' and forty four ''half Shruti'', stretching from about 250&amp;nbsp;Hz to 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, is called the ''Shruti octave''.&lt;ref&gt;Miloš Zatkalik, Milena Medić and Denis Collins (2013), Histories and Narratives of Music Analysis, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1443850285}}, page 509&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarly works on Hinduism, ''śruti'' refers to ancient Vedic texts from India. Monier-Williams&lt;ref name=monierwilliams/&gt; traces the contextual history of this meaning of ''śruti'' as, "which has been heard or communicated from the beginning, sacred knowledge that was only heard and verbally transmitted from generation to generation, the Veda, from earliest [[Rishi]]s (sages) in Vedic tradition.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeld/&gt; In scholarly literature, ''Śruti'' is also spelled as Shruti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Shruti Shruti], Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Knott|title=Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ts6CwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874554-9|page=12|quote=Quote: There are different views among Hindus about which scriptures are ''shruti'' and which fall into the other important category of sacred literature, ''smriti'', that which is remembered or handed down.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtZRAQAAIAAJ |year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-1867-1 |pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between śruti and smṛti==
Smriti literally "that which is remembered," refers to a body of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down but constantly revised, in contrast to Śrutis (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt; ''Smriti'' is a derivative secondary work and is considered less authoritative than ''Sruti'' in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 656-657&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sruti'' are fixed and its originals preserved better, while each Smriti text exists in many versions, with many different readings.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt; Smritis were considered fluid and freely rewritten by anyone in ancient and medieval Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock (2011), Boundaries, Dynamics and Construction of Traditions in South Asia (Editor: Federico Squarcini), Anthem, {{ISBN|978-0857284303}}, pages 41-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Both śrutis and smṛtis represent categories of texts of different traditions of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 448&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gokul Narang, the Sruti are asserted to be of divine origin in the mythologies of the [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gokul Chand Narang|year=1903|title=Message of the Vedas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2sJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39 |publisher=Рипол Классик |isbn=978-5-87256-097-5  |pages= 39–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, states Roy Perrett, ancient and medieval Hindu philosophers have denied that śruti are divine, authored by God.&lt;ref name=royperrett&gt;Roy Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}, pages 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mīmāṃsā]] tradition, famous in Hindu tradition for its Sruti exegetical contributions, radically critiqued the notion and any relevance for concepts such as "author", the "sacred text" or divine origins of Sruti; the Mimamsa school claimed that the relevant question is the meaning of the Sruti, values appropriate for human beings in it, and the commitment to it.&lt;ref&gt;Francis X. Clooney (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1464680 Why the Veda Has No Author: Language as Ritual in Early Mīmāṃsā and Post-Modern Theology], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 55, No. 4, page 660&lt;/ref&gt;

Nāstika philosophical schools such as the [[Cārvāka]]s of the first millennium BCE did not accept the authority of the śrutis and considered them to be human works suffering from incoherent rhapsodies, inconsistencies and tautologies.&lt;ref name=richardhayes&gt;Richard Hayes (2000), in Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy (Editor:Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 187-212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ma&gt;Original Sanskrit version:[https://archive.org/stream/Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha.by.Madhavacharya-Vidyaranya.Hindi#page/n11/mode/2up Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha], pages 3-7;&lt;br /&gt;English version: [https://archive.org/stream/thesarvadarsanas00madhuoft#page/4/mode/2up The Charvaka System] with commentary by Madhava Acharya, Translators: Cowell and Gough (1882), pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Smṛtis are considered to be human thoughts in response to the śrutis.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt; Traditionally, all smṛtis are regarded to ultimately be rooted in or inspired by śrutis.&lt;ref name=wendydof/&gt;

==Texts==
The śruti literature include the four Vedas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shruti: The Four Vedas|url=http://hinduism.iskcon.org/tradition/1106.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, pages 33-40&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Rigveda]]
*[[Yajurveda]]
*[[Samaveda]]
*[[Atharvaveda]]

Each of these Vedas include the following texts, and these belong to the śruti canon:&lt;ref&gt;A Bhattacharya (2006), Hinduism: Introduction to Scriptures and Theology, {{ISBN|978-0595384556}}, pages 8-14&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Samhita]]s
*[[Brahmana]]s
*[[Aranyaka]]s
*[[Upanishads]]

The literature of the [[shakha]]s, or schools, further amplified the material associated with each of the four core traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 1997. pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the above śrutis, the Upanishads are most widely known, and the central ideas of them are the spiritual foundation of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wendydoniger/&gt; Patrick Olivelle writes,
{{Quote|Even though theoretically the whole of Vedic corpus is accepted as revealed truth [śruti], in reality it is the Upanishads that have continued to influence the life and thought of the various religious traditions that we have come to call Hindu. Upanishads are the scriptures par excellence of Hinduism.
|Patrick Olivelle&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle/&gt;}}

==Role in Hindu Law==
Shrutis have been considered the authority in Hinduism.{{refn|group=note|name=elisa}} Smṛtis, including the ''[[Manusmṛti]]'', the ''[[Nāradasmṛti]]'' and the ''[[Parāśarasmṛti]]'', are considered less authoritative than śrutis.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Smrti", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N–Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, pages 656 and 461&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;वेदोऽखिलो धर्ममूलं स्मृतिशीले च तद्विदाम् &lt;nowiki&gt;।&lt;/nowiki&gt;
आचारश्चैव साधूनामात्मनस्तुष्टिरेव च &lt;nowiki&gt;॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

}}

&lt;/poem&gt;
}}
Only three of the four types of texts in the Vedas have behavioral precepts:
{{Quote|For the Hindu all belief takes its source and its justification in the Vedas [Śruti]. Consequently every rule of ''dharma'' must find its foundation in the Veda. Strictly speaking, the Samhitas do not even include a single precept which could be used directly as a rule of conduct. One can find there only references to usage which falls within the scope of ''dharma''. By contrast, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads contain numerous precepts which propound rules governing behavior.
|Robert Lingat&lt;ref name=robertlingat&gt;Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520018983}}, pages 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bilimoria states the role of śruti in Hinduism has been inspired by "the belief in a higher natural cosmic order (''[[ṛta|Rta]]'' succeeded later by the concept ''Dharma'') that regulates the universe and provides the basis for its growth, flourishing and sustenance – be that of the gods, human beings, animals and eco-formations".&lt;ref&gt;Bilimoria, Purushottama (2011), The idea of Hindu law, Journal of Oriental Society of Australia, Vol. 43, pages 103-130&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson states that the role of śruti and smṛti in Hindu law is as a source of guidance, and its tradition cultivates the principle that "the facts and circumstances of any particular case determine what is good or bad".&lt;ref name=davidlevinson/&gt; The later Hindu texts include fourfold sources of dharma, states Levinson, which include ''atmanastushti'' (satisfaction of one's conscience), ''sadacara'' (local norms of virtuous individuals), smṛti and śruti.&lt;ref name=davidlevinson&gt;Devid Levinson (2002), Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volume 1, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-0761922582}}, page 829&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
The śrutis, the oldest of which trace back to the second millennium BCE, had not been committed to writing in ancient times. These were developed and transmitted verbally, from one generation to the next, for nearly two millenniums. Almost all printed editions available in the modern era are copied manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation of "... almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still extant and superior oral tradition" - M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in: Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Witzel]] explains this oral tradition as follows:

{{quote|The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on.  This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a ''tape-recording''.... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.|Michael Witzel&lt;ref&gt;M Witzel, "Vedas and Upaniṣads", in: Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|1-4051-3251-5}}, pages 68-71&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient Indians developed techniques for listening, memorization and recitation of śrutis.&lt;ref name=scharfe28&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe |title=Handbook of Oriental Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7s19sZFRxCUC |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=90-04-12556-6 |pages=24–29, 226–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of recitation or ''pathas'' were designed to aid accuracy in recitation and the transmission of the ''[[Veda]]s'' and other knowledge texts from one generation to the next. All hymns in each Veda were recited in this way; for example, all 1,028 hymns with 10,600 verses of the Rigveda was preserved in this way; as were all other Vedas including the [[Principal Upanishads]], as well as the Vedangas. Each text was recited in a number of ways, to ensure that the different methods of recitation acted as a cross check on the other. Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat summarizes this as follows:&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;
* ''Samhita-patha'': continuous recitation of Sanskrit words bound by the phonetic rules of euphonic combination;
* ''Pada-patha'': a recitation marked by a conscious pause after every word, and after any special grammatical codes embedded inside the text; this method suppresses euphonic combination and restores each word in its original intended form;
* ''Krama-patha'': a step-by-step recitation where euphonically-combined words are paired successively and sequentially and then recited; for example, a hymn "word1 word2 word3 word4...", would be recited as "word1word2 word2word3 word3word4 ...."; this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Gargya and Sakalya in the Hindu tradition and mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini (dated to pre-Buddhism period);
* ''Krama-patha'' modified: the same step-by-step recitation as above, but without euphonic-combinations (or free form of each word); this method to verify accuracy is credited to Vedic sages Babhravya and Galava in the Hindu tradition, and is also mentioned by the ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini;
* ''{{IAST|Jata-pāṭha}}'', ''{{IAST|dhvaja-pāṭha}}'' and ''{{IAST|ghana-pāṭha}}'' are methods of recitation of a text and its oral transmission that developed after 5th century BCE, that is after the start of Buddhism and Jainism; these methods use more complicated rules of combination and were less used.

These extraordinary retention techniques guaranteed an accurate Śruti, fixed across the generations, not just in terms of unaltered word order but also in terms of sound.&lt;ref name=scharfe28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, Annette and Moebus, Oliver. Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism (Religion and Society). De Gruyter (February 1, 2007). P. 495. {{ISBN|3110181592}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That these methods have been effective, is testified to by the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the ''[[Rigveda|{{IAST|Ṛgveda}}]]'' ([[circa|ca.]] 1500 BCE).&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat|editor=Karine Chemla|title=History of Science, History of Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9w13rSxWcsC|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-2321-7|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This part of a Vedic student's education was called [[svādhyāya]]. The systematic method of learning, memorization and practice, enabled these texts to be transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|title=Ritual and Mantras: Rules Without Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKLxjjXqAsQC |year=1996|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas |isbn=978-81-208-1412-7 |pages=220–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotation==
[[Max Müller]] in an 1865 lecture stated:
{{Quote|The idea of revelation, and I mean more particularly book revelation, is not a modern idea, nor is it an idea peculiar to Christianity. In no country, I believe, has the theory of revelation been so minutely elaborated as in India.  The name for revelation in Sanskrit is shruti, which means hearing; and this title distinguished the Vedic hymns and, at a later time, the Brahmanas also, from all other works, which however sacred and authoritative to the Hindu mind, are admitted to have been composed by human authors.&lt;br&gt;But let me state at once that there is nothing in the hymns themselves to warrant such extravagant theories. In many a hymn, the author says plainly that he or his friends made it to please the gods; that he made it, as a carpenter makes a chariot (Rv 1.130.6; 5.2.11), or like a beautiful vesture (Rv 5.29.15); that he fashioned it in his heart and kept it in his mind (Rv 1.171.2).
