'''Aaron Osborne''' (1947 – December 13, 1995)) was an American modern dancer known for his performances in works by [[José Limón]], [[Maggie Black]] and [[Lar Lubovitch]]. Also a dance teacher, he was the cofounder of a San Francisco presenting organization, Dancer's Group, and its associated dance school, Footwork Studio.

==Biography==
Osborne started dancing only during his college years, when he was a [[premed]] student at the University of Oregon.&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; He transferred to the [[Juilliard School]], where he studied techniques associated with [[Martha Graham]], [[Merce Cunningham]], and [[José Limón]], whose work he especially admired for its attention to human psychology.&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; Between 1969 and 1974, he performed with the José Limón Dance Company.&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; Limón created the central role of his late dance work ''Orfeo'' (1972) especially for Osborne,&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; and he was praised for the strength of his performance in this physically demanding, high-energy role.&lt;ref name=mcdonagh /&gt; Other Limón works he danced in included ''La Piñata'' (1969), ''The Unsung'' (1970), ''And David Wept'' (1971), and ''Carlota'' (1972).&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Osborne subsequently danced with the [[Lar Lubovitch]] Dance Company in works such as ''Time Before the Time After (After the Time Before)''.&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt;&lt;ref name=highwater /&gt;

Later in his career, Osborne moved to San Francisco, where he taught modern dance, especially Limón technique.&lt;ref name=legacy /&gt; In 1982 he cofounded and served as the artistic director of a pair of nonprofits, Dancer's Group (which presented performances) and Footwork Studio (which offered dance classes); both were housed in a building in the [[Mission District]].&lt;ref name=hazzard /&gt;  After a few years, he left to teach dance at the New Performance Gallery, then the home of the [[Margaret Jenkins]] Dance Company.&lt;ref name=hazzard /&gt; Known as a generous and inspiring teacher, he occasionally taught master classes as well.&lt;ref name=varone /&gt;

Osborne died of AIDS.&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt;

In [[Romania]]n [[primary school]]s, a 4-point grading scale is used:

*Foarte Bine (FB, very good)
*Bine (B, good)
*Sufficient/Satisfăcător (S, pass)
*Insufficient/Nesatisfăcător (I, fail)

In secondary schools, [[high school]]s, and universities, a 10-point scale is used, 5 being the minimum grade for passing.

Specifications such as + and −, half grades, and grades like 6/7 are sometimes used. Note that the grades used in primary school are derived from this scale, with ''Insufficient'' meaning "4 or less", and the other grades standing for 5-6, 7-8 and 9-10 respectively. A 10 is not an uncommon grade, especially in low-interest subjects. A 9 is usually considered an excellent grade. The average grade ranges between 7 and 8. A very poor performance is usually awarded a 3 or 4, while a 1 is often reserved for cases of academic dishonesty or some other unacceptable behavior. Grades with 2 decimal digits can also be awarded, e.g. 7.38 means "'very' satisfactory", although in the register (''catalog'', where grades are written) the grade will be rounded. Grades with 2 decimal digits can also be awarded in certificates of final examinations in secondary schools, but in that case, they are not rounded. 

The same system (10-point scale) is used in [[Moldova]], [[Academic grading in Finland|Finland]] and [[Academic grading in Vietnam|Vietnam]], including in primary school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edu.gov.md/?lng=ro&amp;MenuItem=6&amp;SubMenu0=1&amp;SubMenu1=1 Grading scale in Moldova]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alethea Arnaquq-Baril''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Meritorious Service Cross|MSC]]}} is an [[Inuit|Inuk]] filmmaker, known for her work on [[Inuit culture|Inuit life and culture]]. She is the owner of Unikkaat Studios, a production company in [[Iqaluit]], which  produces [[Inuktitut]]-language films. She was awarded the [[Canada|Canadian]] Meritorious Service Cross {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Meritorious Service Cross|MSC]]}}, in 2017 in recognition of her work as an activist and filmmaker. She currently works part-time at the Qanak Collective, a social project which supports [[Inuit]] empowerment initiatives.

==Early life==
Alethea Arnaquq-Baril was born and  raised in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut Territory]], [[Canada]]. Her mother is an [[Inuit|Inuk]] teacher with a Masters in Education and her father was a radio broadcaster with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC).&lt;ref name="DOC" /&gt;

Arnaquq-Baril initially wanted to be a video game designer. While attending [[Sheridan College]] in [[Ontario]], she became interested in storytelling. She graduated from the college's Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning's program in illustration.  Arnaquq-Baril  also completed animation training at the [[Banff Centre]] in a program offered by the [[National Film Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filmcatalog.nmai.si.edu/person/4510/|title=Alethea Arnaquq-Baril|website=National Museum of the American Indian|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Arnaquq-Baril was interviewed by CBC about her work: "The [[Inuit]] culture is primarily an oral culture, there is little written in [[Inuktitut]] about the past and she feels compelled to record it 'while the last elders that traditionally lived on the land are still alive'".[4]

==Film career==

'''Boatyard Music &amp; Film Studio''' is a youth and community facility in Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is operated by the Tanyard Youth Project and was built with funds from the National Lottery's [[Big Lottery Fund]].

==History and overview==
In April 2009, the Tanyard received £367,807 in grant money to buy the building, renovate and equip the studio with the latest music technology equipment. The grant also went to fund a Music and Film Technician's post for three years. In July 2009, James Harding took up this post and oversaw the building work and installation of equipment.

The studio opened its doors for the first time to the youth of the Tanyard Youth Project in November 2009. In April 2010, [[Jonathan Thomas]] from the Ospreys (rugby team), opened the studio officially during an open public event. Shortly after the studio featured in the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]'s BIG Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tinsel Town at Tanyard|url=http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/big_mag_wales_5.pdf|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=National Lottery's Big Magazine|page=35|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045053/http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/big_mag_wales_5.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since opening in November 2009, the Boatyard has played a role in over 400 young peoples and 100 adults lives through music and film activities. It has to date produced 12 short films from various genres all of which are available to watch on its website (listed below) and via [[YouTube]].

In June 2011, the Boatyard Studio was nominated for a [[The National Lottery]]'s Good Causes Awards for "Best Arts Project." Out of eight hundred and fifty projects nominated for the award the Boatyard Studio made it into the final ten. This nomination gained the studio and the studio attention with newspapers such as the [[Western Telegraph]],&lt;ref name="Western Telegraph - National Lottery Award's Boatyard Studio" &gt;{{cite news|title=Boatyard Studio at Pembroke needs your help to win £2,000|url=http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/county/9079083.Help_studio_record_success_with_your_vote/?ref=rss|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Western Telegraph|date=&lt;!-- 5:30pm  --&gt; 11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Milford Mercury and the [[South Wales Argus]]. The studio was also mentioned on [[Real Radio]] and [[BBC Radio One]] as part of a public vote campaign.

The '''''Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz''''' (mostly known by its abbreviation '''BAföG''') is Germany's Federal Training Assistance Act for students at secondary schools and universities in [[Germany]]. Since its introduction in 1971, it has regulated federal [[Student loans in Germany|student grants and loans]]. Students who receive loans and grants under this law refer to it by saying they "receive BAföG". In 2012, 24% of all students in Germany received financial support via ''BAföG''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studentenwerke.de/en/content/baf%C3%B6g-state-funding-students-germany|title=BAföG - state funding for students in Germany|last=|first=|date=|website=studentenwerke.de|publisher=Deutsches Studentenwerk|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25827">'''The Cardus Education Survey: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats''' (Cardus II) is a Canadian report measuring non-government school effects in service of the Canadian public good. The first of its kind to explore the topic in [[Canada]], the study was a survey from a representative sample of graduates of government and non-government schools ages 24–39. The data included graduates from schools in all provinces except for [[Quebec]], which is included separately in the report. The data was collected in March 2012. The report was made available on September 26, 2012 at http://www.cardus.ca/research/education/. A Cardus Education Survey was published in the [[United States]] in 2011 called ''Do the Motivations for Private Religious [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] Schooling in [[North America]] Align with Graduate Outcomes?''(Cardus I), and it was phase one of the overall project. ''The Cardus Education Survey: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats'' was phase two of the project.

[[File:Cardus front cover.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=The Cardus Education Survey: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats.|The Cardus Education Survey: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats]]

== Summary of Cardus II Report ==

Using educational standards based in various provincial documentation, the report concluded that graduates from various non-government schooling sectors—Separate [[Catholic]], Independent [[Catholic]], Independent Non-religious, [[Evangelical Christian]], and religious [[home education]]—exceed in all the measures that the [[State school|public school]] sets for itself and do a better job than the public schools. These graduates represent about 8% of [[Canada]]'s population. The report suggests that non-government schools are important contributors to [[education in Canada]], that they contribute citizens that enhance the [[public good]], and that these schools may have best practices that could be shared across all education systems.

On September 26, 2012, in an interview with [[Michael Coren]], Ray Pennings the chair and coordinator of the Cardus Education Survey described what the report examined.

:::''We show the raw numbers. We control for social economic status and faith background.
:::
:::''So we are really saying, you take a hundred kids, same amount of rich and poor, same amount of church and non-church. We have two groups of a 100 kids. We send these to public schools. We send these kids to [[independent schools]]. What's the difference in their adult lives?''
:::
:::''What we are seeing is a cross section of society who are engaged, who are salt of the earth people, and we actually take a look at most measures of [[civic engagement]], not necessarily political engagement, but civic engagement. On most measures, they exceed that of the [[State school|public school]] graduate.''''&lt;ref&gt;Sun News (September 26, 2012) Why [[private schools]] make better people Retrieved from http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/video/why-private-schools-make-better-people/1863112169001&lt;/ref&gt;

The report states that "Canada's government schools perform very well in international rankings, but by many measures, Canada's non-government schools perform at even higher levels." &lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, D, Pennings, R, Seel, D.J., and Sikkink, D (2012) Cardus education survey. a rising tide lifts all boats. Hamilton, Canada: Cardus, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive summary of the report highlighted some of the characteristics of non-government school graduates. These graduates are likely to have stronger families with more children. These graduates are more engaged in neighbourhood and community groups and are involved in cultural initiatives. They vote more than government school graduates vote. They are more generous with their money to a variety of causes and more generous with their time by volunteering more. In particular, [[Evangelical Protestant]] school graduates have high satisfaction with the quality of their life and seek to contribute to the public good even though they feel that the culture makes them feel unwelcome. Graduates of independent non-religious schools look for fulfillment expectations in their jobs, while graduates of Evangelical Protestants schools and religious [[homeschooling]] understand a strong vocational calling. These graduates focus on educating for employment rather than influence, leaving higher education when they have attained what they need for their future careers. Reflecting back on their secondary education, these graduates have high satisfaction and feel that they were prepared well for later life. Religious attributes of conviction, spiritual formation and practices are evident for Evangelical Protestants and graduates of religious home education, while graduates of separate [[Catholic schools]] appear almost identical to those of public school.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings: School Effects on Graduate Outcomes ==

This section of the report summarizes the findings from the comparison of graduates
(ages 24 to 39) from six Canadian school sectors: Government, Separate [[Catholic]], Independent [[Catholic]], Independent non-religious, [[Evangelical Protestant]] (often called [[Christian schools]]), and religious [[home education]] ([[homeschooling]] families in which the mother regularly attended religious services.) Graduate outcomes are described and discussed under three main themes: cultural, economic, and social engagement; [[academic achievement]]; and [[spiritual formation]]. The report focuses on the school effect, meaning the impact a high school experience has on individuals and families. They are compared to the government school graduates who are seen as the control group.

=== 1. Cultural, Economic, and Social Engagement ===

Based on the survey, The Cardus Report suggests a number of conclusions about the cultural, economic and social engagement of non-government school graduates. First, in terms of income, there is no significant difference between all the groups compared to government school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

For marital status, Separate Catholic graduates were more likely to have never been married, and more likely to marry at a later age than government school graduates. They were less likely to be divorced or separated, and they were as likely as government school graduates to be living with a partner. Independent Catholic graduates were less likely to be living with a partner or to be divorced or separated, but as likely to be married and marry about the same age as government school graduates. Independent non-religious graduates differed from government school graduates only in being less likely to be divorced or separated. [[Christian school]] graduates marry younger and are more likely to be married than any other group. They are also less likely to be divorced or separated and less likely to be living with a partner than graduates of government schools. They are more likely to have more children. Religious home education graduates are somewhat less likely to be divorced or separated and extremely unlikely to be co-habiting. Though they marry at an earlier age, they are somewhat more likely to be married than government school graduates and more likely to have more children.&lt;ref&gt;p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

It suggests that graduates of non-government schools (religious and non-religious) tend to be equally or more involved in politics and culture than are government school graduates.
Independent non-religious graduates act on their feelings of obligation and become involved with political campaigns. [[Christian school]] and [[home school]] graduates feel the same level of obligation, but do not act on these feelings. Their high level of involvement in other activity could be the cause of this.&lt;ref&gt;p. 33, 34&lt;/ref&gt; This trend shows again when answering about environmental issues. Christian school and religious home-educated graduates are notably more likely to feel obligated to care for the environment, but again only the independent non-religious school graduates are significantly more environmentally active than their government school peers.&lt;ref&gt;p.39, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural activities seemed to be shaped by the graduates' community and family interests. Christian school graduates are more likely to join a choir, while independent non-religious graduates are more likely to enjoy a concert or opera. All non-government school groups read more than their government school peers.&lt;ref&gt;p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The two groups who felt most prepared to be culturally involved were home school graduates and Independent non-religious school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian school graduates have had more cross-cultural experiences than graduates of other schools. These experiences are identified as "mission" or "development" trips.&lt;ref&gt;p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent non-religious school graduates tend to trust established structures and institutions. Separate Catholic graduates stand out because of their trust in [[labour unions]].
Christian school graduates and religious home educated graduates show more confidence in corporations and the [[federal government]], but less in the institutions of the federal government, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the [[mass media|media]], and the [[scientific community]]. This may correspond to the perception that society is negative toward the Christian faith. At the same time, most non-government school graduates feel that the government should do more to solve social problems.&lt;ref&gt;p. 37, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduates of Christian schools are more likely that any other group to be satisfied with their lives, but they are less likely to take risks and more likely to conform.&lt;ref&gt;p.40, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2. Academic Achievement ===

Graduates of independent Catholic schools and independent non-religious schools attain more years of education than government school graduates. Christian school graduates were the same as government school graduates. The home school graduate completed fewer years.&lt;ref&gt;p.42-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate Catholic school graduates, independent Catholic school graduates and independent non-religious school graduates are spread out over [[high school]], [[college]], university undergraduate and [[master degrees]], with the independent non-religious graduate having the highest overall educational attainment. Christian school graduates and religious home educated graduates are more likely to have as their highest educational certification a college diploma rather than a university degree, but when they do go to university, Christian school graduates are more likely to have a master's degree, and home school graduates are more likely to receive a Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;42-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-government school graduates are more likely to call their school experience sheltered. In contrast, they also highly valued their high school experience and saw it as a valuable preparation. Catholic school graduates did not show any difference in valuing their high school experience compared to their public school peers.&lt;ref&gt;p. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3. Spiritual Formation and Religious Engagement. ===

By almost all survey questions, Christian schools and religious home education are affirmed by their graduates in contributing to religious and [[spiritual formation]]. They are more effective than all other school categories. These graduates are involved in their church and have done international mission work. They are developing skills for participation and contribution to their communities and neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;p. 47-49&lt;/ref&gt; They are "grounded, contributing, faithful, diligent, conservative, and dependable."&lt;ref&gt;p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The survey's concern is that Catholic school graduates are not different from government school graduates in the faith strength and practice of their faith.&lt;ref&gt;p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings: School Effects on Graduate Outcomes in Quebec ==

The comparison between the results of [[English-speaking Canada]] and [[Quebec]] showed such strong differences that the Cardus Education team decided that the Quebec results should be considered separately.

Responses from Quebec participants included 173 graduates of fully government-funded schools, including 22 who labeled their school as Catholic; 248 independent Catholic school graduates; and 67 independent non-religious school graduates.

One difference is that students obtain a Quebec high school diploma after successful completion of grade 11, not after grade 12. Another significant difference was that all government schools were officially labeled either [[Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] until 1997, when a change in Canada's constitution made it possible for the [[Quebec government]] to make education less about religion and more about language in 2000 by now labeling all schools as either French-speaking of English-speaking. Participants in the survey had difficulty designating their schools, with some classifying the same schools as Catholic, others as public, and still others as non-religious.

According to Cardus, Quebec has the highest proportion of students going to private high schools in North America (17%). Most of these are Catholic. The Quebec government subsidizes the schools on a per student basis, so that a student's tuition is about one-third of the cost.  About half of the total sample of 500 Quebec students survey identified themselves as coming from a Catholic independent school. The number of graduates of independent non-religious schools was too small to draw any conclusions. What the Cardus study was therefore able to do is compare the Quebec graduates who attended fully funded government schools with those who attended partially funded Catholic independent schools.

Three trends emerged from the surveys. First, graduates of the independent schools had a higher satisfaction with their high school experience. They feel prepared for their roles in society, and they have completed more years of schooling, including more post-secondary education. Second, they are involved in supporting a political candidate or a party, but less likely to protest because of the full-time work schedule that they have. Third, their religious involvement differs very little with their government school counterparts.

In the report, Cardus applauded the work of independent Catholic schools in Quebec for preparing their graduates for their careers and their socio-economic contributions to the province and the country, but Cardus also questioned whether the schools have prepared students for their life of faith.&lt;ref&gt;p.52, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparing Cardus Survey Phase I (American) with Phase II (Canadian) ==

In the two reports, many similarities between the countries are evident. [[Christian school]] graduates are more likely to have strong commitments to family, church and faith formation. Graduates are very involved in their churches, in mission trips and in volunteering in non-religious community work. Their views on morality issues are parallel, and both sets of graduates have a sense of a culture around them that is negative toward them.

Three main differences can be seen in the reports. First, Canadian Christian school graduates show a stronger tendency to obtain a master's degree than American Christian graduates. Second, American Christian school graduates donate less and are involved less in political action, but like the Canadians, they agree that they should be involved. Third, Canadian Christian school graduates volunteer outside of their religious congregation more than their American counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cardus Origins ==

[[Cardus]] is a Canadian think tank "dedicated to the renewal of North American social architecture, drawing on more than 2000 years of Christian social thought". Cardus focuses its research in four areas of North American public life: Cities; Volunteerism, Public-Good Services and Support Programs; Education and Culture; and Work and Economics. It publishes four journals: Comment, Cardus Policy in Public, LexView, and Convivium. Cardus Audio is its podcast. http://www.cardus.ca/organization/about/

The word Cardus comes from the Latin root "cardo". In the [[Ancient Roman]] world, the [[cardo]] was a street running north to south in a city. Busy with many markets and stores, the cardo, was the center of business and the economy of any Roman town. Cardus uses this image of the busy street saying, "Cardus's wide-angle periodicals, policies, and punditry come together for a renewed vision of North American social architecture, up and down the Cardus—the Main Street." &lt;ref&gt;p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cardus Education Survey Origins ==

In December 2007, thirty-seven Christian leaders in education and culture met at a [[California]] symposium to explore the through lines that weave Christian education and culture together.&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, D, Seel, DJ (2007) The California table connecting education and culture a work research foundation paper. Ontario, CA: Cardus.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantified and qualified data was needed to learn more. A discussion paper was then published and followed by a research proposal.

Cardus secured funding from the [[Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation]] based in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan; the William Voortman Foundation based in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]; and the Van Lunen Foundation based in [[Chicago]], Illinois. The William Voortman Fund is a private foundation in [[Waterdown]], Ontario, which supports selected Christian organizations, with a focus on education in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Ajah Fundtracker (2012). William Voortman fund. Retrieved from http://ajah.ca/demo/fo/14336&lt;/ref&gt; The Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation supports conservative policy and politics. The foundation has been a supporter of both [[Hope College]]&lt;ref&gt;Hope College (2012) DeVos Fieldhouse. Retrieved from http://www.hope.edu/resources/devos/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calvin College]],&lt;ref&gt;Calvin College (2012) DeVos Communications Center. Retrieved from http://www.calvin.edu/map/devos/&lt;/ref&gt; both West Michigan Christian colleges. The Van Lunen Foundation has been a supporter of Christian education by establishing the Van Lunen Center for Executive Management in Christian Schools established at [[Calvin College]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lunen Center (2012) History of the Van Lunen Center. Retrieved from http://www.calvin.edu/vanlunen/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Notre Dame]] joined in research partnership with an in-kind contribution to the project. The combined value of the funded and in-kind contributions to the project was $1,150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus II, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the first phase of the project published, Do the Motivations for Private Religious [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] Schooling in North America Align with Graduate Outcomes? The research goals of this phase focused the connection between the motivations of Christian education and the outcomes, especially in academic excellence, [[spiritual formation]], and cultural engagement. The Phase I report says,

:''The impacts and effects of Christian schools in the U.S. and Canada have never before been studied in a broad international examination. If the effects of Christian schooling can be better understood, more informed discussions can take place on the role of the Christian school sector in students' lives, families and the larger society. The Cardus Education Survey has just this purpose- to determine the alignment between the motivations and outcomes of Christian education, setting a benchmark for further study of Christian schooling.''&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt, D, Pennings, R, Seel, D.J., and Sikkink, D (2011) Cardus education survey. do the motivations for private religious Catholic and Protestant schooling in North America align with graduate outcomes? Hamilton, Canada: Cardus.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Research Team ==

Ray Pennings served as the chair and coordinator and is a Senior Fellow and Director of Research at Cardus.

Dr. David Sikkink was the head of quantitative studies. He completed his doctorate in sociology at the [[University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill]], and has been in [[Sociology]] at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] since 1999.

Dr. Deani Van Pelt served as the author for the report and is an Associate Professor of Education at [[Redeemer University College]] where she serves as Director of Teacher Education.

Harro Van Brummelen served as an advisor and is former Dean of Education and Professor Emeritus at [[Trinity Western University]], and currently the Executive Director of Christian Studies International.

Amy von Heyking served as an advisor and is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Education at the [[University of Lethbridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Cardus II, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology of Quantitative Research ==

The American Survey (Phase I)used two web-based surveys. Questions about schooling history were included in the Science of Generosity Survey conducted in 2010. This survey was conducted by survey firm Knowledge Networks. This survey included nearly 2000 randomly sampled Americans ages 24 to 39 who completed a 60-minute survey. The survey included questions about academic excellence, spiritual formation, and cultural engagement. Toward the end of the survey, participants were asked to identify the type of high school that they attended. Choices included public, Catholic, conservative Protestant or "Christian school", other Christian, non-Christian religious, non-religious private or home-school.  The second survey, also done by Knowledge Networks, included 1,003 graduates of non-government schools and 505 graduates of government schools. Graduates were sorted by the type of school, such as Catholic, evangelical Protestant, non-religious private, and home school. The survey includes questions about academic excellence, spiritual formation, and cultural engagement. Participants responded to a thirty-minute survey.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus I, p. 44, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Survey (Phase II) was a parallel survey. A survey of randomly selected Canadians was administered by Vision Critical, a division of [[Angus Reid Public Opinion|Angus Reid]]. This survey included a large oversample of non-government school graduates that was limited to participants between 23 and 40 years of age. Respondents chose from the following options: Catholic, conservative Protestant or "Christian school," other Protestant school, or other type of independent school. In addition, respondents were asked the name and location of the high school from which they graduated. From these responses, participants were sorted into categories of public, separate Catholic, independent Catholic, non-religious independent, "Christian," and home school.  The forty-five-minute survey included questions about academic excellence, spiritual formation, and cultural engagement. In order to make the survey instrument comparable to the United States sample of the Cardus Education Study, several questions were replicated from the Knowledge Networks survey.

The distribution of English-speaking, non-government high school participants in the analysis was as follows:
* 683 Public
* 368 Separate Catholic
* 49 Independent Catholic
* 110 Conservative Protestant or "Christian School"
* 112 Non-religious independent
* 34 Religious home school &lt;ref&gt;Cardus II, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The small number of home school graduates that were identified puts into question the validity of the sample. Other larger surveys have been done that may reflect more clearly on the academic excellence, spiritual formation and cultural engagement of home school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Arai, A. B. (2000). Reasons for home schooling in canada. Canadian Journal of Education / Revue Canadienne De l'Éducation, 25(3), 204-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Cardus Education Survey had participants from [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]]
(5), [[Jewish schools]] (15), [[Sikh]] schools (2), mainline Protestant schools(22), and non-religiously-defined home school (17), the Cardus team decided that the numbers in each category were insufficient to study them as distinct groups, and they could not naturally be collapsed into another category. Responses from graduates of these categories were not analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus II, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dora Sakayan''' ([[classical Armenian orthography]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայեան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayean}}; [[Armenian orthography reform|reformed]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayan}}; born January 24, 1931), Professor of German Studies (retired), McGill University. Specializing initially as a Germanist, today she is known for her work in various areas of [[Applied Linguistics]]. Sakayan is also noted for pioneering Armenology in Canada, and introducing the two branches of the Armenian language, [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]], to the English-speaking world.

==Early life, education and career==
Sakayan was born in 1931 in Salonica, Greece, to Armenian parents who had escaped the [[Armenian Genocide]]. She grew up in a multilingual environment, with her first languages being Western Armenian and Modern Greek, and she received early exposure to German, French and Turkish. After immigrating to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]], she received her education in Eastern Armenian and Russian. Later on, she mastered English and learned other languages.

Sakayan received her elementary education at the Armenian Gulabi Gulbenkian School in Salonica. She then attended the local German high school Deutsche Schule Saloniki. She was 11&amp;nbsp;years old when her family moved to Vienna, Austria, where she pursued her high school education at the Gymnasium for girls in the 7th District of Vienna "Oberschule für Mädchen, Wien VII."

In 1946, Sakayan’s family repatriated to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] where she completed her secondary education. In 1948, she was admitted to the [[Yerevan State Linguistic University|Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages]] (YSPL) where she graduated with a diploma in [[Germanic languages|Germanic linguistics]] and in [[Pedagogy]] in 1952. She was then appointed as an instructor of German at YSPL, where she taught from 1952 to 1956. Subsequently, she was invited to teach in the Department of [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic philology|Germanic Philology]] at [[Yerevan State University]] (YSU, 1956–1958).

Sakayan began her graduate studies in Germanic philology in 1958 at the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (LMSU), completing them in 1961. Over the following four years, she shared her time between Moscow and Yerevan to pursue her teaching duties in Germanic Philology at YSU and complete her PhD thesis while raising her two young children. She obtained her PhD in Germanic Philology from [[Moscow Lomonosov University]] in 1965.

In 1965, Sakayan became Head of the Department of Foreign languages of YSU, a position she held for ten years. At the same time, she delivered lectures in the Department of Romance-Germanic Philology of YSU.

Sakayan immigrated to Canada in January 1975 and began to teach German at two universities: [[McGill University]], (Department of German Studies) and the [[Université de Montréal]] (Department of Études des langues anciennes et modernes). In 1977, she was offered a full-time position at McGill and left Université de Montréal. Due to her high ratings as an instructor of German at McGill, in 1978 she was offered a joint appointment with the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies where she taught for ten years. Over the years, Sakayan rose to the rank of Full Professor at McGill University.

In 1981, Sakayan began her groundbreaking work in [[Armenian studies|Armenian Studies]] at McGill. At the Centre of Continuing Education, she founded and supervised a program of credited Armenian courses anchored in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies. She edited and prepared for publication a number of Armenological manuscripts of linguistic, literary and historic  interest,&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Sakayan et al. "Sign, System, Communications.

She became a regular participant at international Armenological conferences and congresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org./papers.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also organized Armenological conferences in Canada and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org/confs.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing her mission as presenting Armenian language and culture to non-Armenians, she founded the series "Armenian Studies for the English Speaking World" and published a number of scholarly books and articles under this heading. To promote the publication of her Armenological books, in 1997 she founded a small press under the name AROD Books in Montreal.

After 25&amp;nbsp;years of service at McGill University, Sakayan retired from the Department of German Studies in 2000 and dedicated herself fully to Armenian Studies. She renewed her ties with Yerevan State University, where she regularly spends a few months every year, participating in scholarly projects, organizing international linguistic conferences, publishing her books with YSU Press and organizing book launches at YSU and elsewhere in Armenia. Among many activities in her homeland, she is the supervisor and participant of an ongoing translation project that she carries out with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armin.am/en/news |title=Institute for Armenian Studies of YSU |publisher=Armin.am |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; at YSU.

At the same time, Sakayan continues the promotion of Armenian Studies in Canada. In 2005, she founded an Armenian language program at the Diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in Montreal, carrying on a tradition that she established more than three decades ago (in 1981) at the Centre of Continuing Education at McGill University.

==Works==

===Contrastive grammar===
As a Germanist and educator in the East European tradition, Sakayan has received training in Germanic linguistics and [[language pedagogy]]. This background has led her to applied linguistics, and from the great variety of its interdisciplinary branches Sakayan has concentrated on the following areas: a) [[contrastive linguistics]], b) [[foreign language acquisition]], c) [[translation studies]].

Sakayan includes into the contrastive discussion, besides German, other [[Indo-European languages]]: Russian, English, French, and Modern Greek. As an innovation, she also includes Armenian, a non-European language whose [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] properties set it apart from other languages in the Indo-European family. In fact, in Sakayan’s work, contrastive analysis is predominantly based on Armenian, and other languages are viewed through the prism of this language. The objectives of such an endeavor are to establish [[Linguistic typology|language typologies]] and to identify areas of difficulty in foreign language acquisition. Her work also incorporates the findings of Armenian and Russian data — not always accessible to Western linguists.

Sakayan introduces to the Western reader the idiosyncrasies of Eastern Armenian [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], with a special focus on the verb system and its rich paradigm of non-finite verb forms, called ''derbays'' (դերբայ = participle). Over the years, she has dealt extensively with East Armenian deverbal [[nominalization]]s, deriving from certain ''derbays'': the Armenian infinitive and three participles: the present, past and the future participle. Within the framework of "Nominalizations of various degrees" Sakayan discusses the regular [[relative clause]] (RC), the ‘relative participles’&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Armenian Relative Participles and their Access to the AH (Accessibilty Hierarchy)." In: Proceedings of the XVth  [[International Congress of Linguists]], Université Laval, 1992, Quebec: Université Laval Press, 1993, vol. 2, pp. 361-364&lt;/ref&gt; (RP based on the present, past and the future participle), as well and other phenomena of relativization in Eastern Armenian.

Sakayan contrasts Armenian clausal nominalizations with their semantic counterparts in a selective number of European languages. A noteworthy monograph in this respect is ''Formen der Textkohärenz: Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen''.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Formen der Textkohärenz. Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen [Forms of text coherence. Nominalization as sentential anaphora in East Armenian], Tübinger Beiträge zur Linguistik, 299 – [Tübingen contributions to Linguistics, Nr. 299], Tübingen: Gunter Narr 1986. {{ISBN|3-87808-299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores East Armenian clausal nominalizations that are based on the Armenian infinitive. Sakayan describes the transformation process of finite clauses into economical nominal phrases, gives the morphosyntactic characteristics of these nominalizations, identifies the functions of the agglutinative segments in a synthetic nominalized infinitive (SNI).

===Contrastive phraseology===
Sakayan has also taken a keen interest in contrastive [[phraseology]] in the general sense of the term. Recognizing the importance of ready-made expressions in human communication, she has based her research on self-collected linguistic corpora of phraseological units, such as proverbs and sayings, idiomatic expressions, and routine formulae (gambits).

Sakayan has explored the reproduction of routine formulae (gambits) and their role for turn-taking in conversation and for organizing discourse&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora; Tessier, Christine (1983). "Deutsche Gesprächsformeln in Mikrodialogen" [German Speech Formulae in Mini-Dialogues]. Zielsprache Deutsch 1983/3: pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; She has created thematically and pragmatically grouped bilingual concordances of routine formulae (gambits) for language learning. See the use of such concordances in Sakayan’s textbooks.&lt;ref name="SakayanDora"&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Revised Edition. Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakayan's interest in proverbs resulted in a major [[Paremiology|paremiological]] study accompanied by a bilingual (Armenian-English), thematically arranged anthology of 2,500 proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, First edition: 1994, Second and revised edition: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On the Grammar of Armenian Proverbs." In: John A. C. Greppin (ed.), Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on Armenian Linguistics. [[Cleveland State University]], Cleveland, September 14–19, 1991, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, 1992, pp. 171-201&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs).

Contrastive paremiology being an ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian connections and discussions on cross-cultural translatability.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "Ein Freund kann dir das Gesicht weiß oder schwarz machen: Zum Problem der Übersetzbarkeit von Sprichwörtern" [Problems of proverb translatability]. In: Ferdinand van Ingen and Christian Juranek (eds.). Ars et Amicitia, Festschrift für Martin Bircher zum 60. Geburtstag am 3. Juni 1998. Chloe. Beihefte zum Daphnis. Bd. 28. Amsterdam and Atlanta, Rodopi, 1998, pp. 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Cross-Cultural Understanding of Language-Specific Notions and Concepts in Folklore." In: Alice Sarkösi (ed.), Festschrift for Edmond Schütz, Budapest: Academy of Sciences Press, 1998, pp. 130-145&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Armenische Sprichwörter. Որտեղ հաց, այնտեղ կաց, որտեղ գինի, այնտեղ քնի: Wiesbaden: [[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]], 2001. {{ISBN|3-447-04379-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new introduction that provides an in-depth analysis of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre and can be found only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Reported and Direct Speech in Proverbs. Dialogue Proverbs in Armenian." In: Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, Vol. 16, 1999, pp. 303-324&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign language acquisition===
Sakayan’s scholarly interest in foreign language acquisition is apparent not only in the titles of her published articles, but also in the list of authored and co-authored textbooks, instructional manuals and methodological guides, for the instruction of both German and Armenian as foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these projects demonstrate the benefits of applying the latest trends in linguistics to instructional development.&lt;ref&gt;On newer trends in Foreign language teaching. Expectancy Grammar." In: Semiotics and Language Teaching. Theoretical Principles and Practical Applications. Ann Arbor: Caravan Books, 2001, pp. 9-14&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s and 1970s, while chairing the Department of Foreign Languages at Yerevan State University (YSU) in Soviet Armenia, Sakayan authored and co-authored several textbooks, manuals and methodological guides for the instruction of German in Armenian high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 6. Klasse. (German for the 6th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Coauthor: Z. Svazlian. Yerevan: Louys Press, 1970 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 5. Klasse (German for the 5th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Yerevan: Louys Press, 1969 (1st ed.), 1971 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of German literary]. Yerevan State University Press, 1968 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Lies Deutsch, Erzähl Deutsch! (A reader for Armenian secondary schools with German-Armenian commentary and glossary.) Yerevan: Louys Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of literary texts for graduate students in philology, with German-Armenian commentary and glossary]. Yerevan: University Press, 1967 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in accordance with Soviet censorship rules that deprived expatriate authors of authorship, the production of all books carrying her name had to be discontinued after Sakayan’s departure to Canada in 1975.

After resettling in Canada, Sakayan continued her research in Foreign Language Methodology. In close collaboration with Professor Christine Tessier of Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada, Sakayan conducted the research project dedicated to German Stereotyped Speech Forms in Mini-Dialogues. Sakayan and Tessier laid the groundwork for a new method of communicative exercises that has received widespread recognition in the area of DaF (Deutsch als Fremdsprache, or German as a Foreign Language). The project resulted in a book called Rede und Antwort,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely used as a supplement to other DaF textbooks at universities; in 1991 it was declared in the AOL-Reference Manual as "a hit textbook for DaF."

The innovative method is based on the introduction of German Stereotyped Speech Forms, or gambits, known for their important role in languages while turn-taking in interaction. Gambits used at the beginning of an utterance are seen as cues that signal not only the illocutionary feature of an utterance, but also its syntactic-semantic unfolding. The method broadly applies [[speech act theory]] and [[text linguistics]], as well as some insights of "grammar of expectancy," to the teaching of DaF. The Rede und Antwort exercises have proven to be an effective means for promoting oral skills in the classroom, which are readily applicable in real life-settings.

Inspired by the success of the Rede und Antwort, in the 1990s Sakayan launched and carried out a completely new project: an introductory university textbook for Western Armenian (Western Armenian for the English-speaking World: A Contrastive Approach). The textbook, which first appeared in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Modern Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach. Montreal: Arod Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-9699879-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws on more recent achievements of linguistics in the instruction of Western Armenian. It demonstrates the great potential that contrastive linguistics has for the advancement of foreign language teaching by outlining Armenian-English contrasts throughout the course. It also applies the insights of text linguistics and grammar of expectancy by enhancing the production of correct grammatical forms anticipated by the reproduction of certain ready-made routine formulae. The textbook is conceptualized pragmatically, enabling students to carry out speech acts fundamental for communication. Although grammar receives proper attention, other linguistic aspects such as word formation, semantic vocabulary groups, pronunciation, orthography, etc. are also treated on a regular basis. The textbook was received positively and was adopted by Armenian Studies Programs at universities and schools worldwide.

In 2007, Sakayan published a new Armenian textbook, this time on Eastern Armenian,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also accompanied by a CD-Rom featuring Eastern Armenian native speakers. To bring the level of the existing Western Armenian textbook to that of its Eastern Armenian counterpart, in 2012 Sakayan published a second and revised edition (with CD-Rom).&lt;ref name="SakayanDora" /&gt;

Both titles are now published by YSU Press. They are consistent in methodology and structure, with a vast amount of linguistic material proportionally distributed among 12 Units, which each consist of 12 sections. These twin Armenian textbooks are considered to be the highlight of Sakayan’s career, reflecting a lifetime of pedagogical and scholarly experience in foreign language teaching and research in applied linguistics.

===Armenian genocide===
Sakayan is also a major contributor to the study of the Armenian Genocide. In 1993, she came across the journal of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Garabed Hatcherian, and has since dedicated herself to its publication and dissemination. The journal is a chronicle of the Smyrna catastrophe of 1922, which describes how the ancient port city in Asia Minor was destroyed by a massive fire, whereby the entire Christian population was either massacred or forced to flee. The journal is also a detailed account of the hardship Dr. Hatcherian and his family of eight endured in September 1922. Dr. Hatcherian’s diary is considered to be the most widely translated book about the Armenian Genocide. So far, the journal has appeared in nine languages, three of which were translated by Sakayan, who is also the general editor of all editions. All volumes include a detailed biography of the author, a literary analysis of the journal in an expanded introduction, 52 annotations of an historical and cultural nature, an afterword, and a bibliography. The meticulous editorial work has made ''An Armenian Doctor in Turkey'' a book that has received a highly favorable international reception&lt;ref&gt;[See worldwide reception of Dr. Hatcherian's Diary pp. 175-207] Ed.

This latest edition of Theodik’s Hushartsan, published in commemoration of the 95th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, is a bilingual production (Armenian and Turkish) with a trilingual introductory section (Armenian, Turkish, and English) dedicated to the memory of [[Hrant Dink]], the Armenian journalist who was murdered in Istanbul in 2007. Also included in this volume is an Armenian and Turkish index of the names of the 761 Armenian martyrs of April 11 (April 24 according to the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/06/08/theodik/ |title=Theodik’s ‘Memorial to April 11′ Republished in Turkey |publisher=Armenian Weekly |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the last decade, Sakayan has been working on a translation project with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU. This project has yielded six books that Sakayan and Makaryan translated from German into Armenian and published with YSU Press. The translations are predominantly eyewitness testimonies of the Armenian Genocide&lt;ref name=Kunzler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Künzler, Dreissig Jahre Dienst am Orient [Thirty Years of Service in the Orient] Basel 1933, Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan and Evelina Makarian (Յակոբ Քյունցլեր, Երեսուն տարի ծառայություն Արևելքում), Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-1026-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwei Kriegsjahre in Konstantinopel, Skizzen Deutsch-Jungtürkischer Moral und Politik von Dr. Harry Stuermer, Korrespondent der "Kölnischen Zeitung" In Konstantinopel, 1915–1916, Verlag Payot, Lausanne, 1917. Translation from German into Armenian in progress.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Sakayan has collected from libraries in German-speaking countries.

Sakayan's latest (and most important) work is a book entitled «Man treibt sie in die Wüste»; Clara und Fritz Sigrist-Hilty als Augenzeugen des Völkermordes an den Armeniern 1915–1918 ["They drive them into the desert": Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty as eyewitnesses of the Armenian Genocide 1915-1918] on the writings of Clara Sigrist-Hilty (1884–1988). One day after their church wedding in April 1915, the civil engineer Fritz Sigrist and the nurse Clara Hilty take the train from Werdenberg (Switzerland) and travel through the war zone to South-Eastern Turkey, where Fritz has been working at the construction of the Baghdad railway since 1910. They settle in Keller (today’s Fevzipaşa), a little town on the flank of the Amanus mountains. Shortly after their arrival, the Armenian deportations start and thousands of Armenians walk past their window. For three years the couple has to witness «the lapsing of human lights down there in the steep gorge» while they live their everyday life in their little house on the remote hillside. A visit to Aleppo makes them realize that what they were seeing in Keller on a daily basis was nothing but premeditated death marches. Things deteriorate when the skilled Armenian workers at the Baghdad railway construction site must also join those death marches. Clara feels obliged to record the atrocities, first in her journal, and later in a special eyewitness account. Fritz in his turn writes some important essays on the subject.

Sakayan has deciphered and transcribed the documents written in Gothic handwriting; she has meticulously processed the data and embedded them in the historic events of the time. Moreover, based on a memoir by Haig Aramian, Sakayan recounts the adventurous story of how in June 1916 the couple Sigrist-Hilty helped their Armenian storehouse manager Aramian to escape certain death. The structure of the book presented itself from the available archival materials. The book consists of three parts, each centered around one main character: Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty, and Haig Aramian. Through a thoughtful interplay of primary and secondary texts, Sakayan tells a coherent story of endless human suffering, but also of Christian compassion and selflessness.

===Translations===
At an early stage of her career, Sakayan’s knowledge of languages directed her towards translation and interpretation, and some of her translations were published early on.&lt;ref&gt;Manouk Abeghian (1865–1944) Der armenische Volksglaube [Armenian Folk Beliefs].

This furthered her interest in the theoretical aspects of translation. During the Summer semesters between 1981 and 1986, her contact and collaboration with the Translation Department of Saarbrücken University in Germany (Chairman: Dr. Wolfram Wilss) intensified her involvement and productivity in that field and resulted in several articles published in scholarly journals and books, as well as in several papers presented at international conferences.

{{see also|Utopian and dystopian fiction}}
A '''dystopia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δυσ- "bad" and τόπος "place"; alternatively, '''cacotopia''',&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 19th century works ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-03-19|df=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230])&lt;/ref&gt; '''kakotopia''', or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.&lt;ref name=Merriam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; It is translated as "not-good place" and is an [[antonym]] of [[utopia]], a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of his best known work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.

Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories [[setting (narrative)|set]] in the future. Some of the most famous examples are [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Dystopias are often characterized by [[dehumanization]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[science]], or [[technology]]. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been [[totalitarian]] states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.

It should be noted that some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas '''anti-utopias''' function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Utopia Reader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was deployed as an antonym for ''[[Utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches - Part I - November 1850 - November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hansard Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad"), reinterpreting the initial ''U'' as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable."&lt;ref name="Hermansson"&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."  The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Roth, "A Dystopia of the Spirit" 230ff., Chap. 15 in Jörn Rüsen, Michael Fehr, and Thomas Rieger, eds., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230 Thinking Utopia]'', ''[[Google Books]]'' Preview, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]]: "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described."&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1818). ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by [[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', who said it was a better fit for Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' because "it sounds worse than dystopia".&lt;ref name="beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/summary/v073/73.2beaumont.html Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870-1900]. ''ELH, 73''(2): 465-487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Common theme==

===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff153&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff147&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealistic]] in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Utopia"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0-87436-757-3}} (10).  {{ISBN|978-0-87436-757-7}} (13).&lt;!--not verified.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron hand" or "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref name=Donawerth&gt;Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''; and in such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''.

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow.

A commonly occurring theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''Anthem'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind &amp;ndash; only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy. In ''Brave New World'', a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both byproducts of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', loosely based on Dick's novel).

====Social stratification====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the novel ''Brave New World'', written in 1931 by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts "mother" and "father" are considered obscene.  In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', children are organized to spy on their parents; and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'', for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', McClelland and Stewart, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7710-0813-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of this theme is [[Robert Hugh Benson]]'s ''[[Lord of the World]]'', about a futuristic world where the [[Freemasons]] have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a [[Roman Catholic]] minority.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.

In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.

===Violence===
[[Violence]] is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of [[war]] (e.g. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]''). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berne|first1=Suzanne|title=Patterns for College Writing|journal=Ground Zero|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatism and Utopia" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.{{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts. [[E. M. Forster]]'s "[[The Machine Stops]]" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/angulo/volumen/Volumen06-2/articulos05.htm|journal=Ángulo Recto.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''Soylent Green''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2002). Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.

“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, D. (2013, July 3). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Rosenbaum, R. (2013, January 1). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&amp;no-ist&lt;/ref&gt;''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Heitman, B. (2011, April 13).

In his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

7. ''New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

In a 1967 study [[Frank Kermode]] suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.&lt;ref name=jstor1/&gt;

There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do.

[[File:Frank Hoar Punch c1950.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Hoar in the 1950s]]
'''Harold Frank Hoar''', [[Royal Institute of British Architects|FRIBA]] (13 September 1909 &amp;ndash; 3 October 1976), was a British architect, artist, academic and architectural historian.  Hoar first came to public prominence when, at the age of 25, he won a competition to design the first terminal building at London's [[Gatwick Airport]] in the 1930s. His architectural career focused increasingly on town planning in the post war years, when he also became a well known public commentator on domestic architecture in that era of reconstruction.  A senior lecturer at [[University College London]], Hoar was an expert on the [[Bavaria]]n [[Baroque]] and wrote histories of English and European architecture at a time when architectural [[modernism]] decried the value of an historical approach to architecture.  He was also an accomplished [[watercolour]] painter, his work on architectural themes having often been exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

In a wide-ranging career Hoar was probably best known as the cartoonist "Acanthus", where his work appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''The Builder'' magazine; and as "Hope" in the ''[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]''.  His cartoons reflected on the [[Home front during World War II|home front]] during [[World War II|the Second World War]] and were often accompanied by great architectural backdrops.  As a cartoonist during the war, Hoar's political cartoons contemplated the long term direction of the war and of the perpetrators of its worst atrocities.

==Background and early life==
Hoar was born in [[Burma]], then a part of the [[Indian Empire]], to Harold Hoar and Frances (née) Harry, where his father was stationed with the [[British Army|Army]] Educational Corps.  The Hoars were an old Hampshire family, settled in Catherington from the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Lords of the Manor of Lovedean, near Catherington, in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;The family had recently been based in Portsea, where they had moved from Catherington in the early 19th century. Census returns; Baptisimal records of Catherington and Portsea; The Victoria County History (1908) [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41936 Parish of Lovedeane].  A grandson of the John Hoare who was Lord of Lovedean was Richard Ayliffe (1640-82), MP for [[Whitchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Whitchurch]]: [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HW1_upECKUwC&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq=hoar+catherington&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MrFeI8ssa6&amp;sig=XDojK18EV4EHd2VbbjdbkFkw9lw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lbOkTJmjMMyb4Ab5n9jyDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The House of Commons 1660-1690] by Basil Duke Hemming (1983); Martin Secker &amp; Warburg Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;  Harold Hoar's great grandfather, John Jeans, was the Professor of Nautical Astronomy at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hoar's grandfather, Samuel Hoar, married Harriet Jeans, son of John Jeans.National Records Office; family papers.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Harry family descend in the male line from the Owens of Lllullo and, ultimately, from [[Hywel Dda]] and [[Rhodri Mawr]], 10th-century Kings of Wales.  Through that family, Hoar was a kinsman of [[Richard Nixon]], 37th President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Presidential families of the United States; Burke's Commoners, Owen of Llullo&lt;/ref&gt;

On the family's return to England, they settled in [[Devon]], where Hoar was educated at [[Plymouth College]].  At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the [[The Bartlett|Bartlett School of Building]] at [[University College London]] (UCL), with which he was to be associated for the best part of his life.  Studying under Sir [[Albert Richardson]], [[Royal Academy|PRA]], Hoar qualified as an [[Royal Institute of British Architects|ARIBA]] in 1931, and was awarded a diploma in Town Planning, having been awarded the [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] Student Medal by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) whilst an undergraduate.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, The Times, 7 October 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoar's interest in architectural history developed during his student years, where he was awarded the Roland Jones prize for the history of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] architecture in his second year.

Hoar was a keen rugby player, playing for [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] 1st XV between 1934 and 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Huntly, Robert (2001): Saracens, 125 Years of Rugby&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural Practice==

===Gatwick Airport===
[[File:The Beehive, Gatwick Airport (IoE Code 461938).jpg|right|thumb|420px|''''The Beehive'''']]

Hoar's entry into the competition for the design of the first [[Gatwick Airport]] terminal building was as the leading member of a team of three architectural research students.  In the early 1930s, at the beginning of the era of commercial flight, [[Morris Jackaman]] had had the idea of a circular terminal, which was well suited to the developing air traffic needs of the time, allowing sufficient aircraft to be positioned in close proximity to the terminal building.  Hoar's design catered for these needs by surrounding the round terminal with five ramps, each of which connected to aircraft.  The terminal was entered by a tunnel subway connected, in turn, to the railway station.&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Christopher (2005) ''Transport Terminals and Modal Interchanges: Planning and Design'', p 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoar's designs were commissioned in 1935 and the building still exists, affectionately known as "[[Beehive (Gatwick Airport)|The Beehive]]".  A model of Hoar's design was included in the gallery of architectural history at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/files/file_upload/22133_file.pdf List of Architects’ Models in the Architecture Gallery, V &amp; A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War Years and post-war Reconstruction===
Following this success, Hoar built an architectural practice in which he was often engaged to design civic buildings, especially in the 1940s and '50s.  He was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in [[Egypt]] and North Africa during the [[World War II|Second World War]] where he was mainly engaged on the design of bridges.  During his period with the RE, a newspaper reported that he was being considered for an army secondment to the government of [[Nairobi]], where he would work on the re-development of the city, although this approach did not come to fruition.

After the War, Hoar joined the [[London County Council]]'s architectural department for a short period, before returning to private practice and academe.  He was heavily involved in the national discussion and debate about the development and improvement of housing after the War.  Aside from his involvement in the design of [[Council Housing]] with the LCC, Hoar was commissioned to design and write about the ideal new house in the opinion of the readers of the ''Sunday Express''.  His simple design incorporated what were beginning to be seen as household essentials: the fitted kitchen and bathroom, the utility room and the garage.&lt;ref&gt;'The Sunday Express House', article in ''Sunday Express'', 1946&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Hoar's cartoons as ''Acanthus'' reflected on the demands of pre-fabrication and the ideas behind redevelopment (see further below).

===Academic career===
Hoar later combined his private architectural and town planning practice with academic positions at UCL, where he was a senior lecturer at the Bartlett School.  In a time of architectural asperity, he was well known for his lectures on the Bavarian [[Baroque]] - a subject far out of favour with the modernism of the age.  Hoar's doctorate was awarded on this subject and a number of his watercolours of the interiors of Bavarian churches were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]'s [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibition]]; as were his watercolours of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], Rome, a particular favourite.  He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in the early 1940s.
[[File:Hoar grave Brookwood.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Frank Hoar in [[Brookwood Cemetery]]]]
The [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis on the Bavarian baroque set those churches in the context of the social and religious background of the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoar, Frank (1956) ''A Study of the Architectural and Social Context of the Bavarian Baroque'', PhD theses at the library of [[University College London]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside Hoar's drawings, it was illustrated by the series of [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] he exhibited at the RA.  His great interest in architectural history, which manifested itself in his cartoons as much as his architectural and academic practice, led to the publication of his two books on the architectural history of [[History of England|England]] and [[History of Europe|Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoar, Frank (1963) ''A History of English Architecture''. Evans Brothers; Hoar, Frank (1967) ''European Architecture, From Earliest Times to the Present Day''. Evans Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aimed at the lay reader and illustrated with drawings, [[Plan view|plans]] and [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]], these histories draw extensively on the cultural and historical background that gives meaning to the progression of architectural styles.  In many ways, they can be seen as a reaction to the prevailing ethos of his era, which spurned the historical purpose in favour of wholly [[utilitarian]] approaches; [[Le Corbusier]], for example, famously quipped that the house was a 'machine for living in'.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanneret-Gris, Charles-Edouard ('Le Corbusier') (1923) ''Vers une architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoar's hope was that: {{cquote|In time, an increasing interest by the public, a growing awareness of what a building is meant to do, and a keener appreciation of sane planning and fine design will create in England a new architecture that is as essentially English in character as the yeoman's cottage of Tudor times, and blessed with a beauty and a balance that reflect the spirit of what is still one of the most fortunate and envied countries in the world.'&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''A History of English Architecture'' (''ibid''), p 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoar's wish was, in many respects, to be granted after his death.  The utilitarian, concrete architecture of the 1950s and 1960s has gradually fallen out of favour, coupled with a resurgence of traditional architectural design and a renewed appreciation of context and scale.  (Compare, for example, the 1990s extension to [[Magdalen College Oxford]] with the college extensions of the post-war period.)  The change in public attitudes has been assisted in no small measure by the poor living conditions suffered by so many tenants of tower blocks built in that era.

On his death in 1976 Hoar was buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]] in [[Surrey]].

==Cartoons==

===Political cartoons===
Hoar was perhaps best known for his cartoons, as "Hope" in the ''[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]'' and as "Acanthus" in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.  He had started illustrating cartoons as "Acanthus" at the beginning of the War but soon began a series of political cartoons.  As his brother, George, had become a [[prisoner of war]] at the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]] in 1940, it was on security grounds that Hoar decided to publish these cartoons under the biline of "Hope".  These cartoons offered a long term commentary on the progress and evils of the War itself.  In one, [[Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] and [[Hideki Tōjō|Tōjō]] glare at a shackled prisoner whose shadow reveals the noose that represents their ultimate fate.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Express'', 1943&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cartoons focus on the role of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and the impact of the alliance, represented in one cartoon as the [[Allied leaders of World War II|Big Three]] using the [[swastika]] as a pivot to squash Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Correspondent'', 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Acanthus"===
Hoar's cartoons as "Acanthus" combined amusing social commentary with architectural themes and backgrounds.  The early cartoons provide a great insight into the [[Home Front]] during the Second World War; his subjects included the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], the crumbling [[English country house|country houses]] of the aristocracy and the [[Prefabricated buildings|prefabricated housing]] built after the war.  They are also of some historical interest, reflecting as they do the social mores of the day.  Hoar's work was later published in ''The Builder'', an architectural and building magazine and in ''[[Men Only]]'', then what might now be described as a lifestyle magazine.  In the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' he published [[pocket cartoon]]s in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' obituary, ''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt;

Practicing for his entire career in the age of [[Modern architecture|architectural modernism]] (which he did not entirely spurn, his buildings being as influenced by the age as those of most architects of his generation), Hoar was fond of using his cartoons to lampoon what he saw as its excesses - especially where they threatened architectural heritage.  In doing so, the breadth of his historical architectural knowledge was used to good effect.  An example was his skit on a proposal by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a new building on the [[Grand Canal, Venice|Grand Canal]] in [[Venice]], published in ''Punch'' in 1954, in which Hoar suggests a medley of architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence. (1983) ''Perspectives in Perspective'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  His cartoons often reflected upon the chastened circumstances of English country houses requisitioned in the War and later left to their decline, a suitable theme for his architectural backgrounds.

==History==
Full Sail University was founded by Jon Phelps in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shanklin |first=Mary |title=Full steam ahead at Full Sail, one of Orlando's few viable real-estate engines |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-08-01/business/os-cfb-cover-full-sail-080210-20100801_1_full-sail-university-jon-phelps-rolling-stone |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its curriculum was centered on recording arts and offered courses in [[audio engineering]].&lt;ref name="The Source"&gt;{{cite news |author=CombatJack |title=Why You Should Consider Full Sail University |url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/92456/Why-You-Should-Consider-Full-Sail-University/230/Features?thesource-prod=n2l4is8ojoortctsfvaceo47n0 |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |newspaper=The Source |date=September 15, 2011 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023075810/http://www.thesource.com/articles/92456/Why-You-Should-Consider-Full-Sail-University/230/Features?thesource-prod=n2l4is8ojoortctsfvaceo47n0 |archive-date=October 23, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school relocated to [[Orlando, Florida]], in 1980 and added new courses to its core recording arts program. In 1989, Full Sail moved to its current location at Winter Park, Florida;&lt;ref name="The Source" /&gt; the following year, it was accredited to grant specialized [[associate degree]]s.&lt;ref name="Video Game Boot Camp"&gt;{{cite news |last=Krantz |first=Matt |title=Video game college is 'boot camp' for designers |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2002-12-03-video_x.htm |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment doubled between 1989 and 1991 at a time of increased interest in film and media studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Welkos |first=Robert |title=Film School Daze |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/entertainment/ca-5459/4 |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university underwent financial difficulties in 1992 and its growth slowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Strother |first=Susan |title=Full Sail Weathers Stormy Year |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-09/business/9203071224_1_haddock-full-sail-steve-phelps |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=March 9, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995 and 1999, it began offering specialized associate degrees and associate degrees in computer animation, digital media, game design and development, and show production and touring; these courses were later expanded into full bachelor's degree programs.&lt;ref name="Video Game Boot Camp" /&gt;

In 2005, the school offered its first bachelor's degree program, a Bachelor of Science degree in entertainment business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crabbe |first=Nathan |title=UF and Full Sail partnering in production programs |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20111207/ARTICLES/111209699?tc=ar |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=The Gainesville Sun |date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the first master's degree program—also in the entertainment industry—was offered.&lt;ref name="first masters degree"&gt;{{cite news |last=Beck |first=Tiffany |title=Full Sail offers first master's in entertainment business |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2007/04/09/story15.html?page=all |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Business Journal |date=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online degree programs began in 2007, the first of which was an online adaptation of the existing Entertainment Business Master of Science.&lt;ref name="first masters degree" /&gt;

The additions of the master's degree programs, among other factors, led to the school being recognized as a university by the state of Florida. In 2008 it changed its name from Full Sail Real World Education to Full Sail University after attaining university status from the [[Florida Department of Education]]'s Commission for Independent Education.&lt;ref name="university status"&gt;{{cite news |last=Horowitz |first=Etan |title=Full Sail digital media school achieves university status |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-03-25/business/fullsail25_1_full-sail-school-officials-media-design |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Sentinel |date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus expanded with the addition of a {{Convert|1,780|foot|meter|adj=on}}-long backlot with 18 city facades designed to replicate the sets used in production of [[Hollywood]] films and television shows, which later expanded to {{Convert|2,078|feet|meters}}.&lt;ref name="university status" /&gt;

As the university grew between 2006 and 2011, the curriculum and degree programs were broadened,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carstensen |first=Melinda |title=Full Sail to launch 10 new degree programs |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2010/08/30/focus2.html?page=all |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Business Journal |date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding programs such as a bachelor of science in sports marketing and media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Full Sail, Wide World of Sports ink deal |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2011/03/30/full-sail-espn-wide-world-of-sports.html |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Business Journal |date=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a master of science degree in game design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Full Sail University to offer new master's degree in game design |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2008/09/08/daily26.html |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |newspaper=Orlando Business Journal |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2009, Full Sail marked its 30th anniversary with the opening of the Full Sail University Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Mix Online |title=Full Sail University to Unveil Hall of Fame |url=http://mixonline.com/news/headline/fullsail_university_hof_1702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] cited Full Sail as an example of the way rising costs of education could be solved. Romney did not mention that its chief executive Bill Heavener was a major campaign donor and fundraiser.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |title=Romney Offers Praise for a Donor’s Business |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/us/politics/mitt-romney-offers-praise-for-a-donors-business.html?_r=1 |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full Sail custom-built a [[learning management system]] for use with their online courses; the LMS is Macintosh-based, and utilizes content created by an in-house curriculum development team in conjunction with campus-based instructors.&lt;ref name="FSBooming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Pro Sound News |title=Full Sail Launches New Online Degrees |url=http://www.prosoundnews.com/article/26486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Full Sail has many of the same problems as other institutions in the for-profit college industry.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; They reported that some of the university's academic programs have high loan burdens and low graduation rates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3082">'''Gregory Galloway''' is an American fiction writer.  His first novel, ''[[As Simple as Snow]]'', was released by Putnam in 2005. Though the book was meant for an adult audience, it has taken off with teen readers.

== Biography ==

The son of a juvenile probation officer, Gregory Galloway, was born and raised in the small, southeastern [[Iowa]] town of [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], located near the confluence of the [[Des Moines River|Des Moines]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers.  The idea of writing presented itself to Galloway while he was in the throes of adolescence at Keokuk High School.

Galloway later graduated with MFAs in both fiction and poetry from the Iowa Writer’s Workshop at the [[University of Iowa]], in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]].  He worked at a downtown record store while attending college, a job driven by his longstanding interest in music.

His interest in music played a pivotal role in ''[[As Simple as Snow]]'', a mystery about a highly intense and intelligent [[Goth subculture|Goth]] teenager, Anastasia Cayne, who goes missing in the middle of winter. The only clue to her disappearance is a dress left outstretched like an arrow near a hole in an icy river and a cryptic tape she leaves for the unnamed male narrator. The novel is draped in codes and clues that leave the reader speculating what will come of the relationship between Anna and the narrator.

His second novel, ''The 39 Deaths of Adam Strand'', which follows a summer in the life of a boy named Adam Strand, who, no matter how hard he tries, cannot die, was published by Dutton in February 2013.

Galloway currently lives in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] with his wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Hawai{{okina}}iloa''' is the settler of the island of Hawai'i based on an ancient Hawaiian legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dennisk/voyaging_chiefs/hawaiiloa.html Hawai‘iloa and the Discovery of Hawai‘i]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to the legend, Hawai'iloa was an expert fisherman and navigator. While out with a crew of men, they accidentally stumbled upon the island of Hawai'i which was named in Hawai'iloa's honor. Hawai'iloa returned to his homeland of ''Ka {{okina}}āina kai melemele a Kane'', "the land of the yellow sea of [[Kāne|Kane]]" in order to bring his family back with him to Hawai'i. He then organized a colonizing expedition with his family and eight other skilled navigators. They settled on what is now the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]], named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm |title=Origins of Hawaii's Names |accessdate=2007-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230195509/http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm |archivedate=2006-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend contains reference to his children:  [[Maui]] (eldest son), [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] (son), and [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] (daughter) who settled on the islands that bear their names.

[[File:Polynesian canoe replica 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Hawai{{okina}}iloa, Honolulu Harbor]]

The story of Hawai{{okina}}iloa has received a great deal of attention from modern [[Hawaii]]ans, as a realistic depiction of the settling of the islands, consistent with current anthropological and historical beliefs. Many people believe it is a validation of the veracity of ancient Hawaiian oral traditions.

However, the story of Hawai{{okina}}iloa is attested only by late sources, such as the antiquarians [[Abraham Fornander]] and [[Thrum's Hawaiian Annual|Thomas George Thrum]]. As they did not give their original Hawaiian sources, but only digests and compilations, we cannot be sure that the tale has not been slanted towards proof of Fornander's now discredited migration theories, or that it has not been elaborated by 19th century Hawaiians eager to stress the validity of their own beliefs.

Hawai{{okina}}iloa is not mentioned in early Hawaiian historian sources like [[David Malo]] or [[Samuel Kamakau]]. Malo says there are many stories about the origin of the Hawaiians and cites some migration tales and some legends of indigenous origin. He does not mention Hawai{{okina}}iloa. Kamakau says that the first man and woman were Hulihonua and Keakahuilani, and that they were created on O{{okina}}ahu.

==Canoe==

''Hawai{{okina}}iloa'' is also the name of a voyaging canoe. Thought to be named after the legendary navigator, the canoe was built and sailed for international navigation. The canoe ''Hawai{{okina}}iloa'' is now docked at [[Honolulu Harbor]]. It is often sailed on long voyages throughout the [[Pacific Ocean]] in hopes of studying voyaging techniques used in [[Ancient Hawaii]].

The '''Higher Education Research Institute''' ('''HERI''') serves as an interdisciplinary center for research, evaluation, information, policy studies, and research training in post-secondary education. HERI is housed in the [[UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies]] (GSE&amp;IS) at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. The Institute's research program covers a variety of topics including the outcomes of post-secondary education, [[leadership development]], institutional transformation, faculty performance, federal and state policy, and [[educational equity]].

==Data ==
HERI provides a wealth of higher education research information. The data is freely available, but recent data is only accessible by applying for specific dataset based on research needs.&lt;ref&gt;Higher Education Research Institute [http://www.heri.ucla.edu/gainaccess.php "Gaining Access to HERI Data"], Retrieved on 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Data which is over 10 years is archived and freely available on the website.

The available information comes primarily from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP).&lt;ref&gt;Higher Education Research Institute [http://www.heri.ucla.edu/abtcirp.php "About CIRP"], Retrieved on 2010-09-02.&lt;/ref&gt; CIRP is the largest and oldest empirical study of higher education in the [[United States]]. The CIRP data comes from three main surveys, one for incoming freshmen, another given after the completion of the first year, and a final exit survey for graduating seniors. The data covered by these surveys ranges from basic demographics to the political views of students.

The '''Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire''' or '''IFAN Museum of African Arts''' in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] is one of the oldest art museums in [[West Africa]]. It was promoted by [[Léopold Senghor]], the country's first President. In December 2007, its official title was changed to '''The Théodore Monod African Art Museum''' ("Musée Théodore Monod d'Art africain"), after the French naturalist [[Théodore André Monod]], former director of IFAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html Le musée de l’IFAN change de dénomination, ausenegal.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218020238/http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html |date=2008-02-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously its official name had been "''Le Musée d'Art africain de l'Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD''".

The museum is part of the [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN) institute, founded 1936  under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in France. When IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, the building at Place Soweto near the [[National Assembly of Senegal]] was converted into a museum. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture and part of the [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]].  As the main cultural research center of the colonies of [[French West Africa]], it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.

The museum is one of the regular locations used in the [[Dakar Biennale]] exhibition, showing art by contemporary African and diaspora artists.&lt;ref&gt;''Assembling Africa — Dak'art 96 biennial art festival, various artists, various venues, Dakar, Senegal'', in Art in America, May 1997 accessed at [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v85/ai_19385178] March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dak'Art 2006: positions and perspectives'', in African Arts, Winter 2006 accessed at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0438/is_4_39/ai_n17094470/pg_10] March 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.osiris.sn/article2324.html  DAK’ART 2006 - Yacouba Konaté, Commissaire général de la Biennale de l’art africain contemporain : « L’art numérique n’est pas décalé, mais le public a le droit d’être un peu surpris »], Babacar DIOP : Le Quotidien, 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Lave''' is a [[social anthropologist]] who theorizes learning as changing participation in on-going changing practice. Her lifework challenges conventional theories of learning and education.

She completed her doctorate in  [[Social Anthropology]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1968. She is currently a [[Professor Emerita]] of Geography at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jeanlave home page at Berkeley] (17 September 2009 now out of date)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her studies of [[apprentice]]ship are recognized as a significant critique of [[educational psychology]].
She pioneered the theory of [[situated learning]] and [[communities of practice]], with the assistance of her student [[Etienne Wenger]].

In 1988, Lave and her students showed that grocery shoppers in [[Orange County, California]] who could successfully do the [[mathematics]] needed for comparison shopping were less able to do the same mathematics when they were presented with the same problems in a formal test. &lt;ref&gt;Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life (Learning in Doing)" by Jean Lave, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988) {{ISBN|0-521-35734-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
She has published four books:
*''Apprenticeship in Critical Ethnographic Practice'' (2011)
*''Understanding Practice'' (co-authored with Seth Chaiklin, 1993)
*''Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation'' (co-authored with [[Etienne Wenger]], 1991)
*''Cognition in Practice'' (1988)

Wikibooks includes an [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Theorists#Jean_Lave introduction to Lave's ideas].

'''Julia C. Addington''' (June 13, 1829 &amp;ndash; September 21, 1875) was an American elected official in [[Iowa]]. She was the first woman elected to public office in Iowa and may have been the first woman elected to public office in the United States.&lt;ref name=ackley/&gt;&lt;ref name=mullenbach&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stacyville.com/pdfs/Addington.pdf |title=The Election of Julia Addington, An Accidental Milestone in Iowa Politics |last=Mullenbach |first=Cheryl |work=Iowa Heritage Illustrated |date=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Addington was the daughter of William. H. Addington Sr. and Alvira Potter. She was born in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.&lt;ref name=fame/&gt; She came to Iowa from [[Wisconsin]] with her family in 1863 and taught school in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Des Moines]] and at the Cedar Valley Seminary in [[Osage, Iowa|Osage]]. Addington was elected Superintendent of Schools for [[Mitchell County, Iowa|Mitchell County]] in 1869.  She had been acting school superintendent just prior to the election, completing the term of the previous holder of that position. Addington was elected as part of the "Bolter" faction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], who favoured [[Mitchell, Iowa|Mitchell]] as the county seat. She received exactly the same number of votes as Republican candidate Milton N. Browne and the election was settled by flipping a coin. Because she was a woman, her election was not universally accepted, even though the Iowa [[State attorney general|attorney general]] Henry O'Connor ruled that her election was legal since there was no explicit requirement in the law for a candidate to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www2.tulane.edu/newcomb/sallykenney/upload/SKMBT_C30012111312300.pdf |title=Julia C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2819">The '''Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme''' ('''LCVP''') is a two-year optional Education Programme of the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Skills]]. THE LCVP was introduced in 1989. According to the Department of Education and Skills, the programme is ''designed to give a strong vocational dimension to the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate (established)]]. The programme combines the virtues of academic study with a new and dynamic focus on self-directed learning, enterprise, work and the community'' &lt;ref name=LCVP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcvp.slss.ie/ |title=Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme |accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme is aimed at young people who have completed the [[Junior Certificate]] and are entering the senior cycle of [[Secondary School]] education, but provides a stronger vocational focus than the more established Leaving Certificate. The LCVP aims to give students an opportunity to develop their interpersonal, vocational and technological skills as well as providing extra points for grades for getting into universities.  &lt;ref&gt;http://pdst.ie/node/2354&lt;/ref&gt;

Students must pass four Leaving Certificate subjects, one of which must be Irish language [only for Irish students] and one Link Modules which is optional. Typically, students would take seven Leaving Certificate subjects along with the one link modules.

According to The Irish Examiner News, approximately 15,000 (15,274) students took exams for the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/special-report-leaving-certificate-results-279335.html&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, according to this article, overall roughly 57,000 students recently took exams for the Irish Leaving Certificate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/special-report-leaving-certificate-results-279335.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucy Ann Kidd–Key''' (née '''Lucy Ann Thornton'''; at first marriage, '''Lucy Ann Kidd'''; November 15, 1839 – September 13, 1916) was an American educator and music college administrator from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. She founded and served as first president of the North Texas Female College (renamed [[Kidd-Key College]]), of [[Sherman, Texas]], the first woman south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] to hold such a position.{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=435}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kidd-Key, Lucy Ann Thornton|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fki04|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
Lucy Ann Thornton was born at [[Bardstown, Kentucky]], November 15, 1839{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}}  (another source states June 11, 1839),{{sfn|Willard|1893|p=435}} daughter of Willis Strather and Esther (Stevens) Thornton; granddaughter of James Thornton, of Kentucky, and great-granddaughter of Sir William Thornton, of Virginia. On the maternal side she was of [[South Carolina]] [[Huguenot]] ancestry.{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}} There was a sister, Sarah (born 1836), who married Dr. W. Y. Gadberry.{{sfn|Railey|1938|p=190}}

For the most part, her education was acquired at Rev. Stuart Robinson's Institute at [[Georgetown, Kentucky]], where she specialized in literature and history.{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}} 

==Career==
About 1858, at age 17, she married Dr. Henry Byrd Kidd (1821–1877) of Kentucky, a physician-planter, and took up her residence on an extensive plantation near [[Yazoo City, Mississippi]]. Her sister and brother-in-law moved to Yazoo as well.{{sfn|Railey|1938|p=190}} The [[American Civil War]] brought ruin and disaster to her husband. At his death in 1877, after a long period of invalidism, he left many debts, and three small children. She took up the management of the debts, and eventually paid them off.{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}} 

She accepted the position of presiding teacher at Whitworth College (now [[Whitworth University]]), [[Brookhaven, Mississippi]], and remained there 10 years. In 1888, she became president of the North Texas Female College (now [[Kidd-Key College]]), [[Sherman, Texas]]. This institution had fallen into disrepute, and had been closed for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Domatti|first1=Ruth O.|title=A History of Kidd-Key College|journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly|date=October 1959|volume=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings were in a dilapidated condition, and but partly finished. With a valuation on the property of US$15,000 it was encumbered with a debt of US$11,000. She reopened the college with 60 boarders and an enrollment of nearly 100 students.

She was married in 1894, to Bishop [[Joseph Staunton Key]] (1829–1916), of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. In 1908, she organized the Kidd-Key Conservatory of Music and Art, of which she became the president, and brought some of the best teachers available. The college graduated thousands of southern women.{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}} 

Kidd-Key died at Sherman, September 13, 1916, survived by her second husband. Two children by the first union also survived her: Sara, who married Louis Verse, of Sherman, and Edwin Kidd, an educator of Sherman.{{sfn|White|1921|p=407}}

The term '''“Macondistas”''' refers to authors and members of the writing community who are alumni of the [[Macondo Writers Workshop]], which was founded by [[Sandra Cisneros]] in 1995.  The workshop is for writers whose work is socially engaged and who have addressed the needs of underrepresented communities via their writing.  For years, the workshop was made possible by the philanthropic endeavors of Cisneros and the Macondo Foundation, though currently the [[Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]], administers and hosts the annual workshop.  The term "Macondo" was first used in [[Gabriel García Márquez]]' 1967 novel ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.

==History==
Mendeley, named after the biologist [[Gregor Mendel]] and chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Henning, [http://blog.mendeley.com/start-up-life/how-our-name-evolved-from-b-movie-monster-to-mendeley/ How our name evolved from B-movie monster to Mendeley], 23 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in November 2007 by three German PhD students and is based in London. The first public [[beta version]] was released in August 2008. The company's investors include some people previously involved with [[Last.fm]], [[Skype]], and  [[Warner Music Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/mendeley-shares-scientific-research-to-build-a-better-future|title=Case study – Mendeley shares scientific research to build a better future|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-29|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as academics from [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]].

Mendeley won several awards in 2009: Plugg.eu "European Start-up of the Year 2009",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winners for Plugg Start-Ups Rally 2009 announced |url=http://plugg.eu/media/blog/p/detail/winners-for-plugg-start-ups-rally-2009-announced |author=Plugg.eu |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-03-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318234932/http://plugg.eu/media/blog/p/detail/winners-for-plugg-start-ups-rally-2009-announced |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Plugg wraps with two very capable winners | author=TechCrunch | url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/12/plugg-wraps-with-two-very-capable-winnners/ | date=2009-03-12 | accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; TechCrunch Europas "Best Social Innovation Which Benefits Society 2009",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Europas: The Winners and Finalists | url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/09/the-europas-the-winners-and-finalists/ | author=TechCrunch | date=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Guardian]] ranked it #6 in "Top 100 tech media companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The top 100 tech media companies | author=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tech-media-invest-100/top-100 | date=2009-09-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2013, Mendeley announced [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] apps that are free to install.

===Purchase by Elsevier===
Mendeley was purchased by the [[Elsevier]] publishing company in 2013. The deal price was speculated to be €50 million (US$65 million), following earlier speculation that it was between $69 million and $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/confirmed-elsevier-has-bought-mendeley-for-69m-100m-to-expand-open-social-education-data-efforts/ Confirmed: Elsevier Has Bought Mendeley For $69M-$100M To Expand Its Open, Social Education Data Efforts]. 8 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale led to debate on scientific networks and in the media interested in [[Open Access]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysciencework.com/en/MyScienceNews/9916/elsevier-takes-over-mendeley-and-you-what-do-you-think ''Elsevier takes over Mendeley: And you, what do you think?], [http://www.mysciencework.com/en/ ''MyScienceWork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524065302/http://www.mysciencework.com/en/ |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and upset members of the scientific community&lt;ref name="paidcontent.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paidcontent.org/2013/04/09/the-empire-acquires-the-rebel-alliance-mendeley-users-revolt-against-elsevier-takeover/ | title=The Empire acquires the rebel alliance: Mendeley users revolt against Elsevier takeover | publisher=paidContent | date=Apr 9, 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who felt that the program's acquisition by publishing giant Elsevier, known for implementing restrictive publishing practices, the high prices of their journals&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/thousands-scientists-vow-boycott-elsevier-protest-journal-prices | title=Thousands of Scientists Vow to Boycott Elsevier to Protest Journal Prices | publisher=ScienceInsider | date=Feb 1, 2012 | accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[The Cost of Knowledge]]), and publicly supporting the [[SOPA]] bill, was antithetical to the open sharing model of Mendeley.&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/04/elsevier-mendeley-journals-science-software.html "When the Rebel Alliance Sells Out"], David Dobbs, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', April 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
David Dobbs, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', suggested Elsevier's reasons for buying Mendeley could have been to acquire its user data and/or to "destroy or coopt an open-science icon that threatens its business model."&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

In 2012, Mendeley was one of the [[Open access repository|repositories]] for [[green Open Access]] recommended by [[Peter Suber]].&lt;ref name="openaccessbook"&gt;{{cite book |author=Suber, Peter |title=Open Access |series=MIT Press Essential Knowledge |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book) |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2012 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51763-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{OpenAccess}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation was revoked in 2013 after Elsevier bought Mendeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elsevier bought Mendeley |url=https://plus.google.com/+PeterSuber/posts/e4iZMQfoENc |author=Peter Suber|date=2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an update to Mendeley resulted in some users losing PDFs and annotations stored in their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/thousands-researchers-hit-mendeley-update-glitch|title=Thousands of researchers hit by Mendeley update glitch|date=2018-06-15|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of weeks, Elsevier announced a potential fix for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mendeley.com/2018/06/27/update-on-the-missing-pdf-issue/|title=Update on the missing PDF issue|date=2018-06-27|work=Mendeley Blog|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vendor lock-in controversy===
Since its 1.19 release in 2018 Mendeley encrypts its local database using a proprietary algorithm, making it difficult for users to export their data from the application and possibly creating a [[vendor lock-in]] situation.&lt;ref name="mendeley import"&gt;https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/mendeley_import&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mendeley lockin"&gt;https://eighty-twenty.org/2018/06/13/mendeley-encrypted-db&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Wheeler was born in [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1899. He met [[Glenway Wescott]] who was to be friend or partner for the rest of their lives in 1919. In the 1920s Wescott and Wheeler were working in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monroe Wheeler Papers in The Museum of Modern Art Archives|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/wheelerf|website=The Museum of Modern Art Museum Archives|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an inheritance from his family, Wheeler bought a small print, and with [[Barbara Harrison Wescott|Barbara Harrison]], established ''[[Harrison of Paris]]'', specializing in limited-edition books; they published in total thirteen books, including two works by Wheeler's partner, Glenway Wescott. In 1934 they moved to press to New York City. The last book published by ''Harrison of Paris'' was ''Hacienda'' by [[Katherine Anne Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Harrison of Paris Records | hdl=10079/fa/beinecke.hop | publisher=[[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]]}} Text copied from [[Barbara Harrison Wescott]], see that page for attribution&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Wheeler was employed by New York's [[Museum of Modern Art, New York|Museum of Modern Art]]. He was on the Library Committee and in three years he was ''Director of Membership'' and the following year ''Director of Publications''. In 1940 MOMA created the role of ''Director of Exhibitions'' and Wheeler was the first person to hold the post. In 1944 he became one of MOMA's [[Trustee]]s and later he sat on the Executive Committee, the Exhibitions Program Committee, and also the Coordination Committee. After the war in 1948, Wheeler was leading the Exhibitions and Publications, the outreach programs and the library.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C14FB3F581B728DDDAC0894DA415B818AF1D3&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Le%20Bateau%20Matisse&amp;st=cse|last=Robertson|first=Nan|title=Modern Museum Is Startled by Matisse Picture|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 5, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over ten years, photographer [[George Platt Lynes]] had a relationship with Wheeler and [[Glenway Wescott]].&lt;ref name="LandedGent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Limnander|first1=Armand|title=Landed Gent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/style/tmagazine/08brookesw.html|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Paul Cadmus]], ''Conversation Piece'' (1940),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Swardstrom saved to Cadmus, Kirstein, Lynes circle|url=https://it.pinterest.com/pin/189080884327465655/|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Jared French]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Swardstrom saved to Cadmus, Kirstein, Lynes circle|url=https://it.pinterest.com/pin/189080884328978313/|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a triptych portrait of Wheeler, Wescott and Platt Lynes. ''When We Were Three: The Travel Albums of George Platt Lynes, Monroe Wheeler, and Glenway Wescott, 1925-1935'' was published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When We Were Three: The Travel Albums of George Platt Lynes, Monroe Wheeler, and Glenway Wescott, 1925-1935|date=1998|publisher=Arena Editions|url=https://books.google.it/books/about/When_We_Were_Three.html?id=-NtTAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Wheeler's lovers was [[Christian William Miller]].&lt;ref name="Leddick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leddick|first1=David|title=Intimate Companions: A Triography of George Platt Lynes, Paul Cadmus, Lincoln Kirstein, and Their Circle|date=2015|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8LCpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT161|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Lloyd Wescott]], Glenway's brother, moved to a farm in [[Union Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Union Township]] in 1936, Wescott, Wheeler and Lynes took over one of Lloyd's farm's houses and they called it ''Stone-Blossom''.&lt;ref name=Glenway&gt;{{cite book |title=Glenway Wescott Personally |last=Rosco |first=Jerry |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZPFVlUjuloC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, when Lloyd Wescott acquired a farm near Rosemont in [[Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey]], Glen Wescott moved into a stone house named "Haymeadows" on his brother's land.&lt;ref name=Glenway/&gt;

In 1987, Glen Wescott died of a stroke at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6143BF937A15751C0A961948260|title=Glenway Wescott, 85, Novelist and Essayist|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 24, 1987|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler died in [[New York City]] in 1988, but his ashes were buried with Wescott and this latter family at Haymeadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/obituaries/monroe-wheeler-board-member-of-modern-museum-is-dead-at-89.html|title=Monroe Wheeler, Board Member Of Modern Museum, Is Dead at 89|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 16, 1988|accessdate=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glenway /&gt;

'''Parrot AR.Drone''' is a discontinued [[remote controlled]] flying [[quadcopter]] helicopter built by the French company [[Parrot (company)|Parrot]]. The drone is designed to be controlled by mobile or tablet operating systems such as the supported [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]]&lt;ref name="arsandroid"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/06/ardrone-coming-to-android-gets-new-multiplayer-games.ars|title=AR.Drone coming to Android, gets new multiplayer games|date=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; within their respective apps or the unofficial software available for [[Windows Phone]], [[Samsung bada|Samsung BADA]] and [[Symbian]] devices.&lt;ref name="gizmagintro"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/parrot-ardrone-iphone-controlled-remote-helicopter/13741/|title=Control your own augmented reality aerial drone?

==Design and development==

===Version 1.0===
[[Image:Ardrone-img5-front.jpg|thumb|right|AR.Drone pre-production prototype]]
The Parrot AR.Drone was unveiled at the [[International CES]] 2010 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] along with demonstration of the iOS applications used to control it. Along with AR.Freeflight, the application designed for free operation of the drone, Parrot also released AR.Race, allowing users to take part in solo games, or interact with other drones in combat simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The iPhone: Now There's a Helicopter for That|url=https://www.kualadeals.com/collections/rcs-drones |quote=At the International Consumer Electronics Show this week, Paris-based Parrot unveiled its AR.Drone|work=[[Associated Press]] in the [[New York Times]]|date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-11 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The airframe of the AR.Drone, constructed from [[nylon]] and [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]] parts, measures {{convert|57|cm|in|abbr=on}} across.&lt;ref name="amazonOriginal"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amazon.com/Parrot-AR-Drone-Quadricopter-Controlled-Android/dp/B003ZVSHB0 | title=Parrot AR.Drone Quadricopter Controlled by iPod touch, iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices (Orange/Blue) | publisher=Amazon | work=Amazon.com | accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two interchangeable hulls were supplied with the airframe, one is designed for indoor and one for outdoor flight. The indoor hull is made from [[Polypropylene|EPP]] [[foam]], and encases the circumference of the blades for protection. The outdoor-use hull is made from lightweight plastic and allows for increased maneuverability. In total, the AR.Drone has six [[degrees of freedom]], with a [[Microelectromechanical systems|miniaturized]] [[inertial measurement unit]] tracking the pitch, roll and yaw for use in stabilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Parrot AR.Drones specs |url=http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/parrot-ardrones-specs-arm9 |quote=Parrot AR.Drones specs: ARM9, Linux, 6DoF IMU, Ultrasonics sensor, WiFi....WOW!  |work=Chris Anderson from DIYDrones.com |date=January 6, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the airframe, a range of sensors assist flight, enabling the interface used by pilots to be simpler, and making advanced flight easier. The onboard computer runs a [[Linux]] [[operating system]], and communicates with the pilot through a self-generated [[Wi-Fi]] hotspot. The onboard sensors include an ultrasonic [[altimeter]], which is used to provide vertical stabilization up to {{convert|6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The rotors are powered by 15 watt, [[brushless motor]]s powered by an 11.1 Volt [[lithium polymer battery]]. This provides approximately 12 minutes of flight time at a speed of {{convert|5|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}. Coupled with software on the piloting device, the forward-facing camera allows the drone to build a 3D environment, track objects and drones, and validate shots in [[augmented reality]] games.

[[File:2 Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 in flight.jpg|right|thumb|AR.Drone 2.0 in flight with indoor hull]]
The successor to the original drone, the AR.Drone 2.0 was unveiled at CES Las Vegas 2012. Rather than redesigning the product, improvements were made to its functionality, along with developing a larger ecosystem to support pilots.
The equipment on board AR.Drone 2.0 was significantly upgraded to improve the drone's function. The camera quality was increased to [[720p]], and many of the onboard sensors were made more sensitive, allowing for greater control. The ultrasound altimeter was enhanced with the addition of an air [[pressure sensor]], allowing for more stable flight and hovering. The resources available to the onboard computer were also improved, and the Wi-Fi hardware was updated to follow the new [[802.11n]] standard. Other sensor improvements included an upgraded 3-axis [[gyroscope]], along with a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] and [[magnetometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parrot AR.Drone|url=https://www.spacecitydrones.com/parrot-ar-drone/|publisher=Space City Drones|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At CES 2013, Parrot announced the Flight Recorder add-on for the AR.Drone 2.0. It adds 4GB of storage to the drone, along with GPS tracking and flight data recording. It will allow pilots to define a flight path by selecting a series of waypoints that the drone will follow. Flight Recorder features can be controlled via mobile phone and desktop applications, with "Director Mode" and "Rescue Mode" included. An extended battery designed to increase flight time by up to 50% was also launched alongside the Flight Recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heater|first1=Brian|title=Parrot announces availability for AR.Drone 2.0 add-ons, offers software upgrades|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/17/parrot/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:AR.Drone 2.0 flying over suburd in Avignon, France.jpg|right|thumb|AR.Drone application HUD]]
;AR.Drone
Previously known as AR.Freeflight, provides piloting function for AR.Drones, and the ability to take photos and videos. AR.Drone was launched in 2010 alongside the original drone, and provides piloting capabilities via iOS devices.&lt;ref name="droneIOS"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ar.drone/id628452459?mt=8 | title=AR.Drone for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad | publisher=Apple | work=iTunes Preview | date=2013-04-20 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows pilots to record video or capture images from their drone's onboard cameras. When originally launched pilots could control drones by tilting their device, and data from the onboard accelerometer was converted into flight controls.&lt;ref name="noAccel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.parrot.com/2013/04/08/statement-to-ar-drone-pilots-using-ios-devices/ | title=Statement to AR.Drone pilots using iOS devices | publisher=Parrot | work=Parrot Blog | date=2013-04-08 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-screen controls provide joystick-style movement, and other functions that allow pilots to perform aerobatics, play games, or update their drone's firmware. The app also integrates with AR.Drone Academy, where pilots can map and share flight details with other AR.Drone users. AR.Drone is available on the [[Google Play]] store, where it has kept the name AR.Freeflight.&lt;ref name="playFreeflight"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parrot.freeflight&amp;hl=en | title=AR.Freeflight 2.0 | publisher=Google | work=Android Apps on Google Play | date=2013-02-25| accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;AR.Race 2 (previously AR.Race)
AR.Race is a piloting and multiplayer gaming application for the AR.Drone 2.0. Using a [[Outline of object recognition|target]] included with the drone, pilots can define a race course with a start and finish line. The drone will then detect when it crosses this line, and records the flight time in between these two events. Pilots may invite other AR.Drones to join the race, and scores are aggregated into a leaderboard.&lt;ref name="droneRace"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ardrone2.parrot.com/apps/ar-race/ | title=AR.Drone 2.0. Parrot new wi-fi quadricopter - Ar Race | publisher=Parrot | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application also integrates with AR.Drone Academy and, when the AR.Freeflight application was removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]], was updated to include basic piloting controls. AR.Race 2, and its predecessor AR.Race are only available on for iOS devices.

;AR.Rescue 2 (previously AR.Rescue) 
A single-player augmented reality application for iOS devices. It uses the target provided with the AR.Drone 2.0 to build a 3D environment in which pilots must perform various tasks. The object of the game is to construct a rocket out of pieces that are placed into the physical environment by the drone's software. Along with these pieces, enemies are generated that must be fought. The drone also records the time it takes to complete this task successfully, and this is recorded in AR.Drone Academy, where a global leaderboard is generated, and videos and images can be shared amongst the community.&lt;ref name="rescueIOS"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ar.rescue-2/id536571404 | title=AR.Rescue 2 for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad | publisher=Apple | work=iTunes Preview | date=2013-04-02 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;AR.Hunter 
An augmented, multiplayer game that allows pilots to engage a human target with virtual weapons within a 3D space. Unlike the other multiplayer games made by Parrot, AR.Hunter only requires one AR.Drone. Both the pilot and the 'target' have the application installed on iOS devices, and the 'target' uses theirs to fire their virtual weapons at the drone. In order for the drone to recognise and engage the 'target', they must wear a colored cap, purchased separately from Parrot. The game can be played without the cap, but the drone is unable to engage the 'target', and the pilot must instead evade detection or attack. AR.Hunter is not compatible with the AR.Drone 2.0.

He theorised that a chain of command could be set up, where multiple people could step up and take control should the primary operator be detained by police. To further this, he began development of a new control system, replacing the existing Wi-Fi hotspot with a [[3G]] chip. This would allow users to control drones via the internet, and potentially from remote locations.&lt;ref name="guardPool"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/21/occupy-wall-street-occucopter-tim-pool | title=Occupy Wall Street's 'occucopter' - who's watching whom? | publisher=Guardian | date=2011-12-21 | accessdate=2013-04-15 |author1=Sharkey, Noel  |author2=Knuckey, Sarah |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An open source framework "[https://vsis-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/oldServer/teaching//projects/yadrone/ Yet another drone]", developed by students at University of Hamburg will allow programmers to easily build applications for AR Drone in Java.

Although the technology required to feed and record live video taken from [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAVs) existed prior to the release of the AR.Drone, it was not widely available to members of the public. In Germany, consumer affairs minister Ilse Aigner described the drone as a privacy threat, and called for restrictions to be placed on the use of cameras mounted on aerial platforms.&lt;ref name="german"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.suasnews.com/2011/01/3268/parrot-ar-drone-causes-german-politicians-to-debate-privacy-and-suas/ | title=Parrot AR.Drone causes German politicians to debate privacy and sUAS | publisher=sUAS | date=2011-01-02 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | author=Mortimer, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- In the UK, the AR.Drone is considered a Small unmanned surveillance aircraft, and is governed by the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]].&lt;ref name="caaPDF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/1357/F0001372ReplyLetter.pdf | title=ReplyLetter.pdf | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority | date=2012-08-02 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | author=Chatfield, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limits their use, and requires pilots flying them as part of a commercial application to have acquired a licence.

'''Rebecca Root''' (born 10 May 1969) is a British [[actress]] and [[stand-up comedian]]. She was rated 18th in ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Rainbow List]] 2014, which named her as one of the very few openly [[transgender|trans]] actresses in mainstream television, alongside [[Laverne Cox]] and [[Adèle Anderson]].&lt;ref name="IndRain2014"/&gt; She played the leading role in the 2015–2016 [[BBC Two]] sitcom ''[[Boy Meets Girl (BBC TV series)|Boy Meets Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07k4tx0 |title=Boy Meets Girl |website=BBC online |accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root is also a voice coach,&lt;ref name="GuardFightingMyself"/&gt; teaching at the [[East 15 Acting School]] and from her home in [[Highgate]], London. She started that career after she [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] and acting work became harder to find.&lt;ref name="EnfInd"/&gt; She graduated from the [[Royal Central School of Speech and Drama]] with a [[Master of Arts]] in Vocal Studies. Her thesis, "There and Back Again: Adventures in Genderland", has since been published in the peer reviewed journal ''Voice and Speech Review'', and she advertises voice therapy specifically for transgender people to help them "find a voice they feel fits their gender".&lt;ref name="TeleVoice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RootBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndBBC2Commissions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thesis"/&gt;

In 2015 Root starred in the [[BBC Radio 4]] drama ''1977'',&lt;ref name=bbcb06r8gms&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06r8gms |title=Drama: 1977 |website=BBC online |date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  about the transgender popular composer [[Angela Morley]] who had become a household name to British radio audiences as Wally Stott. Written by Sarah Wooley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sarahwooley.com/ |title=Sarah Wooley, writer for radio, TV, film, theatre |website=Wooley's website |accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  it followed the year in which Morley was enlisted to complete composition of the musical soundtrack to the film [[Watership Down]] in three weeks flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/writersroom/entries/7c87da6e-c8b0-462e-86a9-b4227fdd25de |title=About so much more than 'a transgender woman in the 1970s' |website=BBC/blogs/writersroom |date=30 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Das Sprachenatelier [[Berlin]] - Institute for languages, art and culture''' was founded as both a language school and a studio, a place where intercultural encounters and creative exchange are combined in the context of language learning.[[File:Fasaden Haus Garbe.jpg|300px|right|Facade of Haus Garbe]]

In addition to German language courses and courses in more than forty foreign languages, festivals, film evenings, readings, concerts, exhibitions, workshops, political discussions and seminars are also organised. The institute offers sufficient space for artists and creatives to organise events and reach a broad audience. Numerous performances, plays, film showings, dance and theatre workshops as well as all forms of exhibitions have taken place at the Sprachenatelier in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprachenatelier-berlin.de/de/topic/459.sprachschule-berlin.html |title=Sprachchule in Berlin, |last=Berlin |first=Sprachenatelier |publisher=Open Publishing |date= 2014 |website=Sprachenatelier Berlin |access-date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprachenatelier's spaces are regularly used for political information and discussion forums with experts from many countries. Additionally, every year - besides the regular various language courses, there is always a broad offer of cultural events all students of the Sprachenatelier can join.

== Building ==
[[File:Räumlichkeiten 2 in Sprachenatelier Berlin.jpg|200px|right|Space inside the House Garbe-today]] '''Oskar Garbe''', a master mason from Lichtenberg, Berlin, was a successful property developer around 1900. In [[Berlin]]  he built the Erlöserkirche in Berlin (Church of the Redeemer)  and the Samariterkirche (Samariter Church), various commercial buildings, a cabaret theatre and several luxury villas. In 1907 he built a prestigious residential building at 40 Frankfurter Allee, which is where the Sprachenatelier can be found today. The architect '''Hans Liepe''' developed the building's plans in 1906 for Mr Garbe, who himself designed the layout of the apartments and then lived on the second floor in a nine room apartment. 
[[File:Jugendstil salon in House Garbe.jpg|200px|right|Jugendstil salon in Sprachenatelier Berlin (House Garbe)]] The five-storey, red stucco-fronted building has a double-arched gable and a four sided central bay on the second and third floors with balcony. In the courtyard there is a five-storey, white klinkered industrial building with a further courtyard. The frontal facade was designed in an art nouveau style and is decorated with blue bricks. Users of the building until 1900 were principally furniture makers and shops. The complex is listed. Of particular interest are the rich, almost completely retained interior fittings in [[art nouveau]]  style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.karlshorst-online.de/index.php?view=details&amp;id=3155%3A2501-stadttour-lichtenberg-haus-garbe--ein-jugendstil-denkmal-in-der-frankfurter-allee&amp;option=com_eventlist Willkommen in Berlin Karlshorst - Lichtenberg hat einfach mehr zu bieten , |last=Unknown |first=Unknown |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2014 |website=Karlshorst-online |access-date=22 April 2015 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723130514/http://www.karlshorst-online.de/index.php?view=details&amp;id=3155:2501-stadttour-lichtenberg-haus-garbe--ein-jugendstil-denkmal-in-der-frankfurter-allee&amp;option=com_eventlist |archive-date=2015-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a member of ''fadaf''  and also licensed test centre for all ''telc'' exams, for ''CnaVT'' , ''TCF'' [[Test de connaissance du français]]  and [[Swedex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprachenatelier-berlin.de/de/topic/520.sprachpruefungen.html |title=Sprachprüfungen in Berlin |last=Berlin |first=Sprachenatelier |publisher=Open Publishing |date= 2014 |website=Sprachenatelier Berlin |access-date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer program===
Every summer from June until the end of August, the Sprachenatelier Berlin offers numerous cultural programs for its students every week. While the language learners can choose between five different excursions and activities every day (from Monday until Friday) there are also weekend trips to famous German cities such as [[Potsdam]], [[Dresden]], [[Leipzig]] and many more. The normal "Sommerkulturprogramm" includes sightseeing through [[Berlin]]; visiting numerous exhibitions of all kinds as well as restaurants, bars and streetfood markets; going to open air cinemas; doing activities such as mini golf, playing volleyball or other sports as well as having barbecue together. An annual highlight of the summer program is the great Night of Talents.

===Further Projects and events===
''The World is not my Village'', an open forum for the discussion of themes such as globalisation, migration and environment, with a focus on people and their realm of experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprachenatelier-berlin.de/de/topic/451.veranstaltungen-im-sprachenatelier.html?viewpassed=1 Vergangene Termine - Aktuelle Termine anzeigen]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|...
It is 2014. The Earth is no longer flat and most people are no longer apes. Rather, they have learnt in the meantime what it was like at the beginning and also at the end for that matter. Soon the last spot of land on the Earth has been visited, captured by Google-Maps and extolled in a holiday song. And everything else that could be marketed, had been offered to the market and sold to the highest bidder. Since forests, mountains, rivers were soon cut down, destroyed and fished empty, everyone flocked to the city, where there remained neither sufficient space nor air to breath. And even for the most fit everything leftover – Darwin's Jungle Book – had at some point become too dangerous for them to continue living out their superiority.
However the people were connected to each other until the end. People told themselves that it was a significant advancement to hear about the death of Paris Hilton's dog, and also having the book at the touch of a button was a great thing. Because of electronic intercommunication a famous media theorist had in 1962 suggested that the world was growing into a "global village". Afterwards there was no longer any "outside". In the information age we were all neighbours, we bought our bread rolls, cobs, buns in the same bakeries - only the term used was still divisive. We had the same favourite drink, watched the same film at the cinema, used the same ringtone and wore the same clothes. In spring, summer, autumn and winter.
"The world is not my Village", my neighbourhood, my barrio, the dump where I want to live. As a point of reference we choose a fourth world, the stars of fantasy, criticism and utopia, for it could be indeed different. For bread and peace, freedom and palaces! From the ancient philosopher Protagoras the following sentence: "Man is the measure of all things". Whoever, upon hearing this, only thinks of themselves, fails to recognise that the measure should be put against everyone and not just one person! Understood in this way, the title of the event series has, alongside the world-critical meaning, also one that is self-critical: one's own village is not the centre of the universe and the famous church is sometimes better located outside outside of the village.
"The World is not my Village" is not to be understood as a blind criticism of a globalised world, nor as a taboo of individual opinion, rather as an invitation and a call to reflect upon both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dieweltistnichtmeindorf.wordpress.com/was-ist-die-welt-ist-nicht-mein-dorf-kommentare |title=Was ist "Die Welt ist nicht mein Dorf"- Kommentare, |last=Wiebel |first=Andreas |publisher=Open Publishing |date= 2014 |website=Die Welt ist nich mein Dorf |access-date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kulturmittwoch'' is weekly, extracurricular cultural programme. Museum visits, neighbourhood walks, lectures or film showings offer an insight into German culture as well as the chance to put German language skills into practice and make new contacts.

A '''student leader''' is any student who takes on the responsibility of spreading knowledge through inspiration, tutoring, campaigns etc.
A student leader strives to change the world by starting with their own community. [[Hardik Padhiyar]] is a student leader.

==Position details==
Student leadership positions are often made available through an application process . This process varies from school to school and position to position, some being highly selective while others are relatively easy to fill. Some student leadership positions are unpaid while others receive an [[hourly wage]] for their work. Many positions that have odd hours or unclear work times will receive a [[stipend]] rather than an hourly wage. This is often the case for resident assistants, members of student government, and student representatives on government boards or panels.

In a broader sense, a student leader can take up the responsibility of their community, their city, their country or the world and work towards it with our without the help of a mentor.

Although most student positions on government panels are advisory, the state boards of education of California and Massachusetts include student members with full voting authority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasbe.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NASBE-State-Education-Governance-State-by-State-Matrix-July-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A student leader could be any of the following roles.

=== Primary or secondary school ===
* Member of [[student government]], [[student council]], or [[Associated Student Bodies|ASB]].
* [[Teachers aide]]
* [[Peer mentor]]
* Member of any number of [[student club]]s or organizations
* [[Peer-mediated instruction]]

=== Colleges ===
* [[Resident Assistant]]
* Member of [[student government]]
* Member of [[Residence Hall Association]] or [[NACURH]] or [[NRHH]]
* Member of incoming [[First year|freshmen]] [[First-Year Student Orientation|orientation]] team
* Student assistant or employee
* Member of any number of [[student club]]s or organizations
* [[Peer-mediated instruction]]

The '''United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)''' is a dedicated training arm of the United Nations system. UNITAR provides training and capacity development activities to assist mainly developing countries with special attention to [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs), [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) and other groups and communities who are most vulnerable, including those in conflict situations. 

==Facts==
*Established in 1963
*Close to 55,000 participants per year 
*Close to 500 training related activities per year
*Headquarters in [[Geneva]] (Switzerland) with offices in [[New York City]] (US); [[Hiroshima]] (Japan) and project offices in [[Port Harcourt]] (Nigeria) and [[Islamabad]] (Pakistan)
*17 associated training centers ([[CIFAL]])
*About 220 staff and collaborators

==History==

The idea of a United Nations training and research institute was mentioned for the first time in a 1962 resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitar.org/resource/sites/unitar.org.resource/files/document-pdf/GA-1827-XVII.pdf|title=Resolution 1827 (XVII) of 18 December 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNITAR was founded in 1963, following the recommendation of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|UN Economic and Social Council]] to the General Assembly, which commissioned the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] with the establishment of a United Nations Institute for Training and Research as an autonomous body within the [[United Nations System|UN system]].&lt;ref&gt;Economic and Social Council – Thirty-sixth Session Annexes Document E/3780 United Nations Training and Research Institute – [http://www.unitar.org/sites/default/files/uploads/20160506133359.pdf Note by the Secretary-General, 28 May 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitar.org/resource/sites/unitar.org.resource/files/document-pdf/GA-1934-XVIII.pdf General Assembly resolution 1934 (XVIII) of 11 December 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of UNITAR coincided with the addition of 36 States since 1960, including 28 African States to the [[United Nations]]. That unprecedented wave of [[decolonization]] created a critical need for assistance, as many of the newly-independent States lacked the capacity to train their young diplomats. Shaped by its first four Executive Directors&lt;ref&gt;[http://unitar.org/former-executive-directors-unitar Former UNITAR Executive Directors]&lt;/ref&gt; originally from newly-independent African States, the Institute’s vision of training was developed considering the very needs and priorities of recipient countries.

UNITAR commenced functioning in March 1965. The Institute originally had its headquarters based in [[New York City|New York]]. In 1993, UNITAR’s headquarters were transferred to [[Geneva]] (Switzerland).

==UNITAR today==

[[File:AfricaDay2008.jpg|thumb|[[Multiculturalism]]]]

The Institute provides training and learning services to national and local government officials of [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] and [[civil society]] representatives from around the world. UNITAR strives to respond to the growing demand from [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member States]], especially the [[Least Developed Countries]], for capacity development in the thematic areas of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]].

UNITAR helps governments to understand [[climate change]], chemicals and [[waste management]], and [[green economy]]. The Institute also assists ministries of finance through its courses on public debt management, finance and trade, and it provides government officials with training in [[Peacekeeping]] and conflict prevention. Through its programme on operational satellite applications ([[UNOSAT]]), the Institute provides [[satellite imagery]] and analysis.

Since 2003 UNITAR provides courses to support municipal and regional leaders dealing with complex [[Public policy|public policies]].

Another task of the Institute is to organize knowledge sharing events for the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]], including the annual seminar for [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General|Special Representatives of the UN Secretary-General]] as well as strategic meetings for UN Departments. UNITAR also spearheads UN inter-agency initiatives such as the one UN Learning Platform on [[Climate change|Climate Change]] or the [[Global Migration Group]].

UNITAR’s research activities are focusing on [[Knowledge-based systems|knowledge systems]] and their practical applications. They support the Institute’s [[training]] activities through the provision of learning environments adapted to respond to the needs of adult learners, thus facilitating the increase, efficiency and outreach of the Institute’s capacity development activities.

==Governance==
[[File:UN General Assembly 20-11-2009.jpg|thumb|[[UN General Assembly]] 20-11-2009]]

Operated as an autonomous body within the [[United Nations System|United Nations system]], UNITAR is headed by an Executive Director&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unitar.org/executive-director Nikhil Seth, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General, Executive Director, UNITAR]&lt;/ref&gt; and governed by a Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitar.org/board-trustees UNITAR Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Director and the members of the Board of Trustees are appointed by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]].

[[File:Old University Basel.jpg|thumb|250px|Old University Basel]]
The '''University of Basel''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Universität Basel'') is located in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded on 4 April 1460, it is Switzerland’s oldest university and among the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|world's oldest surviving universities]]. The university is traditionally counted among the leading institutions of higher learning in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.universitieshandbook.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&amp;link_id=13&amp;task=viewlink&amp;Itemid=53|title=University of Basel|first=Swiss|last=Universities|date=|website=Swiss Universities Handbook - Top Universities in Switzerland|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The associated [[Basel University Library]] is the largest and among the most important libraries in the country. The university hosts the faculties of [[theology]], [[law]], [[medicine]], [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]], [[science]], [[psychology]], and [[business and economics]], as well as numerous cross-disciplinary subjects and institutes, such as the [[Biozentrum University of Basel|Biozentrum]] for biomedical research and the Institute for European Global Studies. In 2016, the University boasted 12,852 students&lt;ref name="unibas.ch"/&gt; and 377 professors.&lt;ref name="unibas.ch"/&gt;  International students accounted for 24 percent of the student body.&lt;ref name="unibas.ch"/&gt;

In its over 500-year history the university has been home to [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], [[Leonhard Euler]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Tadeusz Reichstein]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Karl Barth]] and [[Jeanne Hersch]]. The institution is associated with nine [[Nobel prize]] winners and two [[Presidents of the Swiss Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/|title=All Nobel Prizes|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/bundespraesidium/bundespraesidenten-und-schweizer-geschichte/praesidenten-seit1848-liste.html|title=Bundespräsidenten|last=Bundesrat|first=Der|website=www.admin.ch|language=de|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Johann von Venningen Bischof Basel.jpg|thumb|left|Inauguration ceremony of the University of Basel, 1460]]

The University of Basel was founded in connection with the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]]. The deed of foundation given in the form of a [[Papal bull]] by [[Pope Pius II]] on November 12, 1459, and the official opening ceremony was held on April 4, 1460.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History | website=www.basel.com | publisher=[[Archive.org]] | accessdate=14 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the University of Basel was decreed to have four faculties—arts, medicine, theology, and jurisprudence. The faculty of arts served until 1818 as the foundation for the other three academic subjects. In the eighteenth century as Basel became more commercial, the university, one of the centres of learning in the Renaissance, slipped into insignificance. Enrollment which had been over a thousand around 1600, dropped to sixty in 1785 with eighteen professors. The professors themselves were mostly sons of the elite.&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Lionel, ''Basel in the age of Burckhardt '' (Chicago, 2000) p. 35, and note 20; p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of centuries as many scholars came to the city, Basel became an early centre of book printing and humanism. Around the same time as the university itself, the [[Basel University Library]] was founded. Today it has over three million books and writings and is the largest library in Switzerland.

Located in what was once a politically volatile area, the University’s fate often ebbed and flowed with regional political developments, including the Reformation, the Kantonstrennung (separation of the Canton of Basel City from Basel Land), and both World Wars.  These factors affected student attendance, funding, university-government relations. In 1833 the Canton of Basel split in two with the Federal Diet requiring that the canton's assets, including the books at the University library, be divided—two-thirds going to the new half canton of [[Basel-Landschaft]]. The city, [[Basel-Stadt]], had to buy back this share and the university became so impoverished that it drastically reduced its course offerings. Students were expected to continue their education after two years or so at a German university.&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt;

Student enrollment surged after the University shed its medieval curriculum (including the elimination of Latin as the official language of the course catalog in 1822) and began to add more faculties, especially those in the humanities and sciences. Liberal Arts became a faculty in 1818, from which the Philosophy and History and Natural History faculties were derived in 1937.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Georg Kreis, "550 Years of the University of Basel: Permanence and Change" (Basel, 2010) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The University subsequently established the Faculty of Science (1937), the Faculty of Business and Economics (1996), and the Faculty of Psychology (2003).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; During the 20th century, the University grew rapidly, from one thousand students in 1918 to eight thousand in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Kreis, "550 Years of the University of Basel: Permanence and Change" (Basel, 2010) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The first woman who was admitted to the University, [[Emilie Frey]], began her medical studies in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/zeitstrahl/|title=550 Jahre Universität Basel|first=|last=Fellmann|website=www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411052307/http://www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/zeitstrahl/|archivedate=11 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the seizure of power in the year 1933 by the [[Nazis]], numerous renowned German professors decided to emigrate to Basel and started to work at the University of Basel. Several Swiss scholars also returned, inter alia the Law Professor [[Arthur Baumgarten]] (1933), the Theologians [[Karl Barth]] (1935) and [[Fritz Lieb]] (1937) and after World War II the Philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] from [[Heidelberg University]] (1948), as well as the surgeon [[Rudolf Nissen]] (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D10971.php|title=Universität Basel|last=Kreis|first=Georg|website=HLS-DHS-DSS.CH|language=de|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1996, the University of Basel became independent from the cantonal government and thus earned its right to self-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/juengste-geschichte-ab-1985/der-weg-zu-einem-neuen-universitaetsgesetz/neues-universitaetsgesetz.html|title=550 Jahre Universität Basel|first=|last=Fellmann|website=www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328184514/https://unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/juengste-geschichte-ab-1985/der-weg-zu-einem-neuen-universitaetsgesetz/neues-universitaetsgesetz.html|archivedate=28 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Canton of Basel-Landschaft voted in favor to share the sponsorship of the University in parity with the Canton Basel-Stadt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/juengste-geschichte-ab-1985/bewaehrungsproben-und-entwicklungen/bewaehrungsproben.html|title=550 Jahre Universität Basel|first=|last=Fellmann|website=www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925033706/http://www.unigeschichte.unibas.ch/550-jahre-im-ueberblick/juengste-geschichte-ab-1985/bewaehrungsproben-und-entwicklungen/bewaehrungsproben.html|archivedate=25 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===University administration===
Since January 1, 1996, the University of Basel has been independent. The University Law of 1995 stipulates that, “The University of Basel is an institution established under public law. It has its own legal personality and right to self-government.”&lt;ref&gt;Kreis,p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
As the entity that formally receives the Performance Mandate (Leistungsauftrag) for the University from both supporting cantons, the University Council (Universitätsrat) is the supreme decision-making body of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unibas.ch/de/Universitaet/Leitung-Organisation/Universitaetsrat/Aufgaben.html|title=Aufgaben|website=www.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128155253/https://www.unibas.ch/de/Universitaet/Leitung-Organisation/Universitaetsrat/Aufgaben.html|archivedate=28 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council consists of eleven voting members and three non-voting members, including the President, the Executive Director, and the Secretary of the Council.
Beneath the University Council are the Senate (Regenz) and the President’s Board. The 80-member Senate consists of the senior members of the President’s Board, faculty deans, professors, lecturers and research assistants, assistants, students, and administrative and technical employees.
The President’s Office is tasked with leading the overall university business. It consists of the President and her staff, a General Secretariat, an Administrative Directorate, the Communications and Marketing Office, and two respective Vice-Presidents for Research and Education.

==Student life==
The University hosts several formal institutions that are intended to serve the needs of its students. The Student Advice Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Advice/Student-Advice-Center.html|title=Student Advice Center|website=www.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054251/https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Advice/Student-Advice-Center.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides advice on academic degree programs and career opportunities. The Student Administration Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/Vice-President-for-Education/Student-Services/Student-Administration-Office.html|title=Page not found|website=www.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202060011/https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/Vice-President-for-Education/Student-Services/Student-Administration-Office.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides information on applications, grants, mobility, exchanges, and disability services.

===Student organizations===
There are also a variety of organizations that cater to international students, such as local chapters of Toastmasters and AIESEC, and associations that perform community services (Beraber, for instance, provides remedial lessons to immigrant youth). There is a foreign affairs association (Foraus), a Model United Nations team, and various choirs and orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Student-Life/Student-Organizations.html|title=Student Organizations|website=www.unibas.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930102103/https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Student-Life/Student-Organizations.html|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various religious groups.

A number of other student groups exist out of formal venues. The most recognizable are the “Studentenverbindungen,” traditional student associations dating from the 19th century that organize social events, share common uniforms, and often focus on particular hobbies, such as sword fighting. Such associations include the Akademische Turnerschaft Alemannia zu Basel, AKW Raurica, Helvetia Basel, Jurassia Basiliensis, Schwizerhüsli, A.V. Froburger, and Zofingia. Membership in many is restricted to men, though A.V. Froburger also accepts women.

===University sports===

It acts as an official student representative and has no political or religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skuba.ch/ueber-uns|title=Über uns – Studentische Körperschaft der Universität Basel|website=www.skuba.ch|accessdate=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327082739/http://skuba.ch/ueber-uns/|archivedate=27 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivian E. Browne''' (April 26, 1929&amp;ndash;July 23, 1993) was an American artist. Born in [[Laurel, Florida]], Browne was mostly known for her African-American protest paintings, and linking abstraction to nature. She has received multiple awards for her work, been an activist, professor and a founder of many galleries. According to her mother, Browne died at 64 from [[bladder cancer]].

==Biography==
Vivian Browne was born in [[Laurel, Florida]], on April 26, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thecrowsneststudio.com/artists/196-2/vivian-e-browne-cv/|title = Vivian E. Browne CV|website = The Crows Nest Studio|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of her life in [[New York City]] and [[Kern County]], [[California]]. She received her [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1950 from [[Hunter College]], New York, NY and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from [[Hunter College]] in 1959. She was invested in her travels across [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], also studying at the [[University of Ibadan]] in [[Nigeria]] in 1972. Browne worked at [[Rutgers University]] in Newark from 1971 to 1992 as a Faculty member of the Arts and Sciences department while continuing as an artist in her own right with shows across the country. Her early painting career was fostered by a scholarship from the [[New School for Social Research]], and a [[Huntington Hartford Foundation]] fellowship in 1964 and a fellowship with the [[MacDowell Colony]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Collections==
Browne's work is housed in public and private collections all over the United States, primarily in New York and California. Most notably her work can be found in the collections of the [[Smithsonian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=624|title=Artworks Search Results / American Art|website=americanart.si.edu|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Robert Blackburn (artist)]] printmaking workshop, [[MOMA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/ps1_artists/artists_b5|title = MoMA {{!}} MoMA PS1 Artists|website = www.moma.org|access-date = 2016-03-05|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151012011833/http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/ps1_artists/artists_b5#|archive-date = 2015-10-12|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Schomburg Center]] NYC, [[Chase Manhattan Bank]]  the [[John Cotton Dana Library]], the Hatch-Billops Collection, the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] Museum, The [[New York Public Library]]  and the [[Harry Belafonte]] &amp; [[Rosa Parks]] private collections.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hamalian, L.. (1985). Talking to Vivian Browne. Black American Literature Forum, 19(1), 48–50. http://doi.org/10.2307/2904481&lt;/ref&gt; Browne is included in the Center for the Women in the Arts and Humanities virtual exhibit at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cwah.rutgers.edu/programs/mary-h-dana-women-artists-series/40-years-of-women-artists-at-douglass-library/virtual-exhibit/#B|title=Center for Women in the Arts and Humanities|website=cwah.rutgers.edu|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Many of Browne's works, particularly those from the 1960s, showcase her dissatisfaction with the struggles of growing up as a [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] black woman. "Black art is political. If it's not political, it's not black art".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While she fought for equality, she was not optimistic about attitudes changing soon, and self categorized her look at art into two  categories. "When I am political, I am painting as a black or as a woman or both. Otherwise, I am just a member of the human race".

'''Xiaolian''' ({{zh|c=孝廉}}; literally "[[wikt:filial|filial]] and incorrupt"), was the standard of nominating civil officers started by [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 134 BC. It lasted until its replacement by the [[imperial examination]] system during the [[Sui Dynasty]]. In Confucian philosophy, [[filial piety]] is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;[Confucianism in Context Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the advice of [[Dong Zhongshu]], Emperor Wu ordered each district to recommend one filial and one incorrupt candidate for civil offices. Later the nomination became proportional. [[Emperor He of Han]] changed the proportion to one candidate for every 200,000 residents, and one for every 100,000 residents in [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority]] regions. The nominator was also responsible if the nominee was charged with corruption, and could be punished if he refused to nominate qualified individuals.

After the [[Han dynasty]], high positions were usually nominated according to the [[Nine-rank system]], so Xiaolian became increasingly unimportant. During the [[Tang dynasty]], both systems were replaced by the [[imperial examination]] system.
