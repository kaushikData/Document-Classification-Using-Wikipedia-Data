{{Religious text primary|date=October 2011}}
According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amaleki''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|k|aɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «a-măl´a-kī»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] record keeper (ca 130 BC).  He received the [[Plates of Nephi]] from his father [[Abinadom]], and penned 18 verses in the [[Book of Omni]] (Omni 1:12-30). He was the last person to write in the small [[plates of Nephi]].

In his brief contribution to the ''Book of Mormon'', Amaleki relates the flight of [[King Mosiah I]] and his people from the [[land of Nephi]],  and the subsequent discovery of the people and land of [[Zarahemla]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, like the [[Nephites]], were descendants of the [[Israelites]] of the [[old world]].  Amaleki's writing also introduce the [[Jaredites]] for the first time in the ''[[Book of Mormon]]'', since the people of Zarahemla had contact with [[Coriantumr]], the last surviving Jaredite.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death, Amaleki passed the Nephite record to [[King Benjamin]], who was the son of Mosiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Omni|omni|1|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
According to [[Hugh Nibley]], the name ''Amaleki'' simply means "my king."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh W. Nibley]], ''[http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1135&amp;index=26 Teachings of the Book of Mormon]'', Semester 1, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[Bruce R. McConkie]] once said: "Amaleki explained that 'there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord:  and that which is evil cometh from the devil' (Omni 1:25; see also Alma 5:40).  This is the great litmus test for determining the truthfulness or rightness of a matter- does it invite and entice one to come unto God, to partake of his goodness and grace, to enjoy the fruits of his Spirit, to gain in time those godly attributes and godly powers which will equip the person to be with and be like God?  If it does so, it is of God."&lt;ref&gt;McConkie, Millet, and Top, ''Doctrinal Commentary on the Book of Mormon'', vol. 4, p. 335{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bishop of Chichester''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Chichester]] in the [[Province of Canterbury]]. The diocese covers the counties of [[East Sussex|East]] and [[West Sussex]].  The [[Episcopal see|see]] is based in the [[Chichester|City of Chichester]] where the bishop's seat is located at the [[Chichester Cathedral|Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity]]. On 3 May 2012 the appointment was announced of [[Martin Warner (bishop)|Martin Warner]], [[Bishop of Whitby]], as the next Bishop of Chichester.&lt;ref name=number10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/diocese-of-chichester/ |title=10 Downing Street — Queen approves Martin Clive Warner for election as Bishop of Chichester|publisher=number10.gov.uk (10 Downing Street) |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His enthronement took place on 25 November 2012 in Chichester Cathedral.

The bishop's residence is The Palace, Chichester. Since 2015, Warner has also fulfilled the diocesan-wide role of [[alternative episcopal oversight]], following the decision by Mark Sowerby, Bishop of Horsham, to recognise the orders of priests and bishops who are women.

==Earliest history at Selsey==
The [[episcopal see]] at Selsey was founded by Saint [[Wilfrid]], formerly [[Bishop of York|Bishop of the Northumbrians]], for the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Kingdom of Sussex]] in the late 7th century. He was granted land by [[Æthelwealh of Sussex]] to build a cathedral at Selsey. However, shortly afterwards [[Cædwalla of Wessex]] conquered the [[Kingdom of Sussex]], but he confirmed the grant to Wilfrid. The bishop's [[Cathedra|seat]] was located at [[Selsey Abbey]]. Nine years after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], in 1075, the [[Council of London (1075)|Council of London]] enacted that [[episcopal see]]s should be removed to cities or larger towns. Accordingly, the see at Selsey was removed to [[Chichester Cathedral|Chichester]]. Some sources claim that Stigand, the last Bishop of Selsey, continued to use the title Bishop of Selsey until 1082, before adopting the new title Bishop of Chichester, indicating that the transfer took several years to complete.&lt;ref name=dallaway25&gt;Dallaway.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0VkMAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA25  History of the Western Division of the county of Sussex, Volume 1 p. 25] accessed 18 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bishops resided until 1595 in [[Wurzen]]. In 1559 the diocesan [[temporalities]] within Saxony were seized by the [[Kursachsen|Electorate of Saxony]].

== Apostolic prefects of Meissen (1567–1921)==
In the Meisen diocesan area located outside of then Saxony in [[Lower Lusatia|Lower]] and [[Upper Lusatia]] there was no immediate overlord, since the then [[liege lord]] of the Two Lusatias, the Catholic king of Bohemia (in personal union Holy Roman Emperor) held the Lusatias as fief outright. The Kings of Bohemia did not effectively offend the spreading of the Protestant Reformation in the Two Lusatias. So it depended on the local [[vassal]]s if Lutheranism prevailed or not, following the principle of [[Cuius regio, eius religio]]. The Two Lusatias thus became an area of regionally altering predominant denomination. In 1560 Meissen's last bishop John IX had appointed Johann Leisentrit as [[diocesan administrator]] for the Lusatian part of the diocese, seated in Bautzen. After the Holy See had recognised as a matter of fact the suppression of the Meissen diocese within Saxony it converted its Lusatian part into an [[apostolic prefecture]] ('''[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Meißen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]]''') in 1567 with administrator Leisentrit elevated to prefect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddres.html "Diocese of Dresden-Meissen: Historical Details"] on: [http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org ''The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church: Current and historical information about its bishops and dioceses (Catholic Hierarchy)''], retrieved on 1 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In canon law an apostolic prefecture is a diocese on approval. 

According to its seat or its area comprised the prefecture was alternatively also called ''Apostolic Prefecture of Bautzen'' or ''Apostolic Prefecture of the Two Lusatias'', respectively. When in 1635 the Lutheran [[Electorate of Saxony]] annexed the Two Lusatias it guaranteed in the cession contract (''Traditionsrezess'') with Bohemia to leave the existing religious relations untouched. As a signatory of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648 Saxony later agreed to maintain the religious status quo as given in the reference year of 1624 in all its territories acquired since.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Hellinghausen, ''Kampf um die Apostolischen Vikare des Nordens J. Th. Laurent und C. A. Lüpke: der Hl. Stuhl und die protestantischen Staaten Norddeutschlands und Dänemark um 1840'', Rome: Editrice Pontificia Università Gregoriana, 1987, (=Miscellanea historiae Pontificiae; vol. 53), pp. 15seq. {{ISBN|88-7652-568-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Prussian annexation of Lower Lusatia and easterly Upper Lusatia in 1815 the Holy See disentangled the newly Prussian diocesan area and incorporated it into the Prussian diocese of Breslau in 1821. The remaining diocese, officially always called Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen, was thus also called the ''Apostolic Prefecture of (Saxon) Upper Lusatia''. The office of the apostolic prefect was held in personal union by the cathedral dean of Bautzen Cathedral. In the 19th century the episcopal function of the apostolic prefects was further emphasised by appointing them simultaneously with [[titular see]]s.

It is estimated that in the Middle East around 900,000 people, perhaps more, profess [[Buddhism]] as their religion. Buddhist adherents make up just over 0.3% of the total population of the Middle East. Many of these Buddhists are workers who have migrated from Asia to the Middle East in the last 20 years, many from countries that have large Buddhist populations, such as [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. A small number of engineers, company directors, and managers from [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Korea]] have also moved to the Middle East.

==Demographics==
[[Theravada Buddhism]] is the predominant religion of workers from Thailand and Sri Lanka. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] is the predominant religion of workers from East Asia and Vietnam, although [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], and [[Shinto]] are also represented among these people. In [[Dubai]] (the [[United Arab Emirates]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.emirates247.com/lankans-in-dubai-to-celebrate-vesak-2011-05-05-1.389291|periodical=Emirates 24/7|title=Lankans in Dubai to celebrate ‘Vesak’|date=2011-05-05|accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qatar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=71,8150,0,0,1,0#.Ue2G8tLIZIM|periodical=THE PENINSULA|title=Sri Lankans celebrate Vesak in Qatar|date=2009-05-09|accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the workers from Sri Lanka were allowed to celebrate [[Vesak]] (the most important holiday in Buddhism) in those [[Islamic]] countries.

==Saudi Arabia==
{{main|Buddhism in Saudi Arabia}}
{{Update|section|date=May 2015}}
The [[U.S. Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s ''International Religious Freedom Report 2007'' estimates that more than 8 million foreigners are living and working in [[Saudi Arabia]], including Muslims and non-Muslims.

In addition to 400,000 [[Sri Lankans]], there are a few thousand Buddhist workers from [[East Asia]], the majority of whom are [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], and [[Thai people|Thai]]. A number of [[Tibetans|Tibetan]]-[[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] immigrants may also be among the foreign population of Saudi Arabia.

Thus approximately 1.5% of Saudi Arabia's population – or around 400,000 people – are Buddhist, likely giving Saudi Arabia the largest Buddhist community in either the [[Middle East]] or the [[Arab World]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90220.htm U.S. Department of State.

The '''Buddhist Congregation Dharmaling''' is a Buddhist organization, which main office is registered to the Office for religious communities of the Government of [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvs.gov.si/en/religious_communities{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (n°33 on the list)&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist Congregation Dharmaling is also  signatory of an agreement with the State of Slovenia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp.gov.si/si/novinarsko_sredisce/novica/browse/1/article/745/5910/?cHash=db7c92669d Podpis sporazuma o pravnem položaju Budistične kongregacije Dharmaling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619015522/http://www.mp.gov.si/si/novinarsko_sredisce/novica/browse/1/article/745/5910/?cHash=db7c92669d |date=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Notinsource|date=September 2018}} and is as such the 6th religious community to have signed such agreement in Slovenia (after the four Christian faiths and the Muslim community).

Following primarily the [[Gelug]] lineage, the head of the organization, [[Lama Shenphen Rinpoche]] – a Western reborn and officially recognized [[tulku]] by the Tibetan community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tibetanlama.com/htmls/lama_dtls.asp?Section=Main&amp;ID=276&amp;S_Thought=GELUG |title=Tibetan Lamas detailed biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929030248/http://www.tibetanlama.com/htmls/lama_dtls.asp?Section=Main&amp;ID=276&amp;S_Thought=GELUG |archive-date=2007-09-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – has a non sectarian (Rime) type of approach. The Congregation’s teachings and practices are traditional, but are adapted to be accessible to Westerners and the life they live. A regular program of teaching exists in different countries and more periodical teachings are taking places in other countries where a study group exists. Retreats and seminars are also organized each year.

Dharmaling is also active in the humanitarian fields, through [[AMCHI]] non profit organization created since 1989, and its Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zavod.dharmaling.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010949/http://zavod.dharmaling.org/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} Dharmaling Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Dharmaling now exists as a registered religious community in [[Slovenia]] and [[Hungary]], and as non profit organization in [[Austria]] and [[Russia]]. There are several groups apart from these main branches, more organized as study groups, regularly organizing the visits of Lama Shenphen Rinpoche, such as in [[Romania]] or [[France]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dharmaling.org/content/view/66/69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011041/http://www.dharmaling.org/content/view/66/69 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} (program)&lt;/ref&gt;

A premise was purchased in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] and was consecrated as a Buddhist temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmaling.org/content/view/67/70 Ljubljana Center Location&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010831/http://www.dharmaling.org/content/view/67/70 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This became also the main seat of the Buddhist Congregation Dharmaling.

== Spiritual teachers  and lineage ==
The main teacher and spiritual director of the organization is Lama [[Shenphen Rinpoche]].

Dharmaling invites teachers of different lineages of Buddhism. As visiting teachers Dharmaling already received Geshe Khedrup a Lharampa Geshe from [[Sera Monastery|Sera]]-Jhe monastery, and Tulku Gyatso a Rinpoche from Kham (Tibet).

===Lineage===
The main transmission of teaching and practices is coming from the [[Gelug]] tradition, but also from [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools. The practices are primarily Gelug, but Shenphen Rinpoche has written several practices which are not connected with one school in particular, to allow common practice.

== Activities ==
[[File:Dharmaling Ljubljana Temple c.jpg|Dharmaling Temple in Ljubljana|right|300px]]

===Program of teachings and practices===
Dharmaling's program is composed of regular teachings on traditional texts and more general lectures. According to the time and place Rinpoche chooses to follow on a series of teaching, sometimes over several months a specific text, or to give a talk on a specific subject.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Lama Shenphen Rinpoche teaches regularly the root traditional texts: “The 37 practices of a Bodhisattva”, “[[Lam Rim]]”, “The Wheel of Sharp Weapons”, “The [[Heart Sutra]]”, “[[Lojong]]”, but also giving teachings on more general subjects to highlight the understanding of some concepts and find a corresponding way to practice them in everyday life. Among such subjects are “Peace and Emptiness”, “How to deal with emotions”, “Entering the Vajrayana Path”, and “Practice of Bodhicitta in every day life”.

===Humanitarian activities===
Dharmaling has engaged in several humanitarian missions, through [[AMCHI]], a non profit organization created to separate the religious activities from the humanitarian ones.

The '''Center for Jewish Studies Shanghai''' (CJSS, Simplified: 上海犹太研究中心, Traditional: 上海猶太研究中心, Pinyin: ''Shànghǎi Yóutài Yánjiūzhōngxīn'') was established in 1988. It is a department of the [[Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]]. Under the leadership of Dean [[Pan Guang]] CJSS has become the most influential research institute in China studying Judaism and Israeli affairs. 

The Center focuses its research on the history of the "Shanghai Jews" ([[the Holocaust]] refugees during [[World War II]]), the remnants of Jewish communities in China (the largest of which are in [[Tianjin]], [[Harbin]] and [[Kaifeng]]) and political studies on the Near East. Amongst the publications of the Center are ''The Jews of China'', ''The Jewish Civilization'', ''The Revitalization of the Jewish People'' and ''Jews in China: Legends, History and New Perspectives''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311193059/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_7i.htm]

The Center has organized several national as well as international academic conferences along with so-called Rickshaw Reunions (reunions of Holocaust refugees who survived the Holocaust in [[Shanghai#During World War II|Shanghai]]). The Center has been visited by prominent guests, amongst them [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ehud Olmert]], [[Gerhard Schröder]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Hillary Clinton]] and then [[Austria]]n President [[Thomas Klestil]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045108/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_3.htm]

Since 2006 the CJSS receives each year an [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service|Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant]] from the [[Austrian Service Abroad]].

In Tibetan Buddhism the '''Chokling Tersar''' (mchog gling gter gsar) are a collection of formerly hidden teachings or [[Terma (Buddhism)|termas]] revealed by [[Chokgyur Lingpa]], whose current reincarnations are [[Neten Chokling]] Rinpoche and [[Tsikey Chokling Rinpoche]], whose foundation to propagate the Chokling Tersar is the [[Chokgyur Lingpa Foundation]]. These teachings were often revealed in combination with [[Jamyang Khyentse]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]].

'''Christian liturgy''' is a pattern for worship used (whether recommended or prescribed) by a Christian congregation or [[Christian denomination|denomination]] on a regular basis. Although the term [[liturgy]] is used to mean public worship in general, the [[Byzantine Rite]] uses the term "Divine Liturgy" to denote the [[Eucharist]]ic service.&lt;ref&gt;Mother Mary and Ware, Kallistos Timothy, ''Festal Menaion'' (3rd printing, 1998), St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, p. 555, {{ISBN|1-878997-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]]. Liturgy is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the 'Word of God' (the [[Christian Bible]]) and encouraged in their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]]. In most Christian traditions, liturgies are presided over by [[clergy]] wherever possible.

==Partial list of Christian liturgical rites (past and present)==
Different Christian traditions have employed different rites:

====Protestant churches====
While some [[Protestant church]]es see no need for set liturgies, many of these churches have retained them.

=====Reformed Churches=====
{{see also|Reformed worship}}
[[Protestant Reformation]]-era ministers of the Reformed tradition used set liturgies which emphasized preaching and the Bible. English [[Puritans]] and [[English dissenters|separatists]] moved away from set forms in the 17th-century, but many Reformed churches retained liturgies and continue to use them today.

=====Lutheran Churches=====
*[[Church of Denmark]]
*[[Church of Norway]]
*[[Church of Sweden]]
*[[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Church of Finland]]
*[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]
*[[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]
*[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]
**[[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]] &lt;!-- All Lutheran churches listed use this liturgy --&gt;

=====Anglican Communion=====
At the time of [[English Reformation]], The [[Sarum Rite]] was in use along with the Roman Rite. Reformers in England wanted the Latin mass translated into the English language. Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer authored the ''[[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|Exhortation and Litany]]'' in 1544. This was the earliest English-language service book of the [[Church of England]], and the only English-language service to be finished within the lifetime of King Henry VIII.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;F Proctor &amp; W.H. Frere, ''A New History of the book of Common Prayer'' (Macmillan 1905) p31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1549, Cranmer produced a complete English-language liturgy. Cranmer was largely responsible for the first two editions of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. The first edition was predominantly pre-Reformation in its outlook. The Communion Service, Lectionary, and collects in the liturgy were translations based on the [[Sarum Use|Sarum Rite]]&lt;ref name="G.M."&gt;{{cite book

The revised edition in 1552 sought to assert a more clearly Protestant liturgy after problems arose from conservative interpretation of the mass on the one hand, and a critique by [[Martin Bucer]] (Butzer) on the other. Successive revisions are based on this edition, though important alterations appeared in 1604 and 1662. The 1662 edition is still authoritative in the [[Church of England]] and has served as the basis for many of Books of Common Prayer of national Anglican churches around the world. Those deriving from Scottish Episcopal descent, like the Prayer Books of the American Episcopal Church, have a slightly different liturgical pedigree.

*''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''
*[[Exhortation and Litany (1544)|''Exhortation and Litany'' (1544)]]

=====The United Methodist Church=====
The United Methodist liturgical tradition is based on the Anglican heritage and was passed along to Methodists by [[John Wesley]] (an Anglican priest who led the early Methodist revival) who wrote that {{cquote|there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety, than the Common Prayer of the Church of England.&lt;ref&gt;''Works of John Wesley'', vol. XVI, page 304&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
When the Methodists in America were separated from the [[Church of England]], John Wesley himself provided a revised version of The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' called the ''Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America''. Wesley's ''Sunday Service'' has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since.

The United Methodist Church has official [[liturgy|liturgies]] for services of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]], [[baptism]], [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[ordination]], [[anointing of the Sick|anointing of the sick]] for healing, and [[canonical hours|daily office]] 'praise and prayer' services. Along with these, there are also special services for [[Liturgical year|holy days]] such as [[All Saints' Day|All Saints Day]], [[Ash Wednesday]], [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], and [[Easter Vigil]]. All of these liturgies and services are contained in ''The [[United Methodist Hymnal]]'' and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;2008 ''Book of Discipline'' paragraph 1114.3&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these liturgies are derived from the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, [[vestment]]s, paraments, banners, and liturgical art.

===United and Uniting churches===

====Church of South India====
The liturgy of the [[Church of South India]] combines many traditions, including that of the Methodists and such smaller churches as the Church of the Brethren and the Disciples of Christ. After the formation of the Church of South India the first synod met at [[Madurai]] in March 1948 and appointed a liturgical committee. The first [[Church of South India Synod|Synod]] in 1948 (where the Holy Communion service was that of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland) appointed a liturgy committee, composed mainly of Western theologians. The liturgy so prepared was first used at the Synod Session in 1950 and approved for use throughout the church "wherever it is desired" in 1954. The first version of the [[Confirmation|Confirmation Service]] for the new church was also released in 1950, translated into regional languages and was quickly adopted by the various dioceses.

By 1962 the Liturgy Committee was able to prepare a number of Orders. They were Eucharist, Morning and Evening Prayer, Marriage Service, Burial Service, Ordination Service and Covenant Service (1954), Holy Baptism (1955) and Almanac (1955–56). The ''Book of Common Worship'' of the CSI was published in 1963 with all the above orders of service. The orders of service consist of: Order for Morning and Evening Worship, Order of Service for the Baptized Persons, Order for Holy Baptism, Order for the Churching of Women, Order for Holy Matrimony, Order for the Burial Service, Order for the Covenant Service, Order for Ordination Services.

The CSI liturgy was again revised in the year 2004 and published as a hardback book in 2006.

The CSI Synod Liturgical Committee has developed several new orders for worship for different occasions. The order for the Communion Service, known as the CSI Liturgy, has been internationally acclaimed as an important model for new liturgies. The Committee has also produced three different cycles of lectionaries for daily Bible readings and "propers", and collects for Communion services. In addition, the Committee has also brought out a Supplement to the ''Book of Common Worship''.

==Frequent practice==
The [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|''Mass'']] is the service in which the [[Eucharist]] is celebrated. In [[Latin]], the corresponding word is ''Missa'', taken from the dismissal at the end of the liturgy - "Ite, Missa est", literally "Go, it is the dismissal", translated idiomatically in the current English [[Roman Missal]] as "Go forth, the Mass is ended." [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches call this service the ''[[Divine Liturgy]]''.  [[Oriental Orthodox]] call their Liturgy the [[Holy Qurbana]] - Holy Offering. Anglicans often use the Roman Catholic term ''mass'', or simply ''Holy Eucharist''. Mass is the common term used in the [[Lutheran]] Church in Europe but more often referred to as the [[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Divine Service]], Holy Communion, or the Holy Eucharist in North American Lutheranism.

[[Lutheran]]s retained and utilized much of the Roman Catholic mass since the early modifications by [[Martin Luther]]. The general order of the mass and many of the various aspects remain similar between the two traditions. Latin titles for the sections, psalms, and days has been widely retained, but more recent reforms have omitted this. Recently, Lutherans have adapted much of their revised mass to coincide with the reforms and language changes brought about by post-Vatican II changes.

Protestant traditions vary in their liturgies or "orders of worship" (as they are commonly called). Other traditions in the west often called "[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]]" have benefited from the [[Liturgical Movement]] which flowered in the mid/late 20th Century. Over the course of the past several decades, these Protestant traditions have developed remarkably similar patterns of liturgy, drawing from ancient sources as the paradigm for developing proper liturgical expressions. Of great importance to these traditions has been a recovery of a unified pattern of Word and Sacrament in Lord's Day liturgy.

Many other [[Protestant]] Christian traditions (such as the Pentecostal/Charismatics, [[Assembly of God]], and Non-denominational churches), while often following a fixed "order of worship", tend to have liturgical practices that vary from that of the broader Christian tradition.

==Other offices==
''[[Matins]]'' is generally said in the morning, independently of the Eucharist. ''[[Vespers]]'' are prayers generally said in the evening, independently of the Eucharist. Matins and Vespers are the two main prayer times of Christian churches, and are also called Morning and Evening Prayer.

In the Catholic Church, these two offices are part of a series of prayer hours, called the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], the [[Canonical Hours]], the Divine Office, the [[Roman Breviary]], and other names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11219a.htm Fernand Cabrol, "Divine Office" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1911)]&lt;/ref&gt; There were eight such hours, corresponding to certain times of the day: [[Matins]] (sometimes called [[Vigils]]), [[Lauds]], [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], [[Terce]], [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]], [[Vespers]], and [[Compline]]. The [[Second Vatican Council]] ordered the suppression of Prime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html Second Vatican Council, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'', 89 d] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221180735/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |date=February 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In monasteries, Matins was generally celebrated before dawn, or sometimes over the course of a night; Lauds at the end of Matins, generally at the break of day; Prime at 6 AM; Terce at 9AM; Sext at noon; None at 3PM; Vespers at the rising of the Vespers or Evening Star (usually about 6PM); and Compline was said at the end of the day, generally right before bed time.

In [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, the offices were combined into two offices: [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], the latter sometimes known as Evensong. In more recent years, the Anglicans have added the offices of Noonday and Compline to Morning and Evening Prayer as part of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. The [[Anglican Breviary]], containing 8 full offices, is not the official liturgy of the Anglican Church.

In [[Lutheranism]], like Anglicanism, the offices were also combined into the two offices of [[Matins in Lutheranism|Matins]] and [[Vespers in Lutheranism|Vespers]] (both of which are still maintained in modern Lutheran prayer books and hymnals). A common practice among Lutherans in America is to pray these offices mid-week during Advent and Lent. The office of Compline is also found in some older Lutheran worship books and more typically used in [[Christian monasticism#Lutheran Church|monasteries]] and [[seminaries]].

The [[Byzantine Rite]] maintains a daily cycle of seven non-sacramental services:
* Vespers (Gk. ''Hesperinos'') at sunset commences the liturgical day
* Compline (Gk. ''Apodeipnou'', "after supper")
* Midnight Office (Gk. ''mesonyktikon'')
* Matins (Gk. ''Orthros''), ending at dawn (in theory; in practice, the time varies greatly)
* The First Hour
* The Third and Sixth Hours
* The Ninth Hour
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday; for details, see [[Canonical hours#Aggregates|Canonical hours — Aggregates]].

''Great Vespers'' as it is termed in the Byzantine Rite, is an extended vespers service used on the eve of a major Feast day, or in conjunction with the divine liturgy, or certain other special occasions.

==History of the Roman Catholic Mass==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
This section will describe the evolution of the liturgical celebration known as the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] by Roman Catholics, which appears similar to [[Anglican]] mass or Holy Eucharist. It is called the [[Divine Liturgy]] by many groups of Orthodox Christians.

Generally it is theorized that the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostle]]s obeyed the command "do this in memory of me", said during the [[Last Supper]], and performed the liturgy in the houses of Christians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Besides repeating the action of [[Jesus]], using the bread and wine, and saying his words (known as the words of the institution), the rest of the ritual seems to have been rooted in the Jewish [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|Seder]], and [[synagogue]] services, including singing of [[hymn]]s (especially the Psalms, often responsively) and reading from the Scriptures ([[Bible]]).

Until the 4th century, when the church established a [[Biblical canon]], a manner of things were read during the liturgy besides the Prophets, including papal [[encyclical]]s from Pope St. Clement. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Many elements of these liturgies began to be fixed in several popular settings, and a book called the [[Apostolic Constitutions]], from the fourth century, shows an outline for the liturgy which is incorporated in almost all Western and Eastern rites. This includes the use of the [[prayer]] known as the [[Sanctus]], which is prefaced by a long introduction; it also includes a fairly fixed series of prayers leading up to the consecration.

Vestments worn by the [[Bishop]]s and [[Priest]]s at this point were academic robes of the educated class.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Later, as fashions changed the styles for the [[clergy]] remained the same and were embellished. Following the custom of the synagogue, the liturgy was normally sung. Many places divided the congregation into male and female. At some point both Western and Eastern churches adopted the use of curtains to mask the clergy at the altar at certain points; this curtain became the rood screen and [[altar rails]] in western churches, and [[iconostasis]] in the Byzantine East, while still being used in [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] and Syriac Churches.

=== Regional variation ===

The earliest church used Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek in the liturgy. Over time, however, the local vernacular languages became the liturgical languages of later centuries. The Greek-speaking empire retained the mainly Greek liturgy. The West used Latin, eventually dropping most Greek usage. Egypt and Armenia used Coptic and classical Armenian, respectively. As Christianity spread to different [[nation]]s around the [[Mediterranean]], several distinct traditions developed, each with a different liturgical language: the Alexandrine Tradition ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]), Syriac Tradition ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]), Byzantine Tradition (Greek), Armenian Tradition ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), and the Latin Tradition ([[Latin]]).

These basic traditions gave rise to several distinct rites. The Coptic and Ethiopic rites came from the Alexandrine Tradition. The Chaldean, Malabar, Syriac, Malankar, and Maronite rites developed from the Syriac Tradition. The Greek and Slav variants of the Byzantine liturgy emerged from the Byzantine Tradition. The Armenian rite developed from the Armenian Tradition. The Roman, Ambrosian, and Mozarabic liturgical rites came from the Latin Tradition. These regional variations of the liturgy over time diverged into distinct branches of the Christian liturgical tradition, each retaining fundamental characteristics with external particulars influenced by local customs and traditions.

=== Standardisation at the Council of Trent (1545–1563) ===

In the particular Latin Church of the Catholic Church throughout earlier centuries there was much regional variation in the liturgy due to the lack of centralisation that existed in the western church at the time due to the fall of the western empire. This resulted in regional variations of the Latin [[liturgical rite]] such as the Celtic rite and [[Gallican rite]], of which today only the Mozarabic rite and [[Ambrosian rite]] remain in addition to the normative Roman rite. The liturgical rite was standardized throughout much of the [[Catholic Church]].

Standardization was enforced at the [[Council of Trent]], which suppressed regional variations in favour of the Roman liturgical rite. Most of the particulars of the resulting Tridentine Mass were already in existence in the usage of Rome. Pope Pius V permitted rites in existence for at least 200 years to continue in use; however, in the following centuries almost all rites were abandoned except those of religious orders and the afore-mentioned Ambrosian and Mozarabic liturgical rites.

==Commonalities==
There are common elements found in most Western liturgical churches which predate the [[Protestant Reformation]]. These include:
*The [[Procession]] with the cross, followed by the other acolytes, the deacons and the priest
*The [[Invocation]] (beginning with the [[Sign of the Cross]])
*[[Confession (religion)|Confession]] at the foot of the [[altar]]
*[[Absolution]]
*[[Introit]], [[Psalm]]s, [[Hymn]]s, [[chant]]s
*[[Litany]]
*[[Kyrie]] and [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]
*Salutation
*[[Collect]]
*Liturgical Readings ([[call and response]])
*[[Alleluia]] Verse and other responses
[[File:Misa Gereja Santa 2.jpg|thumb|Scripture readings at  [[Gereja Santa]], [[Indonesia]]]]

*The [[Prayer]]s
*The [[Lord's Prayer]]
*[[Commemoration of the Saints]] and prayers for the faithful departed.

*[[Incense]]
*[[Alms|Offering]]
*A division between the first half of the liturgy, open to both Church members and those wanting to learn about the church, and the second half, the celebration of the Eucharist proper, open only to baptized believers in good standing with the church.
* The [[Consecration]]
* The Offertory Prayer
*[[Eucharist|Communion]]
*[[Sanctus]] prayer as part of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]]
*A [[Sursum Corda|three-fold dialogue]] between priest and people at the beginning of the [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]] or [[eucharistic prayer]]
*An [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphora]], [[eucharistic prayer|eucharistic canon]], "great thanksgiving", [[Biblical canon|canon]] or "hallowing", said by the priest in the name of all present, in order to consecrate the bread and wine as the Body and Blood of Christ.
*With one exception, that of [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari|Addai and Mari]], all of the extant anaphoras incorporate some form of Jesus' words over the bread and wine at the [[Last Supper]]: "This is my body" over the bread and, over the wine, "This is my blood."
*A prayer to God the Father, usually invoking the Holy Spirit, asking that the bread and wine become, or be manifested as, the body and blood of Christ.
*Expressions within the anaphora which indicate that sacrifice is being offered in remembrance of Christ's crucifixion.
*A section of the anaphora which asks that those who receive [[Eucharist|communion]] may be blessed thereby, and often, that they may be preserved in the faith until the end of their lives
*[[Holy kiss|The Peace]] or "Passing of the Peace"
*[[Agnus Dei]]
*[[Benediction]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2383">'''Claudia Augusta''' ({{IPA-la|ˈklawdɪa|classical}}; January 63 – April 63) was the only daughter of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]] by his second wife Roman Empress [[Poppaea Sabina]]. She was born in Antium ([[Anzio]]) on 21 January 63.

Nero honored Claudia and her mother with the title of [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]. Gold statues were placed in temples and circus games were held in Claudia's honor. 
She died three months &lt;ref&gt;Tacitus' Annals XV chapter 23&lt;/ref&gt; after her birth of illness. Nero and Poppaea Sabina mourned her death and Claudia was declared a goddess. A shrine and a priest were dedicated to her shortly afterward.

In the [[Fatimid]] era [[Ismaili|Ismā'īlī]] faith, the term ''dā'ī'' has been used to refer to important religious leaders other than the hereditary [[Shi'a Imam|Imām]]s working under their commands known as ad-Da'i al-Bilaagh (Arabic: الداعي البلاغ), and the [[Dawah|Da'wah]] or "Mission" is a spiritually guided clerical-style organisation. "The Da'wah" was a term for the [[Ismā'īlī]] faith itself from early on. They are also called [[List of Dai of Dawoodi Bohra|Dā'ī Syednas]].

==History==
According to [[Ismā'īlī]] [[Mustaali|Musta'alavī Tayyabī]]  tradition, before the 21st Fatimid [[Mustaali|Musta'alavi]] [[Imam]], [[Taiyab abi al-Qasim]] went into state of [[ghaybah|occultation]] from Cairo in 528 AH/1134 AD, his father, the 20th Imām [[Mansur al-Amir Bi-Ahkamillah|al-Amīr]] had instructed Queen [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]]/[[Al-Hurra Al-Malika]] in [[Yemen]] to anoint a vicegerent after the occultation - the Dāʻī al-Mutlaq, who as the Imām's vicegerent, has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thedawoodibohras.com/the-dal-al-mutlaq.html|title=The Dawoodi Bohras - The Dal Al Mutlaq|website=thedawoodibohras.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the spiritual rank in [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili Da'wah]] which became more explicit and operational after the seclusion of 21st Imam.  After Prophet Mohammad this rank is on the 6th position and after this comes Mazoon-مأذون and Mukaasir-مکاسر who are in turn appointed by the Dā'ī al-Mutlaq.  Before the seclusion, the Da’i or a missionary works under the direct orders of Imaam and his trusted associates in all the 12 islands-جزائر where faithful were present and living openly propounding their faith or secretly due to the fear of their lives.

During the Imam's occultation, the Dā'ī al-Mutlaq is appointed by his predecessor in office.  Da’i was given Itlaaq-إطلاق&lt;ref&gt;'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Aqeedat ul-Muwahhedeen wa Muzehato Maraatib Ahl id-Deen:''''' 8th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Husain bin Saiyedna Ali bin Mohammad al-Waleed (d. 667 AH/1269 AD)&lt;/ref&gt; or a free conduct and absolute religious and social authority but under the governing principles of Isma’ili Taiyebi Faith.  His command is regarded as a final decree guided by the divine support of Imam and this is the reason he is called Da’i al-Mutlaq. Unlike the case of Imam, where he appoints his successor only from his sons through divinely guided practice called Nass-نص, the Da’i can appoint anyone in his place who is most trusted, pious and capable of carrying Da’wah affairs with wisdom and proficiency. The first Da'i al-Mutlaq of the [[Taiyabi Ismaili]] sects was Syedna [[Zoeb bin Moosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thedawoodibohras.com/the-dal-al-mutlaq.html|title=The Dawoodi Bohras - The Dal Al Mutlaq|website=thedawoodibohras.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dā'ī al-Mutlaq is recognised in [[English law]] as a [[corporation sole]], by a private act of Parliament passed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1993/10/contents/enacted Dawat-e-Hadiyah Act 1993 (c. x) at Legislation.gov.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tradition of ''Nass'' governing the Appointment of Da'i ===
Nass-نص  is a declaration and designation through [[Spirituality|Divine Indication]] and Spiritual Intervention-تأئید إلھي for the appointment of a successor-منصوص, be it an Imam or his deputy-داعي during Imam’s concealment by his predecessor-ناص amongst his subjects, publicly-نص جلي or privately-نص خفي and at times supported by written documentary orders-سجل شریف.  This tradition and practice-سنۃ اللہ is related to the Isma’ili Taiyebi succession to the seat of Imaamat,&lt;ref&gt;'''''Tohfat ul-Quloob wa Farjat ul-Makroob'':''' 3rd Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Haatim Mohiyuddin (d. 596 AH/1199 AD)&lt;/ref&gt; whereby each Imam under hidden heavenly commands designates his successor, when he witnesses the [[Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|Light of Imaamat]]-نور الإمامۃ has got transferred to one of his sons whom he selects for Nass.  During the seclusion of Imam, his deputy-Da’i performs this act of succession whom he finds eligible for the status of Da’i.  He might not be from his sons, unlike the succession of Imam where an Imam always appoints his successor from one of his sons. 

The appointment according to Shi'a faith and sources is when Mohammad appointed his son-in-law, cousin and his heir 'Ali bin Abi Taalib as his Vicegerent, legatee and Wali&lt;ref&gt;'''''Taaj ul-‘Aqaa’id wa Ma’dan ul-Fawaa’id'':''' 5th Da’i-e-Mutlaq Saiyedna Ali bin Mohammad al-Waleed (d. 612 AH/1215 AD)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Faithful.  This Prophetic tradition is followed throughout the centuries be it the appointment of Imam or Da'i and as per Isma'ili-Taiyebi principles it is the belief that no Imam or Da'i dies without the appointment of his successor and this will continue till the Last Day of this World.

===Da'i al-Mutlaq governing the two Important Ranks: Mazoon and Mukaasir===
* المأذون المطلق - al-Mazoon al-Mutlaq, Mazoon e Mutlaq: The Licentiate, Authoritative Rank, the most trusted associate in Da’wah ranks who takes [[Bay'at al-Imam|Bay’at]]-Pledge of Loyalty from his subjects by the orders of Da’i al-Mutlaq.  He is on a Spiritual Rank in the Isma’ili Taiyebi Da’wah hierarchy immediately below the authority of Da’i who sits in his right side and who carries out the religious activities as per the regulations of Da’wah organization.  At any cost he always assists and obeys his superior and his Master, the Da’i al-Mutlaq.  His prime responsibility is to conduct teaching sessions and make them understand the basic things of Isma’ili Taiyebi faith.  In the absence of Da’i he acts as his legatee.  Da’i may appoint his Mazoon as his successor.  And if not Da’i can appoint someone more learned and efficient for the post of Da’i after him and can never disqualifies Mazoon from his post. As the respectable post of Mazoon is necessary for the completeness of Spiritual Hierarchy.

* المکاسر المطلق - al-Mukaasir al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir e Mutlaq - The Eight and the last rank in the Spiritual Hierarchy of the Isma’ili Taiyebism.  He sits left to the Da’i al-Mutlaq during the religious gathering-Majlis. He is lower to the rank of Mazoon. He is well versed and well informed about the baseless beliefs of other sects for which he thinks as a threat to the faith of believers.  His responsibility is to train the beginner - مستجیب مؤمن and win over the neophyte who is little aware of the overall understanding of Islamic Faith and by proper grooming he enters him into the fold of [[Isma'ilism|Isma’ilism]] by taking Oath of Fealty in the name of the present Da’i al-Mutlaq.  He is quite expert in putting Rational and Logical arguments with necessary ideological and doctrinal proofs and healthy debates.

===Da'i al-Mutlaq===

الداعي المطلق، داعي المطلق - ad-Da'i ul-Mutlaq or Da'i al-Mutlaq: It is the spiritual rank in Isma'ili Da'wah which became more explicit and operational after the seclusion of 21st Fatimid Imam of Cairo, Abul Qaasim at-Taiyeb in 528 AH/1134 AD. After Mohammad this rank is on the 6th position and after this comes Mazoon-مأذون and Mukaasir-مکاسر. Before the seclusion the Da’i or a missionary works under the direct orders of Imaam and his trusted associates in all the 12 islands-جزائر where faithful were present and living openly propounding their faith or secretly due to the fear of their lives. In Yemen, after the seclusion, Da’i was given Itlaaq-إطلاق or a free conduct and absolute religious and social authority but under the governing principles of Isma’ili Taiyebi Faith. His command is regarded as a final decree guided by the divine support of Imam and this is the reason he is called Da'i al-Mutlaq. Unlike the case of Imam, where he appoints his successor only from his sons through divinely guided practice called Nass-نص, the Da’i can appoint anyone in his place who is most trusted, pious and capable of carrying Da’wah affairs with wisdom and proficiency. 

===Mazoon al-Mutlaq===
المأذون المطلق - al-Mazoon al-Mutlaq, Mazoon e Mutlaq: The Licentiate, Authoritative Rank, the most trusted associate in Da’wah ranks who takes Bay’at-Pledge of Loyalty from his subjects by the orders of Da’i al-Mutlaq. He is on a Spiritual Rank in the Isma’ili Taiyebi Da’wah hierarchy immediately below the authority of Da’i who sits in his right side and who carries out the religious activities as per the regulations of Da’wah organization. At any cost he always assists and obeys his superior and his Master, the Da’i al-Mutlaq. His prime responsibility is to conduct teaching sessions and make them understand the basic things of Isma’ili Taiyebi faith. In the absence of Da’i he acts as his legatee. Da’i may appoint his Mazoon as his successor. And if not Da’i can appoint someone more learned and efficient for the post of Da’i after him and can never disqualifies Mazoon from his post. As the respectable post of Mazoon is necessary for the completeness of Spiritual Hierarchy. On the death of Mazoon, Da'i immediately appoints another trusted person on this rank.

===Mukaasir al-Mutlaq===
المکاسر المطلق - al-Mukaasir al-Mutlaq, Mukaasir e Mutlaq - The Eight and the last rank in the Spiritual Hierarchy of the Isma’ili Taiyebism.[38] He sits left to the Da’i al-Mutlaq during the religious gathering-Majlis. He is lower to the rank of Mazoon. He is well versed and well informed about the baseless beliefs of other sects for which he thinks as a threat to the faith of believers. His responsibility is to train the beginner - مستجیب مؤمن and win over the neophyte who is little aware of the overall understanding of Islamic Faith and by proper grooming he enters him into the fold of Isma’ilism by taking Oath of Fealty in the name of the present Da’i al-Mutlaq. He is quite expert in putting Rational and Logical arguments with necessary ideological and doctrinal proofs and healthy debates. On the death of Mukaasir, Da'i entrusts this rank to one of his close associates. In some cases, on the death of Mazoon, Da'i elevates Mukaasir to the rank of Mazoon.

=== Dawoodi Bohras ===
The [[Dawoodi Bohra]] follow [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]] [[Islam]] as propagated by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Imamate]] in medieval Egypt. They [[Salat|pray]] 3 times a day joining both afternoon prayers Zuhr and Asr and both evening prayers Maghreb and Isha, fast in the month of [[Ramadan]], perform [[Haj]] and [[Umrah]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and give [[Zakat]].

[[Taher Fakhruddin]] is a claimant to the title of 54th Da'i al-Mutlaq of the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawoodi-bohras.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, a sect within [[Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam]]. He is the oldest son of [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]], the [[53rd Syedna succession controversy (Dawoodi Bohra)|claimant to the position of 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq]]. After the death of the 52nd Da'i al-Mutlaq, [[Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin]], due to the succession controversy two claimants emerged, [[Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin]] and Khuzaima Qutbuddin. [[Khuzaima Qutbuddin]] died on 30 March 2016. On 31 March 2016 the family of Qutbuddin released a statement that "Khuzaima Qutbuddin has conferred nass (announcement of successor) on his son Syedna [[Taher Fakhruddin]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianage.com/mumbai/syedna-s-death-won-t-affect-succession-row-high-court-717&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of Qutbuddin regard Taher Fakhruddin as a rightly appointed Da'i al-Mutlaq whereas followers of Syedna [[Mufaddal Saifuddin]] do not recognize him as the Da'i al-Mutlaq. 

=== Alavi Bohras ===
{{Ismailism|collapsed=1}}This title is also used in the [[Alavi Bohra]] community to refer to their leader (in the Persian form [[Abu Hatim Tayyib Ziyauddin|"Da'i-e-Mutlaq"]]) for similar reasons.  At present Saiyedna [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] is the 45th Da’i al-Mutlaq of Alavi Bohras in the line of succession of these Da’is in which 24 are in Yemen, 7 are in Ahmedabad, 1 is in Surat and 12 are in Vadodara.  The 44th Da'i al-Mutlaq Saiyedna [[Abu Haatim Tayyib Ziyauddin|Abu Haatim Taiyeb Ziyauddin]] (d. 05-08-1436 AH/23-05-2015) appointed his eldest son [[Haatim Zakiyuddin]] as his successor.

=== Sulaymani ===
The [[Sulaymani]] branch of [[Tayyibi Isma'ilism]] is an [[Islam]]ic community, of which around 70 thousand members reside in [[Yemen]], while a few thousands of Sulaymani Bohras can be found in India and [[Pakistan]]. The Sulaymanis are headed by a da'i al-mutlaq from the Makrami family.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ismaʿilism III. Ismaʿili History |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ismailism-iii-ismaili-history |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sulaymanis split off from the Tayyibi community, following a succession dispute upon the death of [[Da'ud bin Ajabshah]] in 1589. While most of the Tayyibis in India recognised [[Da'ud Burhan al-Din]] as his successor and thus forming the [[Da'udi Bohra]]s, the Yemeni community followed [[Sulayman bin Hassan]]. Starting from 1677, Sulayman's successors almost always came from the Makrami family. The ''da'i''s made [[Najran]] their headquarters and ruled the area, supported by the [[Banu Yam]], until their power waned under the successive rules of the Ottomans and Saudis.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;

=== Atba-e-Malak Badar ===
The Atba-i-Malak community are a branch of Musta'ali Isma'ili Shi'a Islam that broke off from the mainstream Dawoodi Bohra after the death of the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq, under the leadership of Abdul Hussain Jivaji in 1840. They have further split into two more branches. The [[Atba-e-Malak Badar]] is a branch of [[Atba-i-Malak]] Mustaali Ismaili Shi'a Islam. They follow the preachings of both [[Abdul Hussain Jivaji]] and [[Badruddin Ghulam Hussain Miya Khan Saheb]]. The current leader or Dai al Mutlaq is Maulana Muhammad Amiruddin Malak Saheb. The Atba-i-Malak Badar community is based in Mahdibagh, [[Nagpur]] in India. The Mahdibagh Atba-i-Malak Badar community, is a unique community of peaceful and progressive Muslims, an elitist sect, known as Atba-e-Malak Badar (followers of Maulana Malak and Maulana Badar) named after the two founders of the religious order who founded it in 1891 AD in Nagpur, India. The [[Atba-i-Malak Vakil]] is a branch of Atba-i-Malak Mustaali Ismaili Shi'a Islam. They follow [[Abdul Qadir Ebrahimji]], who they believe to be the true successor to Abdul Hussain Jivaji. Their current leader is [[Tayyebhai Razzak]].

'''David Bernard Gaiman''' (1933 – 7 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title =Prominent East Grinstead figure mourned  | work =East Grinstead Courier and Observer  | publisher =www.thisissussex.co.uk  | date =11 March 2009  | url =http://www.thisissussex.co.uk/eastgrinstead/news/Prominent-East-Grinstead-figure-mourned/article-762176-detail/article.html  | archive-url =https://archive.is/20120912075914/http://www.thisissussex.co.uk/eastgrinstead/news/Prominent-East-Grinstead-figure-mourned/article-762176-detail/article.html  | dead-url =yes  | archive-date =12 September 2012  | accessdate =11 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was head of the UK branch of [[Church of Scientology]]. He and his wife Sheila joined Scientology in the early 1960s and Gaiman served as public relations director and was commonly in the media during the British controversies over Scientology in the 1960s and 1970s.

== Family and public career ==
Gaiman's family is of [[Polish people|Polish]] [[Jew]]ish origins; after emigrating from the [[Netherlands]] in 1916, his father eventually settled in the [[Hampshire]] city of [[Portsmouth]] on the south coast of England and established a chain of grocery stores. Born in 1933, Gaiman was educated at [[The Portsmouth Grammar School]], though he did not excel academically. He subsequently joined the [[British Army]] where he rose to the rank of [[sergeant]]. He returned to Portsmouth on leaving the army to work for his father in the grocery stores, though he detested this job.&lt;ref name="argus"&gt;{{cite news

He married Sheila on 1 March 1959.&lt;ref name="long weekend"&gt;[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/03/long-weekend.html Long Weekend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316192736/http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2009/03/long-weekend.html |date=16 March 2009 }} (Neil Gaiman, blog, 15 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually decided to go into business for himself, much to his father's displeasure,&lt;ref name="argus" /&gt; and the family moved away from their home in [[Portchester]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2004/04/oddments-and-oh-white-chocolate.asp|title=oddments.

When the Gaimans discovered Scientology they moved to [[East Grinstead]], West Sussex in 1965.&lt;ref name="argus" /&gt; David Gaiman joined the staff of the [[Church of Scientology]] at nearby [[Saint Hill Manor]], eventually becoming the Church's chief UK media spokesman.

== Guardian's Office ==

He joined the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO), the Church's public relations bureau/intelligence agency. In 1969, Gaiman was involved in an attempt by the Church to take over the National Association for Mental Health (now [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]), a British mental health charity. Some 300 Scientologists joined the group and nominated Gaiman, among others, for high office. Gaiman was nominated for the Chairmanship. Eventually, the Scientologists were asked to resign but contested that request in court. Scientologists also held demonstrations for, according to Gaiman, "humane treatment and a bill of rights for mental patients and the protection of their bodies and their well-being. We want an independent inquiry into conditions in mental hospitals. We want no more whitewashing from certain mental health organisations like the one across the road. Our stand is not on being asked to resign but for humane psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Rolph, ''[[Believe What You Like]]''&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, all members of the NAMH (or most of them) received a letter from Mr David Gaiman, the spokesman of Scientology, to whom their names and addresses had been perforce supplied by the NAMH.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s he became Deputy Guardian for Public Relations&lt;ref&gt;[[Paulette Cooper]], ''[[The Scandal of Scientology]]'', Appendix, {{cite web |url=http://www.factnet.org/Books/ScandalOfScientology/sos-app.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222324/http://www.factnet.org/Books/ScandalOfScientology/sos-app.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;br /&gt;In January 1971, I wrote to David Gaiman, Public Relations Director of Scientology in England, with whom I had had some earlier correspondence, informing him that this book was to be published and offering him a chance to give the Scientologists' side of the story in brief. I also requested information on some of Scientology's rehabilitation programs – their Human Rights Commission and Narconon, their program in India – so that some of this could also be included.&lt;/ref&gt; World Wide and Minister of Public Affairs for the Churches of Scientology Worldwide, as well as serving as public spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;''Van Wert Times Bulletin'', 7 September 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bucks County Courier Times'', 13 March 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents in the US vs Kember and Budlong case, Gaiman issued an order in 1975 for an operation to put false information in US security agency computers using planted agents. It was known as '[[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operation Cat|Operation Cat]]'. Kember also credited Gaiman with the strategy to claim that CoS plants inside the American Medical Association were reporters for [[Freedom (magazine)|''Freedom'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;US vs Kember and Budlong was part of the fallout of the 1978 [[United States v. Hubbard]] case, which charged many CoS members with conspiracy and other crimes related to [[Operation Snow White]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Sentencing Memorandum for US v Kember and Budlong is available at wikisource, [[s:United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum|Here]], or also the original PDF is available [http://www.suppressiveperson.org/writings/usa-v-kember-budlong-sentencing-memo-1980-01-72.pdf Here (accessed 2010 1 27)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718055641/http://www.suppressiveperson.org/writings/usa-v-kember-budlong-sentencing-memo-1980-01-72.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }}.

He rose to become the head of GO Public Relations and was a member of the powerful [[Watchdog Committee]]. In 1981 he was promoted to the position of Guardian (i.e. head of the Guardian's Office), replacing [[Jane Kember]] following her criminal conviction for conspiracy against the US Government (she had been part of Scientology's [[Operation Snow White]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | page=268 | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vitamin Shop and later life ==

In 1965, David and Sheila Gaiman co-founded a vitamin shop, G&amp;G Vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandgvitamins.com/aboutus.asp|title=Our History - gandgvitamins.com|author=|date=|website=www.gandgvitamins.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211211310/http://www.gandgvitamins.com/aboutus.asp|archivedate=11 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 G&amp;G moved to larger premises and began to manufacture its own label vitamins for the first time. With David’s leadership the demand for G&amp;G’s own-brand label and manufacturing expertise grew dramatically and in 1997 they moved to a 31,000 square foot factory and built a customised clean-room for optimum high speed production lines. It was from here that G&amp;G expanded its contract manufacturing arm, building up to the current capacity to manufacture 14,000,000 capsules per month for numerous companies across the UK and Europe under their own label. Today G&amp;G is still a family-owned business under the leadership of Mauro Calcioli, David’s son-in-law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2782">'''Derech Hateva''' ({{lang-he|דרך הטבע}}) is an educational organization in [[Israel]] that integrates nature hikes and [[Jewish]] learning.

== History ==
Derech Hateva was founded in 2004 by Yael Ukeles, a New York native and outdoor educator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tevaadventure.org/ta_foundingTA.shtml Ukeles bio]&lt;/ref&gt; The program was created connect Jews with Israel and to stress the connection that exists between Judaism and nature.  The organization began as an outgrowth of Ukeles' earlier program Teva Adventure and was incubated by [[SPNI]] (Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel) for its first years.

Derech Hateva is modeled after environmental programs in the [[United States]] like [[National Outdoor Leadership School]] and [[Outward Bound]].  The idea is to create educational opportunities by placing participants out in nature without modern conveniences, creating self and group reliance.

The first two summers were only open to [[Orthodox Judaism| religious]] Jewish teenagers. In 2007, it opened to young people from multi-denominational backgrounds in multiple sessions.&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/16110/ Program Lets Teens Find 'Way of Nature']. Michelle Mostovy-Eisenberg, May 15, 2008, Jewish Exponent&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The main program is the Israel Trail Teen Adventure (ITTA), a month-long hiking program covering some 215 kilometers in northern and southern Israel.  The program is divided into gender-segregated groups with each  group operating independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1153291959432&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull On the right track. Paula Margulies, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements of the program include hiking and biking in areas mentioned in the [[Bible]] along with development of outdoor living and leadership skills.  Participants are taught map-reading, setting up camp and preparing meals, combined with swimming, rock-climbing and other outdoor pursuits. The participants keep [[kosher]] and observe [[Shabbat]], exploring [[Judaism]] through relevant biblical texts on topics relating to nature.&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"/&gt;

Other programs include smaller trips and educational programming covering topics such as [[water conservation]] education and wilderness [[halacha]] (Jewish law).  The Derech Hateva program goals are to integrate teaching of outdoor skills, ecology, Leave No Trace ethics and Jewish learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechhateva.org/jeeDH_aboutDerechHateva.shtml Derech Hateva website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins was director of the Foothill College Writers' Conference 2003, 2006–2008.

==Education==
Union Institute, BA, 1990. The University of Iowa, MFA, 1993. Two years post-graduate studies in literature, [[multiculturalism]], and criticism at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], 1994–96.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html dorenrobbins.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710145615/http://www.dorenrobbins.com/Robbins/Biography.html |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early influences, development of poetry==
Doren Robbins began actively publishing [[poetry]] in the 1970s. In 1969, while reading [[Henry Miller]]'s ''The Time of the Assassins'', his study of [[Arthur Rimbaud]], Robbins became aware of [[Kenneth Rexroth]]'s poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable "Memorial" for [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 poetryfoundation.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010024456/http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171537 |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Thou Shalt Not Kill," about which Miller stated, "If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this "'Memorial.'" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with ''The Diary of Najinsky'', [[Van Gogh]]'s ''Letters'', [[Kenneth Patchen]]'s ''The Journal of Albion Moonlight'', [[Jack Hirschman]]'s ''Artaud Anthology'', and [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s ''The Murder of Christ'', making the connection to Rexroth's [[elegy]] for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted [[Social alienation|alienation]] of society with the [[vulnerability]] and ensuing [[martyrdom]] of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue "My Dylan Thomas," the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' ''Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By [[John Malcolm Brinnin]] and Leftover Life To Kill By [[Caitlin Thomas]]''. The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in general.
After a five-year period of studying many of the key books of [[Western literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[politics]], Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become—through his essays in ''Bird in the Bush'', ''Classics Revisited'', and ''Assays''; along with his ''Collected Shorter Poems'', ''Collected Longer Poems'', and his many books of translations—his initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]]. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solt&lt;ref&gt;[http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc highmoonoon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230015338/http://highmoonoon.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc |date=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker.

==Political sensibility==
Clearly, as explored in his essay ''The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community'',&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his prose poem, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', Perivale Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  honoring the [[anarchist]] organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation.  It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as ''For [[Pablo Neruda]],'' ''Hooker with a Lily'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Roots and the Towers'', Third Rail Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''They're Honking at a Woman'', ''The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream'', ''Collecting Myself'',&lt;ref&gt;''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;/ref&gt;  or the later poems ''My Pico Boulevard'', ''Gregor Samsa's Face'', ''Her Friday'',&lt;ref&gt;From ''Driving Face Down'', Eastern Washington University Press 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his more recent poems ''Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood'', ''Latina Worker'', ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', and ''Before and After Tampico''&lt;ref&gt;From ''My Piece of the Puzzle'', Eastern Washington University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetry.la/page188.html poetry.la]&lt;/ref&gt; display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter "Alienated Labor" from the ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts'', but the underlying thematics in Robbins' [[political poetry|political poems]] are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the''...Rabelais...Whitman'' essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people—aside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace—shows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Rail'' #4, 1980, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, as in his ''Neruda'' poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against—de Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that ''we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are—their work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane''.&lt;ref&gt;Third Rail #4, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem "Sympathetic Manifesto" with these final lines: "I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance" (60).  And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that "To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture—is the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans."&lt;ref&gt;Notes to ''The Three Penny Opera'', Grove, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there does not appear to be a consistent "reductive" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that "Complex seeing must be practiced."  Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are "Predators' Hour2, Open All Night"&lt;ref&gt;''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (63-66).&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Ash Lands." Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com.  Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Art supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other than our own resilient skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Baroque Magazine'' Vol. 26 No. 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: "Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty.  But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing."&lt;ref&gt;See "Biography," Dorenrobbins.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural work==
Influenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as [[George Hitchcock (poet)|George Hitchcock]]'s ''Kayak'', [[Clayton Eshleman]]'s ''Caterpillar'', and [[Robert Bly]]'s ''The Seventies'' with its emphases on "wild association", political poetry, and critical [[book review]]s, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, ''Third Rail'' (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982.
The avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos|Cantos]]'', [[William Carlos Williams]]'s ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]'', [[Louis Zukofsky]]'s ''"A"'', and [[Charles Olsen]]'s ''The Maximus Poems''. The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''[[Tender Buttons (book)|Tender Buttons]]'', the French "cubist" poetry of [[Pierre Reverdy]], and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets [[George Oppen]], the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and the [[Beat Generation]] poet [[Philip Whalen]]. On the other hand, [[Beat poet]]s [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Harold Norse]], and [[Charles Bukowski]] carried on the [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] tradition of the authentic voice, "I was the man, I suffered, I was there." Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'' combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's ''Kayak'' and Eshleman's ''Caterpillar'', Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to [[surrealism]], but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of "automatic writing" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of [[language poets]]. To this end Bly emphasized the works of [[Georg Trakl]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[César Vallejo]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive [[depth psychology]] fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and [[bathos]]; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated.
For Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of ''Third Rail'' was basically connected to the paths ''Kayak'', ''Caterpillar'', and ''The Seventies'' were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as "the international idiom". From 1975–1982, ''Third Rail'' published works by [[Henry Miller]], [[Walter Lowenfels]], [[Kenneth Rexroth]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Jack Micheline]], [[Christopher Buckley (poet)|Christopher Buckley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/buckley/index.html creativewriting.ucr.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Blazek]], [[Andrea Hollander Budy]], [[Naomi Shihab Nye]], Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, [[Paul Eluard]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], [[Natalia Gorbanevskaia]], [[Anna Akhmatova]] and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as "Poets on [[Chile]], Neruda, [[Isabel Allende|Allende]]" (1976) and "Poets Against Nuclear Power" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of ''Kayak Press'', George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker.

In 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, ''Electric Rexroth''.  His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, [[Gerald Stern]], Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, [[Ingrid Wendt]], Clayton Eshlemen, [[Marvin Bell]], and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for ''Electric Rexroth'' were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative [[lyrical poetry]]: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness  pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of cliché. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, "Someone waiting for me among the violins," Philip Levine's, "The Simple Truth," Tania Pryputneiwicz's "Labor," and Gerald Stern's "Ducks Are for Our Happiness," are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for ''Electric Rexroth'', Robert Bly's "An Open Rose," and "Grandma's Myth" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'' (Cedar Hill Press).

==Themes==
Ethnic and working-class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter.  Whether they be family members that escaped [[pogrom]]s in [[Ukraine]], deserted the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], survived [[World War I|WWI]], [[World War II|WWII]], the [[Korean War|American-Korean War]], or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the [[Vietnam War|American-Vietnam War]] or the violent conflicts in [[Latin America]], many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence.  The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of [[persecution]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems "Before and After Tampico", "Four Family", and "My Pico Boulevard". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and [[manifesto]], "Poetry is in the Streets" ("Le Poesy es en la rue"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and [[censorship]] underlying and undermining the subject.  These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of [[injustice]] and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament.  One of his more noted poems, "For Neruda",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Roots'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, [[dissidence]], and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to [[Joseph Stalin]].

Robbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, [[carpenter]]s and war [[veteran]]s making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a [[concentration camp]] working the [[delicatessen]] counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]s and [[department store]]s.  His poems "Anna", and "Dvayda", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Wife of Bath]]'' with her exceptional forthrightness or [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Emilia (Othello)|Emilia]] with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of [[B. Traven]]'s ''[[The Death Ship]]'' can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, "Before and After Tampico."

For Robbins, the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] of "Poetry is in the Streets" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]]s that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression.  Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or [[Cesare Pavese|Pavese]],&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Sympathetic'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, "Name a Dish After Me",&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, ''Donkey's'' 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure.

Robbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books ''Sympathetic Manifesto''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Sympathetic Manifesto'', (Van Nuys: Perivale Press, 1987) 73-91.&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''Seduction of the Groom''.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Seduction of the Groom: Love Poems'' (Palos Verdes, Loom Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are "In-terminal Rose", "Seduction of the Groom", "Dreaming of a Daughter", and "In the Middle of a Fight". Examples from his more recent collections ''Double Muse&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Double Muse'' (Rabbel-A Press 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;'',  ''The Donkey's Tale''&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren. ''The Donkey's Tale'' (Los Angeles, Red Wind Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Driving Face Down'',&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''Driving Face Down'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; and "My Piece of the Puzzle,&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Doren, ''My Piece of the Puzzle'' (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  include "You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I", "Marc Chagall and the Male Soul", "I Went Through a Box of Emily's [[Shell Jewelry]]", "The Eighties"; and from current published poems: "Pulled Over", "The Fire Petal", "The Weaving", "The Sexiest Part", "My Boat, My Waves", and "Badlands and Outlands".

While the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, "Badlands and Outlands" (''Double Muse'' 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, "Badlands and Outlands" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment.  The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self-destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces "not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops […]" And yet, there is "…the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is "crested, empathic, vulgar." The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: "momentary undermined attentions, in Florence—/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence."

==Style, form, and themes==
Many poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem.  In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, "I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[…]" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Doren Robbins, [untitled statement of prose poetry], ''Bear Flag Republic: Prose Poems and Poetics from California'', ed. Christopher Buckley and Gary Young (Santa Cruz: Greenhouse Review Press/ Alcatraz Editions, 2008) 327-28.&lt;/ref&gt;   Arguably, the collage technique of [[monologue]], short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and [[vaudeville]]-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in ''House of Fame'', Bottom's dream from ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', as well Shakespeare's other "clowns" in ''[[Othello]]'' and particularly the "philosophizing" clown in ''[[King Lear]]''.

Robbins' first prose collection, ''Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry'', certainly displays an affinity with [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne's]] enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. His prose poem essay in ''Bear Flag Republic'' notes with appreciation the writings of [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]], Henry Miller, [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Marguerite Young]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] Jr., [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Stephen Dixon (author)|Stephen Dixon]], and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted ''Journal of Albion Moonlight''.  Such works as "Chaucer's Quill, [[Sappho]]'s Libido, [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Eye Brows", "Dealing With the Insomnia Surf", "Pantagruel Antigruel", "As Much Sex as Elvis", "Green Torso", and "Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation", from ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'' appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry.  Whether these "omissions" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output.  Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after ''Parking Lot Mood Swing'', such as "Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/fiction.htm 25. Robbins, Café Irreal, #29]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Nothing but an Ear",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpse.org/ See ''Exquisite Corpse'', #14 &amp; #16]&lt;/ref&gt; "Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir",&lt;ref&gt;See ''Hotel Amerika'', Vol.7, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; from the forthcoming novella, ''Twin Extra'' (Highmoonoon 2010); and "Just My Luck", "My Defects Call Me Back", and "Night Song" from the ''Bear Flag Republic'' prose poem anthology.

{{Other uses|Dualism (disambiguation)}}
{{God}}
'''Dualism in cosmology''' is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.

Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In [[theology]], dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of [[Christianity]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of [[Taoism]]. It is also discussed in [[Confucianism]].

Many [[Mythology|myths]] and creation [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] with dualistic cosmologies have been described in [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two [[demiurge]]s, [[culture hero]]es, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 42&lt;/ref&gt; They may be often [[Twin (mythology)|believed to be twins]] or at least brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966: 71, 181&lt;/ref&gt; Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society ([[Kinship#Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides|moieties]]); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral dualism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Moral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of [[Monism|monist]] or [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be "moral" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.

For example, Mazdaism (Mazdean [[Zoroastrianism]]) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the [[antithesis]]&lt;!-- Mazdaism's core tenet is truth/[[asha]] vs falsehood. --&gt;—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. [[Zurvanism]] (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mandaeism]] are representative of dualistic ''and'' [[monism|monist]] philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religions, such as [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Catharism]], and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in [[Hermeticism]], where ''[[Nous]]'' "thought"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] is considered a logical fallacy.

===History===
Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [[Set (deity)|Set]] (disorder, death) and [[Osiris]] (order, life).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172631/dualism/38186/Egypt-and-Mesopotamia "Egypt and Mesopotamia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [[Ahura Mazda]] is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from ''[[druj]]'', which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give ''druj'' power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the [[good and evil|beliefs]] of later religions.

The religious dualism of [[Christianity]] between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy [[Satan]] (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: [[Neoplatonism and Christianity]]). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Knight | first = Kevin | title = Soul | encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia | edition = Online | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.htm | accessdate = 13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duotheism, bitheism, ditheism==
When used with regards to multiple gods, ''dualism'' may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply ''[[theism]]'' ([[god (word)|theos = god]]) at all.

Both bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. [[theodicy]]). In the original conception of [[Zoroastrianism]], for example, [[Ahura Mazda]] was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman ([[Angra Mainyu]]) was the spirit of ultimate evil.

In a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism{{clarify|reason=where would one go to [[Cf.|confer]]?|date=December 2016}}). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a [[Wiccan views of divinity|divine couple]], the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Moon Goddess]] and the [[Horned God]], who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of "good" and "evil" but are aspects of the natural world, much like [[yin and yang]] in [[Taoism]].)

===Radical and mitigated dualism===
* '''Radical Dualism''' – or absolute Dualism which posits two co-equal divine forces. [[Manichaeism]] conceives of two previously coexistent realms of light and darkness which become embroiled in conflict, owing to the chaotic actions of the latter. Subsequently, certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness; the purpose of material creation is to enact the slow process of extraction of these individual elements, at the end of which the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism likely inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zoroastrianism]], in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]; the two are engaged in a cosmic struggle, the conclusion of which will likewise see Ahura Mazda triumphant. '[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]' included the belief that the material world corresponds to some sort of malevolent intoxication brought about by the powers of darkness to keep elements of the light trapped inside it in a state of drunken distraction.
* '''Mitigated Dualism''' – is where one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. Such classical Gnostic movements as the Sethians conceived of the material world as being created by a lesser divinity than the true God that was the object of their devotion. The spiritual world is conceived of as being radically different from the material world, co-extensive with the true God, and the true home of certain enlightened members of humanity; thus, these systems were expressive of a feeling of acute alienation within the world, and their resultant aim was to allow the soul to escape the constraints presented by the physical realm.

However, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of [[Persephone]]). [[Marcionism]], an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Riparelli, ''Il volto del Cristo dualista. Da Marcione ai catari'', Peter Lang, Bern - Berlin - Bruxelles - Frankfurt am Main - New York - Oxford - Wien 2008, 368 pp.  {{ISBN|978-3-03911-490-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theistic dualism ==
In theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt;

===In Christianity===
[[Image:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209. The Cathars were denounced as heretics by the Roman Catholic Church for their dualist beliefs.]]
The dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including [[Marcionism]], [[Catharism]], [[Paulicianism]], and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]]. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe|year=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0680-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that [[Free will in theology|free will]] separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism.&lt;ref name="Rouner"/&gt; The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the [[Samkhya]] tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.&lt;ref name="Rouner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rouner|first=Leroy|title=The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology|year=1983|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22748-7|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Jeffrey|title=A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00684-0|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1912 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' describes that, in the Catholic Church, "the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected" by the thirteenth century, but [[mind–body dualism]] was not.&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[problem of evil]] is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by [[Constantine-Silvanus]], argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Janet |last2=Hamilton|first2=Bernard |last3=Stoyanov|first3=Yuri |title=Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, C. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4765-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catharism|Cathars]], a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was initiated by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1208 to remove the Cathars from [[Languedoc]] in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]], which began in 1233 under [[Pope Gregory IX]], also targeted the Cathars.&lt;ref name="Chidester"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chidester|first=David|title=Christianity: A Global History|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-251770-8|pages=266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gnosticism====
[[Gnosticism]] is a diverse, [[syncretistic]] [[religious movement]] consisting of various [[belief systems]] generally united in the teaching that humans are divine [[soul]]s trapped in a [[Nature|material world]] created by an imperfect god, the [[demiurge]], who is frequently identified with the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable [[God|supreme being]] that embodies good.

[[Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] and [[Cathar]]s are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective [[Salvation|salvific]] force.

===In Hinduism===
The [[Dvaita Vedanta]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate [[realities]]. The first and the more important reality is that of [[Shiva]] or [[Shakti]] or [[Vishnu]] or [[Brahman]]. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme [[Self]], God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul ([[Jiva]]), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to [[Advaita Vedanta]] ([[monistic]] conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&amp;pg=PA59 A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism]. iUniverse Inc. P. 59-60. {{ISBN|0-595-39312-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2018}} Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. [[Moksha|Salvation]] therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Jeaneane D.

==Ontological dualism==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|right|100px|thumb|The yin and yang symbolizes the duality in nature and all things in the Taoist religion.]]

Alternatively, ''dualism'' can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching [[categorization|categories]]. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of [[yin and yang]].&lt;ref name="Girardot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardot|first=N.J.|title=Myth and Meaning in Early Taoism: The Theme of Chaos (hun-tun)|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06460-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditions such as classical Hinduism, [[Zen]] Buddhism or [[Islam]]ic [[Sufi]]sm, a key to enlightenment is "transcending" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with [[monism]] or [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]].

===In Chinese philosophy===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of [[yin and yang]] is a large part of [[Chinese philosophy]], and is an important feature of [[Taoism]], both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jeremy|title=Yin and Yang|url=http://online.infobase.com/HRC/Search/Details/239492?q=yin%20and%20yang|website=Ancient and Medieval History|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in [[Confucianism]], but to a lesser extent.

Some of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, [[light]] and [[darkness|dark]], active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun.&lt;ref name="Yin and Yang"/&gt; The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.

The complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a [[feedback loop]], where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to [[homeostasis]]. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.

== In traditional religions ==

=== Uralic peoples ===
In a [[Nenets people|Nenets]] myth, Num and [[Nga (god)|Nga]] collaborate and compete with each other, creating land,&lt;ref name=land&gt;Vértes 1990: 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt; there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.&lt;ref&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparative studies of Uralic peoples and Kets ===
Among others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] compared the [[mythology]] of [[Ket people]] with those of [[Uralic peoples]], assuming in the studies, that there are modelling [[Semiotics|semiotic]] systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov &amp; Toporov 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hoppál&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of [[Ob-Ugric languages|Ob-Ugric]] peoples&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 225, 227, 229&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoyedic peoples]]&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229, 230&lt;/ref&gt; are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society&lt;ref name=noket2org&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 39&lt;/ref&gt; nor cosmological dualism&lt;ref name=ket2cosm&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 48&lt;/ref&gt; has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered;&lt;ref name=noket2org/&gt; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,&lt;ref&gt;Zolotaryov 1980: 37&lt;/ref&gt; folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land:&lt;ref name=ket2cosm/&gt; the diving of the water fowl.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 1984: 229&lt;/ref&gt; If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov"&gt;Zolotarjov 1980: 56&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chukchi ===
A [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings ([[bird]]s, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the [[raven]], collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).&lt;ref&gt;"Zolotarjov 1980: 40–41"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anyiszimov 1981: 92 – 98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fuegians ===
{{see also|Fuegians#Spiritual culture}}
All three [[Fuegians|Fuegian]] tribes had dualistic myths about [[culture hero]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yámana]] have dualistic myths about the two {{IPA-xx|joalox|}} brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the [[Selk'nam]].&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966:181&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] necessarily.&lt;ref name="Zolotarjov" /&gt;

According to ''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)'', supporters of EVF have stated that the schools do not teach hate, and that they themselves have been the target of a campaign by media and academic networks.{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Appendix K, pp. 160–172}}{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Chapter III, Section A, pp. 27–30}}

==Establishment and growth==
The Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation (EVF) was established in 1986 by [[Rakesh Popli]], a US-returned Indian nuclear scientist, and his wife Rama Popli, a child education specialist.&lt;ref name="visfot-ekal"/&gt; The couple established the foundation's first single-teacher school in [[Gumla district|Gumla]] in Jharkhand (then a part of [[Bihar]]).&lt;ref name="visfot-ekal"&gt;

 |trans-title=Solo effort for education and development}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was successful within two years and, in 1989, 60 single-teacher schools were started simultaneously in [[Dhanbad]]. By 1995–1996, the foundation was running 1,200 schools in [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref name="visfot-ekal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, global support networks were established. The Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of India was officially registered in 2000 and the EVF-USA was registered soon after.{{sfn|Tukdeo|2011|p=85}}

As of April 2008, there were more than 23,000 schools run by EVF, including 2,100 schools in the [[Northeast India|North Eastern states]].&lt;ref name="visfot-ekal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080407/jsp/northeast/story_9103098.jsp | title=Urban-rural exchange in Ekal conference | date=7 April 2008 | publisher=''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]''| accessdate=13 February 2010 | location=Calcutta, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of schools grew to 27,000 in 2010, 34,000 in 2011 and 51,717 in 2013.&lt;ref name="toi-ekal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff-ekal"/&gt; EVF's goal is to reach 100,000 villages in the India's [[India tribal belt|tribal belt]] by 2015.&lt;ref name="essel-ekal"&gt;{{cite web

EVF is associated with the Hindu nationalist organisations [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]], which is in turn a member of the [[Sangh Parivar]], the family of organisations run by the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS).&lt;ref name=tehelka1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dhar/&gt;
''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)'' points out that some who have been on the board of trustees of the foundation include [[B. K. Modi]], the founder of [[ModiCorp]], Justice [[Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati|P. N. Bhagwati]], former [[Chief Justice of India]]; [[Laxmi Mall Singhvi|L. M.

The foundation was headed in the past by [[Subhash Chandra]], the Chairman of [[Essel Group]] and the founder of [[Zee TV]].&lt;ref name="essel-ekal"/&gt; [[Hema Malini]], Indian actress and danseuse, has served as the global brand ambassador for the Ekal Vidyalaya movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hema to campaign for Ekal schools,  BJP|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2003-10-17/news/27547612_1_hema-malini-primary-education-rss|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=17 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Education===
The Ekal Vidyalayas provide five years of free, non-formal education to children from the age group 6–14 years. A typical school has 30–40 students taught by a local youth who has passed grades 8 or 9 and has been specifically trained. A local organizer looks after a unit of 10 schools, called a "subcluster". Local people are also involved in higher organization levels like a "cluster" (unit of 30 schools), subarea (unit of 90 schools), and area (unit of 270 schools). The classes take place under a tree or in a hut and use informal modes like storytelling, folk dramas, folk songs and religious discourses.&lt;ref name=sharma2002/&gt;&lt;ref name="dl-ekal"/&gt; 
In ''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)'' this non-didactic approach has been described by Dr. [[Ramesh Nagaraj Rao|Ramesh Rao]] and others as "assimilative and respectful of local cultural norms and belief systems".{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|p=7}}
Around half of the students and teachers are females, and about a fifth of the students go on to pursue higher education, some of which return to serve the foundation.&lt;ref name=sharma2002/&gt;

EVF's philosophy is to take a holistic approach to social and economic development, providing primary school education for children, as well as healthcare, livelihoods and empowerment education for the entire village.&lt;ref name=self&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The schools are primarily organized in small villages among India's tribal groups. The local youth who are trained to operate the schools are social workers and teachers, teaching sanitation and health care, literacy and Hindu nationalism.{{sfn|Spring|2008|p=158}}
Each school is run on an annual budget of around 20,000 [[Indian rupee]]s. At the national level, the schools are organized by Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of India.  Regionally, Ekal Vidyalayas are run by the [[Friends of Tribals Society]] (FTS) and [[Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad]] (BLSP) NGOs and by state-level groups such as Janahitha in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Bharatiya Janseva Sansthan in  [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="pk-ekal"&gt;{{cite news | last=Correspondent | first=Navada | publisher=''[[Prabhat Khabar]]'' | title = अब आयी एकल विद्यालय की अवधारणा | url = http://www.prabhatkhabar.com/node/31458 | accessdate=10 September 2011 | language=Hindi |trans-title=Here comes the concept of Ekal schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hindu165&gt;{{cite news

===Other activities===
Along with literacy, Ekal Vidyalaya schools also impart moral education.&lt;ref name="bhaskarekal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="djekal1"/&gt; EVF works in tribal areas on health care education with the emphasis on hygiene, treatment of general diseases, maternal and child care.

==Recognition and awards==

===Recognition===
EVF's single-teacher school concept and their contribution towards literacy and empowerment in the rural and tribal areas have been praised by several state governments and social organisations in India.&lt;ref name="ian-ekal"/&gt; [[Avinash Kaushik]], American entrepreneur and author, wrote that foundations like the [[Smile Train]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors Without Borders]] and Ekal Vidyalaya have done "incredible work" and "they make the world a better place".{{sfn|Kaushik|2009|p=9}}
Digital Learning, a magazine on education, described the non-formal education experiment by EVF in Jharkhand from 1986 to 1995–96 as "extraordinary", noting that literacy rate in Jharkhand doubled in this period, and diseases caused by unhygienic practices, witchcraft and alcoholism declined sharply.&lt;ref name="dl-ekal"&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 2008|title=Ekal Vidyalaya: 'One Teacher, One School, One Village'|journal=Digital Learning|publisher= Elets Technomedia Pvt.

==Controversy and criticism==

===Suspension of government funding===

In 2005, a report prepared by an enquiry committee of the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Indian Ministry of Human Resource Development]] found that in some Ekal Vidyalaya schools the names of enrolled students had been copied from registers of government-run schools. The schools did not provide reading and learning material, and used funds to "generate hatred toward minorities, and condition the minds of children". The report said the FTS was "misusing these funds, and using the grants for creating disharmony amongst religious groups and creating a political cadre". In May 2005 the Indian government stopped grants to the schools based on this report.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news

Quoting from the report in ''[[The Milli Gazette]]'', [[Mukundan C. Menon]] noted that the English booklet used to teach second year students in Jharkhand omitted six letters of the alphabet. Menon said the reason was names of Hindu Gods beginning with these letters are not common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Criticism===

In 2002, [[Sabrang Communications]] and South Asia Citizens Web published a report named ''The Foreign Exchange of Hate – IDRF and the American Funding of Hindutva'' on utilisation of funds by [[India Development and Relief Fund]].  The report alleged the VHP-run Ekal Vidyalaya schools had the goal of "Hinduizing" tribals and spreading hatred against Indian minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTk6_HXg5E8C&amp;pg=PA289 |page=289

In 2005 [[John Dayal]], then president of the [[All India Catholic Union]] (AICU) and a member of the [[National Integration Council]] expressed concern that the schools were spreading hatred towards members of the Christian minority, in order to "prevent conversions of tribals to Christianity by missionaries."&lt;ref name=Chaterjee20070719&gt;{{cite web

In a 2008 article [[Angana Chatterji]], associate professor of anthropology at [[California Institute of Integral Studies]], identified Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation of USA as one of the charities in the US that had allocated money "disproportionately directed to [[Hindutva]]-affiliated groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an article in the ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' of [[Pakistan]], [[Khalid Hasan]] described the Ekal Vidyalayas as having a "curriculum steeped in instilling hatred against non-Hindu religious minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rights activists have claimed that the schools pursue a Hindu-nationalist agenda and generate hatred towards non-Hindu minorities such as Christians.&lt;ref name=tehelka1/&gt;

===Response to criticism===

In response to the 2002 report published by Sabrang Communications, in March 2003 Ramesh Rao, professor of Communication at [[Truman State University]], and others wrote a report named ''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)''.
In this report, they wrote that "there has been a concerted campaign against the Ekal Vidyalayas by a combination of media and academic networks ... try as they might, they really cannot find anything wrong with the schools".{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Chapter III, Section A, pp. 27–30}}
According to Prakash Sharma, media convener of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, "The Ekal vidyalayas are our effort to reach the most deprived areas of the country. Christian missionaries get funds from all over the world: the entire Christian empire backs them. Ours is a completely indigenous effort".&lt;ref name=tehelka1/&gt; 
[[François Gautier]], French author and journalist, described the Ekal Vidyalayas as "a harmless programme doing wonderful job for tribal children", and questioned why organisations raising funds for them were attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)'' quotes Yvette Rosser as saying that "the ladies and gentlemen in the villages who teach in Ekal Vidyalaya schools are not teaching hate".{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Appendix K, pp. 160–172}}
''A Factual Response to the Hate Attack on the India Development and Relief Fund (IDRF)'' notes that several other authors have praised the schools' role in providing [[literacy]] to millions of children, and stated that the schools do not teach hate but have themselves been the target of a campaign by media and academic networks.{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Appendix K, pp. 160–172}}{{sfn|Rao et al 2003|loc=Chapter III, Section A, pp. 27–30}}

[[File:Astrological Chart - New Millennium.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A horoscope calculated for January 1, 2000 at 12:01:00 A.M. [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States|USA]] (Longitude: 074W00'23" - Latitude: 40N42'51")]]

A '''horoscope''' is an [[Astrology|astrological]] chart or diagram representing the positions of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[planets]], [[astrological aspects]] and [[Angle (astrology)|sensitive angles]] at the time of an event, such as the moment of a person's [[Childbirth|birth]]. The word ''horoscope'' is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] words hõra and scopos meaning "time" and "observer" (''horoskopos'', pl. ''horoskopoi'', or "marker(s) of the hour"). Other commonly used names for the horoscope in English include '''natal chart''', '''astrological chart''', '''astro-chart''', '''celestial map''', '''sky-map''', '''star-chart''', '''cosmogram''', '''vitasphere''', '''radical chart''', '''radix''', '''chart wheel''' or simply '''chart'''. It is used as a method of [[divination]] regarding events relating to the point in time it represents, and it forms the basis of the [[Horoscopic astrology|horoscopic traditions]] of astrology.

In common usage, ''horoscope'' often refers to an [[astrologer]]'s interpretation, usually based on a system of solar [[Sun sign astrology]]; based strictly on the position of the Sun at the time of birth, or on the calendar significance of an event, as in [[Chinese astrology]]. In particular, many newspapers and magazines carry predictive columns, written in prose that may be written more for increasing readership than tied directly to the Sun or other aspects of the solar system, allegedly based on celestial influences in relation to the [[zodiac]]al placement of the Sun on the month of birth, cusp (2 days before or after any particular sign, an overlap), or decante (the month divided into 3 ten-day periods) of the person's month of birth, identifying the individual's [[Sun sign]] or "star sign" based on the [[Sidereal and tropical astrology|tropical zodiac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/horoscope1.htm|title=How Horoscopes Work|date=29 January 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The horoscope serves as a stylized map of the heavens over a specific location at a particular moment in time. In most applications the perspective is [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] ([[heliocentric astrology]] being one exception). The positions of the actual planets (including Sun and Moon) are placed in the chart, along with those of purely calculated  factors such as the [[lunar node]]s, the [[House (astrology)|house]] cusps including the [[midheaven]] and the [[ascendant]], [[zodiac]] signs, fixed stars and the [[Arabian Parts|lots]]. Angular relationships between the planets themselves and other points, called [[astrological aspect|aspect]]s, are typically determined. The emphasis and interpretation of these factors varies with tradition.

==Etymology==
The [[Latin]] word ''horoscopus'', ultimately from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὡρόσκοπος }} "nativity, horoscope", literally "observer of the hour [of birth]", from  {{lang|grc|ὥρα}} "time, hour" and  {{lang|grc|σκόπος}} "observer, watcher".
In [[Middle English]] texts from the 11th century, the word appears in the Latin form and is [[anglicisation|anglicized]] to ''horoscope'' in [[Early Modern English]]. The noun ''horoscopy'' for "casting of horoscopes" has been in use since the 17th century ([[OED]]).
In Greek, {{lang|grc|ὡρόσκοπος}} in the sense of "[[ascendant]]" and {{lang|grc|ὡροσκοπία}} "observation of the ascendant" is in use since [[Ptolemy]] (''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' 33, 75).

* The '''native''' is the subject of the event (a birth, for example) being charted at a particular time and place, and is considered to be at the centre of the '''celestial sphere'''.
* The '''celestial sphere''' is an imaginary sphere onto which the zodiac, constellations and planets are projected.
* The '''plane of the equator''' is the plane of the Earth's [[equator]] projected into space.
* The '''plane of the ecliptic''' is defined by the orbits of the earth and the [[Sun (astrology)|sun]]. For practical purposes the plane of the equator and the plane of the [[ecliptic]] maintain a constant inclination to each other of approximately 23.5°.
* The '''plane of the horizon''' is centred on the '''native''', and is tangential to the earth at that point. In a sphere whose radius is infinitely large, this plane may be treated as nearly equivalent to the parallel plane with its centre at the Earth's center. This greatly simplifies the geometry of the horoscope, but does not take into account that the '''native''' is in motion. Some writers on astrology have thus considered the effects of [[parallax]], but most would agree that (apart from that of the moon) they are relatively minor.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Angles===
There are '''[[Angle (astrology)|four primary angles]]''' in the horoscope. These are, in order of power:

* First House ('''[[Ascendant]]''' – East Angle)
* Tenth House ('''[[Mid heaven, or Medium Coeli]]''' (M.C.) – North Angle)
* Seventh House ('''[[Descendant (astrology)|Descendant]]''' – West Angle)
* Fourth House ('''[[Imum Coeli]]''' or I.C. – South Angle)

The '''[[ascendant]]''' is the easternmost or sunrise point where the ecliptic and horizon intersect; the ascendant and the '''[[midheaven]]''' are considered the most important angles in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. In most systems of house division, the ascendant is the cusp of the 1st house and the midheaven is the cusp of the 10th house. The placement of the planetary ruler of the ascendant, called the ''[[Chart Ruler|chart ruler]]'' is also considered to be significant. The point in the west diametrically opposing the ascendant is called the '''[[Descendant (astrology)|descendant]]''', normally the cusp of the 7th house; and the point opposing the M.C. is the cusp of the 4th house, the northernmost point of the chart, called the '''[[Imum Coeli|imum coeli]]''' or I.C.

In creating a horoscope the ascendant is traditionally placed at the "nine o'clock" position on the left-hand side of the chart wheel (though traditional rectangular chart formats need not follow this convention). During the course of a day, because of the Earth's rotation, the entire circle of the ecliptic will pass through the ascendant and will be advanced by about 1°. This movement provides us with the term '''rising sign''', which is the sign of the zodiac rising over the eastern horizon at the moment of birth. The point on the ecliptic that is furthest above the plane of the horizon at the time is called the Midheaven, or ''medium coeli'' (M.C.), placed at the "twelve o'clock position" effectively where the Sun would be if the birth time was midday.

===The Zodiac===
[[Image:Astro signs.svg|thumb|right|The [[astrological symbols]]/[[glyphs]] used in Western astrology to represent the [[astrological signs]] ([[Zodiac]])]]

{{Main|Zodiac}}
* The '''Zodiac''', or "circle of animals" is a zone or belt in space projected onto the celestial sphere through which, from our viewpoint, the planets move. A symbolic geometric construction around 15 to 18 degrees wide, it is divided into 12 '''signs''', each of 30 degrees longitude (making 360 degrees in all), with the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, as its middle line.  The '''tropical zodiac''' used by most Western astrologers has its beginning at the exact moment that the Sun crosses the [[celestial equator]] and enters the zodiacal sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]. Some Western astrologers use the '''[[Sidereal astrology|sidereal zodiac]]''' favoured by Indian ("jyotish") astrologers, which is based more closely on actual positions of constellations in the heavens, as opposed to the tropical zodiac, which is a moveable format based on the seasons.

The tropical zodiac defines the vernal point (the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere) as the first degree of Aries, but the sidereal zodiac allows it to precess. Many people are confused regarding the difference between the '''sidereal zodiac''' and the '''tropical zodiac''' signs. Because of a "wobble" in the Earth's axis of rotation over a period of about 26,000 years (often called a "[[great year]]"), the rate at which the vernal equinox precesses in the heavens is approximately 0 deg, 0 min, 50.23 seconds a year, drifting by one degree every 72 years.  [[Precession of the equinoxes]] thus occurs at a rate of roughly 5 arc minutes of a degree every 6 years.  The tropical signs relate to the seasons and not the stars.  Here is an example: a person born on, say '''August 28, 2002''' would come to understand that his/her Sun sign was in '''Virgo''' according to [[Western astrology]] (conventional Sun sign dates August 23, to September 22, of every year), but Sun on that same calendar date of the year 2002 was in the [[Leo (constellation)|constellation Leo]] (where it had been since August 10, 2002 and would remain until September 15, when it would then finally cross into Virgo).

It is worth pointing out that the sidereal signs and the tropical signs are both geometrical conventions of 30° each, whereas the zodiacal constellations are pictorial representations of mythological figures projected onto the celestial sphere based on patterns of visible star groupings, none of which occupy precisely 30° of the ecliptic. So constellations and signs are not the same, although for historical reasons they might have the same names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrologycom.com/precession.html|title=Astrology on the Web: Stars and Signs|first=Kevin|last=Burk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that some astrologers don't use the signs of the zodiac at all, focusing more instead on the [[astrological aspects]] and other features of the horoscope.
* The [[Sun (astrology)|sun sign]] is the sign of the '''zodiac''' in which the sun is located for the native. This is the single astrological fact familiar to most people. If an event occurs at sunrise the ascendant and '''sun sign''' will be the same; other rising signs can then be estimated at approximately two-hour intervals from there.
* A '''cusp''' is the boundary between two signs or houses. For some the cusp includes a small portion of the two signs or houses under consideration.

===Houses===
* The '''[[House (astrology)|houses]]''' are a series of twelve divisions of the plane of the ecliptic. Astrologers have devised many systems of calculating these house divisions.  In the case of the [[equal house system]] the ecliptic is divided into twelve equal houses of 30° each. The first house begins at the ascendant and the others are numbered counterclockwise from that point. The first six are therefore below the horizon, and the other six are above. The positions of these houses remains fixed relative to the native. The signs and planets all move through the twelve houses during the course of a day, and the planets move through the signs over the course of months or years.

==Construction of a horoscope in Western astrology==
To create a horoscope, an astrologer first has to ascertain the exact time and place of the subject's birth, or the initiation of an event. The local [[standard time]] (adjusting for any [[daylight saving time]] or [[History of time in the United States#War Time 1918 and 1942|war time]]) is then converted into [[Greenwich Mean Time]] or [[Universal Time]] at that same instant. The astrologer then has to convert this into the local [[sidereal time]] at birth in order to be able to calculate the [[ascendant]] and [[midheaven]]. The astrologer will next consult a set of tables called an '''ephemeris''', which lists the location of the Sun, Moon and [[Planets in astrology|planets]] for a particular year, date and sidereal time, with respect to the [[vernal equinox|northern hemisphere vernal equinox]] or the [[fixed star]]s (depending on which astrological system is being used). The astrologer then adds or subtracts the difference between the longitude of Greenwich and the longitude of the place in question to determine the true local mean time (LMT) at the place of birth to show where planets would be visible above the horizon at the precise time and place in question. Planets hidden from view beneath the earth are also shown in the horoscope.

The horoscope features 12 sectors around the circle of the [[ecliptic]], starting from the eastern horizon with the [[ascendant]] or rising sign. These 12 sectors are called the [[House (astrology)|houses]] and numerous systems for calculating these divisions exist. Tables of houses have been published since the 19th Century to make this otherwise demanding task easier.

===Houses===
{{Main|House (astrology)}}
[[Image:AstrologicalGlyphs-AsteroidsChaldean.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astrological symbols]]/[[glyphs]] used in Western astrology to represent the [[planets in astrology]]]]

The chart thus begins with a framework of 12 houses. Upon this the signs of the zodiac are superimposed. In the equal house system the cusp between any two houses will fall at the same degree for each of the at 12° of Leo, the second house will begin at 12° of Virgo, the third at 12° Libra, and so on. In house systems that take into consideration the effects of the angle of intersection between the planes of the horizon and the ecliptic, the calculations are more complicated. For these calculations it is essential to know the latitude of the event. Tables are available for these calculations, but they are now commonly calculated by computer. Most astrology computer programs allow the user to choose from a variety of house systems.

===Placements of the planets===
{{Main|Planets in astrology}}
Having established the relative positions of the signs in the houses, the astrologer positions the sun, moon, and planets at their proper celestial longitudes. Some astrologers also take note of minor planetary bodies, fixed stars, [[asteroid]]s (for example, [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]]) and other mathematically calculated points and angles such as the [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]], equatorial ascendant, etc. Many astrologers also use what are commonly referred to as '''[[Arabic parts]]''' (or [[Greece|Greek]] Lots), the most common of which is the [[Part of Fortune]] (Pars Fortunae).

===Aspects===
To complete the horoscope the astrologer will consider the aspects or relative angles between pairs of planets. More exact aspects are considered more important. The difference between the exact aspect and the actual aspect is called the '''[[Orb (astrology)|orb]]'''. Those generally recognized by the astrological community are '''[[Astrological aspect#Conjunction|Conjunction]]''' (0°), '''[[Astrological aspect#Opposition|Opposition]]''' (180°), '''[[Astrological aspect#Square|Square]]''' (90°), '''[[Astrological aspect#Trine|Trine]]''' (120°), '''[[Astrological aspect#Sextile .E2.80.94 intermediate major.2Fminor aspect|Sextile]]''' (60°), '''[[Astrological aspect#Semi-square|Semi-Square]]''' (45°),  '''[[Astrological aspect#Sesquiquadrate|Sesquisquare]]''' (135°), and '''[[Astrological aspect#Quincunx .E2.80.94 intermediate major.2Fminor aspect|Quincunx]]''' (150°). Understandably these aspects are more significant when they are exact, but they are considered to function within an '''orb''' of influence, the size of which varies according to the importance of each aspect. Thus conjunctions are believed to operate with a larger orb than sextiles. Most modern astrologers use an orb of 8° or less for aspects involving the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter and smaller orbs for the other points.  Some astrologers, such as practitioners of [[Cosmobiology]], and Uranian astrology, use minor aspects (15°, 22.5°, 67.5°, 72°, 75°, 105°, 112.5°, 157.5°, 165°) with much narrower orbs.

The major astrological system regarded universally is Vedic Hindu Astrology. As per this, all planets see just opposite i.e. 180 degree aspect. But Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have special aspects. Mars sees the houses 4th and 8 too from its place in the horoscope, Saturn sees the houses 3 and 10 too from its place, and Jupiter sees 5 and 9 from its place in the horoscope i.e. the house in which they are posited in the lagna chart.

===Ascendant===
The ascendant (ASC) is a point on the ecliptic that rises on the eastern horizon at sunrise and changes as the earth rotates on its axis.
The ascendant is very important in astrological chart interpretation. It exerts more power than the sun, moon and planets because it infiltrates everything in the natal chart.
The ascendant is the first point of energy in the natal chart and it represents the way we view life. The sign on the ascendant characterises our expression of “who we are” when dealing with others, and our initial action when dealing with day-to-day concerns. [[Longitude]] is necessary in order to determine the position of the [[Ascendant]] because horoscopes use local time.
Having constructed the horoscope, the astrologer can begin the task of interpreting the chart. This interpretation depends upon which branch of horoscopic astrology is being used.

==Chinese horoscopes==
In [[Chinese astrology]], horoscopes are based on the symbolism of the [[Chinese zodiac]], a system of [[Chinese astrology#Wu Xing|elements]] and [[Chinese calendar#12 animals|animals]] associated with each year according to a [[Sexagenary cycle]]. Chinese horoscopes often appear in [[Sun sign astrology|horoscope sections]] in newspapers and magazine alongside Western horoscopes.

==Plot==
A Ph.D. student, Ian Gray, is researching the evolution of human eyes with Karen, his first year lab assistant, and Kenny. He has a particular hostility to superstition, religion and "[[intelligent design]]", which he hopes to discredit by filling in the steps of [[Evolution of the eye|the evolution of the eye]]. At a Halloween party he has an encounter with Sofi, who is wearing a black face mask, where only her magnetic hazel-speckled, ash-blue eyes are visible. Fascinated, he photographs her eyes and then up at the warehouse party she later leads him into the washroom to have sex. However, soon after, she abruptly leaves without saying goodbye.

Ian can't stop thinking about her. One day, synchronicities around the number eleven, amongst others, seem to mysteriously guide him to a billboard displaying what he recognizes to be Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train and approaches her, letting her listen to the music on his earphones. They begin a relationship, although his rationalism often clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry. They are told they need to wait a day for a license, and as they disappointedly walk out of the registry office, Ian gets a call from Karen at the lab. There has been an exciting breakthrough in their research. She has found a blind worm—''[[Eisenia fetida]]''—with the DNA necessary to develop an eye, just what they'd been looking for. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him, though she's less pleased he's willing to do so on their supposed 'wedding day'. He attempts to appease her by exchanging their wedding rings, to which she's reluctant as it possibly being bad luck. He states he doesn't believe in such, then places her ring on her finger anyway, whilst whispering that he's loved her forever.

Back at the lab, Sofi is upset by the research they're doing and an uncomfortable Karen leaves. After a short argument, Sofi kisses Ian and knocks over a bottle of formaldehyde, accidentally splashing Ian's eyes. They call Karen, who helps him to the eyewash station and bandages his eyes, and Sofi takes him home. On the way up, the elevator in Sofi's apartment building stops between floors. Ian wishes to hoist up Sofi but she refuses. Frustrated by her childish fears, he rips off his bandages and attempts to climb out himself. As he's pulling up Sofi, the elevator suddenly starts to move again. With blurry eyes, Ian thought he had pulled her out in time, but it was too late - Sofi's bottom half being chopped off, she dies instantly in his arms. Ian goes into a deep depression, and Karen continues their research. One night Karen brings him a meal at his home. He begins to cry and she comforts him. They begin to kiss.

The film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written a book on the evolution of the eye that he claims further debunks creationism. Ian and Karen are now married and Karen is pregnant. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an [[iris scan]] of baby Tobias' eyes. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results, thinking it a glitch, and the problem disappears.

A few months later, a Doctor Simmons calls, claiming that a test of the baby's urine may indicate an elevated risk of [[autism]] and recommending a further test. But Ian and Karen become suspicious during this unconventional test and decide to investigate Doctor Simmons. They find that she is in fact one of a very few people with full access to the iris scan database. Ian tracks some pictures from this test to Idaho where he stumbles on the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who apparently died just before their baby was conceived.

Ian's former research partner, Kenny, is the creator of the iris database. He helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased family members, plus various other people's eyes through the database to see if there are any other recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi, whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior, years after Sofi's death.

Ian goes to India to find the subject of this scan. There he finds Priya, the head of the community centre where the iris scan was made. Priya recognizes Sofi's eyes as those of a girl she knows, named Salomina, and agrees to help. Ian and Priya begin searching for Salomina, who is an orphan and seems to have disappeared into the crowds of the city. Ian tries putting up a billboard showing Sofi's eyes and offering a cash reward. He is besieged with calls but none are credible. Weeks later he comes across a little girl staring at the billboard. It is Salomina. He takes her back to his hotel and contacts Karen over [[Skype]]. The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi. At first Salomina is uncannily accurate, but in the end her results are within the probable range of random chance. Karen asks him how he feels about this and he says he feels rather foolish. Feeling somewhat disheartened, Ian then leaves the hotel room with Salomina to take her to Priya but when they reach the elevator, the moment the doors open Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms, too frightened to enter. Staring into each other's eyes with a certain recognition, they then cling to each other, tears streaming down both's faces. He picks her up and takes her down the stairs instead, with Salomina tightly gripped around his neck, till they walk out the dark interior and step out into the light.

A [[post-credits scene]] shows Dr. Simmons scanning the irises of famous deceased figures, apparently finding many such matches.

== Production ==
''I Origins'' was the second feature film by writer-director [[Mike Cahill (director)|Mike Cahill]] after his earlier independent science fiction-drama, ''[[Another Earth]]'' (2011), also with actress [[Brit Marling]]. Cahill sold the film rights to ''Another Earth'' to [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] at the [[2011 Sundance Film Festival]]. At that time he also sold a screenplay to what would be his next feature film titled ''I''. Though during the development of ''I'', after failing to "crack" some aspects of the story, Cahill instead decided to make an origin story for the film, in which he had a "rich back story for".&lt;ref name=slashfilm&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |date=18 July 2014 |title='I Origins' Is a Prequel to a Screenplay Sold to Fox Searchlight in 2011 |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/origins-prequel-screenplay-sold-fox-searchlight-2011/ |publisher=[[/Film]] |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Fox Searchlight owned the rights to any prequels or sequels to the ''I'' script, Cahill decided to make ''I Origins''  independently. He intended to sell the film at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], like he did for ''Another Earth''. Fox Searchlight agreed and the film was produced by Verisimilitude and WeWork Studios in association with Bersin Pictures and Penny Jane Films. After the premiere of ''I Origins'' at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]], Fox Searchlight ended up buying the rights to the film.&lt;ref name=slashfilm/&gt;

==Reception==
''I Origins'' received mixed reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 53%, based on 100 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] score of 6/10. The site's consensus states: "Writer-director Mike Cahill remains an intriguingly ambitious talent, but with the uneven sci-fi drama ''I Origins'', his reach exceeds his grasp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''I Origins''|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_origins/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-origins|title=''I Origins'' Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Zakarin, of entertainment and media news website [[TheWrap]], said that "The movie starts as a love story and then morphs into a thriller, propelled always by the push and pull of faith and logic, with tragedy shifting world views over time". He continued, saying that "The message is both micro and macro, aimed at the renewed war in the United States over issues like science education and contraception, as well as Cahill's way of working out his own mixed emotions".&lt;ref name=thewrap&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Pitt-Brit Marling Film ‘I Origins’ Is Actually a Prequel to a Sequel That Doesn’t Exist Yet|url=http://www.thewrap.com/michael-pitt-brit-marling-film-i-origins-is-actually-a-prequel-to-a-sequel-that-doesnt-exist-yet/ |publisher=[[TheWrap]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
''I Origins'' was developed as a prequel of ''I'', a screenplay which Cahill sold to [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=thewrap/&gt; Cahill intended for ''I'' to take place twenty years after the event of ''I Origins'', after the repercussions of Dr. Ian Gray’s discoveries take hold, as teased in the post-credits of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘I Origins’ Helmer Mike Cahill Talks Science and Sequels as Sci-fi Pic Prepares to Open Karlovy Vary|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/i-origins-helmer-mike-cahill-talks-science-and-sequels-as-sci-fi-pic-prepares-to-open-karlovy-vary-1201257721/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During press interviews for the film, Cahill spoke of plans to go ahead with a sequel to ''I Origins'', saying "There's a sequel in the works. It's not scripted.

'''Jacques Jean Edmond Georges Gaillot''' (born 11 September 1935; {{Audio|Fr-Jacques Gaillot.ogg|pronunciation}}; generally known in French as '''[[Monseigneur]] Gaillot''') is a [[France|French]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] clergyman and social activist. He was [[Bishop of Évreux]] in [[France]] from 1982 to 1995. In 1995, by decision of [[Pope John Paul II]], he was demoted to be [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Partenia]], an extinct [[diocese]], for having expressed too controversial and heterodox positions on religious, political and social matters.

In reason of these views he earned the popular nickname of ''The Red Cleric''.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.[http://www.aegis.com/news/ads/1995/AD950105.html French Against Vatican Sacking of "Red Cleric"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208135520/http://www.aegis.com/news/ads/1995/AD950105.html |date=2012-02-08 }} 17 January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Jacques Gaillot was born in [[Saint-Dizier]], [[Haute-Marne]]. As a teenager, he already desired to become a priest. After his secondary studies, he entered the seminary in [[Langres]].

From 1957 to 1959, he carried out his compulsory military service in [[Algeria]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence|war of independence]].

From 1960 to 1962 he was sent to [[Rome]] to complete his studies in [[theology]] and get his bachelor's degree. He was [[holy orders|ordained]] a priest in 1961. From 1962 to 1964, he was sent to the Higher Institute for Liturgy in [[Paris]], while teaching at the major seminary in [[Châlons-en-Champagne]].

From 1965, he was a Professor at the regional seminary of [[Reims]]. He chaired many sessions to implement the orientations of the [[Second Vatican Council]].

In 1973, he was appointed to the parish of St Dizier, his hometown, while becoming co-manager of the institute for the training of the educators of the clergy (IFEC) in Paris.

In 1977, he was appointed vicar general of the [[diocese of Langres]]. In 1981, he was elected vicar capitular. In May 1982, he was appointed bishop of Évreux, being consecrated into the position on 20 June.&lt;ref&gt;Diocese of Partenia. [http://www.partenia.org/english/biographie_eng.htm] January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media attention and controversy==
As soon as Bishop Gaillot had taken his place in Évreux he began to engage in activities that may be said to have cost him his position. During his first Easter message he wrote: "Christ died outside the walls as he was born outside the walls. If we are to see the light, the sun, of Easter, we ourselves must go outside the walls." Following this he then stated that: "I'm not here to convince the convinced or take care of the well. I'm here to support the ill and offer a hand to the lost. Does a bishop remain in his cathedral or does he go into the street?. . .I made my choice." Within months Gaillot had begun to act on his word.&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

In 1983, he supported a [[conscientious objector]] before the court in Évreux. During the yearly assembly of the episcopate, he was one of the two bishops (of a total of 110) voting against the episcopate's text on [[nuclear deterrence]], which supported having nuclear arms as a legitimate deterrent.&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

In 1984 he angered numerous Catholic authorities by refusing to support the movement in defence of French [[parochial schools]].

In 1985, he supported the [[First Intifada]] in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] and met [[Yasser Arafat]] in [[Tunis]], being embraced by the future Nobel Peace Prize Laureate in a private audience. Perhaps the most notable event he performed in 1987 was attending, by invitation, a special session of the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City|New York]] to speak out for [[disarmament]]. The first amount of considerable media attention paid to Gaillot came in January 1985 when he signed an appeal on behalf of underpaid Catholic school teachers; also signing the appeal was [[Georges Marchais]], the head of the [[French Communist Party]]. This proved to be highly controversial, bringing about the start of a right-wing campaign against Bishop Gaillot.  Within his own diocese, ''[[Le Figaro]]'' spearheaded the campaign. At this point Bishop Gaillot was described as being "a tool of the church's worst enemies".&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

In 1987, he went to [[South Africa]] to meet a young [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] militant from Évreux sentenced to 4 years in prison by the South African régime. There he also appeared at a demonstration where some Communist militants were also demonstrating.  In order to accomplish this trip, he had to renounce going with the diocesan [[pilgrimage]] to [[Lourdes]], a move that attracted criticism. Further, in the same year he also announced that the French Bishops "remain too preoccupied by the correct functioning of the church and its structures."&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt; This only ensured that the responses to Gaillot when he later attacked the right wing French political party, the [[National Front (France)|National Front]], were even stronger. Also in 1987 Gaillot traveled to Athens to show solidarity with a boatload of Palestinian refugees.

In 1988, during a closed-door session of the assembly{{specify|date=September 2015}} in Lourdes, he advocated the ordination of married men to the priesthood. After the proceedings had finished Gaillot spoke to the press about the discussions held and also promoted his own viewpoints. By promoting a revision of [[clerical celibacy]] and the use of [[condoms]], he caused considerable tension with the French bishops' conference, the situation being exacerbated by the fact that in speaking to the media about the session, Gaillot had violated convention regarding assembly conclaves. He later defended his previous actions, remarking that "I never broke the vow of celibacy ... I only questioned it. But that's worse."&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt; Also that year, Gaillot took the unprecedented step for a [[Roman Catholic]] bishop of blessing a homosexual union in a "service of welcoming", after the couple requested it in view of their imminent death from [[AIDS]].

In 1989, he participated in a trip to [[French Polynesia]] organized by the peace movement, asking for the end to [[French nuclear testing]]. He also participated in the ceremony of the transfer of the ashes of the late bishop [[Baptiste-Henri Grégoire]] (1750–1831) to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]], a necropolis for the great men of France. Grégoire had been instrumental in the first [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]], and the end of discrimination against the Blacks and the Jews during the [[French Revolution]]. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church had refused to give him the last [[sacraments]] because of Grégoire's acceptance of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Gaillot was the only French bishop participating in this ceremony. By this stage in his career, Bishop Gaillot had earned an impressive reputation, both positive and negative. The French journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Tincq|fr}} wrote in ''[[Le Monde]]'' that {{nowrap|"[Bishop}} Gaillot] has the merit of saying out loud what many people in authority in the church think down deep."&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

Throughout 1989, Gaillot continued to cause considerable tension within the [[French Bishops' Conference]], to the extent that the members of the episcopate voted to censure him. This disciplinary action came after Gaillot gave an interview to the publication ''[[Lui]]'', the French equivalent of ''[[Playboy]]''. Furthermore, he also gave interviews to leading gay magazines and lambasted the incompetence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to judge the circumstances of homosexuality. At this point, the bishop offered his resignation to the Pope, should he feel it necessary to remove him; no such action was taken however.&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

Toward late 1989, he attempted concilatory movements, signing an agreement in which he promised "loyalty" and "docility" to the pope. This agreement did not last long however; within a week, Gaillot had distanced himself from the majority of other bishops by appearing on television to criticise the "feeble state of internal debate in the church" and express his feelings of grief that progress had not been made since the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref name="pg_4"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17564085.html | title=Provocateur or Prophet? the French Church &amp; Bishop Gaillot | work=[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]] | date=October 6, 1995 | accessdate=May 14, 2015 | author=Englund, Steven |publisher= [[HighBeam Research]]}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he opposed the [[Gulf War]], publishing a book called ''Open letter to those who preach war, but let it be waged by others''. He also condemned the embargo on [[Iraq]]. By the end of 1991, the French Bishops' Conference had censured Gaillot three times, most recently for his intervention in [[Haiti]], rousing support for [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].

Bishop Gaillot also caused controversy with a number of other actions. He was frequently condemned by others for his numerous television appearances, but justified them by claiming that if people still found a Bishop interesting, then they clearly still found the church interesting. 

As well as this, Bishop Gaillot also took a lenient stance with regard women who have had abortions, claiming he was not qualified to judge a woman who found herself in such a scenario.

The last drop that made the cup run over was a conversation Bishop Gaillot had with the prolific dissident Catholic theologian [[Eugen Drewermann]] in the show "Transit" on the French channel ARTE on April 12, 1994. Two days after this widely seen show, archbishop [[Joseph Duval]], the President of the French Bishops' Conference, wrote to Gaillot: "For all to see you are in solidarity with Drewermann. But how do you show your solidarity with us, your fellow episcopal brothers and the Pope? Are you aware that your position is unsustainable? The distance from your brothers in the episcopate that you emphasize makes us suffer and has become a scandal for many Catholics".&lt;ref&gt;Eugen Drewermann, Jacques Gaillot, Der Traum von Menschlichkeit, ed. by Peter Eicher. Kösel, 1997; {{ISBN|978-2226075840}}, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, Archbishop [[Joseph Duval]] of Rouen, the President of the French Bishops' Conference was attempting to convince Gaillot to cease in his actions; Gaillot however responded by withdrawing his offer of resignation, desiring that the scenario not be reduced to the same response given by the Vatican in the case of [[Raymond Hunthausen|Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen]].

At the height of the controversy that Bishop Gaillot caused during his tenure as Ordinary of Évreux, he was the target of a bitter campaign to disparage his name. Unsubstantiated allegations of homosexuality, racism, anti-Semitism, and psychosis and neurosis were all made by highly placed authorities in the French clergy.&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt; Bishop Gaillot countered in kind. He branded Archbishop Duval an "ayatollah" seeking to impose "ideological uniformity" within the French Bishops' Conference. Further, he also compared the leadership style of Cardinal Gantin to those of the East German political police the [[Stasi]].&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

Testament to Gaillot's strong yearning to reach out to the 'exiled' is the fact that by the time he left office at the Diocese of Évreux he had visited more prisons than any bishop in France's history.

==Removal from Évreux==
On 13 January 1995, Jacques Gaillot was summoned to a meeting with [[Bernardin Cardinal Gantin]], prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]]  at the [[Vatican City]]. He was offered the choice of resigning his see and becoming bishop emeritus of Évreux, or being removed from the see. In the latter case, he would be assigned to the [[titular see]] of Parthenia. Gaillot chose not to resign; instead, he left the Vatican and returned to France to give a press conference, providing one short press release to explain the events:

{{Quote|Cardinal Gantin, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, summoned me to be in Rome on January 12, 1995 at 9:30 am.
The threats that were hanging over me for a while came into effect. I had met the deadline. I was told that I had been removed from my function as bishop and that the See of Évreux would be declared vacant starting tomorrow from noon onwards.
I was asked to hand in my resignation, which I thought I had good reasons to refuse.
|Bishop Jacques Gaillot|Diocese of Partenia}}

The See of [[Parthenia (place)|Parthenia]], now located in the desert of Algeria, has not existed in reality since the 5th century when it was in the Roman province of Mauritania. This function is a kind of sinecure with no pastoral responsibilities. Gaillot still continues to reach out however, this time on the internet, as a "virtual bishop".

Gaillot made no coat of arms or episcopal decide for himself either in Évreux or after his removal from that see. He found that to be more in the realm of heraldry and nobility. Asked whether he could yet name  a suitable device, he quoted a verse from the [[Quran]] (2, 256): ''En religion pas de contrainte'', In religion no coercion.&lt;ref&gt;''Chers amis de Partenia'' - www.partenia.org/partenia_1996_2006/amis.rtf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to removal===
This removal sparked an emotional response from thousands of people across France and the rest of the world. Twenty thousand people, including Gaillot's own mother, attended Bishop Gaillot's last mass at the Cathedral in Évreux and stayed on the streets protesting the Vatican's decision. Protestors united under the leadership of the [[Communist]] mayor of the region and marched on the streets during the rain. With the Cathedral full, many people stayed outside for the bishop's last mass. Still being a bishop he left his cross, mitre and staff behind in Évreux.

The choice to remove Bishop Gaillot as ordinary of Évreux was widely seen as a mistake by both lay people and clergy, and also by many non-religious people who had come to view Gaillot favorably. After his removal, a reported forty thousand people wrote letters to the Cathedral office at Évreux, with more being sent to the Vatican and eminent prelates. He was perceived favorably by a significant number of people, particularly due to his ministry to all people without distinction. In addition, he had become a national figure after the sanctions taken against him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Christianity Today]]''. [http://ctlibrary.com/488 Deposed Bishop Invents Online Diocese], 29 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Official polls taken at the time consistently revealed the French public to be against the punishment brought upon Gaillot. One CSA survey showed that  total of 64 percent of the public were against the firing of Jacques Gaillot as bishop of Évreux, with only 11 percent approving of his firing and a remaining 25 percent being undecided.&lt;ref&gt;''[[La Vie]]''. January 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some later polls showed that support for Gaillot might even have been as high as 75 percent.&lt;ref name="pg_4"/&gt;

Reaction from the French clergy varied. While no French bishop expressed public support for Bishop Gaillot, Monsignor [[Jean-Michel Di Falco]], the official spokesperson for the clergy hierarchy, reported that both [[Cardinal Coffy]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Marseille|Marseille]] and Archbishop [[Joseph Duval|Duval]] were "visibly troubled" by the actions taken against Gaillot. Duval later released an official statement saying that "I pleaded for patience in Rome". Only weeks later, Duval was on record as saying that he "regretted" the manner in which Rome had dealt with Gaillot. Duval later came to summarise the actions as being "an authoritarian act which cannot be accepted by society, even if it is carried out by the Church".&lt;ref&gt;''His Holiness'' pg. 509, [[Carl Bernstein]] &amp; Marco Politi&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as this the [[Archbishop of Cambrai]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Delaporte|fr}}, defended Gaillot saying that "This is a wound for our church... It is a source of misunderstanding for the poor and for all those who seek the truth and who put their trust in the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Protests+follow+French+bishop%27s+removal.-a016531819 | title=Protests follow French bishop's removal | work=[[National Catholic Reporter]] | date=27 January 1995 | accessdate=May 14, 2015 | author=Skinner, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Évreux==
After being removed from his position as prelate of Évreux, Bishop Gaillot wrote the following comment:

{{quote|I had a dream: to be able to accompany the poor, the excluded, the ignored, without having to explain myself or justify myself to the rich, the secure, or the comfortable. To be able to go where distress calls me without having to give advance notice. To be able to show my indignation at destitution, injustice, violence, the sale of weapons, and managed famines without being considered a meddler in politics.

I dreamed of being able to live my faith within the church, but also in society, in my time and with my times. I dreamed of the freedom to think and express myself, to debate and criticise, without fear of the guillotine. I dreamed of the being different within the unity of faith, and remaining myself, alone and yet in solidarity with others. Ultimately, I hoped to be able to proclaim a Gospel of freedom without being marginalised.|Jacques Gaillot, ''Voice From The Desert''}}

After leaving the Bishop's Palace, Gaillot immediately moved in with illegal squatters in Paris' infamous Rue de Dragon street. Since then he has shown similar solidarity with the homeless. Bishop Gaillot continues to defend human rights and engage in activism, regularly publishing information about his activities on the website of Partenia.

He remains active as a pastor to the excluded. He also travels throughout France and also internationally, spreading the word of the Christian Gospel and defending those who are considered "outcasts" (namely immigrants). He is an avid anti-war protester and is considered by many to be a strong [[socialist]]. Jacques Gaillot had a strong friendship with [[Abbé Pierre]].

In 1995, after his removal as Bishop of [[Évreux]], Gaillot attended a [[Call to Action]] conference in Detroit as one of the keynote speakers. He held three sessions, proving to be very popular despite speaking through a translator. He hosted the conference alongside other controversial Catholic Theologians including [[Hans Küng|Professor Hans Küng]] and [[Thomas Gumbleton|Bishop Thomas Gumbleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Call to Action. [http://www.cta-usa.org/resgaillot.html My Option for the Poor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015090350/http://www.cta-usa.org/resgaillot.html |date=2006-10-15 }} 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of his responsibility over a specific geographical diocese permitted Gaillot to be even more daring in his activism. Indeed, in 1995 following his removal, Bishop Gaillot engaged in protests regarding the policy of French [[nuclear testing]] at [[Mururoa Atoll]] in the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]] of [[French Polynesia]]. Gaillot went with a fleet of protest ships, being on the [[Greenpeace]] vessel [[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] himself, he was subsequently removed from the ship by French [[Naval commandos (France)|commandos]], given that ''Rainbow Warrior'' had sailed within the exclusion zone, and escorted back to the atoll.&lt;ref&gt;The Militant. [http://www.themilitant.com/1995/5928/5928_5.html Protesters Say `No Nukes In Pacific!'] 7 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaillot has been so active in his beliefs that he has had to be stopped by the Vatican on numerous occasions, including one time when he was given a direct order by [[Pope John Paul II]] to avoid a conference in Italy about homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/816332.stm Bishop's Gay Conference Ban] 2 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[World Youth Day]], in [[Bonn]], 2004, Cardinal [[Joachim Meisner]] of [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]] invoked Canon 763, which allows a bishop for some grave reason to prevent another bishop speaking in his diocese, to ban Gaillot from addressing a session of the event on the topic of ''Being a Christian in the Third Millennium: A Faith which has Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;Lifesite News.

Also in 2004 Bishop Gaillot met with [[Maryam Rajavi]], a controversial Iranian political activist. Gaillot strongly criticised the actions of some extremist religious leaders in Iran, going on to comment that “One must not forget that the strength of truth will make it [the Iranian resistance] triumphant. Darkness will give way and truth will prevail despite all the lies and ruses”. Rajavi publicly thanked the bishop and expressed that his support had been very effective in promoting the cause of the Iran resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the [[National Council of Resistance of Iran]]. {{cite web |url=http://www.maryamrajavi.info/meeting/gaillot.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030149/http://www.maryamrajavi.info/meeting/gaillot.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} 17 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Gaillot has also taken position as a well-known public figure in France, fighting for a number of causes; Gaillot serves as the co-chairman of one of France's foremost [[Human Rights]] activist groups, '{{Interlanguage link multi|Droits devant !!|fr}}' (Rights First), among other groups.

In 2007 Gaillot expanded his use of the internet by posting a video interview on the website ''[[Google Video]]'', attempting to bring attention to the escalating [[violence]] occurring in [[Darfur]].&lt;ref&gt;Diocese of Partenia. [http://www.partenia.org/english/carnet_eng.htm#a1 Darfur: conscience awakening] 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Gaillot has written over a dozen books; one of them, ''A cry on Exclusion'' (''Coup de gueule contre l'exclusion'') got much media attention. The book criticized the French laws on [[immigration]] proposed by the then-[[Minister of the Interior (France)|minister of the Interior]], [[Charles Pasqua]]. This book was the justification for his demotion by the Catholic hierarchy. Another book released shortly after his demotion was ''Voice From the Desert: A Bishop's Cry for a New Church''. This book was mainly an autobiographical text discussing events surrounding his demotion.

He has expressed his publical support for [[euthanasia]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and [[same-sex marriage]], when it was legalized in [[France]].

In September 2015, Pope Francis welcomed French Bishop Jacques Gaillot to his Vatican residence. They talked for 45 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/le-pape-francois-a-mgr-gaillot-nous-sommes-freres-01-09-2015-1961114_23.php   |title=Le pape François à Mgr Gaillot : "Nous sommes frères"|first= Jérôme|last=Cordelier
|date= September 1, 2015    |newspaper=[[Le Point]]|language=fr}} &lt;/ref&gt; Gaillot said the pontiff encouraged him to continue his activism on behalf of migrants and refugees. After the meeting, Gaillot said he was “in love” with Francis.

[[File:2 New Julleuchters.jpg|thumb|Two ''Turmleuchter'' type ceramic candle-holders-the right one replicates the design of the SS ''Julleuchter'', itself based on an early modern candle-holder from southern Sweden.]]

'''Julleuchter''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjuːlˌlɔʏçtɐ}}; "[[Yule]] lantern") was the term for a type of lantern used in the "Julfest" during the German [[Third Reich]]. [[Heinrich Himmler]], commander of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who placed great interest in [[Ariosophy]],
gave the ''SS Julleuchter'' as a presentation piece for SS soldiers to celebrate the [[winter solstice]], from approximately 1936 until 1944.  [[Heinrich Himmler]] originally had the intention to make the Julleuchter a standard gift to all SS members and there were no criteria attached to its presentation.  For reasons which are not entirely clear, by the start of [[World War II]], the Julleuchter had begun to be viewed as an SS decoration, and was entered as such in SS service records once the Julleuchter had been presented.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;SS Service record collection, United States National Archives; College Park, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the SS-Julleuchter was considered "non-portable" (much like the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe Honor Goblet]]), there was no outward display on an [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS uniform]] indicating its presentation.

==Swedish artefact type==
The design of the ''Julleuchter'' was based on an early modern (late  18th century or early 19th century) unburnt clay candle-holder from [[Halland]], Sweden. 
This particular specimen is kept in the [[Nordic Museum]] in Stockholm (inv. nr. 32.477). It has a height of 15&amp;nbsp;cm and a base of 8.2&amp;nbsp;cm squared.&lt;ref&gt;Schild (2000). C.f. this [http://www.allach.ru/images/stories/allach/article/julleuchter/jull.jpg online copy] of a photograph by Sören Hallgren, Nordiska Museet.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The candle-holder has an incised [[heart shape]] and below a six-spoked opening.
This artefact was  described in 1888 in the magazine of the Swedish literary club Runa (founded  by [[Johan August Strindberg]]), which compared the six-spoked window in its base with the shape of the [[Medieval runes|medieval]] [[hagall|''h''-rune]]; the 1888 article attributed a  16th-century date to the object (the earliest date of the introduction of candles to Scandinavian households).&lt;ref&gt;Runa magazine 1888 page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several surviving specimens of this type of early modern candle-holder from Sweden. There is nothing to suggest that it was in any way connected to [[Yule]] in particular. The artefact type was also called ''Turmleuchter'' ("tower lantern") in some 1920s to 1930s German sources.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
A comparable specimen was on display in the open-air museum of [[Skansen]], based on a photograph kept in the [[Detmold]] state archive.

==Interpretation in Germanic mysticism==
The ''Runa'' article came to the attention of [[Herman Wirth]] because of its supposed "[[Hagal (Armanen rune)|Hagal rune]]" (the six-spoked window at its base) who mentioned it in his [[Oera Linda Book|Ura Linda Chronik]], whence it passed into Nazi-era [[Germanic mysticism]].
In a 1936 memorandum, [[Heinrich Himmler]] set forth a list of approved holidays, in part supposedly based on "pagan" traditions, including a "[[Christmas in Nazi Germany|Julfest]]" intended to replace Christian rites.
The Julleuchter and other symbols were also meant to serve as a consolation to women who, by having married into the SS, had to renounce the spiritual shelter and service of their church.&lt;ref&gt;Power Politics and Social Change in National Socialist Germany: A Process of Escalation into Mass Destruction, by John Michael Steiner, page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
The SS soldier was instructed to set up a shrine that included a ''Julleuchter'' in the corner of one room of his household.&lt;ref&gt;"The house of the SS man ought to know because one of its corners is intended for the celebration of his family. In it is to summarize those things that remind people of his higher obligations. ...On the chest , in the corner and shall include heirlooms,  are all year round and the Julleuchter the Julteller (pewter or earthenware) of individual family members who use them on all holidays of the year, but also on birthday, wedding and death . ... The Wall adorns the image of the Fuehrer and Reich SS, to pedigree and family photos, mementos of war and times of struggle. The large SS runes will not be absent. The Jul-and SS-corner is the yardstick the extent of the SS man and his wife at the Customs of the SS to participate." SS Upper Section West: The design of the celebrations in the year and resume in the SS family, Wuppertal, nd, page 41, KW, Archive, 70/1/3/7, quoted in page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

An article about the ''Julleuchter'' was published in the German magazine "Germanien" in December 1936. The author argued that this "millennia old" lantern was to be used as "a memento of the "Year of the Great Migrations of the people of the north"". Another article was published in the SS periodical ''[[SS-Leitheft]]'' Jahrgang 7 Folge 8a. In 1939 the ''Julleuchter'' was also mentioned in "Die Gestaltung der Feste im Jahres und Lebenslauf in der SS-Familie"(Celebrations of the SS Family) by [[Fritz Weitzel]].

The information about the 1936 issue of ''Germanien'' magazine about the Julleuchter is actually from the later magazine "Der Freiwillige."  The article in "Der Freiwillige"  reports ''Germanien'' magazine being, …"the official organ of the German ancestor inheritance registered association, Berlin."  The information given in that latter article is from ''Germanien'' magazine.

A 1936 issue of ''Germanien'' magazine claimed that the "millennium old" lantern had been used as a memento of the "Year of the Great Migrations" of the people of the north and as the small light of humanity under the stars of the night sky. When used during the 2 [[Solstice]] periods of the year, this is a symbol of the victory of Light over the Darkness, and also as a token of Eternal Circulation. The Julleuchter stands for an inseparable community, its conscience and attitude, and that it was used as a symbol of never ending sunlight. Further, the magazine stated that when the ''Julleuchter'' was used during the holiday of [[Yule]] (what is now known as The 12 Days of [[Christmas]]), twelve candles are used. One is used each night symbolizing the twelve months, until the 31 of December when the "July Moon shines." On that night a thirteenth candle is used for the new coming month of January.  The candles always burn below but on the last night, the candle is again transferred upward- this is the sun, which is spilled in order to return to the earth from the gloom of another peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Germanien'' magazine, December 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Himmler's SS==

The SS-Julleuchter was  considered both an [[Political decorations of the Nazi Party|award and trophy]] of the German [[Schutzstaffel]] that was presented to members of the SS from approximately 1936 until 1944 as a service decoration.  Manufactured by the [[Allach (porcelain)|Allach]] [[porcelain]] company, the SS Julleuchter was presented to any SS member who participated in a ''Julfest''.

[[Heinrich Himmler]] originally had the intention to make the Julleuchter a standard gift to all SS members and there were no criteria attached to its presentation.  For reasons which are not entirely clear, by the start of [[World War II]], the Julleuchter had begun to be viewed as an SS decoration, and was entered as such in SS [[service record]]s once the Julleuchter had been presented.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  However, as the SS-Julleuchter was considered "non-portable" (much like the [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Luftwaffe Honor Goblet]]), there was no outward display on an [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS uniform]] indicating its presentation.

Apparently even as the Red Army was advancing and the fall of Berlin was in the foreseeable future, The ''Julleuchter'' was used during the decoration French volunteers in the Waffen-SS.  One surviving soldier said, "In the light of a candle burning on a ''Julleuchter'', a Jule Candlestick, symbolizing the never dying sunlight, Fenet decorated a number of comrades with the [[Iron Cross]].  Although simple, the ceremony that evening seemed all the more extraordinary."&lt;ref&gt;For Europe: the French volunteers of the Waffen-SS, by Robert Forbes, page 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SS ''Julfest''===
{{main|Christmas in Nazi Germany}}

::''Not only the presents but the whole celebration should be full of surprises for all members of the family. The father lights the candle in the Jul-Leuchter, or 'Jul Earthenware Candlestick', from which the tree candles in turn get their light. [...] The Jul-Leuchter, presented by Reichsführer-SS Himmler to the SS Man, is the most important symbol used throughout the year to mark celebrations and commemorations. Its cut-out Heart represents hearth and home, and the Hagal Rune peace through victory. At midnight, when the candles on the [[Yuletide]] Tree are burnt down, the SS Man will put the Jul-Leuchter on the table. The Candlestick with its year-long candle has been lit at every family celebration the past year. Its candle has burned down, and it should receive a new one tonight. Just as our ancestors never let the sacred hearth cooking fire extinguish, so our Jul-Leuchter must always have a light. Thus it becomes a symbol of the never dying sunlight. Everyone becomes very thoughtful when the old candle finally burns down and the new one is put in its place." (From "Celebrations of the SS Family" by [[Fritz Weitzel]], 1939)&lt;ref name= WEITZELFAMILY &gt;Celebrations of the SS Family, by Fritz Weitzel 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacture in the Allach factory===
{{further|Allach (concentration camp)}}

In January 1936, the SS [[Allach (porcelain)|Porzellan Manufaktur Allach]] was created in Munich under the control of Heinrich Himmler.  Well known artists were forced to participate. The output of the factory included over 240 porcelain and ceramic models. Due to a rapid expansion, the factory was not able to meet production targets, and so in October 1937 a part of production was shifted to the SS-operated Allach sub camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Originally the Allach factory manufactured only art ceramic, like plates, jugs and vases, but in the war years they also produced simple utensils like ointment containers and cafeteria table-ware.&lt;ref name="CandleHolderAllach"&gt;{{cite web|author=Admin at 5:41 pm |url=http://www.allachporcelain.com/ |title=Candle Holders |publisher=Allachporcelain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special occasion gift items for SS supporters were also made and given away at dinner parties and other events. Starting from 1941 German civilians and about 50 prisoners of the Allach sub camp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] were forced to produce art and porcelain. The Allach sub camp of Dachau remained the main location for porcelain manufacture even after the original factory in the town of Allach was modernized and reopened. The factory in the town of Allach was retrofitted for the production of ceramic products such as household pottery. The fall of the Third Reich brought an end to the Allach factory. The Allach factories were shut down in 1945 and never reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Admin at 5:41 pm |url=http://www.allachporcelain.com/ |title=Allach Porcelain |publisher=Allach Porcelain |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allach porcelain]] made a variety of candle holders ranging from elaborate gilded baroque candelabras, to the most basic plain white porcelain single candle holder. More candleholders were made than for other Allach items, indicating popularity and interest among the German people. The varying styles and low cost (due to slave labor) of the candleholders produced at Allach allowed most Germans of every class to own them.&lt;ref name="CandleHolderAllach"/&gt;

The Allach factory deposited the ''Julleuchter'' design with the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin on 16 January 1936.
The Allach ''Julleuchter'' was unique in that it was made as presentation piece for SS officers to celebrate the [[winter solstice]]. It was later given to all SS members on the same occasion, 21 December. Made of unglazed stoneware, the ''Julleuchter'' was decorated with early pagan Germanic symbols.&lt;ref name="CandleHolderAllach"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">The Catholic Church in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]] comprises only a Latin hierarchy; &lt;br&gt;neither country has a national [[episcopal conference]], but they jointly form the Episcopal Conference of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, comprising five [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each headed by a Metropolitan Archbishop, and a total of seventeen [[suffragan]] bishoprics. 

There are no pre-diocesan, Eastern Catholic or other exempt jurisdictions.

All defunct (often pre-diocesan missionary) jurisdictions are direct precursors of current sees.

There is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level) to Papua New Guinea (at the national capital [[Port Moresby]]), in which the Apostolic Nunciature to the Solomon Islands is also vested.

'''Liturgy''' is the customary public [[worship]] performed by a religious group, according to its beliefs, customs and traditions. As a religious phenomenon, liturgy is a communal response to and participation in, the sacred through activity reflecting praise, thanksgiving, [[supplication]] or repentance. Ritualization may be associated with life events such as birth, [[coming of age]], marriage, sex and death. It thus forms the basis for establishing a relationship with a divine agency, as well as with other participants in the liturgy. Methods of dress, preparation of food, application of cosmetics or other hygienic practices are all considered liturgical activities.

Technically speaking, liturgy is a subset of ritual. When ritual is undertaken to participate in a divine act or assist a divine action, it is liturgy. If the ritual does not have this purpose it is not liturgy but only ritual. Thus, the word, sometimes rendered by its [[English language|English]] translation "Service or Divine Service", refers to a formal ritual, which may or may not be elaborate, enacted by those who understand themselves to be participating in a divine action, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Divine Liturgy]] ({{lang-el|Θεία Λειτουργία}}), [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Catholic Mass]], the [[Eucharist]] or Mass ([[Anglican Communion]]). A daily activity such as the [[Muslim]]  [[salah]]&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p.&amp;nbsp;582&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jewish services|Jewish synagogue services]] would be ritual but not liturgy. If the Temple were re-established, the ritual undertaken by the Judaic priesthood within the Temple would be liturgy.

==Etymology==
The word ''liturgy'', derived from the technical term in [[ancient Greek]] ({{lang-el|λειτουργία}}), [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|''leitourgia'']], which literally means "work of the people" is a literal translation of the two words "litos ergos" or "public service". In origin it signified the often expensive offerings wealthy Greeks made in service to the people, and thus to the ''[[polis]]'' and the state.&lt;ref&gt;N. Lewis, "''Leitourgia'' and related terms," ''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'' '''3''' (1960:175–84) and '''6''' (1965:226–30).&lt;/ref&gt; Through the ''leitourgia'', the rich carried a financial burden and were correspondingly rewarded with honours and prestige. The ''leitourgia'' were assigned by the polis, the State and Roman Empire and became obligatory in the course of the 3rd century A.D. The performance of such supported the patron's standing among the elite and the popular at large. The holder of a Hellenic ''leitourgia'' was not taxed a specific sum, but was entrusted with a particular ritual, which could be performed with greater or lesser magnificence. The chief sphere remained that of civic religion, embodied in the festivals: [[Moses Finley|M.I. Finley]] notes "in [[Demosthenes]]' day there were at least 97 liturgical appointments in Athens for the festivals, rising to 118 in a (quadrennial) [[Panathenaic festival|Panathenaic year]]."&lt;ref&gt;Finley, ''The Ancient Economy'' 2nd ed., 1985:151.&lt;/ref&gt; However groups of rich citizens were assigned to pay for expenses such as civic amenities and even payment of warships. Eventually, under the [[Roman Empire]], such obligations, known as munera, devolved into a competitive and ruinously expensive burden that was avoided when possible. These included a wide range of expenses having to do with civic infrastructure and amenities; and imperial obligations such as highway, bridge and aqueduct repair, supply of various raw materials, bread-baking for troops in transit, just to name a few.

==Buddhism==
{{main|Buddhist liturgy}}
Buddhist liturgy is a formalized service of veneration and worship performed within a [[Buddhist]] [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] community in nearly every traditional denomination and sect in the Buddhist world. It is often done once or more times a day and can vary among the [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]] sects.

The liturgy mainly consists of [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] or reciting a ''[[sutra]]'' or passages from a sutras, a ''[[mantra]]'' (especially in Vajrayana), and several ''[[gatha]]s''. Depending on what practice the practitioner wishes to undertake, it can be done at a temple or at home. The liturgy is almost always performed in front of an [[Buddharupa|object or objects of veneration]] and accompanied by offerings of light, incense, water and food.

==Judaism==
{{main|Jewish liturgy}}
Jewish liturgy are the [[prayer]] recitations that form part of the observance of Rabbinic [[Judaism]]. These prayers, often with instructions and commentary, are found in the ''[[siddur]]'', the traditional Jewish prayer book. In general, Jewish men are obligated to pray three times a day [[Zmanim|within specific time ranges (zmanim)]]. while, according to the [[Talmud]], women are only ''required'' to pray once daily, as they are generally exempted from obligations that are time dependent.

Traditionally, three prayer services are recited daily:
# ''[[Shacharit]]'' or ''Shaharit'' (שַחֲרִת), from the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] ''shachar'' or ''shahar'' (שַחָר) "morning light",
# ''[[Mincha]]'' or ''Minha'' (מִנְחָה), the afternoon prayers named for the flour offering that accompanied sacrifices at the [[Temple in Jerusalem]],
# ''Arvit'' (עַרְבִית) or ''[[Maariv]]'' (מַעֲרִיב), from "nightfall".
Additional prayers:
* ''[[Musaf]]'' (מוּסָף, "additional") are recited by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] congregations on [[Shabbat]], major [[Jewish holiday]]s (including [[Chol HaMoed]]), and [[Rosh Chodesh]].
* A fifth prayer service, ''[[Ne'ila]]'' (נְעִילָה, "closing"), is recited only on [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement.

==Christianity==
{{main|Christian liturgy}}
[[File:Jan Babjak SJ.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[bishop]] celebrating the [[Divine Liturgy]] in an [[Eastern Catholic Church]] in [[Prešov]], [[Slovakia]]]]
[[File:Vihkimistilaisuus Kiuruveden kirkossa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Wedding ceremony inside the [[Kiuruvesi Church]] in [[Kiuruvesi]], [[Finland]]]]
Frequently in [[Christianity]], a distinction is made between "liturgical" and "non-liturgical" churches based on how elaborate or antiquated the worship; in this usage, churches whose services are unscripted or improvised are called "non-liturgical".  Others object to this usage, arguing that this terminology obscures the universality of public worship as a religious phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Underhill, E., ''Worship'' (London:  Bradford and Dickens, 1938), pp. 3&amp;ndash;19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even the ''open'' or ''waiting'' worship of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] is liturgical, since the waiting itself until the Holy Spirit moves individuals to speak is a prescribed form of Quaker worship, sometimes referred to as "the liturgy of silence".&lt;ref&gt;Dandelion, P., ''The Liturgies of Quakerism'', Liturgy, Worship and Society Series (Aldershot, England and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically in Christianity, however, the term "the liturgy" normally refers to a standardised order of events observed during a religious service, be it a [[sacrament]]al service or a service of public [[prayer]].  In the Catholic tradition, liturgy is the participation of the people in the work of God, which is primarily the saving work of Jesus Christ. In the liturgy, Christ continues the work of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 1069(London: Chapman, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "liturgy" literally in Greek means "work for the people", but a better translation is "public service" or "public work", as made clear from the origin of the term as described above. The early Christians adopted the word to describe their principal act of worship, the Sunday service (Holy Eucharist, Holy Communion, Mass or Divine Liturgy). This service, liturgy, or ministry (from the Latin "ministerium") is a duty for Christians as a priestly people by their baptism into Christ and participation in His high priestly ministry. It is also God's ministry or service to the worshippers. It is a reciprocal service. As such, many Christian churches designate one person who participates in the worship service as the liturgist. The liturgist may read announcements, scriptures, and calls to worship, while the minister preaches the sermon, offers prayers, and blesses sacraments.  The liturgist may be either an ordained minister or a layman. The entire congregation participates in and offers the liturgy to God.

==Islam==
{{main|Salat}}
''Salāt'' ("prayer", {{lang-ar|[[Wikt:صلاة|صلاة]]}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣalāh}}'' or [[genitive case#Arabic|{{smallcaps|''gen''}}]]: ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣalāt}}''; pl. {{lang|ar|صلوات}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣalawāt}}'') is the practice of physical and compulsory prayer in [[Islam]] as opposed to [[dua]], which is the Arabic word for [[supplication]]. Its importance for [[Muslims]] is indicated by its status as one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|Five Pillars]] of [[Islam]].

Salat is preceded by [[Wudu|ritual ablution]] and usually performed five times a day. It consists of the repetition of a unit called a ''[[rakat|rakʿah]]'' (pl. ''rakaʿāt'') consisting of prescribed actions and words. The number of obligatory (''[[fard]]'') ''rakaʿāt'' varies from two to four according to the time of day or other circumstances (such as Friday congregational worship, which has two rakats). Prayer is obligatory for all Muslims except those who are [[Preadolescence|prepubescent]], [[menstruation|menstruating]], or in [[puerperium]] stage after childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics'', p. 43, Aruna Thaker, Arlene Barton, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Quran does not state many personal details about Luqman's life, including when or where Luqman lived, later Islamic traditions have elaborated upon his story. Some tales portray him as a man of [[Nubia|Nubian]] descent,&lt;ref name=tafsir/&gt;&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; while others state that he was of [[South Arabia|South Arabian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zvXrQ7W7PEC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=70cNGDnjYK&amp;dq=luqman%20pre-islamic&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=luqman%20pre-islamic&amp;f=false The Book of Proverbs and Arabic Proverbial Works, Volume 74]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many stories about Luqman in [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Arabic literature|Arabic]] and [[Turkish literature]], and various [[tafsir]] collections comment upon these stories. The Quran does not state whether or not Luqman was a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]], and Islamic scholars have differing views of the matter. The [[Bahá'í]] [[Bahá'í literature|holy writings]] also make reference to Luqman.&lt;ref name=epistle/&gt;&lt;ref name=valleys/&gt;

==In the Quran==

The Quranic account of Luqman's life involves him offering his son religious and moral advice. He urges his son to avoid [[polytheism]] and worship Allah alone.{{Quran-usc|31|14}} He also instructs his son to be modest in attitude and to avoid arrogance.{{Quran-usc|31|18}} While the text states that Allah gave Luqman "wisdom", it does not explicitly state that he is a prophet.

==In Islamic tradition==

The [[tafsir]] written by the scholar [[Ibn Kathir]] places Luqman in [[Nubia]] or Ethiopia and portrays him as a carpenter and a slave. He states that while Luqman was a "righteous servant" of Allah, he was not a prophet.&lt;ref name=tafsir/&gt; One tale recounted in Ibn Kathir's writings involves Luqman's master ordering him to slaughter a sheep and to bring its worst parts to him. Luqman slaughtered the sheep and took its heart and tongue to his master. The master was confused upon receiving them, but Luqman stated that "There is nothing better than these if they are good, and there is nothing worse than these if they are bad", demonstrating his perception and wisdom.

Other Islamic traditions portray Luqman as an Arab poet and wise man from the people of [[ʿĀd]] who lived in [[Al-Ahqaf]], near modern-day [[Yemen]]. A large number of stories demonstrating Luqman's sharp mind have made their way into Islamic tradition, including his attempts to gain a woman's love. Over time, a large number of proverbs have been attributed to him, rendering him a sort of Arabic [[Aesop]] figure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zvXrQ7W7PEC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=70cNGDnjYK&amp;dq=luqman%20pre-islamic&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=luqman%20pre-islamic&amp;f=false The Book of Proverbs and Arabic Proverbial Works, Volume 74]&lt;/ref&gt; One saying attributed to Luqman has him crediting his success in life to "truthful speech, fulfilling the trust, and leaving what does not concern me."&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halawi, Ali Sayed, Stories of the Qur'an by Ibn Kathir, Dar Al-Manarah&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars speculate that he was a mythical figure known in pre-Islamic times, though there has been much debate about the relationship of the pre-Islamic and Islamic Luqmans. Some maintain that the two are the same person; others that they simply share the same name.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; Both Ibn Kathir and the Islamic historian [[Ibn Ishaq]] allude to a pre-Islamic "Book of Luqman", or "roll of Luqman", containing his wisdom, though no such work has survived, and it is unclear if the reports of its existence are true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutas |first1=Dimitri |date=Jan-Mar 1981 |title= Classical Arabic Wisdom Literature: Nature and Scope  |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/602164?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society  |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=49-86 |doi=10.2307/602164  |access-date= 20 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Bahá'í==

In the Bahá'í writings, Luqman presents the following analogy to his son to explain the inevitability of the afterlife: "O Son, if thou art able not to sleep, then thou art able not to die. And if thou art able not to waken after sleep, then thou shalt be able not to rise after death.” &lt;ref name=valleys/&gt;

Until the discovery that [[Maya stelae]] depicted [[ajaw|kings]] instead of [[high priest]]s, the '''Maya priesthood''' and their preoccupations had been a main scholarly concern. In the course of the 1960s and over the following decades, however, dynastic research came to dominate interest in the subject. A concept of royal '[[shamanism]]', chiefly propounded by [[Linda Schele]] and Freidel,&lt;ref&gt;''Maya Cosmos''&lt;/ref&gt; came to occupy the forefront instead.&lt;ref&gt;Klein et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Classic [[Maya civilization]], being highly ritualistic, would have been unthinkable without a developed [[priest]]hood.{{Citation needed|reason=Established scholarly consensus that it would be unthinkable?|date=August 2017}} Like other [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican priesthoods]], the early Maya priesthood consisted of a [[hierarchy]] of professional priests serving as intermediaries between the population and the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|deities]]. Their basic skill was the art of [[Reading (process)|reading]] and writing. The priesthood as a whole was the keeper of knowledge concerning the deities and their [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]], including calendrics, [[astrology]], divination, and prophecy. In addition, they were experts in [[historiography]] and [[genealogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Casas 1967: 504-505; Landa 1941: 98&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were usually male and could marry. Most of our knowledge concerns [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] in the Late Postclassic, with additional data stemming from the contemporaneous [[Guatemalan Highlands]].[[File:Maya Codex-Style Vessel with two scenes 3 Kimbell.jpg|thumb|300px|right|High priest (''aj k'in''), evincing the eye of [[Itzamna#Early-colonial reports|Kinich Ahau Itzamna]] and the netted headdress of the [[Bacab]]s, while instructing scribes]].

==Priests: In between shamans and kings==

===Shamans and priests===
The Maya class of the priests is sometimes thought to have emerged from a pre-existing network of [[Shamanism|shamans]] as social complexity grew. The classic Siberian shaman is characterised by his intimate relationship with one or several helper spirits, ʻecstatic’ voyages into non-human realms, and often operates individually, on behalf of his clients. In 20th-century Maya communities, [[Divination|diviners]], and also [[Witch doctor|curers]], may show some features of true shamans, particularly vocation through illness or [[dream]]s, [[trance]], and communication with a [[spirit]]. In reference to these features, they are often loosely called ʻshamans’ by ethnographers.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Tedlock 1992: 47-53&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, priests are chiefly cultic functionaries operating within a well-defined [[hierarchy]] and offering [[food]], [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifices]] and [[prayer]]s to the deities on behalf of social groups situated on different levels. In 20th-century Maya communities of the north-western Guatemalan highlands, the hierarchies of 'Prayermakers' offer examples of such priests. The Prehispanic religious functionaries described by men like [[Diego de Landa]], [[Tomás de Torquemada]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] were also priests, not shamans.

===Priestly kings and priests===
Among the Mayas, priestly functions were often fulfilled by dignitaries who were not professional priests, but this fact cannot be used to argue the nonexistence of a separate priesthood. The ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' stereotypically describes the first ancestors as "bloodletters and sacrificers" and as the carriers of [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|their deities]], a priestly function.&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003: 236; 211, 223&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[K'iche' people|Kʻicheʻ kings]] and highest dignitaries coming after them, the kingship was a sacred institution and the temple service a duty: during certain intervals, they [[Abstinence|abstained]] from [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], [[fasting|fasted]], prayed, and [[burnt offering]]s, "pleading for the light and the life of their vassals and servants."&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2003: 287-288&lt;/ref&gt; Although the text describes the three [[temple]]s dedicated to the first ancestors' [[Tutelary deity|patron deities]] and names what appear to be the two high priests of the main deities (the Lords Ah Tohil and Ah Cucumatz), it does not discuss, or even mention, local priests.

According to some Yucatec sources, too, the rulers and the high nobility carried out priestly tasks. The highest [[Mayapan]] nobility, for example, is stated to have served continually in the temples; for the early Choles, no regular priesthood is mentioned, so that one might assume that the [[Tribal chief|chief]]s performed the priestly functions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 27 note 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Yucatec [[king]] (or "head chief of a [[province]]"), known as the ''halach uinic'' (‘true man’), is defined both as a ‘[[governor]]’ and a ‘[[bishop]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Motul dictionary, in Tozzer 1941:36 note 177&lt;/ref&gt; Without a grounding in esoteric and ritual knowledge, a ruler could apparently not function.

For the Classic period, the king should probably be considered a [[Sacred king|sacred, priestly king]], perhaps subsuming in his person the priesthood as a whole. The latter idea has been used as an explanation for the seeming lack of references to priests in Classic period texts.&lt;ref&gt;Houston and Inomata 2009: 61&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the king representing the priesthood should not be pushed to its limits, however, since due to our lack of knowledge of priestly titles and imperfect understanding of the script, textual references to priests may easily pass unnoticed. The existence of a separate Classic priesthood, at the [[monarchy|kingdom]]'s [[court]] as well as in its towns and villages, is hardly doubtful; its absence would constitute an anomaly among early civilizations.

==The priesthood in the Late-Postclassic Period==
The main description of a priestly hierarchy as it functioned in the first decades of the 16th century stems from Landa's account of Yucatec society, but isolated terms for priestly offices have also been transmitted from other [[Maya peoples|Maya groups]].

===The Yucatec hierarchy===

====Recruitment====
In Yucatán, priests were [[son]]s of priests or second sons of [[Nobility|nobles]].&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 27&lt;/ref&gt; The priesthood provided high status positions for those children of the Maya nobility who could not obtain political office. They were trained through an apprentice system, with young adults being selected according to their descent and individual abilities.

====Offices====
The high priest of the kingdom ('province') was called ''ahau can mai'' or ''ah kin mai'', with ''mai'' being either a [[family name]] or a functional designation. The position was hereditary, usually passed on to sons or [[family|close relatives]]. The high priest lived from the contributions of his town priests and the gifts of the [[lord]]s. The responsibilities of the ''ahau can mai'' included the writing of [[book]]s; the teaching of the [[Maya script]] and the [[Maya calendar]] to the novices; examining and appointing new priests and providing them with books; performing the more important rituals; and advising the other lords.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The town priest was called ''ah k’in'', a word with a basic meaning of 'diviner' (''k’in'' by itself meaning '[[sun]]' or 'day').&lt;ref&gt;Lizana, in Thompson 1970: 166&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ah k’inob'' had the responsibility of conducting public and private rituals within individual towns throughout the province. They "preached and published the [[festival]] days," determined the appropriate steps in case of need, made sacrifices, and administered the "[[sacrament]]s", acts connected to life cycle [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 111&lt;/ref&gt; The town priests were assisted by four old men called ''chac''.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The priests carrying out [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]] were called ''ah nakom''; their status was relatively low. Priests giving oracles were known as ''chilan'' or ''chilam'', ‘oracular priest’ (often translated as ‘[[prophet]]’; an influential role, with the ''[[Chilam Balam]]'' as a prime example). The ''chilan'' may have used [[mind]]-altering substances.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970: 185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Itzá priesthood===
The last independent Maya state, [[Itza people|the 17th-century Itzá kingdom]] of [[Tayasal|Nojpetén]], was ruled by the king, Kan Ek’ and the high priest, ''Ajk’ín'' Kan Ek’.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998: 94&lt;/ref&gt; Their priesthood seems to have consisted of 12 priests: In the hall of the dwelling of the petty king, Ajau Kan Ek’, was a stone table with twelve seats for the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Avendaño, in Jones 1998: 71&lt;/ref&gt; This priestly college is reminiscent of the twelve head priests of the kingdom of Mayapan.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Itzá high priest should perhaps be counted its 13th member. Thirteen priests are also mentioned as part of a classificatory system shared by the Yucatec and the Itzá states, and further comprising 13 ''[[K'atun|katuns]]'', 13 provinces and 13 ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998: 102, cf. Craine and Reindorp 1979: 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iconography====
In [[Chichen Itza]] ([[Temple]] of the [[Chac Mool]] under the Temple of the Warriors), long-robed, aged and ascetic-looking characters with broad-rimmed [[Featherwork|feather hats]] have been depicted that are carrying offerings. They are seated in a row with [[rain]] [[deity]] impersonators (perhaps rainmakers) directly behind them, and have been interpreted as Itzá priests.&lt;ref&gt;Roys 1967: 181, fig. 45; cf. Schele and Freidel 1990: 371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priestly offices outside Yucatán===
In dictionaries concerning the 16th-century Pokom Mayas of the [[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]],&lt;ref&gt;Miles 1957: 750&lt;/ref&gt; one finds terms like ''ah mai'' and ''ah zi'' ʻthose who make offerings'; ''ah zacumvach'', ‘white countenance’ and ''ah quih'' for diviner; and ''ihcamcavil'', ‘carrier of the [[Cult image|idol]]’, a function like that fulfilled by the first ancestors of the Kʻicheʻ and probably referring to priests serving in processions. [[Black magic|Black sorcerers]] (''ah itz'', ''ah var'', ''ah kakzik'') were consulted by lords and [[prince]]s for [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|witchcraft against enemies]] and for [[Magic and religion|defensive magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles 1957: 751&lt;/ref&gt;

==The priesthood in the Classic Period==
At least seven centuries separate the [[Franciscan missions to the Maya|early Spanish missionary]] descriptions of the Maya priesthood from Classic Maya society. Although archaic religions tend to be very conservative, it can not be assumed beforehand that these descriptions are valid for the Classic priesthood as well. It has been suggested that the priestly function of the king completely overshadowed that of the priests (see above). Nonetheless, Classic iconography appears to show various sorts of priests, and some hieroglyphic titles have been suggested to be priestly ones. Amongst these are ''ajk'uhuun'' ('worshipper'), ''yajaw k'ahk'' ('master of fire'), ''ti'sakhuun'' ('prophet'), and ''yajaw te''' ('master of the tree/woods').&lt;ref&gt;Zender 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Priestly duties included sacrifice and the propitiation of deities, inauguration of kings, writing and interpretation of codices, and of course maintenance of ritual spaces and paraphernalia. Without being permanent ministers, the kings of the Classic Period (''k'uhul ajaw'' or "holy lord") regularly officiated ''ex officio'' as high priests.

===Appearance===
Classic art, particularly scenes on vases, depicts characters writing and reading books, aspersing and inaugurating kings, overseeing or performing [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]], and presiding over [[burial]] rites, all activities suggestive of priests. These characters, sometimes aged and ascetic, can show some of the attributes of Late-Postclassic priesthood mentioned in Yucatec sources.&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 105, 218&lt;/ref&gt; Among these Postclassic attributes are long, heavy vestments and 'chasubles'; feather jackets; 'miters'; aspergillums; and tail-like [[ribbon]]s hanging down from the jacket.

===Patron deities of the priesthood===
Chief among the patron deities of the Classic priests was the upper god, [[Itzamna]], first priest and first writer, still shown officiating in one of the pictures of the Late-Postclassic [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]].&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1992:34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Patron deities of writing and calendrical reckoning were of obvious importance to the priesthood, especially the writers among them,&lt;ref&gt;Coe/Kerr&lt;/ref&gt; and included a [[Maya maize god]] and the [[Howler Monkey Gods]]. The Howler Monkey God also personified the [[day]] sign, suggesting that he may more specifically have been a patron of diviners.&lt;ref&gt;Braakhuis 1987; Houston and Inomata 2009: 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mesoamerican Maya priesthood after the Conquest==
The priestly hierarchy disappeared in the wake of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Conquest]]. Following the disastrous epidemics of the first colonial decades, the Mesoamerican priestly functions were restructured to fit within the incipient new order. In Yucatán, the village herbalists and curers seem to have become responsible for the rituals of the forest and the fields as well, and thus to have become a sort of village priests.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Thompson 1970: 169&lt;/ref&gt; Their name, ''ahmen'', already occurs in the earliest colonial dictionaries, yet only with the restricted meaning of ‘craftsman’. Originally only a maker of all sorts of poultices, the curer-''ahmen'' gradually appears to have become a maker of prayers and sacrifices as well. Naturally, then, priestly ''ahmenob'' are not yet mentioned in Landa’s account. The literate aspects of the Prehispanic priesthood were partly assumed by local school masters and church singers (''maestros cantores''), who may also have been among the writers and compilers of the ''[[Chilam Balam]]'' books.

In the Guatemalan Highlands, the colonial and modern development was different and eventually resulted in thoroughly organized, indigenous priestly hierarchies, such as that of [[Momostenango]]. In this town, a hierarchy of ‘mother-fathers’ is charged with the priestly tasks of prayer and [[sacrifice]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tedlock 1996: 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; two of them on behalf of the town as a whole, fourteen for the wards, and three hundred for the patrilineages. Besides this hierarchy, a large part of the population (about 10000) has been initiated as diviner (''ajk’ij'').

'''Mormonism and Christianity''' have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express the doctrines of [[Mormonism]] using standard biblical terminology and have similar views about the nature of Jesus' [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], bodily resurrection, and [[Second Coming]] as traditional [[Christianity]]. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the [[Trinitarian]] views of orthodox [[Nicene Christianity]], codified in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]]s of 325 and 381;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shipps|1985|pp=148–49}} (arguing that "Mormonism differs from traditional Christianity in much the same fashion that traditional Christianity... came to differ from Judaism.").&lt;/ref&gt; Mormonism is the largest [[nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]] denomination within Christianity. Though Mormons consider the [[Bible]] as [[sacred scripture|scripture]], they do not believe in [[biblical inerrancy]]. They have also adopted additional scriptures, including the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Mormons practice [[baptism]] and celebrate the [[Eucharist]], but they also participate in religious rituals not practiced by traditional Christianity.

Focusing on differences, some Christians consider Mormonism "non-Christian"; but Mormons, focusing on similarities, are sometimes offended at being so characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Stark|Neilson|2005|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons do not accept non-Mormon baptism nor do non-Mormon Christians usually accept Mormon [[baptism]]. Mormons regularly proselytize individuals actually or nominally within the Christian tradition, and some Christians, especially [[evangelical Christianity|evangelicals]], proselytize Mormons. Some view Mormonism a form of Christianity, but distinct enough from traditional Christianity so as to form a new religious tradition, much as [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|Christianity is more than just a sect of Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Shipps|2000|p=338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mormonism]] that originated with [[Joseph Smith]] in the 1820s shared strong similarities with some elements of nineteenth-century [[Protestant Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John G. |last= Turner |authorlink= |year= 2016 |title= The Mormon Jesus: A Biography |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts and London |publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |page= 5 |isbn= 9780674737433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that God, through Smith and his successors, [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restored]] various doctrines and practices that were lost from the original Christianity taught by Jesus. For example, Smith, as a result of his "[[First Vision]]", primarily rejected the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] doctrine of the [[Trinity]] and instead taught that God the Father, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are three distinct "personages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joseph Fielding|title=Doctrines of Salvation|year=1956|publisher=Bookcraft|url=http://institute.lds.org/manuals/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/doc-gosp-01-10-5.asp|authorlink=Joseph Fielding Smith|page=1:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the largest [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormon denomination]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), acknowledges its differences with mainstream Christianity, it also focuses on its commonalities such as its focus on faith in Christ, following the teachings of Jesus Christ, the miracle of the atonement, and many other doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See, commentary, "[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/real-differences-real-similarities-and-biblical-christianity Real Differences, Real Similarities and Biblical Christianity] Mormon News Room, last 11 October 2007."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrinal comparison==
With roots within [[Second Great Awakening|radical Protestantism]] of the 1820s and 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=xv}} ("Mormonism springs from the sectarian tradition of the [[Radical Reformation]], in fact from its most extreme fringe.").&lt;/ref&gt; Mormonism soon diverged dramatically from traditional Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=200}} (describing Smith's evolving theology as "a radical departure from traditional Protestant Christianity.").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Joseph Smith era===
Mormonism arose in the 1820s during a period of radical reform and experimentation within American Protestantism, and Mormonism is integrally connected to [[Burned-over district|that religious environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gordon|2002|p=11}}; {{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title     =  ''The Book of Mormon: A Biography (Lives of Great Religious Books)''  | author    = Paul C. Gutjahr  | date      = March 25, 2012 | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | isbn      = 978-0-691-14480-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of [[Christian primitivism]], the new faith was one among several contemporary religious movements that claimed to [[Restorationism|restore]] Christianity to its condition at the [[Apostolic Age|time of the Twelve Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1969|pp=1–4}} (describing the background of Christian primitivism in New England).&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Book of Mormon====
The [[Book of Mormon]] (1830), which codifies the earliest Mormon doctrine, was intended, in part, to settle ongoing doctrinal disputes among contemporary [[Christian denominations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=4}} ("The Book of Mormon settles doctrinal differences among those who accept the Christ it presents. Mormon's purpose is to make clear the true doctrine and to dissolve doctrinal disputes by explaining the gospel of Christ"); {{Harvtxt|Ford|2005|pp=75–76}} ("[T]he Book of Mormon decides controversies in a number of areas, including those argued among early nineteenth century American theologians.").&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a single shared theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=88}} (noting that the Book of Mormon expresses contempt for [[sectarianism]], and arguing that establishing the one true fold and one true faith are the "only real theological themes of the book"); {{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=32}} (the Book of Mormon "would seek to heal the wounds of sectarianism and defend God against deism, rationalism, and sectarianism.").&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Smith believed in the Bible&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|pp=153–54}}; {{Harvtxt|Hill|1969|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and shared the Protestant tradition that the Bible (excluding the [[biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]) was originally revealed by God to humanity&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=154}}; {{Harvtxt|Hill|1969|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and had contained the "fulness of the gospel." Nevertheless, Smith believed the Bible of his era had degenerated from its original form. Smith blamed the [[Catholic Church]] for the loss of biblical books and for introducing corruptions and obfuscations in the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said that the [[Book of Mormon]] revealed "plain and precious things that had been taken away" from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hill|1969|p=5}}; {{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|pp=154–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also completed an unpublished [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|revision of the Bible]] in 1833,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=142}} (noting that though Smith declared his revision of the Bible complete in 1833, though the church lacked funds to publish it during his lifetime).&lt;/ref&gt; which he said corrected many of these errors,&lt;ref&gt;The LDS Church has canonized only a small part of this translation. However, see {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=296}} (noting that the most significant parts of Smith's revision of the Bible are found as footnotes and study materials in the [[LDS edition of the Bible|LDS Church edition]] of the Authorized King James Version).&lt;/ref&gt; and added inspired commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Q&amp;A: Questions and Answers|journal = [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]|date = April 1977|url = http://www.lds.org/new-era/1977/04/qa-questions-and-answers|accessdate = 2015-09-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151021205835/https://www.lds.org/new-era/1977/04/qa-questions-and-answers|archivedate = 2015-10-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith endowed the Book of Mormon with status equal to the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|pp=154–55}} ("To defend the Bible's status as revelation, the Book of Mormon demanded equal status.")&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nature of God====
Views on the Nature of God in early Mormonism has been a matter of debate. [[Thomas G. Alexander]] argues that early Mormon theology was "essentially trinitarian,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|pp=24–25}} (describing the pre-1835 theology as "essentially trinitarian"); {{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=30, 59}} (calling ''Book of Mormon'' theology "layman's Trinitarianism"); {{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1986|p=77}} ("The Book of Mormon, revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants prior to 1835, and Smith's 1832 account of his First Vision all reflect 'trinitarian' perceptions."); {{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|p=37}} ("While the Book of Mormon theology does not reflect a truly orthodox trinitarian view as codified in the [[Athanasian creed]], it does reflect the common Christian layman's perception that is some manner, the Father and the Son were both representations of one God."); {{Harvtxt|Lindgren|1986|pp=72–73}} (noting that Book of Mormon theology was similar to trinitarianism, but ultimately was "modalistic [[Monarchianism]]").&lt;/ref&gt; A statement in the [[Lectures on Faith]] is used to defend this belief:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are two personages who constitute the great, matchless, governing, and supreme power over all things, by whom all things were created and made, that are created and made..They are the Father and the Son-the Father being a personage of spirit, glory, and power possessing all perfection and fullness, the Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, a personage of tabernacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/lectures_on_faith.htm#LECTURE%20FIFTH |title=Lectures On Faith |work=mormonbeliefs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028025249/http://www.mormonbeliefs.com/lectures_on_faith.htm |archivedate=2005-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert L. Millet]] suggests that Smith simply had not had God's physical nature [[First Vision#Recorded accounts of the vision|revealed to him]] when he gave the lecture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is possible that Joseph Smith simply did not understand the corporeal or physical nature of God at the time the Lectures on Faith were delivered. His knowledge of things-like that of all men and women-was often incremental, and his development in understanding was therefore a "line upon line" development. As a result of the First Vision, the boy prophet knew that the heavens were no longer sealed; that satan was more than myth or metaphor; and that the Father and Son were separate and distinct personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=5931|title=Joseph Smith and Modern Mormonism: Orthodoxy, Neoorthodoxy, Tension, and Tradition|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Millet also argues that a statement by Truman Coe in 1836 reinforces the idea that early Mormon doctrine differed from the orthodox Protestantism of the day:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They (The Mormons) believe that the true God is a material being, composed of body and parts; and that when the Creator formed Adam in his own image, he made him about the size and shape of God himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=5295|title=Truman Coe's 1836 Description of Mormonism|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kurt Widmer stated that "early Mormons were reacting against a heavily intellectualized and theologized Trinitarian concept of God" and the nature of God was not at first of central importance to Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=30, 31}} ("What is apparent is that early Mormons were reacting against a heavily intellectualized and theologized Trinitarian concept of God.").&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other points of doctrine====
Early Mormon [[soteriology]], although not following a preexisting tradition, was generally [[Arminianism|Arminian]] in tendency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=26}} (noting that early Mormon doctrine "saw man as a creature of God, but capable of sanctification"); {{Harvtxt|Matzko|2007|p=73}} (noting similarities with [[Arminianism]], and disagreeing that the Book of Mormon incorporates [[Calvinist]] doctrine); {{Harvtxt|Ford|2005|p=77}} (arguing that while the Book of Mormon agrees with some tenets of Arminianism, it "integrates doctrines from a variety of preexisting theological perspectives and some apparently unique teachings").&lt;/ref&gt; Early Mormonism agreed with [[Methodism|Methodists]] and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] in rejecting [[Calvinistic]] doctrines in favor of [[Christian perfection]] and [[free will]] (called [[Agency (LDS Church)|free agency]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|pp=26–27}}; {{Harvtxt|Matzko|2007|p=73}} (noting, in addition, that the "Book of Mormon seems to contradict all five points of Calvinism"); {{Harvtxt|Ford|2005|p=88}} ("[I]n the debate over human freedom, the Book of Mormon tends to resolve the issues similarly but not identically to the Methodist brand of Arminianism.").&lt;/ref&gt;Also, while the Book of Mormon affirmed the doctrine of [[original sin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ford|2005|p=83}} (Book of Mormon "affirms original sin (2 Ne. 2), [and] [[Total depravity|human depravity]] (Mosiah 16:3)..."); {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=26}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostler|1991|p=61}} ("[A]lthough the Book of Mormon promulgates a notion of 'original sin', it is a 'hypothetical original sin' which does not actually afflict persons unless they reject the atonement."); {{Harvtxt|Lindgren|1986|p=72}} (describing the Book of Mormon as pessimistic about fundamental human nature, and the inability to overcome depravity through willfulness alone).&lt;/ref&gt; it also agrees with other Arminian denominations that children are [[Infant baptism#Arguments against infant baptism|incapable of sin]] and in a state of grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/warfield/warfield_children.html|title=Warfield - The Children in the Hands of the Arminians|website=www.monergism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.12,13,14?lang=eng#11|title=Moroni 8|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Christian primitivists, Smith located the authority of Christianity in correct interpretation of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=32}} (comparing the earliest Mormonism with the Disciples of Christ's view of Biblical authority).&lt;/ref&gt;—although he also maintained (as did the [[Shakers]]) that interpretation of the Bible should be guided by new and [[continuing revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=32}} ("Like Shakers, [Smith] would restore the church and be led to the correct interpretation by new and constant revelation.").&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the authority of Smith's faith was based on correct doctrine&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=32}} ("Like other Protestants, he would see correct doctrine as a mark of the true church.").&lt;/ref&gt; and his own claim of prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|p=7}} (describing Smith's earliest authority as [[charismatic authority]]); {{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|pp=77–78}} (noting that Smith based his authority, in part, on signs of divine approbation and special revelations, and that "[a]t first the Prophet had little to offer [converts] beyond baptism and his own impressive personality.").&lt;/ref&gt; Then during the early 1830s, Smith added to this authority [[apostolic succession]], represented by angelic apostles and prophets who Smith said [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|had ordained him]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hullinger|1992|p=32}} ("Like other Protestants, he would see correct doctrine as a mark of the true church. But Smith added something else: a new scripture and a dual priesthood based not on apostolic succession, as in the case of the Roman Catholic claim to authority, but on prophetic succession."); {{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|pp=77, 81}} (Smith "claimed ''prophetic'' succession through a dual priesthood that allegedly existed among the Hebrews."); {{Harvtxt|Quinn|1994|p=7}} (In 1834, Smith first began claiming that his authority arose within a line of succession through angelic visitors.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late–Joseph Smith era===
From the mid-1830s to his death in 1844, Smith continued to introduce ideas and practices which differed significantly from traditional Protestantism. First, Smith pressed [[Christian perfection]] beyond Protestant orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed non-Protestant Christians in rejecting the doctrine of [[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=85}} ("Mormonism as it evolved between Kirtland, Ohio and Nauvoo, Illinois, also rejected the pre-eminence of faith over works.").&lt;/ref&gt; and moved toward [[universal reconciliation|universalism]] by introducing a hierarchy of [[degrees of glory|three glorious heavens]], in which even the wicked had a place.&lt;ref name="Brodie 118"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=118}} ("[E]ven the 'liars, sorcerers, adulterers, and whoremongers' were guaranteed telestial glory, and only a handful of unregenerates called the [[Son of perdition (Mormonism)|Sons of Perdition]] were to be eternally damned.").&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1830s, Smith introduced [[baptism for the dead]] by proxy as a means for unredeemed souls to accept salvation in the afterlife,&lt;ref name="Brodie 282"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=421–22}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he also taught that the [[Sealing (Mormonism)|ordinance of marriage]] was required to reach the highest level of salvation.&lt;ref name="Brooke 255"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|p=255}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=300}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=443}} (noting that a modern Mormon interpretation of Smith's 1843 polygamy revelation ties both polygamy and monogamy to degrees of exaltation).&lt;/ref&gt; Smith also introduced a [[second anointing]] ritual, after which a participant was guaranteed virtually unconditional salvation. This has been seen as an attempt to retain the Calvinistic ideas of [[Assurance (theology)|assured salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Buerger|1983|pp=13–14, 36–37}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98}} (Second anointing was Smith's "attempt to deal with the theological problem of assurance" over which Calvinist theologians had argued for centuries.); {{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|pp=256–60}} (arguing that unlike Calvinism, the power to grant unconditional salvation resided in the priest, rather than God alone, and therefore incorporated elements of Smith's magical tradition); {{Harvtxt|Ostler|1991|pp=77–78}} (noting differences with the Calvinistic notion of [[Perseverance of the saints|persevering grace]]); {{Harvtxt|Prince|1995|pp=190–91}} (Unlike other Mormon rituals necessary for salvation, "the second anointing guaranteed one's exaltation, and thus may be viewed as the crowning ordinance of Smith's ministry.").&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years Smith also differed from traditional Protestantism in his views on the nature of God and humanity. Eventually Smith reduced the difference between God and man to one of degree. Both God and man are coeternal and uncreated. He taught that humans could progress to an exalted state in which they became coequal with a God who was material, plural, and himself a glorified man existing within time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=119, 145}}.{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=84}} ("To the older New England the ways and 'providences' of God were inscrutable. To a rebellious son of New England, living in an age of secret societies with strange signs and special ceremonies, God was quite scrutable, but only to those who were initiated."){{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=84}};{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119}}; {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=27}} (describing Smith's doctrine as "material anthropomorphism"); {{Harvtxt|Bloom|1992|p=101}} ("Smith's God, after all, began as a man, and struggled heroically in and with time and space, rather after the pattern of colonial and revolutionary Americans."){{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=421}} ("Piece by piece, Joseph redefined the nature of God, giving Him a form and a body and locating Him in time and space."); {{Harvtxt|Bloom|1992|p=101}} ("Joseph Smith's God...is finite.... Exalted now into the heavens, God necessarily is still subject to the contingencies of time and space.").&lt;/ref&gt; Smith taught that both [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus]] were distinct beings with physical bodies, and that the [[Holy Spirit]] was a personage of Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1909|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because God had once been a man who had risen to a high position in heaven,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=85}}; {{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=123–24}} (discussing instances where Smith taught that God was a resurrected man).&lt;/ref&gt; humans too could progress to godhood. Such a teaching implied a vast hierarchy of gods who would rule kingdoms of inferior intelligences, and so forth in an eternal hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=535, 455–56, 535–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the god of traditional Christianity, the god envisioned by Smith did not create the eternal spirits of humanity—he only organized them and provided them with a plan to follow in his footsteps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=420–21}}; {{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; God was God not because he was an ''ex nihilo'' creator, but because he had the greatest intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=455–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer Mormonism===
{{partisan|date=February 2015}}
After Smith's death, his successor [[Brigham Young]] and others built upon Smith's late teachings and introduced more significant doctrinal innovations. The resulting religious tradition defined the Mormonism of the Mormon pioneer era in the 19th century. An important part of this pioneer Mormonism is the [[Adam–God doctrine]], which became the most prominent (but not exclusive) theology of 19th-century Mormonism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Young taught that God the Father was [[Adam]], a mortal man resurrected and [[exaltation (Mormonism)|exalted]] to godhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bergera|1980|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this doctrine believed that Father Adam, as the subordinate member of a three-god council, created the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=131–33}} (describing Michael as a "lesser God in the Council of Gods".); {{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|p=38}} (noting that in Joseph Smith's [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] ceremony, the gods involved in the creation were "Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael," but unlike in modern Mormon theology, this "Jehovah" was not identified as Jesus).&lt;/ref&gt; Adam was both the common ancestor and the father of all spirits born on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bergera|1980|p=41}} (describing the Adam–God doctrine as "that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ"); {{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=131}} (Adam "was the father of the spirits in Heaven, as well as the father of their mortal bodies.").{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=132–33}}; {{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|p=39}} (Young apparently believed that while Adam was mortal on the earth, his father Elohim, the "Grandfather in Heaven," temporarily took over Adam's role as the god of this planet).&lt;/ref&gt; After ascending again to his heavenly throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|p=39}} ("After his death Adam returned to his exalted station as God the Father, and as such presided over Israel designated by the divine names ''Elohim'' or ''Jehovah''.").&lt;/ref&gt; Adam returned to physically father Jesus by [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=131}}; {{Harvtxt|Bergera|1980|p=41}} (describing the Adam–God doctrine as "that Adam was at once the spiritual as well as the physical father of all persons born on this world, including Jesus Christ"); {{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|p=39}} (Adam "later begot Jesus, his firstborn spirit son, in the flesh").&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of Mormonism from the pioneer era, including polygamy and the Adam–God doctrine, were renounced around the turn of the 20th century by the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=139}}; {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=29}} (noting that in 1912, the LDS [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] explicitly instructed missionaries to teach that Mormons worship God the Father, and not Adam, and discussing the official First Presidency statement of 1916).&lt;/ref&gt; However, these elements have been retained within the small branch of Mormonism known as [[Mormon fundamentalism]].

===Modern LDS Church orthodoxy===
Near the turn of the 20th century there was a movement to codify LDS theology with official statements of Church leaders — which served to quash speculative ideas that persisted as sub rosa concepts among some Mormons. This coincided with an effort to stop new plural marriages — mostly forbidden in 1890 and completely forbidden after 1904. Prominent Mormons such as [[Joseph F. Smith]], [[John A. Widstoe]], and [[James E. Talmage]] formulated the outlines of Mormon orthodoxy with publications that significantly narrowed the realm of acceptable speculative Mormon theology. 

====Nature of God and humanity====
{{main|God in Mormonism}}
In traditional Christianity, as expressed in the [[Athanasian Creed]], God is conceived both as a unity and a [[Trinity]]: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and God the [[Holy Spirit]] are described as three persons of one uncreated divine being, equally infinite, eternal, and unchangeable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Though modern Mormons share with traditional Christianity a belief that the object of their worship comprises three distinct persons, Mormon theology disagrees with the idea that the three persons are the same being. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22-23?lang=eng#21|title=Doctrine and Covenants 130|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons are constrained by the language of the Book of Mormon to regard the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as "one", but consider this a social unity rather than ontological. Mormons since the time of Joseph Smith have regarded God as plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Davies|2003|pp=68–69}}:"This image of God reinforces Dan Vogel's argument that 'Mormonism was never trinitarian but consistently preferred heterodox definitions of God.'" {{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=84}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=310–12}} (developing from monotheism in the late 1820s and 30s, LDS Church theology was clearly tritheistic by 1916).&lt;/ref&gt; They regard God the Father as the biblical god [[Elohim]], and they believe that the Son, a distinct being, is both Jesus and the biblical God [[Jehovah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kirkland|1984|pp=36, 41}} (Jesus is regarded as Jehovah, the Old Testament god).&lt;/ref&gt; The two of them, together with the Holy Spirit, are believed to form a heavenly council which Mormons call the "Godhead". They are "one" in the sense of being lovingly united in purpose or will, a view sometimes called [[Social trinity|social trinitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mormons believe in what is sometimes called "social trinitarianism," meaning the three beings of the Godhead are blended in heart and mind like extremely close friends, but are not one being." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional Christians, modern Mormons generally regard the Son as subordinate to the Father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=331}} (In contrast to Christian orthodoxy, "[t]he Mormon Jesus is subordinate to the Father.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.mi.byu.edu/publications/review/15/1/S00012-Of_Simplicity_Oversimplification_and_Monotheism.html|title=Of Simplicity, Oversimplification, and Monotheism|last=Bickmore|first=Barry|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons since the 1840s have believed that God is changeable. They believe that the Father (like the Son) was twice "born"—once as a spirit, and again as a mortal man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=119}} (Mormons believe that God was once a man.).&lt;/ref&gt; After he lived a mortal life, Mormons believe that the Father died, was resurrected, and achieved his godhood&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=85}};{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=123–24}} (discussing instances where Smith taught that God was a resurrected man);{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=27}}; {{Harvtxt|Bloom|1992|p=101}} ("Smith's God, after all, began as a man, and struggled heroically in and with time and space, rather after the pattern of colonial and revolutionary Americans."); {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=535, 455–56, 535–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with at least one wife whom Mormons refer to as the [[Heavenly Mother (Latter Day Saints)|Heavenly Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=31}} (Roberts and Widtsoe taught that "We must also have a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood.").&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the Heavenly Father and Mother gave birth to the spirits of humanity through a sexual union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=137}} (20th century Mormon theologians retained Young's idea that spirit children were born in the same way that material children are born); {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=31}} (noting the Heavenly Mother doctrine, Roberts and Widtsoe taught that "[s]exual relations will continue into eternity both for joy and for procreation.").&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mormons believe that Jesus, the Son, was the first born of these spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=305, 331}} (Mormon doctrine is that humans are born of a heavenly Father and Mother; Jesus is described as "literally our elder brother").&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mormons might agree with the statement that the Father and the Son are "uncreated", their understanding of "creation" differs from that of traditional Christianity. Mormons do not believe, as do traditional Christians, that God created the universe ''ex nihilo'' (from nothing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, to Mormons the act of creation is to organize or reorganize pre-existing matter or intelligence. Traditional Christians consider God to be a "necessary being", meaning that he cannot ''not'' exist, while all other creations are "contingent beings". In Mormonism, by contrast, every god and human is equally a necessary being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|McMurrin|1965|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mormon sense of "eternal" differs from that of traditional Christians, who believe that God's eternal nature exists outside of space and time. Some situate the Mormon God within space and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=421}} ("Piece by piece, Joseph redefined the nature of God, giving Him a form and a body and locating Him in time and space."); {{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|pp=119, 145}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=305}} ("The Mormon God exists within time; in traditional Christian theology, God is outside time.").&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mormon scripture states that "time is measured only unto man."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060901165351/http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=7027 The Will of the Father in All Things], Jeffrey R. Holland (BYU president), 17 January 1989; (mis-)quoting Alma 40:8. Book of Mormon&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-eternal, but they also believe that all of humanity is co-eternal with the Father&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=305, 331}} (Mormon doctrine is that humans are coeternal with God, are of the same species.&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that the underlying spark of all intelligence has always existed (in space and time) and never was created.

Mormons believe that God is scrutable through revelation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1120&amp;index=7&amp;keyword=Understanding%20God|title=Romans 1|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=84}} ("To the older New England the ways and 'providences' of God were inscrutable. To a rebellious son of New England, living in an age of secret societies with strange signs and special ceremonies, God was quite scrutable, but only to those who were initiated.")&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropomorphic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=27}} (describing Smith's doctrine as "material anthropomorphism"); {{Harvtxt|DePillis|1966|p=84}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=303}} ("Mormon tradition, from Joseph Smith on, has tended to interpret literally ... anthropomorphic descriptions of God.").&lt;/ref&gt; in that he has a physical body of flesh and bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jod.mrm.org/19/311|title=Temples in Ancient America, Etc., by Orson Pratt (Journal of Discourses, vol. 19, pp. 311-321)|work=mrm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1033&amp;index=1&amp;keyword=flesh%20and%20bone|title=The Reality of the Resurrection|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mormons do believe in traditional Christian notions that God is omnipotent and omniscient, modern Mormons also believe that "[e]ven God's omnipotence must conform to the attributes of truth and wisdom and justice and mercy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=929&amp;index=1&amp;keyword=Omnipotence|title=B. H. Roberts: The Book of Mormon and the Atonement|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salvation====
{{See also|Christian soteriology|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}
Although the LDS Church has never officially adopted a doctrine of soteriology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|pp=31–32}} (discussing reasons why the LDS Church never issued an official soteriological statement based on the writings of Roberts, Widtsoe, and Talmage).&lt;/ref&gt; most Mormons accept the doctrine of salvation formulated by [[B. H. Roberts]], [[John A. Widstoe]], and [[James E. Talmage]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=30}} (The soteriological orthodoxy created by Roberts, Widtsoe, and Talmage remained unchallenged until the advent of neo-orthodoxy).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to early Mormons, modern Mormons generally reject the idea of original sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=70–71}}; {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|pp=30, 32}} (The rejection of original sin is a reversal of ideas implicit in the Book of Mormon.); {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=330–31}} ("All Mormon factions agree that LDS theology rejects the orthodox Christian doctrine of original sin.").&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fall of Man]] is viewed not as a curse but as part of God's [[Plan of Salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of Salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald N. Lund]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/01/the-fall-of-man-and-his-redemption "The Fall of Man and His Redemption"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1081&amp;index=15&amp;keyword=Fall%20of%20Man|title=Glimpses of Lehi's Jerusalem|work=byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=31}};{{Harvtxt|White|1970|p=16}} (arguing that this Mormon orthodoxy "implies that the Fall is no fall".); {{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=71–72}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=332}} ("Mormons believe that Adam's fall was a good thing, not the tragic event of traditional Christian understanding.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons believe they must not only have faith and repent but also be baptized (by immersion and by a Mormon [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood holder]]) and bring forth good works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=336}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons consider their weekly [[Eucharist]] (''the [[Sacrament (Latter Day Saints)|Sacrament]]'') as a means of renewing their baptismal covenant and being repeatedly cleansed from sin. Although the grace of Jesus plays a role in salvation, each Mormon must "work out his own salvation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=80–81,83}} (quoting language of Philippians 2:12); {{Harvtxt|McMurrin|1965|pp=66–67}} (emphasis on works);{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=335}} ("On the faith-works scale, Mormons clearly tilt toward the works side.").&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that people not baptized during their lifetime may accept salvation in the afterlife through the Mormon practice of [[baptism for the dead]].&lt;ref name="Brodie 282" /&gt; Although the Book of Mormon rejected the doctrine of [[universal reconciliation]], Smith later taught that damnation was a temporary state from which the wicked would ultimately escape after they had paid for their sins, to be resurrected into one of the two lesser [[Degrees of glory|kingdoms of glory]].&lt;ref name="Brodie 118" /&gt;

Mormonism takes an extended view of [[Christian perfection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=27}} (Joseph Smith extended the idea of perfection extended beyond the Protestant orthodoxy).&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that through the grace of Jesus, Mormons may become perfectly sanctified and thereby literally become gods or achieve a state known as [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=312}} (noting that unlike Mormonism, the [[Methodism|Methodist]] view of sanctification "was thoroughly trinitarian and retained a distinction between the creature and the creator").&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve exaltation, Mormons must remain obedient to the teachings of Jesus, receive all the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] (or sacraments), which includes baptism, confirmation, receiving the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] (for males), the [[Endowment (Mormonism)|temple endowment]], and being [[celestial marriage|sealed to a spouse]].&lt;ref name="Brooke 255" /&gt; To "make sure" the [[conditional election|election]] of believers, Smith introduced a [[second anointing]] ritual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98}} (those who were married eternally were then "sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise" through the second anointing); {{Harvtxt|Brooke|1994|pp=256–57}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=199}} (citing research of David John Buerger, who assumes that the LDS Church does not consider the [[second anointing]] ritual to be a prerequisite for achieving godhood in the afterlife).&lt;/ref&gt; whose participants, upon continued obedience, were sealed to exaltation.

====Role of the church====
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
Like Catholicism and Orthodoxy, Mormonism assigns considerable authoritative status to church tradition and ecclesiastical leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/strangers/chapter14.htm Paul Toscano, Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1990), Chapter 14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707023617/http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/strangers/chapter14.htm |date=2010-07-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons emphasize the authority of an institutional church, which in all Mormon denominations derives from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] established by [[Joseph Smith]] in 1830. Mormons believe this church to be the "only true and living church." Below Jesus as the head of the church is a single man chosen as the "[[Prophet, seer, and revelator|Prophet]]" who holds the position of [[President of the Church]]. The Prophet has been compared to the Pope in Catholicism because both, within their respective faiths, are regarded as the leading authority.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}

Mormons also believe in [[apostolic succession]]. However, Mormons believe the Catholic line of succession is invalid because of a [[Great Apostasy]] that occurred soon after era of the apostles. The line of succession was restored through Joseph Smith when biblical prophets and apostles appeared to him and ordained him through the [[laying on of hands]] with lost priesthood authority. Thus, Mormons believe that non-Mormon clergy have no heavenly authority and that sacraments performed by clergy of other faiths are of no effect in the eyes of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.19?lang=eng|title=Joseph Smith—History 1|website=www.lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons reject the Protestant doctrine of the "[[priesthood of all believers]]", but they consider all [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmed]] Mormons to have the "Gift of the Holy Ghost" (also conveyed by the laying on of hands), which entitles believers to [[spiritual gifts]] but to no ecclesiastical authority.

===Mormon neo-orthodoxy===
Some claim that in the late-20th century, a conservative movement within the LDS Church (called "Mormon neo-orthodoxy" on the analogy of an earlier Protestant [[neo-orthodoxy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|p=xvi}}; {{Harvtxt|McMurrin|1965|p=111}} (noting that Mormonism has become increasingly conservative, denying "the traditional liberalism of Mormon theology by favoring a negative description of human nature and the human predicament."); {{Harvtxt|Alexander|1980|p=32}} (the trend followed Protestant neo-orthodoxy but lacked "the vigor and certitude of its Protestant counterpart" because Mormons were limited by authoritative statements of Mormon progressives); {{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=142, 144}} (Mormon neo-orthodox scholars are "less extreme" than their Protestant counterparts).&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the Book of Mormon over later revelations&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=139–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and embraced original sin, an absolute, eternal, and unchanging God, a pessimistic assessment of human nature, and a doctrine of salvation by grace rather than by works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=xvi, 96–97}}; {{Harvtxt|White|1970|pp=12–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the book's importance to early Mormonism, early Mormons rarely quoted from the Book of Mormon in their speeches and writings.&lt;ref name="Riess 2005 xiii"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Riess|Tickle|2005|p=xiii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Smith's later teachings and writings focused on the Bible, including [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|his own revision and commentary]] of the [[Authorized King James Version]]. The book was not regularly cited in Mormon [[General conference (LDS Church)|conferences]] until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Riess 2005 xiii"/&gt; Within the LDS Church, a movement to re-emphasize the Jesus-based elements of Mormonism in the 1980s included a rediscovery of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Riess|Tickle|2005|p=xiii-xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, the church subtitled the book "Another Testament of Jesus Christ", to emphasize that Jesus was a central focus of the book&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Riess|Tickle|2005|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the book is intended to be a complement to the Bible.

Although Mormon neo-orthodox scholars say they have faced "resistance" from Mormon orthodoxy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; some perceive the direction of the movement to be consistent with a broader trend among the LDS hierarchy to present Mormonism in terms more acceptable to mainline Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=174–75}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=330}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that because Mormonism is not based on an authoritative systematic theology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|p=302}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and much of Mormon scripture was written when Mormonism was "essentially trinitarian", Mormon leaders and apologists have been able to deny that at least some of 20th-century orthodox Mormonism represents official Mormon doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=301, 429–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also claimed that LDS Church publications and a few Mormon scholars have increasingly used the language of Nicene Christianity to describe the nature of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|White|1987|pp=174–75}}; {{Harvtxt|Ostling|Ostling|2007|pp=308, 330}} (noting writings by BYU scholars who describe God as omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent).&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence and implications of the movement continues to be debated. Theologian [[Richard Mouw]] asserts that Mormons have downplayed some of its more "heretical" doctrines in order to obtain more effective dialogue with other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/05/mormons-approaching-orthodoxy|title=Mormons Approaching Orthodoxy {{!}} Richard J. Mouw|newspaper=First Things|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terryl Givens]], a Mormon theologian, has rejected such claims, asserting instead that many Mormon "heresies" eventually become more accepted by much of Christianity. He consequently contends that "Christian consensus is fluid and, in some cases, has lagged behind the Mormon model."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/06/mormons-at-the-forefront|title=Mormons at the Forefront {{!}} Terryl Givens|newspaper=First Things|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian views about Mormons==
In the past, most mainstream Christian denominations rejected Mormonism outright, frequently calling it a cult and characterizing it as "non-Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Abanes|2007|p=253}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although mainstream Christian denominations still reject Mormons as being non-Christian, the image of Mormonism has metamorphosed during the 20th century in large part due to an evolution of Mormon theology and partly due to a deliberate effort on the part of the leadership of the LDS Church.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} According to [[Jan Shipps]], during the 1950s the attitude of mainstream Christians towards Mormonism changed from "vilification" to "veneration," with emphasis on positive Mormon traits such as "family orientation, clean-cut optimism, honesty and pleasant aggressiveness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Kingdom Come |journal=TIME Magazine |first=David |last=Van Biema |date=June 24, 2001 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Abanes]] attributes an "increasing lack of delineation between (Mormonism and mainstream Christianity)" to three primary causes:
#the willingness of some Mormon leaders to be less than candid about more controversial aspects of LDS history and theology,
#a trend among some Mormon scholars to make LDS belief sound more mainstream, and
#an evolution of Mormon thought toward doctrinal positions nearer those of evangelicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Abanes|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Bushman]] asserts that, for many people, Mormonism "conjures up an assortment of contradictory images".  One set of images suggests that Mormons are "happy, uncomplicated, kindly and innocent—if perhaps naive". In contrast to this set of images, Bushman describes a set of associations that focuses on "a powerful religious hierarchy controlling the church from the top".  This perspective views Mormons as "secretive, clannish and perhaps dangerous", often labeling the movement as a "cult rather than a church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen E. Robinson]] has argued that Mormons are labeled heretics "for opinions and practices that are freely tolerated in other mainstream denominations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Eliason|2001|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormonism has a particularly rocky relationship with American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;According to John Pottenger, although both Mormon Christianity and evangelical Christianity claim to be preaching true Christianity, they are nonetheless "diametrically opposed in many of their beliefs, theologies and practices." {{Harvtxt|Pottenger|2007|p=143}}. However, according to {{Harv|Bloom|1992}}, Mormonism and American Evangelicalism (and American religion in general) have more in common at a deep level than either of them do with traditional European Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the view of Mormonism being non-Christian or a cult is not a uniformly held belief among Evangelicals, especially with those that have personal experience with Mormons in their community.{{cn|date=April 2018}} [[Richard J. Mouw]], President of [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], an evangelical school in [[Pasadena, California]], stated in a recent opinion piece for CNN, "[t]hose of us who have made the effort to engage Mormons in friendly and sustained give-and-take conversations have come to see them as good citizens whose life of faith often exhibits qualities that are worthy of the Christian label, even as we continue to engage in friendly arguments with them about crucial theological issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Richard J. |last= Mouw |authorlink= Richard J.

===Non-recognition of Mormon rites===
;LDS perspective
Latter Day Saint history comes from the position that other churches were the product of the apostasy, as referenced in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;See references given in the introductory paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons view other Christian churches as teaching some truth, doing good works, and acknowledge their strong faith in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true 'Mormons'." {{Citation|title=Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith |page=316 |author=Joseph Fielding Smith |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mormons also maintain that all other churches lack the divine authority to perform the ordinances of the gospel because of the Great Apostasy. The LDS Church and most [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|other Latter Day Saint factions]] do not accept the baptisms of other Christian denominations as valid.

;Traditional perspective
The Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant branches of Christianity reject Mormon claims of additional scriptures, and of the prophetic office of Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders; they disagree with Mormon charges that they have committed apostasy. Doctrines such as the beliefs about the existence of prophets in early American civilizations, which are unique to Mormon theology and not found in the teachings of other Christian churches are also causes of disagreement. Nonetheless, many Christian denominations treat Mormons with respect, while not minimizing the differences in belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/february/14.18.html Winning them softly Evangelicals try to reach Mormons with respect - and hard science.] John W. Kennedy, posted 2/01/2004 (February 2004, Vol. 48, No. 2) Christianity Today (Accessed:October 7, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4truth.net/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=hiKXLbPNLrF&amp;b=784549&amp;ct=941339|title=Page Not Found|work=4truth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, in the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Roman Curia|Vatican's]] [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] decided not to accept [[Latter-day Saint]] baptisms as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html|title=RESPONSE TO A 'DUBIUM' on the validity of baptism conferred by "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints", called "Mormons"|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church generally recognizes baptisms from other Christian faiths in the name of the Trinity, provided the person baptizing intends to do as the Church intends. However, because of differences in Mormon and Catholic beliefs concerning the Trinity, the Catholic Church stated that Mormon baptism was "not the baptism that Christ instituted." The Catholic Bishop of Salt Lake City, [[George Hugh Niederauer]], stated that this ruling should not be a statement of the LDS relationship with Jesus Christ.

The [[Presbyterian Church USA]], the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, publishes a brochure describing the LDS Church as follows:
:The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), declares allegiance to Jesus. Latter-day Saints and Presbyterians share use of the Bible as scripture, and members of both churches use common theological terms. Nevertheless, Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church, of which Presbyterians are a part.&amp;nbsp;... It is the practice of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) to receive on profession of faith those coming directly from a Mormon background and to administer baptism.&amp;nbsp;... Presbyterian relationships with Latter-day Saints have changed throughout the twentieth century. By God's grace they may change further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|accessdate=2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest Lutheran body in the US, notes that Lutherans have been among those Christians who do not re-baptize other baptized Christians; however, it publishes the following statement on the recognition of Mormon baptisms:

:Although Mormons may use water—and lots of it—and while they may say "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," their teaching about the nature of God is substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity. Because the Mormon understanding of the Word of God is not the same as the Christian understanding, it is correct to say that Christian Baptism has not taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|accessdate=2006-08-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211010129/http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|archivedate=2006-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2000 General Conference, the [[United Methodist Church]] decided not to recognize Latter-day Saint baptisms, stating:
:The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the LDS Church itself, while calling itself Christian, explicitly professes a distinction and separateness from the ecumenical community and is intentional about clarifying significant differences in doctrine. As United Methodists we agree with their assessment that the LDS Church is not a part of the historic, apostolic tradition of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|accessdate=2006-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Episcopal Church (USA)]], part of the 80-million-member [[Anglican Communion]], does not have an official position on the validity of Mormon baptism; however, most traditional clergy would not accept Mormon baptism and require the baptism of Mormons entering into the Episcopal Church. Retired bishop [[Carolyn Tanner Irish]] of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Utah]] was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of 8, her baptism was deemed valid upon her entering into the Episcopal Church in 1977, where she was confirmed by bishop of [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington|Washington]], Rev. [[John T. Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simpson|first1=James B.|title=Bishop-Elect Not an Issues Person|url=https://episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/the_living_church/TLCarticle.pl?volume=212&amp;issue=21&amp;article_id=2|publisher=Archives of the Episcopal Church|accessdate=9 July 2017|date=May 26, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church does not recognize Mormons as historic Apostolic Christians, but rather as a new and unique religious movement that is an offshoot of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Douglas LeBlanc|url=http://www.getreligion.org/?p=847|title=Latter-day politics |publisher=GetReligion |date=June 13, 2005|accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proselytizing of Mormons by evangelical Christians===
Many other Christian churches also seek to teach or convert Mormons when the opportunity arises. Traditional Christian leaders often encourage their followers to follow the admonition of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible1.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?word=1+Peter+3:15&amp;section=0&amp;version=niv&amp;new=1&amp;showtools=1&amp;oq=&amp;NavBook=1pe&amp;NavGo=3&amp;NavCurrentChapter=31Peter3:15|title=Read and Study the Bible Online - Search, Find Verses|website=Bible Study Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt; and witness to others using gentleness and respect. Like their Mormon counterparts, those from the traditional Christian religions assert that these proselytizing efforts arise out of love and genuine concern for others and not a desire to cause contention. Consequently, though the feelings may be strong, there is often a feeling of mutual appreciation and respect that accompanies missionary efforts on both sides (though this is not always the case). Some traditional Christian denominations have ministries focused on Mormons, just as they also have ministries toward Jews, Native Americans, or other demographic groups.&lt;ref&gt;See{{Citation|url=http://www.bmm.org/BMM/WhereWeServe/NorthAmerica/mormonministries.htm|title=Baptist Mid-Missions Mormon Ministries|accessdate=2006-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See{{Citation|url=http://www.bmm.org/BMM/WhereWeServe/NorthAmerica/jewishministries.htm|title=Baptist Mid-Missions Jewish Ministries|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See{{Citation|url=http://www.bmm.org/BMM/WhereWeServe/NorthAmerica/nativeamericans.htm|title=Baptist Mid-Missions Native American Ministries|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 1998 convention of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] held in Salt Lake City had the stated aim to "bring Christianity to the Mormons."

There are also many independent ministries and organizations focused on Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of such ministries include [http://www.utlm.org/ Utah Lighthouse Ministries],[http://www.mrm.org/ Mormonism Research Ministries], [http://www.lhvm.org/LivingHope Ministries], [http://www.bcmmin.org/ Berean Christian Ministries],[http://www.lifeafter.org/ Life After Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polls and attitudes===
A 2007 Pew Poll showed that 31% of the general public in the United States believe that Mormons are not Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/#2 |title= The Mormons. Frequently Asked Questions: Are Mormons Christians|publisher= PBS |accessdate=18 June 2010}}; [http://www.pewforum.org/Public-Expresses-Mixed-Views-of-Islam-Mormonism.aspx 2007 poll] conducted by the Pew Research Center. See, for example, http://www.religionnewsblog.com/19478/religion-poll-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar polls have concluded that over two-thirds of the general public view Mormons as members of the larger Christian community, including many independent evangelical ministries and prominent evangelical leaders. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

However, in an October 2010 poll conducted by [[LifeWay Research]], three out of four American Protestant pastors did not believe that Mormons were Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/poll-three-in-four-pastors-say-mormons-arent-christian/2011/10/10/gIQAHdlkaL_story.html |title= Poll: Three in four pastors say Mormons aren’t Christian |first= Josef |last= Kuhn |date= 10 October 2011 |agency= [[Religion News Service]] |newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormon engagement with broader Christianity==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
In the 1960s, the LDS Church formed the Church Information Service with the goal of being ready to respond to media inquiries and generate positive media coverage. The organization kept a photo file to provide photos to the media for such events as [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] dedications. It also would work to get stories covering [[Family Home Evening]], the church's welfare plan and the church's youth activities in various publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard O. Cowan]]. ''The Church in the 20th Century'' (Bookcraft: Salt Lake City, 1985) p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the church's efforts to re-position its image as that of a mainstream religion, the church began to moderate its earlier [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] rhetoric. In [[Bruce R. McConkie]]'s 1958 edition of [[Mormon Doctrine (book)|''Mormon Doctrine'']], he had stated his opinion that the Catholic Church was part of "the church of the devil" and "the great and abominable church" because it was among organizations that misled people away from following God's laws. In his 1966 edition of the same book, the specific reference to the Catholic Church was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994}}; {{Harvtxt|Sheperd|Sheperd|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the LDS Church recast its [[Mormon missionary|missionary]] lessons, making them more family-friendly and focused on building on common Christian ideals. The new lessons, named "A Uniform System for Teaching Families", de-emphasized the [[Great Apostasy]], which previously held a prominent position just after the story of the [[First Vision]]. After a further revision in the early 1980s, the lessons dealt with the apostasy even less conspicuously by moving its discussion from the first lesson to later lessons. The lessons also became more family-friendly, including a flip chart with pictures, in part to encourage the participation of children.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1995, the church announced a new logo design that emphasized the words "JESUS CHRIST" in large capital letters. According to Bruce L. Olsen, director of public affairs for the church, "The logo re-emphasizes the official name of the church and the central position of the Savior in its theology. It stresses our allegiance to the Lord, Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="Riess 2005"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Riess|Tickle|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the church sent out a press release encouraging reporters to use the full name of the church at the beginning of news articles, with following references to the "Church of Jesus Christ". The release discouraged the use of the term "Mormon Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/style-guide "Style Guide – The Name of the Church"], mormonnewsroom.org, accessed 6 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downplaying of differences===
Riess and Tickle assert that, starting in the late twentieth century, Mormons have focused their attention on Jesus Christ more than at any other time since the inception of their faith. Some critics of the LDS Church have accused church leaders of attempting to disingenuously portray the church as "just another Christian denomination" when, in fact, there are significant differences. Riess and Tickle argue that these critics are failing to grasp that this recent emphasis on Jesus Christ is part of a genuine theological evolution that concurrently involves a renewed interest in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref name="Riess 2005"/&gt;

Ross Anderson asserts that, "(i)n public, LDS spokesmen downplay their Church's distinctive doctrines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Quick Christian Guide to the Mormon Holy Scripture |first=Ross |last=Anderson |publisher=Zondervan |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQb5qQvKDfgC&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=Mormonism+downplay+differences+Christianity#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-310-59068-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia Limerick suggests that future historians may conclude that, in the last four decades of the 20th, the [[general authorities]] of the LDS Church "undertook to standardize Mormon thought and practice". According to Limerick, this campaign of standardization has led to a retreat from the distinctive elements of Mormonism and an accentuation of the church's similarity to conventional Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Something in the soil: legacies and reckonings in the New West |first=Patricia Nelson |last=Limerick |publisher=W.

According to [[Claudia Bushman]], "[t]he renewed emphasis on scripture study, especially the Book of Mormon, led the Church away from speculative theology. The freewheeling General Conference addresses of earlier years, elaborating unique LDS doctrines, were gradually replaced with a basic Christian message downplaying denominational differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bushman |first= Claudia |authorlink= Claudia Lauper Bushman |year= 2006 |title= Contemporary Mormonism: Latter-day Saints in Modern America |place= Westport, Connecticut |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] |isbn= 0-275-98933-X |oclc= 61178156 |url= http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?isbn=9780275989330 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent church presidents have tended to downplay those doctrines that served to distinguish Mormonism from mainline churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations  |first1=Eugene V. |last1=Gallagher |first2=W.

Hinckley]]  "on numerous occasions demonstrated his willingness to seriously downplay any issues that might be construed as controversial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Inside Today's Mormonism |first=Richard |last=Abanes |publisher=Harvest House Publishers |year=2007 |page=433 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SuCrKAc6i6kC&amp;pg=PT433&amp;dq=Mormonism+Christianity+downplay#v=onepage&amp;q=Mormonism%20Christianity%20downplay&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7369-1968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Hinckley stated that message of the LDS Church was "Christ-centered. [Christ is] our leader. He's our head. His name is the name of our church."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=TIME Magazine |title=KINGDOM COME |first=David |last=Van Biema |date=June 24, 2001 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,138108,00.html |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking about other faiths, modern LDS leaders have adopted a policy of avoiding the use of critical and judgmental language in official church publications, and encouraged members of the church to be respectful of the beliefs of others as they witness in their personal lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Russell Ballard]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2008/06/news-of-the-church/sharing-the-gospel-using-the-internet "Sharing the Gospel Using the Internet"], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; When speaking about other faiths, church magazines are often complimentary and focus on providing factual information rather than on sensationalizing or otherwise seeking to undermine the creeds and practices of others.&lt;ref&gt;See these articles (published in the church magazines) on various other faiths: [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/03/islam-and-mormonism-a-comparison Islam], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/04/roman-catholicism Catholicism] (see also these [http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2005/04/opening-remarks remarks] by Hinckley about the passing of Pope John Paul II),
[http://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/09/the-church-of-england The Church of England].&lt;/ref&gt;

Several presidents of the LDS Church over the years have emphasized the need for Mormons to recognize the good contributions those of other faiths make to the world.&lt;ref&gt;“We recognize the good in all churches. We recognize the value of religion generally. We say to everyone: live the teachings which you have received from your church. We invite you to come and learn from us, to see if we can add to those teachings and enhance your life and your understanding of things sacred and divine. Now we work with people of other faiths on common causes, many of them across the world. We recognize theological differences. We believe that we can disagree theologically without being disagreeable, and we hope to do so. We have been rather careful about surrendering in any way our doctrinal standards, anything of that kind as part of an ecumenical effort, but we certainly have worked with people, and do work with people, and want to work with other groups in tackling common social problems, things of that kind which are so much in need of attention these days throughout the world” (Gordon B. Hinckley, interview with Lawrence Spicer, London News Service, 28 August 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

From around the 2nd century A.D. onward (though widespread use did not really commence until the 4th or 5th centuries), most [[Christian]] denominations have used a [[crucifix]] or [[Christian cross|cross]] as a symbol of their faith. Mormons do not use the cross, although LDS military chaplains do wear the cross on their uniforms to indicate that they are Christian chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lds.org/topics/cross|title=Cross |publisher=lds.org|date=|accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation with other Christian denominations===
{{further|California Proposition 8 (2008)}}
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
Ron Rhodes asserts that, "The Mormon church has in recent years sought to downplay its exclusivism as the 'restored' church. Indeed, the Mormon church has increasingly become involved with the Interfaith movement, joining with various Christian denominations in various charities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The 10 Most Important Things You Can Say to a Mormon |first=Ron |last=Rhodes |publisher=Harvest House Publishers |year=2001 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0as2jKcboaIC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=Mormonism+Christianity+downplay#v=onepage&amp;q=Mormonism%20Christianity%20downplay&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7369-0534-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Christian denominations and the LDS Church share work in providing welfare or humanitarian aid. In recent years, the LDS Church has opened its broadcasting facilities ([[Bonneville International]]) to other Christian groups, and has participated in the VISN Religious Interfaith Cable Television Network.

===Dialogue with other Christian denominations===
There have been independent activities among individuals from both traditions who attempt to discuss openly about issues of faith.&lt;ref&gt;See Craig L. Blomberg and [[Stephen E. Robinson]], ''How Wide the Divide?: A Mormon &amp; an Evangelical in Conversation'' Inter-Varsity Press, March 1997 and{{Citation|url=http://www.standingtogether.org/dialogue.html|title=Faith Dialogue by Greg Johnson|accessdate=2006-08-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010214339/http://www.standingtogether.org/dialogue.html|archivedate=2006-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, [[Fuller Theological Seminary]] President [[Richard Mouw]], and [[Ravi Zacharias]], a well known Christian philosophical apologist, addressed a congregation of Mormons and Evangelicals gathered in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] for an event sponsored by Standing Together Ministries that was well received despite the differences they acknowledged between Mormonism and the Christian Evangelical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Carrie A.|last=Moore|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595105580,00.html |title=Evangelical preaches at Salt Lake Tabernacle |publisher=Deseret Morning News|date=|accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proselytization of other Christian denominations===
Mormons proselytize to all people, including members of other Christian churches, holding to the belief that God told Joseph Smith "that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt; that: 'they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.'"&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith, ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'', vol. 1, ch. 1. "Corrupt" here is taken to refer to their beliefs rather than personal morality. See [http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/section-30-40/section-33-declare-my-gospel "Section 33: Declare My Gospel"], ''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2002) p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because ministering to those of other Christian faiths can be a sensitive task when feelings on both sides are strong, leaders of the LDS Church have counseled members to be sensitive, to exercise caution, and to avoid contentions in their preaching. Despite the criticisms of other creeds, a tone of respect has consistently been encouraged by Mormon leaders. For example, [[Wilford Woodruff]], an early president of the church and a contemporary of Joseph Smith taught:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you go into a neighborhood to preach the Gospel, never attempt to tear down a man’s house, so to speak, before you build him a better one; never, in fact, attack any one’s religion, wherever you go. Be willing to let every man enjoy his own religion. It is his right to do that. If he does not accept your testimony with regard to the Gospel of Christ, that is his affair, and not yours. Do not spend your time in pulling down other sects and parties. We haven’t time to do that. It is never right to do that.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Contributor (LDS magazine)|The Contributor]]'', August 1895, pp. 636–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the LDS Church has been clear about its disagreements with many of the theologies and practices of other religions and seeks actively to convert all people to its own teachings, it has also always adopted a policy of toleration for others and defended the rights of all people to worship God freely.  Article 11 of the church's [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)|Articles of Faith]] written by Joseph Smith states, "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.11#10 |title=Articles of Faith|publisher=lds.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith spoke often of the need for Mormons to be civil and courteous in their treatment of others, particularly those who were not of their faith, and to be willing to defend the right of anyone to religious freedom. He said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we would secure and cultivate the love of others, we must love others, even our enemies as well as friends... I possess the principle of love. All I can offer the world is a good heart and a good hand. The Saints can testify whether I am willing to lay down my life for my brethren. If it has been demonstrated that I have been willing to die for a "Mormon", I am bold to declare before Heaven that I am just as ready to die in defending the rights of a Presbyterian, a Baptist, or a good man of any other denomination. ... It is a love of liberty which inspires my soul.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Church'', '''5''':498.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because [[Mormon missionaries]] proselytize to all, including other Christians, some Christian organizations have published tracts, brochures and books designed to counter these missionary efforts.&lt;ref&gt;"The Kingdom of the Cults" [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] (Revised 2003) [[Bethany House Publishers]], Grand Rapids Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mormonism 101" [[Bill McKeever]] &amp; Eric Johnson -Grand Rapids: [[Baker Publishing Group]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mormonism Unmasked" Phillip Roberts -Nashville: [[Broadman &amp; Holman]] 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Conciliar Press, a department of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church|Antiochian Orthodox Christian]] Archdiocese of North America, has published a brochure designed to inform Orthodox Christians of the proselytizing efforts of what it describes as "cultists" (Mormons and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]).

In 2006, the Catholic bishops in Slovakia urged all Catholics in the country not to sign a petition allowing the LDS Church to be legally recognized in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Associated Press |first=The |title=Slovakian Bishops Urge Rejection Of LDS Church|url=http://kutv.com/topstories/local_story_254185802.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926211822/http://kutv.com/topstories/local_story_254185802.html|archivedate=2007-09-26|publisher=KUTV Holdings |date=2006-09-11 |accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Vrindaban''' is an [[unincorporated area]] and an [[ISKCON]] ([[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]]) [[intentional community]] located in [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall County]], [[West Virginia]] near [[Moundsville, West Virginia|Moundsville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvrindaban.com/about-us/newvrindaban.html "About us: New Vrindaban"] official website. Retrieved 27 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The town consists of {{convert|1204|acre|km2}} (of which 0.1&amp;nbsp;km² is of water),&lt;ref&gt;Marshall County, WV Courthouse, County Assessor Records, Populated Places Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; and several building complexes, homes, apartment buildings, and businesses including the [[Sri|Sri Sri]] [[Radha]] Vrindaban [[Chandra]] Temple (RVC Temple) and Prabhupada's Palace of Gold. New Vrindaban was founded in 1968 under the direct guidance of [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of ISKCON. It is named for the Indian city of [[Vrindavan]].

[[Image:NewVrindaban-Oxen-Road.png|thumb|250px|Left|Oxen Road]]
According to the 2010 US Census, the six census blocks that make up New Vrindaban had a population of 352 and had the West Virginia status of unincorporated town. It is bordered on the north and northwest by [[Big Wheeling Creek]], on the East by [[Stull Run]], and on the southwest by the village of [[Limestone, West Virginia|Limestone]]. The town's water and sewage utilities are provided by the New Vrindaban Public Service District, and following the Marshall County Commission's road naming project all streets in New Vrindaban have been fully named. In addition to ISKCON, the town is the location of McCreary Cemetery, resting place of West Virginia pioneer [[Lewis Wetzel]]; various locally owned businesses; and other ISKCON-affiliated organizations. The chief components in New Vrindaban's economy are tourism, agriculture, and cottage industries.

The religious organization ISKCON New Vrindaban is the largest holder of land in New Vrindaban with 38% of the land.  The nonprofit organization ECO-Vrindaban, Inc. holds 14%, and all other organizations and individuals own 48% of the land encompassing New Vrindaban. In addition to the previously mentioned organizations, as of 2010 jewellery manufacturer Lone Ones Inc., organic commercial bakery World's Best Cookie, Vaishnava Performing Arts Inc., and [[Vedas|Vedic]] Heritage Trust Inc. had facilities in New Vrindaban.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall County, WV Courthouse, County Assessor Records, 2010 Webster District Tax Map 1 and 2 Parcel Data&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:KrishnaTemple1997.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sri Sri Radha Vrindavan Chandra Temple, at Temple of Understanding Circle Drive, July 1997.]]
The community was founded in 1968 by [[Kirtanananda Swami]] and Hayagriva Das, two early disciples of [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krishnapath.org/eBooks/The-Hare-Krishna-Explosion.pdf |title=The Hare Krishna Explosion |last1=Dasa |first1=Hayagriva |date=1986 |publisher=Palace Press |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Vrindaban developed under the guidance of Kirtanananda Swami (honored as "Srila Bhaktipada" after March 1979), and by the mid-1970s the live-in population had grown to over 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluralism.org/affiliates/emery/Rise_Fall_Rebuilding.pdf |last1=Brugger|first1=Rachael |last2=Cappello |first2=Cydney |title=The Rise, Fall, and Rebuilding of New Vrindaban|publisher=Ohio University Global Leadership Center|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s the population was more than 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/us/swami-bhaktipada-ex-hare-krishna-leader-dies-at-74.html |title=Swami Bhaktipada, Ex-Hare Krishna Leader, Dies at 74 |last1=Fox |first1=Margalit |date=24 October 2011 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISKCON New Vrindaban is strictly [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and believes that meat consumption creates negative [[karma]]. [[Alcoholic beverages]] and [[illegal substances]] (such as drugs) are prohibited in the main holy sites around the Temple of Understanding Circle Drive.&lt;ref&gt;Welcome sign at entrance to Temple of Understanding Circle Drive&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ISKCON News, on 4 July 1983 [[Vedavyasa Priya Swami]] installed the statue of [[Shrinathji|Sri Nathji]] at the RVC Temple.&lt;ref&gt;26 July 2008 [http://news.iskcon.com/node/1165/2008-07-26/sri_nathji_transcendental_cowherd_boy_goes_west Sri Nathji: The Transcendental Cowherd Boy Goes West] ISKCON News, Retrieved on 18 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, according to Gargarishi Das, the deity was not installed by Vedavyasa Priya, but was installed instead by [[Kirtanananda Swami]].&lt;ref&gt;Gargarishi Das, “Radha-Vrindaban Chandra Festival,” Brijabasi Spirit, vol. X, no. IV (c. August 1983), 17.{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 1986, a census report showed 377 adults living at the community.&lt;ref&gt;This is confirmed by the New Vrindaban offering in the 1986 Srila Prabhupada Vyasa-puja book—"Sri Vyasa-puja 1986: The Most Blessed Event, August 28, 1986, The Appearance Day of Our Beloved Spiritual Master His Divine Grace Om Visnupada Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya Astottara-sata Sri Srimad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness"—which listed the names of each resident of the community. Disciples of Srila Prabhupada: 104 men, 66 women; Granddisciples: 99 men, 91 women; Varnasrama College: 17; Children 212. This was probably the year of greatest population for the community.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 1987, during their annual meeting at [[Mayapur]], India, the ISKCON [[Governing Body Commission]] expelled Kirtanananda from the society for "moral and theological deviations."&lt;ref&gt;

After Kirtanananda Swami left New Vrindaban, and new leadership stabilized, the community was readmitted to ISKCON in 1998.&lt;ref name="Houser"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_448949.html |title=Hare Krishnas are rebuilding their temple |last1=Houser |first1=Mark |date=30 April 2006 |publisher=[[The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James R.

==Prabhupada's Palace of Gold==
[[File:Palaceanddevotees 1982.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prabhupada's Palace of Gold and Hare Krishna devotees, c. 1982.]]
Originally intended in 1972 to be a residence for [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], the founder-[[acharya]] of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON),&lt;ref name="Prabhupada 1982"&gt;''{{cite book |title=Prabhupada's Palace of Gold: A Labor of Love |author=New Vrindaban Community |date=1986 |publisher=Palace Press, Moundsville, West Virginia |access-date=January 23, 2016}}''&lt;/ref&gt; the plans evolved after Prabhupada's death in November 1977 for an ornate [[palace]] of [[marble]], [[gold]] and carved [[teakwood]], which was dedicated as a memorial shrine on September 2, 1979. [[Kirtanananda Swami]], the leader of the New Vrindaban community, and Bhagavatananda das, the community's principal architect and sculptor, were the two primary forces behind its design and construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/can-hare-krishnas-at-palace-of-gold-in-wva-rebuild-its-tarnished-community/2013/01/04/38dbf6a8-ebc8-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html?utm_term=.3a93b7f7c8d5|title=Can Hare Krishnas at Palace of Gold in W.Va. rebuild its tarnished community?|last=McCarthy|first=Ellen|date=January 2013|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iskconnews.org/restoration-work-underway-at-srila-prabhupadas-palace-of-gold,4241|title=Restoration Work Underway at Srila Prabhupada’s Palace of Gold|last=Smullen|first=Madhava|date=January 2014|website=ISKCON News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It reportedly cost $600,000 in materials, and the labor was donated by the devotees.&lt;ref name="Prabhupada 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brijabasispirit.com/2014/01/19/prabhupadas-palace-of-gold-back-to-godhead-article-july-1981/ |title=In the Hills of West Virginia |last1=Dasa |first1=Yogesvara |date=July 1981 |website=New Vrindaban Brijabasi Spirit, The ISKCON New Vrindaban Blog |access-date=January 23, 2016 |quote=Prabhupada’s Palace of Gold – Back To Godhead Article – July 1981.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The unpaid workers were often untrained and learned on the job.&lt;ref&gt;"In the process of building the Palace our devotees have become expert in so many arts and crafts; many which we never before thought possible. The labor on the Palace—truly a labor of love—has been done completely by the devotees of New Vrindaban, without any remuneration except for the highest; that is, developing one's spiritual consciousness, knowing that one's efforts are being devoted solely for the pleasure of Krishna and the spiritual master." Damodar Pandit Das, "Scenes from Prabhupada's Palace," ''Brijabasi Spirit'', vol. 4, no. 7 (October 1977), 8.{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirtanananda explained, "In the beginning, we didn't even know how to lay blocks. As our Krishna consciousness developed, our building skills developed, then our creativity developed, and the scope of the project developed."&lt;ref&gt;Kirtanananda Swami, cited by Edward Schumacher, "West Virginia Marvels at Indian Palace," ''The New York Times'' (Monday, September 3, 1979).{{verification needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prabhupada's Palace of Gold opened in 1979 to positive reviews.&lt;ref name="Edward Schumacher 1979"&gt;Edward Schumacher, "West Virginia Marvels at Indian Palace," ''The New York Times'' (Monday, September 3, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lynn Darling 1979"&gt;Lynn Darling, "Krishna Land," ''The Washington Post'' (Monday, September 3, 1979), D1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krishna 1980"&gt;"Children of Krishna: Seeking heaven in West Virginia," ''The Courier-Journal Magazine'' (Sunday, February 10, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; CBS [[PM Magazine]] reported, "the magnificence of the Palace of Gold would be hard to exaggerate." [[Life magazine]] called the Palace "a place where tourists can come and be amazed."&lt;ref&gt;Hillary Johnson, "Children of a Harsh Bliss: In a West Virginia Commune, an Extraordinary Look at Life and Love Among the Krishnas," ''Life'' (April 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The New York Times]] proclaimed "Welcome to Heaven."&lt;ref name="Edward Schumacher 1979"/&gt; [[The Washington Post]] called the palace "Almost Heaven."&lt;ref name="Lynn Darling 1979"/&gt; [[The Courier-Journal]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] stated, "It's hard to believe that Prabhupada's Palace is in West Virginia. In fact, it's hard to believe it's on this planet."&lt;ref name="Krishna 1980"/&gt;

Beginning in the early 1990s lack of sufficient financial resources caused palace maintenance to be neglected; nevertheless, as of 2008, 50,000 tourists and [[Hindu]] pilgrims reportedly continued to visit each year.&lt;ref name="Pulliam"/&gt; Since mid-2011, an ambitious five-year, $4.27m restoration effort has been underway to restore and renew the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palaceofgold.com/history.html |title=Palace History |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!-- Undated. --&gt; |website=Palace of Gold at New Vrindaban |access-date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''One Thousand and One Nights''''' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة|ʾAlf layla wa-layla}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=3rd|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|year=2007|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of [[Middle East]]ern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. It is often known in English as the '''''Arabian Nights''''', from the first English-language edition (c. 1706 – c. 1721), which rendered the title as ''The Arabian Nights' Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;See illustration of title page of Grub St Edition in Yamanaka and Nishio (p. 225)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West, Central, and South Asia and North Africa. Some tales themselves trace their roots back to ancient and medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Greek literature|Greek]], [[Sanskrit literature|Indian]], [[Jewish literature|Jewish]] and [[Turkish literature|Turkish]]&lt;ref name="Marzolph2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Marzolph|title=The Arabian Nights in Transnational Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tknULXNl21oC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2007|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-3287-0|pages=183–}}&lt;/ref&gt; folklore and literature. In particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the  [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk eras]], while others, especially the frame story, are most probably drawn from the [[Middle Persian literature#"Pahlavi" literature|Pahlavi Persian work]]  ''Hezār Afsān'' ({{lang-fa|هزار افسان}}, lit. ''A Thousand Tales''), which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

What is common throughout all the editions of the ''Nights'' is the initial [[frame story]] of the ruler [[Shahryār]] and his wife [[Scheherazade]] and the [[framing device]] incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single [[couplet]]s or [[quatrain]]s, although some are longer.

Some of the stories commonly associated with ''The Nights'', in particular "[[Aladdin|Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp]]", "[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]", and "[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]", were not part of ''The Nights'' in its original Arabic versions but were added to the collection by [[Antoine Galland]] and other European translators.&lt;ref&gt;John Payne, ''Alaeddin and the Enchanted Lamp and Other Stories'', (London 1901) gives details of Galland's encounter with 'Hanna' in 1709 and of the discovery in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris of two Arabic manuscripts containing Aladdin and two more of the added tales.

The main [[frame story]] concerns Shahryār  ({{lang-ar|شهريار}}, from [[Middle Persian]] ''šahr-dār'', lit. "holder of realm"&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ch. Pellat|title=Alf Layla Wa Layla|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla|year=2011|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whom the narrator calls a "[[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king" ruling in "India and China".&lt;ref&gt;''The Arabian Nights'', translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons (Penguin Classics, 2008), vol. 1, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonour him. Eventually the [[vizier]], whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. [[Scheherazade]] ({{lang-ar|شهرزاد}}, from Middle Persian ''čehr'', "lineage" + ''āzād'', "noble"&lt;ref name=iranica/&gt;&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Hamori, A. |title=S̲h̲ahrazād| year= 2012 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6771}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.

The tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s, and various forms of [[erotica]]. Numerous stories depict [[jinn]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[ape]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-3sindbad.htm The Third Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman – The Arabian Nights – The Thousand and One Nights – Sir Richard Burton translator].

Common [[protagonist]]s include the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]], in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.

[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|left|180px|An Abbasid [[manuscript]] of the ''One Thousand and One Nights'']]
The different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.

The narrator's standards for what constitutes a [[cliffhanger]] seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of [[Islamic philosophy]], and in one case during a detailed description of [[Medicine in medieval Islam#Human anatomy and physiology|human anatomy]] according to [[Galen]]—and in all these cases turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.

==History: versions and translations==
The history of the ''Nights'' is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] summarises their findings:

{{quote|In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the ''Nights'' by [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from [[India]] and [[Persia]]. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title ''Alf Layla'', or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it—among them some tales about the [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Possible Indian influence===
Devices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.271"&gt;Reynolds p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Indian folklore is represented in the ''Nights'' by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit fables]]. The influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' is particularly notable.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Richard F. (2002). ''Vikram and the Vampire Or Tales of Hindu Devilry'' p. xi. Adamant Media Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jataka tales|The Jataka Tales]]'' are a collection of 547 [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist stories]], which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. ''The Tale of the Bull and the Ass'' and the linked ''Tale of the Merchant and his Wife'' are found in the frame stories of both the ''Jataka'' and the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the influence of the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the ''Tantropakhyana''. Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of this work exist, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil,&lt;ref&gt;Artola.

Bandoeng. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The frame story is particularly interesting, as it follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king—although the basis of the collection of stories is from the ''Panchatantra''—with its original Indian setting.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Warder. ''Indian Kāvya Literature: The art of storytelling, Volume VI''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers. 1992. pp. 61–62, 76–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Panchatantra'' and various tales from ''Jatakas'' were first translated into Persian by [[Borzūya]] in 570 CE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=106622 IIS.ac.uk Dr Fahmida Suleman, "Kalila wa Dimna"], in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization, An Encyclopaedia'', Vol. II, pp. 432–33, ed. Josef W. Meri, New York-London: Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; they were later translated into Arabic by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa'|Ibn al-Muqaffa]] in 750 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Fables of Kalila and Dimnah'', translated from the Arabic by Saleh Sa'adeh Jallad, 2002. Melisende, London, {{ISBN|1-901764-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Kalilah and Dimnah; or, The fables of Bidpai; being an account of their literary history, [https://archive.org/stream/kalilahdimnahorf00bdpkuoft#page/n19/mode/2up p. xiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian prototype: ''Hezār Afsān''===
[[File:Kelileh va Demneh.jpg|thumb|right|A page from Kelileh va Demneh dated 1429, from Herat, a Persian version of the Panchatantra – depicts the manipulative jackal-vizier, Dimna, trying to lead his lion-king into war.]]
The earliest mentions of the ''Nights'' refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, ''Hezār Afsān'' (or ''Afsaneh'' or ''Afsana''), meaning "The Thousand Stories". In the 10th century [[Ibn al-Nadim]] compiled a catalogue of books (the "Fihrist") in Baghdad. He noted that the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] kings of Iran enjoyed "evening tales and fables".&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian ''Hezār Afsān'', explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night; finally one concubine had the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king would delay her execution.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection's literary quality, observing that "it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century [[Al-Masudi]] also refers to the ''Hezār Afsān'', saying the Arabic translation is called ''Alf Khurafa'' ("A Thousand Entertaining Tales") but is generally known as ''Alf Layla'' ("A Thousand Nights"). He mentions the characters Shirāzd (Scheherazade) and Dināzād.&lt;ref name="Irwin p.49"&gt;Irwin p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

No physical evidence of the ''Hezār Afsān'' has survived,&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.271"/&gt; so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51: "It seems probable from all the above [...] that the Persian ''Hezār Afsaneh'' was translated into Arabic in the eighth or early 9th century and was given the title ''Alf Khurafa'' before being subsequently retitled ''Alf Layla''. However, it remains far from clear what the connection is between this fragment of the early text and the ''Nights'' stories as they have survived in later and fuller manuscripts; nor how the Syrian manuscripts related to later Egyptian versions."&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Sallis ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 2 and note 6&lt;/ref&gt; These stories include the cycle of "King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas" and "The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son" (derived from the 7th-century Persian ''Bakhtiyārnāma'').&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] scholar [[Safa Khulusi]] suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer [[Ibn al-Muqaffa']] may have been responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, ''Studies in Comparative Literature and Western Literary Schools,'' Chapter: ''Qisas Alf Laylah wa Laylah'' (''One thousand and one Nights''), pp. 15–85. Al-Rabita Press, Baghdad, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safa Khulusi, The Influence of Ibn al-Muqaffa' on The Arabian Nights. ''Islamic Review'', Dec 1960, pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Books.google.com.pk. Retrieved on 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the mid-20th century, the scholar [[Nabia Abbott]] found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title ''The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights'', dating from the 9th century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the ''Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' appears in Cairo in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Irwin p.50"&gt;Irwin p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:

{{quote|Some of the earlier Persian tales may have survived within the Arabic tradition altered such that Arabic Muslim names and new locations were substituted for pre-Islamic Persian ones, but it is also clear that whole cycles of Arabic tales were eventually added to the collection and apparently replaced most of the Persian materials. One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century Baghdad, including the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (died 809), his vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]] (d. 803) and the licentious poet [[Abu Nuwas]] (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Reynolds p.270"&gt;Reynolds p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition includes the oldest manuscripts; these versions are also much shorter and include fewer tales. It is represented in print by the so-called ''Calcutta I'' (1814–1818) and most notably by the ''Leiden edition'' (1984), which is based above all on the ''[[Antoine Galland|Galland]] manuscript''. It is believed to be the purest expression of the style of the mediaeval ''Arabian Nights''.&lt;ref name=beaustyle&gt;Beaumont, Daniel. Literary Style and Narrative Technique in the Arabian Nights. p. 1. In The Arabian nights encyclopedia, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irwstyle&gt;Irwin, Robert. 2004. The Arabian nights: a companion. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written,&lt;ref name=sallis/&gt;&lt;!--p.32--&gt; and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries, perhaps in order to attain the eponymous number of 1001 nights. The final product of this tradition, the so-called [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] Egyptian [[Recension]], does contain 1001 nights and is reflected in print, with slight variations, by the editions known as the ''Bulaq'' (1835) and the ''Macnaghten'' or ''Calcutta II'' (1839–1842).

All extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=John|title=The Book Of Thousand Nights And One Night Vol-ix|date=1901|location=London|pages=289|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.172872|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more "authentic" and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as [[Muhsin Mahdi]] have suspected that this may have been caused in part by European demand for a "complete version"; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.&lt;ref name=sallis&gt;[[Eva Sallis|Sallis, Eva]]. 1999.

===Modern translations===
{{main|Translations of One Thousand and One Nights}}
[[File:William-Strang-Sindbad-AliBaba-titlepage.JPG|thumb|''Sinbad the sailor and Ali Baba and the forty thieves'' by [[William Strang]], 1896]]
The first European version (1704–1717) was translated into [[French language|French]] by [[Antoine Galland]] from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, ''[[Les mille et une nuits|Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français]]'' ("The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French"), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. "Aladdin's Lamp", and "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from a [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]] [[Christian]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], a [[Maronite]] scholar whom he called "Hanna Diab." Galland's version of the ''Nights'' was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.

As scholars were looking for the presumed "complete" and "original" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the "standard version". The first translations of this kind, such as that of [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were [[bowdlerized]]. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882, nine volumes), and then by [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], entitled ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885, ten volumes)&amp;nbsp;– the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=sallis2/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. The Arabian nights encyclopedia, Volume 1. pp. 506–08&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;) and the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'', which were printed between 1886 and 1888.  It has, however, been criticized for its "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on sexuality" (and has even been called an "eccentric [[wiktionary:ego-trip|ego-trip]]" and a "highly personal reworking of the text").&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt;

Later versions of the ''Nights'' include that of the [[French people|French]] doctor [[J. C. Mardrus]], issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by [[Powys Mathers]], and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.&lt;ref name=sallis2&gt;Sallis, Eva. 1999. Sheherazade through the looking glass: the metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights. pp. 4 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable recent version, which reverts to the [[Syria]]n recension, is a critical edition based on the 14th- or 15th-century [[Syria]]n manuscript in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], originally used by Galland. This version, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by [[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1984) and rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a "definitive" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the [[Mamluk]] period (a view that remains contentious).&lt;ref name=sallis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Dobie, 2009. Translation in the contact zone: Antoine Galland's Mille et une nuits: contes arabes. p. 37.

The Arabian nights: a companion. pp. 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of "the only ''real'' Arabian Nights" recognize it as being the best source on the original ''style'' and linguistic form of the mediaeval work&lt;ref name=beaustyle/&gt;&lt;ref name=irwstyle/&gt; and praise the Haddawy translation as "very readable" and "strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic flavour of those tales".&lt;ref name=irw/&gt; An additional second volume of ''Arabian nights'' translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales ''not'' present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995.

In 2008 a new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in three volumes. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton's. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called "orphan stories" of ''[[Aladdin]]'' and ''[[Ali Baba]]'' as well as an alternative ending to ''The seventh journey of [[Sindbad]]'' from [[Antoine Galland]]'s original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, "[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text," and the work is a "representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pen.org/blog/?p=4056 PEN American Center]. Pen.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation.

==Literary themes and techniques==
[[File:Thousand_and_One_Nights_21.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' by [[Sani ol Molk]], Iran, 1853]]

The ''One Thousand and One Nights'' and various tales within it make use of many innovative [[literary technique]]s, which the storytellers of the tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions.&lt;ref name=Heath/&gt; Some of these date back to earlier [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Indian literature|Indian]] and [[Arabic literature]], while others were original to the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.

===Frame story===
An early example of the [[frame story]], or [[framing device]], is employed in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', in which the character [[Scheherazade]] narrates a set of tales (most often [[fairy tale]]s) to the Sultan [[Shahrayar|Shahriyar]] over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales are also frame stories, such as the ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman]]'' being a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

===Embedded narrative===
An early example of the "[[story within a story]]" technique can be found in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' of ancient [[Sanskrit literature]]. The ''Nights'', however, improved on the ''Panchatantra'' in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the ''Panchatantra'', stories are introduced as [[Didacticism|didactic]] analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase "If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you." In the ''Nights'', this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Within the "Sinbad the Sailor" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as "[[The Three Apples]]" and "[[#Unreliable narrator|The Seven Viziers]]". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, "[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]", the "Tale of the Wazir and the Sage [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Duban|Duban]]" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.

===Dramatic visualization===
Dramatic visualization is "the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience". This technique dates back to the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360/&gt; An example of this is the tale of "The Three Apples" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

===Fate and destiny===
A common [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in many ''Arabian Nights'' tales is [[wiktionary:fate|fate]] and [[destiny]]. The [[Italian people|Italian]] filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|every tale in ''The Thousand and One Nights'' begins with an 'appearance of destiny' which manifests itself through an anomaly, and one anomaly always generates another. So a chain of anomalies is set up. And the more logical, tightly knit, essential this chain is, the more beautiful the tale. By 'beautiful' I mean vital, absorbing and exhilarating. The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to normality. The end of every tale in ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' consists of a 'disappearance' of destiny, which sinks back to the [[somnolence]] of daily life ... The protagonist of the stories is in fact destiny itself.}}

Though invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot devices often used to present this theme are [[coincidence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Retrocausality|reverse causation]] and the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] below). {{Clear}}

===Foreshadowing===
[[File:The Valley of Diamonds by Maxfield Parrish.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sinbad|Sindbad]] and the Valley of Diamonds, from the Second Voyage.]]

Early examples of the [[foreshadowing]] technique of [[repetitive designation]], now known as "[[Chekhov's gun]]", occur in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which contains "repeated references to some character or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [359]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example is in the tale of "The Three Apples" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

Another early foreshadowing technique is ''formal patterning'', "the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds". This technique is also found in ''One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360/&gt;

Another form of foreshadowing is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], which dates back to the story of [[Krishna]] in ancient [[Sanskrit literature]], and [[Oedipus]] or the death of [[Heracles]] in the plays of [[Sophocles]]. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in [[Arabic literature]] (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Bible]]). Several tales in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Foreshadowing|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]" and [[Paulo Coelho]]'s "[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]"; [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' collection of short stories ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]'' featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as "The Story Of The Two Dreamers."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "The Tale of Attaf", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]'' [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'afar, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the tale, Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he didn't commit but Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''[[Disciplina Clericalis]]'',&lt;ref name=Marzolph-109&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the "[[Seven Wise Masters|Sindibad]]" story cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 14th century, a version of "The Tale of Attaf" also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref name=Marzolph-109/&gt;

===Repetition===
[[File:One_Thousand_and_One_Nights26.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''One Thousand and One Nights'' by [[Sani ol molk]], Iran, 1849–1856]]

''[[Leitwortstil]]'' is 'the purposeful [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]] of words' in a given literary piece that "usually expresses a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] or [[Theme (literature)|theme]] important to the given story". This device occurs in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which binds several tales in a story cycle. The storytellers of the tales relied on this technique "to shape the constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole."&lt;ref name=Heath&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thematic patterning]] is "the distribution of recurrent [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] concepts and moralistic [[Motif (literature)|motifs]] among the various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in common". This technique also dates back to the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' (and earlier).&lt;ref name=Heath-360&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–60 [360]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different variants of the "[[Cinderella]]" story, which has its origins in the Egyptian story of [[Rhodopis]], appear in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', including "The Second Shaykh's Story", "The Eldest Lady's Tale" and "Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, "Judar and His Brethren", departs from the [[happy ending]]s of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a [[Tragedy|tragic]] ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual humour===
The ''Nights'' contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this borders on [[satire]], as in the tale called "Ali with the Large Member" which pokes fun at obsession with [[human penis size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ali with the Large Member" is only in the [[Wortley Montague manuscript]] (1764), which is in the [[Bodleian Library]], and is not found in Burton or any of the other standard translations. (Ref: ''Arabian Nights Encyclopedia'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unreliable narrator===
The literary device of the [[unreliable narrator]] was used in several fictional medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic tales]] of the ''One Thousand and One Nights''. In one tale, "The Seven Viziers" (also known as "Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs"), a [[courtesan]] accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the [[Qur'an]]ic/[[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]]/[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]). Seven [[vizier]]s attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds back by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate [[suspense]] in "The Three Apples" and [[humor]] in "The Hunchback's Tale" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).

===Crime fiction elements===
[[File:Godefroy Durand - Morgiane.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicting [[Morgiana]] and the thieves from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]''.]]
An example of the [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thriller]] genres in the collection, with multiple [[plot twist]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[detective fiction]] elements&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=91, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "[[The Three Apples]]", also known as ''Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula'' ("The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman"),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.
In this tale, [[Harun al-Rashid]] comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]], three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.
Harun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan.  Thus the mystery is solved.

Another ''Nights'' tale with [[crime fiction]] elements was "The Hunchback's Tale" story cycle which, unlike "The Three Apples", was more of a [[suspense]]ful [[comedy]] and [[Legal drama|courtroom drama]] rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite [[comedian]], being invited to dinner by a [[tailor]] couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Jewish doctor]]'s [[Bimaristan|clinic]] and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the "Tale of the Jewish Doctor", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a [[courtroom]], all making [[Unreliable narrator|different claims]] over how the hunchback had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of "The Tale of Attaf" (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] above).

===Horror fiction elements===
[[Haunting]] is used as a [[plot device]] in [[gothic fiction]] and [[horror fiction]], as well as modern [[paranormal fiction]]. Legends about [[haunted house]]s have long appeared in literature. In particular, the ''Arabian Nights'' tale of "Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad" revolves around a house haunted by [[Genie|jinns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East &amp; West|last=Yuriko Yamanaka|first=Tetsuo Nishio|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]]|year=2006|isbn=1-85043-768-8|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nights'' is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions [[ghoul]]s, and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story ''The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib'' (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib''|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221142538/http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-date=December 21, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horror fiction elements are also found in "The City of Brass" tale, which revolves around a [[ghost town]].&lt;ref name=Hamori&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [10]}} The hero of the tale is an historical person, [[Musa bin Nusayr]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The horrific nature of [[Scheherazade]]'s situation is magnified in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the ''Nights'' on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. As a child, he was fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he attributes some of his creations to his love of the ''1001 Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Necronomicon Files: The Truth Behind Lovecraft's Legend|first=John Wisdom Gonce, John Wisdom Gonce, III|last=Daniel Harms|publisher=Weiser|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57863-269-5|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantasy and science fiction elements===
[[File:More tales from the Arabian nights-14566176968.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the ''story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Paribanou'', ''More tales from the Arabian nights'' by Willy Pogany (1915)]] Several stories within the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' feature early [[science fiction]] elements. One example is "The Adventures of Bulukiya", where the [[protagonist]] Bulukiya's quest for the [[Elixir of life|herb of immortality]] leads him to explore the seas, journey to [[Paradise]] and to [[Hell]], and travel across the [[cosmos]] to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of [[Galaxy|galactic]] science fiction;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B.

In another ''1001 Nights'' tale, "Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of [[primitive communism]] where concepts like money and clothing do not exist.

===Poetry===

There is an abundance of [[Arabic poetry]] in ''One Thousand and One Nights''. Characters occasionally provide poetry in certain settings, covering many uses. However, pleading, beseeching and praising the powerful is the most significant.

The uses would include but are not limited to:
* Giving advice, warning, and solutions.
* Praising God, royalties and those in power.
* Pleading for mercy and forgiveness.
* Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck.
* Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges.
* Criticizing elements of life, wondering.
* Expressing feelings to others or one's self: happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise, anger.

In a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/1001nights/burton/kamar.htm Burton Nights].

The influence of the versions of ''The Nights'' on world literature is immense. Writers as diverse as [[Henry Fielding]] to [[Naguib Mahfouz]] have alluded to the collection by name in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the ''Nights'' include [[John Barth]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Walter Scott]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], [[Wilkie Collins]], [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], [[Charles Nodier|Nodier]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Marcel Schwob]], [[Stendhal]], [[Alexandre Dumas|Dumas]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Arthur de Gobineau|Gobineau]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]], [[William Butler Yeats|W.

Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]]. Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further "long ago" or farther "far away"; this process culminates in the [[fantasy world]] having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from [[Arabian mythology]] are now common in modern [[fantasy]], such as [[genie]]s, [[bahamut]]s, [[magic carpet]]s, magic lamps, etc. When [[L. Frank Baum]] proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.&lt;ref&gt;James Thurber, "The Wizard of Chitenango", p. 64 ''Fantasists on Fantasy'' edited by Robert H. Boyer and Kenneth J. Zahorski, {{ISBN|0-380-86553-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Arab culture===
There is little evidence that the ''Nights'' was particularly treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as ''khurafa'' (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children). According to Robert Irwin, "Even today, with the exception of certain writers and academics, the ''Nights'' is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ''Nights'' have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] (author of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] play ''Shahrazad'', 1934), [[Taha Hussein]] (''Scheherazade's Dreams'', 1943)&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'', 1981).

===Possible early influence on European literature===
Although the first known translation into a European language only appeared in 1704, it is possible that the ''Nights'' began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]]'s story collection ''[[El Conde Lucanor]]'' and [[Ramón Llull]]'s ''The Book of Beasts''.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 92–94&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the ''Nights'' are found in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (in ''[[The Squire's Tale]]'' the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Echoes in [[Giovanni Sercambi]]'s ''Novelle'' and [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 96–99&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the [[Balkans]] and a translation of the ''Nights'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western literature from the 18th century onwards===
[[File:CC No 08 Arabian Nights.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Classic Comics]]'' issue #8]]

The modern fame of the ''Nights'' derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], Galland "played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the ''Nights''."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for ''contes de fées'' ("fairy stories"). This fashion began with the publication of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]'s ''Histoire d'Hypolite'' in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the ''Nights'', with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the ''Nights'' spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds pp. 279–81&lt;/ref&gt; Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include [[Antoine Hamilton|Anthony Hamilton]]'s ''Les quatre Facardins'' (1730), [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon|Crébillon]]'s ''[[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|Le sopha]]'' (1742) and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels|Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 238–41&lt;/ref&gt; The English versions of the "Oriental Tale" generally contained a heavy moralising element,&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p.242&lt;/ref&gt; with the notable exception of [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s fantasy ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the [[Gothic novel]]. The Polish nobleman [[Jan Potocki]]'s novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the ''Nights'' with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin pp. 245–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] (when an apprentice) to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725. Andrew Millar Project. University of Edinburgh.|website=www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nights'' continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to [[A. S. Byatt]], "In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational."&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (Harvard University Press, 2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In their autobiographical writings, both [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Thomas de Quincey|de Quincey]] refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Wordsworth in Book Five of ''[[The Prelude]]''; Tennyson in his poem "Recollections of the ''Arabian Nights''". (Irwin, pp. 266–69)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the ''Nights'' pervades the opening of his last novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;Irwin p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,&lt;ref name="Byatt p.168"&gt;Byatt p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Théophile Gautier]] (''La mille deuxième nuit'', 1842)&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica"/&gt; and [[Joseph Roth]] (''Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht'', 1939).&lt;ref name="Byatt p.168"/&gt; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote  "[[The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade]]" (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.

Another important literary figure, the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[W. B. Yeats]] was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, [[A Vision]] an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of [[Harun Al-Rashid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/readingeurope/content/ire/NatLibIre_01.pdf|title=The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems by William Butler Yeats|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to his joint experiments with his wife [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], with [[Automatic writing]]. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as "a gift" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Qusta Ibn Luqa]], who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=y5GuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dLo_n9bRYO&amp;sig=OToXfH6YbmgQJu_iRanmQ3ROub4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF2ZnxhOPSAhUCzRQKHQrbAuQQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&amp;f=false|title=In Excited Reverie: Centenary Tribute to W.B.

===Cinema and television===

==Ahmadis==

{{Main|Persecution of Ahmadiyya}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and "heretics" since they are accused of not believing in the finality of [[Prophets in Islam|prophethood]] since the death of [[Muhammad]]. Armed groups, led by the umbrella organization [[Khatme Nabuwwat]] ("Finality of Prophethood"), have launched violent attacks against their mosques in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Breach of Faith|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/bangladesh0605/|publisher=Hrw.org|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They committed massacres against them which resulted in 2,000 Ahmadiyya deaths in Pakistani Punjab. Eventually, martial law had to be established and Governor general Ghulam Mohamed dismissed the federal cabinet. This anti-Ahmadiyya movement led Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to declare that the Ahmadiyyas were "non-Muslims".&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+pk0121) Jamaat-i-Islami] Federal Research Division US Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml Persecution of the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan: An Analysis Under International Law and International Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Government of [[Pakistan]], under General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], passed [[Ordinance XX]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/paklaw.html Ordinance XX]&lt;/ref&gt; which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as [[Muslim]]s. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] migrated to London, UK.

==Ajlafs and Arzals==

{{Main|Caste system among South Asian Muslims}}
Despite [[Islam]]'s egalitarian tenets,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} units of social stratification, termed as "castes" by many, have developed among Muslims in some parts of South Asia.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042918 "Islamic caste."] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 Oct. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;[[John Burton-Page|Burton-Page, J.]], [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-2884 Hindū], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. Edited by: [[Peri Bearman|P. Bearman]], Th. Bianquis, [[C. E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and [[W. P. Heinrichs]]. Brill, 2006. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been put forward regarding the development of castes among Indian Muslims. Majority of  sources state that the castes among Muslims developed as the result of close contact with Hindu culture and Hindu converts to Islam,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh (A Study of Culture Contact), Ghaus Ansari, Lucknow, 1960, Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikand"&gt;{{cite web|last = Singh Sikand|first = Yoginder|title = Caste in Indian Muslim Society|publisher = Hamdard University|url = http://stateless.freehosting.net/Caste%20in%20Indian%20Muslim%20Society.htm|accessdate = 18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while few others feel that these developed based on claims of descent from Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Alvi"&gt;Sajida Sultana Alvi, Advice on the art of governance, an Indo-Islamic Mirror for Princes P122, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-88706-918-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imtiaz"&gt;Ahmad, Imtiaz, "The Ashraf-Ajlaf dichotomy in Muslim social structure in India", Indian economic and social history review 33 (1966) pgs 268-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections of the ulema (scholars of Islamic jurisprudence) have declared the religious legitimacy of the caste system with the help of the concept of kafa'a{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. A classic example of scholarly literature supporting the Muslim caste system is the ''Fatawa-i Jahandari'', written by the 14th century Turkish scholar, Ziauddin Barani, a member of the court of  [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]], of the Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Barani was known for his intensely casteist views, and he regarded the Ashraf Muslims as racially superior to the Ajlaf Muslims{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

He divided the Muslims into grades and sub-grades. In his scheme, all high positions and privileges were to be a monopoly of the high born Turks, not the Indian Muslims{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Even in his interpretation of the Koranic verse "Indeed, the pious amongst you are most honored by Allah", he considered piety to be associated with noble birth.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt; Barrani was specific in his recommendation that the "sons of Mohamed" [i.e. Ashrafs] "be given a higher social status than the low-born [i.e. Ajlaf].&lt;ref name="Das_138_139"&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|pp=138-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most significant contribution in the fatwa was his analysis of the castes with respect to Islam.&lt;ref name="Das2"&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assertion was that castes would be mandated through state laws or "Zawabi" which would carry precedence over [[Sharia]] law whenever they were in conflict.&lt;ref name="Das2"/&gt;

In the Fatwa-i-Jahandari (advice XXI), he wrote about the "qualities of the high-born" as being "virtuous" and the "low-born" as being the "custodians of vices". Every act which is "contaminated with meanness and based on ignominy, comes elegantly [from the Ajlaf]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barani had a clear disdain for the Ajlaf and strongly recommended that they be denied education, lest they usurp the Ashraf masters{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. He sought appropriate religious sanction to that effect.&lt;ref name="Sikand"/&gt; Barrani also developed an elaborate system of promotion and demotion of Imperial officers ("Wazirs") that was conducted primarily on the basis of caste.&lt;ref name="Das_138_139"/&gt;

In addition to the Ashraf/Ajlaf divide, there is also the ''Arzal'' caste among Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36220329|title=Why are many Indian Muslims seen as untouchable?}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose members were regarded by anti-Caste activists like Babasaheb [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] as the equivalent of untouchables.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book |last = Ambedkar |first = Bhimrao |authorlink = B.R. Ambedkar |title = Pakistan or the Partition of India |publisher =  Thackers Publishers  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambedkaronline"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html Web resource for ''Pakistan or the Partition of India'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Arzal" stands for "degraded" and the Arzal castes are further subdivided into Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, Mehtar etc.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambedkaronline"/&gt; The Arzal group was recorded in the 1901 census in India and its members are also called [[Dalit]] Muslims "with whom no other Muhammadan would associate, and who are forbidden to enter the mosque or to use the public burial ground"{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.They are relegated to "menial" professions such as scavenging and carrying [[night soil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/12109.html Dereserve these myths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516075059/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/12109.html |date=2008-05-16 }} by Tanweer Fazal,''Indian express''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alawites==

The [[Alawites]] are a secretive group that believe in the divine nature of [[Ali]], the cousin of [[Muhammad]].  They have been persecuted in the past and survive in the remote and more mountainous parts of [[Syria]].  The ruling [[Ba'ath]] party is dominated by Alawis ([[President of Syria|President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] is Alawi himself) and they have sought fatwas from Shiite clergy in [[Lebanon]] declaring that they are, in fact, Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/lebanon/religious-sects.htm Lebanon - Religious Sects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutazilites==

In medieval Iraq, the [[Mu'tazili]] theological movement was made a state doctrine in 832, igniting the [[Mihna]] (ordeal) a struggle over the application of Greek logical proof of the Qu'ran; people who would not accept Mu'tazili claims that the Qur'an was created rather than eternal were sometimes persecuted.  The most famous victims of the Mihna were [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] who was imprisoned and tortured, and the judge Ahmad Ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i who was crucified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskandrani.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/do-not-envy-anyone-who-has-not-been-harmed-for-the-sake-of-this-affair/ “Do not envy anyone who has not been harmed for the sake of this affair.” « A Resource of Translated Islamic Texts]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] was dragged before the inquisition, known as the [[Mihna]], ordered by the caliph [[al-Maʾmūn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10121/Ahmad-ibn-Hanbal Ahmad ibn Hanbal -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it lost official support soon afterwards. This coincided with the rise to prominence of the [[Ash'ari]] approach to Islam, of which [[Al-Ghazali]] was a staunch defender. [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] Islam became the mainstream schools of Islam.
As a consequence, the tables turned and some Mutazili scholars were victims of persecution themselves in the centuries to follow. Some [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] like [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]] also faced persecution from fellow Muslims in their time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172216/http://www.cmima.csic.es/mirror/mattom/science+society/lectures/illustrations/lecture16/ibnsina.html Science, civilization and society]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu'tazilite doctrine - by now regarded as heretical by Sunnis - continued to be influential amongst some Shia in Persia and Zaydis in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H052 Ash'ariyya and Mu'tazila]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shi'a==

{{Main|Persecution of Shia Muslims|Shi'a–Sunni relations}}

At various times many Shi'a groups have faced persecution. All of the [[Twelve Imams]] of [[Shia Islam]] have been martyred and their followers persecuted by either [[Kharijites]], the [[Umayyads]], or [[Abassids]]. In 1513, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Selim I]] ("The Grim") ordered the massacre of 40,000 [[Shia]] Muslim "heretics" in Anatolia during the Safavid-Ottoman struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/segn/control/context?docId=65&amp;searchDocId=65&amp;selectedDoc=65&amp;offset=0&amp;version=modern&amp;xpath=/wp:Document/wp:Content/page%5B1%5D&amp;allDoc=true St Thomas More Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002035109/http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/segn/control/context?docId=65&amp;searchDocId=65&amp;selectedDoc=65&amp;offset=0&amp;version=modern&amp;xpath=%2Fwp%3ADocument%2Fwp%3AContent%2Fpage%5B1%5D&amp;allDoc=true |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/cmh/cmh103.html The Ottoman Conquest]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the dominant strand in modern Sunni dogma regards Shiism as a valid ''madhhab'', following [[Al Azhar]], some Sunnis both now and in the past have regarded it as beyond the pale, and have attacked its adherents.  In modern times, notable examples include the bombing campaigns by the Sunni [[Sipah-e-Sahaba]] and the Shia [[Tehrik-e-Jafria]], two small extremist groups, against Shia or Sunni mosques in [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39432 RELIGION-PAKISTAN: Shia-Sunni Tensions Surface on Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115013021/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39432 |date=2012-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the persecution of [[Hazara people|Hazara]] under the [[Taliban]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1608289.stm BBC News | SOUTH ASIA | Hazara people's long suffering]&lt;/ref&gt; and the bloody attacks linked with [[Zarqawi]] and his followers against Shia in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6293230.stm BBC NEWS | Middle East | Crushing Iraq's human mosaic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the worst Shia-Sunni sectarian strife has occurred after the [[Iraq War|American invasion of Iraq]], steadily building up to present.{{when|date=July 2012}}&lt;ref name="Civil War"&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2007/03/civil_war.html Civil War]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/03/14/7682/ March 14, 2008 The Independent/UK "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" by Robert Fisk ] "month-long investigation by The Independent, culling four Arabic-language newspapers, official Iraqi statistics, two Beirut news agencies and Western reports"&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] have targeted not only thousands of civilians,&lt;ref&gt;over half of the 20,000 fatalities worldwide from terrorism in 2006 occurred in Iraq according to the American National Counterterrorism Center [http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf Report on Terrorist Incidents 2006] p.3 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326171214/http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|mosques]], shrines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/BA05CFF2-8D0A-4B2D-BBD0-B92EB85E1267.htm Al Jazeera English - News - Car Bomb Blast Near Iraq Shrine]&lt;/ref&gt; wedding and funeral processions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/05/24/bomb-iraq.html Iraqi funeral procession bombed; at least 26 killed]&lt;/ref&gt; markets, hospitals, offices, and streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nasr|2007|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly "tortur[ing] to death or summarily" executing "hundreds" of Sunnis "every month in Baghdad alone," many arrested at random.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article347806.ece Iraq's death squads] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001060540/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article347806.ece |date=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1883854,00.html Iraq 'failing to tackle death squads']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2006/04/02/iraq_militias_wave_of_death/ Iraq militias' wave of death, Sectarian killings now surpass terrorist bombings]," The Boston Globe, April 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi Arabian government has been viewed as repressive against Shias living in Saudi Arabia, mainly because it encourages the [[Salafi]] faith, which denounces Shia Islam as heretical. Shias are mainly persecuted due to the belief that they are Iranian "puppets" and traitors. In several Saudi Arabian cities, Shia [[azans]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] demonstrations are banned.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Sunni Madhabs==

Yaqub Beg's Uyghur forces declared a Jihad against [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] under T'o Ming during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]]. The Uyghurs thought that the Chinese Muslims were [[Shafi`i]], and since the Uyghurs were [[Hanafi]] that they should wage war against them. Yaqub Beg enlisted non Muslim Han Chinese militia under Hsu Hsuehkung in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub, who planned to conquer Dzungharia. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairbank|Liu|Twitchett|1980|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairbank|Liu|Twitchett|1980|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Takfiris==

Certain small groups - the [[Kharijite]]s of early medieval times, and [[Takfir wal Hijra]]- follow ''[[takfir]]ist'' doctrines, regarding almost all other Muslims as infidels whose blood may legitimately be shed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5400/is_200112/ai_n21482222/pg_9 new global threat: Transnational Salafis and Jihad], The Middle East Policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmfaff/36/5020105.htm House of Commons - Foreign Affairs - Minutes of Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahhabis==

The [[Kuomintang]] [[Sufi]] [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] General [[Ma Bufang]], who backed the [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafi/[[Wahhabi]]s. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be "Heterodox" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEih57-GWQQC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=ma+bufang+secret+war&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lh6YTKKkLYT68AbGy7iKAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20secret%20war&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E.

[[File:Saṃsāra.jpg|thumb|Symbolic depiction of Saṃsāra]]
{{Jainism}}
'''''Saṃsāra''''' ('''transmigration''') in [[Jain philosophy]], refers to the worldly life characterized by continuous rebirths and [[reincarnation]]s in various realms of existence. {{IAST|[[Saṃsāra]]}} is described as mundane existence, full of suffering and misery and hence is considered undesirable and worth [[renunciation]]. The ''Saṃsāra'' is without any beginning and the [[Jīva (Jainism)|soul]] finds itself in bondage with its [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] since the beginning-less time. ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' is the only way to be liberated from ''saṃsāra''.

== Influx of karmas (''asrava'')==
According to the Jain text, [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|(There are two kinds of influx, namely) that of persons with passions, which extends transmigration, and that of persons free from passions, which prevents or shortens it.|''Tattvārthsūtra'' (6-4-81){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81}}}}

Activities that lead to the influx of karmas (''[[asrava]]'') which extends transmigration are:{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=81-82}}
*Five senses
*Four passions (''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|kasāya]]'')
**Anger
**Ego
**Deceit
**Greed
*The non-observance of the five vows
*Non-observance of the twenty-five activities like Righteousness 

;''Saṃsāra bhavanā''

Jain texts prescribe meditation on twelve forms of reflection (''bhāvanā'') for those who wish to stop the above described ''asrava''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}} One such reflection is ''Saṃsāra bhavanā''.
It has been described in one of the Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' as:{{quote|Transmigration is the attainment of another birth by the self owing to the ripening of karmas. The five kinds of whirling round have been described already. He, who wanders in the endless cycle of births and deaths, undergoing millions of afflictions in innumerable wombs and families, takes different relationships such as father, brother, son, grandson, etc, or mother, sister, wife, daughter and so on, being propelled by the mechanism of karmas. The master becomes servant and the servant master, just as an actor acts several parts on the stage. To be brief, sometimes one becomes one’s own son. There is no end to the transformations undergone by the self owing to the influence of karmas. Thus to reflect on the nature of mundane existence is contemplation on worldly existence. He who contemplates thus is alarmed at the miseries of transmigration and becomes disgusted with worldly existence. And he who is disgusted with it endeavours to free himself from it.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=246}}}}

[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th century Jain writer in his book ''The Practical Dharma'' wrote:
{{cquote|Endless is the cycle of transmigration; painful is every form of life; there is no happiness in any of the four conditions of existence; devas, human beings, animals and residents of hells are all involved in pain and misery of some kind or other; moksha alone is blissful and free from pain; the wise should, therefore, only aspire for moksha; all other conditions are temporary and painful."{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=52}}}}

Wilbur from December 1906 – 1907 wrote a series of articles about the life of Mary Baker Eddy in the Boston magazine ''Human Life''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longyear.org/exhibits-archives-media/articles/mary-baker-eddy/human-life-articles-mary-baker-eddy-sibyl-wilbur-1906-1907 "The Human Life Articles on Mary Baker Eddy by Sibyl Wilbur: 1906 - 1907"]. Longyear Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Wilbur authored the book ''The Life of Mary Baker Eddy''. It was financed and published by [[John V. Dittemore]] and became the first church-authorized biography.&lt;ref name="Bates and Dittemore"&gt;[[Ernest Sutherland Bates|Bates, Ernest Sutherland]]; [[John V. Dittemore|Dittemore, John Valentine]]. (1932). ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Truth and the Tradition''. A. A. Knopf. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Ralph H. (1933). ''Reviewed Work: Mary Baker Eddy, the Truth and the Tradition by Ernest Sutherland Bates, John V. Dittemore''. ''[[The New England Quarterly]]'' 6 (1): 200-202.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted numerous times.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;Dickson, Carol E. (1998). ''Eddy, Mary Baker 1821–1910''. In Eleanor Amico. ''Reader's Guide to Women's Studies''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers. p. 305. {{ISBN|188496477X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written from a [[Christian Science]] viewpoint and portrayed Eddy in an idealized manner.&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sydney E. Ahlstrom|Ahlstrom, Sydney E]]. (1971). ''Eddy, Mary Baker''. In Edward T. James. ''Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 1''. [[Harvard University Press]]. p. 560. {{ISBN|0-674-62734-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy endorsed the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy|Eddy, Mary Baker]]. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/firstchurchofchr01eddy#page/297/mode/2up ''The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and Miscellany'']. Boston: Allison V. Stewart. pp. 297-298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalijarvi, T. (1931). ''Reviewed Work: The Life of Mary Baker Eddy by Sibyl Wilbur''. ''Social Science'' 6 (3): 321-322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dittemore later denounced the book commenting "the contents of that volume were mostly provided for the author from church sources, and in the light of subsequent knowledge have largely proved unreliable."&lt;ref name="Bates and Dittemore"/&gt;

[[Gaius Glenn Atkins]] criticized the book, noting that it "touches lightly or omits altogether those passages in Mrs. Eddy's life which do not fit in
with the picture which Mrs. Eddy herself and the church desire to be perpetuated."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Glenn Atkins|Atkins, Gaius Glenn]]. (2014 edition, originally published 1924). ''Modern Religious Cults and Movements''. Routledge. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-1-138-77877-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilbur was a San Diego Branch Member of the [[National League of American Pen Women]] and a member of the [[New England Woman's Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Louis S. (1922). 'Who's Who Among the Women of California''. Security Publishing Company. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Myra B. (1932). ''History of the New England Woman's Press Association, 1885-1931''.

'''Sidon''', known locally as '''Sayda''' ({{lang-ar|صيدا}}), is the third-largest city in [[Lebanon]]. It is located in the [[South Governorate, Lebanon|South Governorate]] of Lebanon, on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, about {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=in}} south of the capital, [[Beirut]]. In the [[Book of Genesis]], Sidon was the first-born son of [[Canaan (biblical figure)|Canaan]], who was a son of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], thereby making Sidon a great grandson of [[Noah]].

{{anchor|Etymology|Names|Toponymy}}
==Name==
The [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] name ''Ṣīdūn'' ({{lang|phn|𐤑𐤃𐤍}}, {{sc|ṣdn}}) probably meant "fishery" or "fishing town".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Carl Eiselen|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hhk5AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=sidon+meaning&amp;dq=sidon+meaning|title=Sidon: A Study in Oriental History, Volume 4|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1907|page=12|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in [[Biblical Hebrew]] as ''Ṣīḏōn'' ({{lang|he|צִידוֹן}}) and in [[Classical Syriac|Syriac]] as ''Ṣidon'' ({{lang|syc|ܨܝܕܘܢ}}). This was [[hellenization|hellenized]] as ''Sidṓn'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σιδών}}), which was [[latinization of names|Latinized]] as ''{{lang|la|Sidon}}''. The name appears in [[Classical Arabic]] as ''Saydoon'' ({{lang|ar|صَيْدونْ}}) and in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Arabic]] as ''Ṣaydā'' ({{lang|ar|صيدا}}).

As a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]], it was notionally refounded and given the formal name ''{{lang|la|Colonia Aurelia Pia Sidon}}'' to honor its imperial sponsor.

==History==
[[File:Protome from Eshmun Sanctuary.jpg|thumb|left|Persian style bull [[protome]] found in Sidon gives testimony of the Aecheminid rule and influence. Marble, 5th century BC]]
Sidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a [[Stone tool|lithic]] [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] dating to the [[Acheulean]], whilst finds at Sidon III include a [[Heavy Neolithic]] assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt; It was one of the most important [[Phoenicia]]n cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. [[Homer]] praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonizing party went to found the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of [[Phoenicia]]. Glass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the [[Murex trunculus]] was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.
[[File:Roman era Phonesia.png|thumb|left|The Peutinger Map showing Tyre and Sidon in the 4th century]]
In AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King [[Eshmunazar|Eshmun’azar]] II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a "king of the Sidonians," probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of [[`Ashtart|‘Ashtart]], "the goddess of the Sidonians."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kelly, Herodotus and the Chronology of the Kings of Sidon, [[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]], no. 268, pp. 39–56, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
In this inscription the gods [[Eshmun]] and [[Baal|Ba‘al]] Sidon 'Lord of Sidon' (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled ''‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al'' '‘Ashtart the name of the Lord', a title also found in an [[Ugaritic]] text.

[[File:SidonSeaCastle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sidon Sea Castle]], built by the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in AD 1228]]

In the years before Christianity, Sidon had many conquerors: [[Assyria]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and finally [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Herod the Great]] visited Sidon. Both Jesus and [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] are said to have visited it, too (see ''[[#The Biblical Sidon|Biblical Sidon]]'', below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.

Like other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors. At the end of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] era in 351 BC, it was invaded by the emperor [[Artaxerxes III]] and then by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC, when the [[Hellenistic]] era of Sidon began. Under the [[successors of Alexander]], it enjoyed relative autonomy and organized games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], the [[Lycia]]n tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum|Archaeological Museum]] of [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Turkey"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |title=Istanbul Archaeology Museum |accessdate=10 May 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524104810/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654614207 |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The Romans also built a theater and other major monuments in the city. In the reign of [[Elagabalus]], a [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colony]] was established there. During the [[Byzantine]] period, when the [[551 Beirut earthquake|great earthquake of AD 551]] destroyed most of the cities of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], [[Law School of Beirut|Beirut's School of Law]] took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until it was [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered]] by the [[Arabs]] in AD 636.

[[File:Sidon-coast.jpg|thumb|Sidon with a view of the Mediterranean coast]]
On 4 December 1110 Sidon was [[Siege of Sidon (1110)|captured]], a decade after the [[First Crusade]], by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] and King [[Sigurd I of Norway]]. It then became the centre of the [[Lordship of Sidon]], an important lordship in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. [[Saladin]] captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the [[Crusade of 1197]]. It would remain an important Crusader stronghold until it was finally destroyed by the [[Saracens]] in 1249. In 1260 it was again destroyed by the [[Mongols]]. The remains of the original walls are still visible.

After Sidon came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the [[Sidon Eyalet]] (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance.

During the [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1839–41)| Egyptian–Ottoman War]], Sidon - like much of [[Ottoman Syria]] - was occupied by the forces of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]]. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]], commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on September 26, 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named "[[HMS Sidon]]".  

===Modern era===
After [[World War I]] it became part of the French [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] of [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]]. During [[World War II]] the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was [[Syria–Lebanon Campaign|captured by British forces]] fighting against the [[Vichy French]], and following the war it became a major city of independent [[Lebanon]].

Following the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]] in 1948, a considerable number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of [[Ein el-Hilweh]] and [[Mieh Mieh (camp)|Mieh Mieh]]. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.

Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900, but studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of some wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels. (Refer to the '''"Old City"''' and the '''"Architecture and Landscape"''' sections below).

{{wide image|Panorama of Sidon from the castle.jpg|900px|alt=Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009|{{center|Panorama of Sidon as seen from the top of the Sea Castle, 2009}}}}
[[Saida International Stadium]] was inaugurated in 2000 for the [[Asian Cup 2000|Asian Football Confederation's Cup 2000]].

==Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment==
According to a recent United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report "data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon's largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032823/http://www.undp.org.lb/WhatWeDo/poverty.cfm |date=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.lb/communication/publications/linking/Session4.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards a Regionally Balance Development |publisher=Undp.org.lb |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital-city outgrew Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.

The post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centred around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.

===The Former ''Makab'' (waste dump) and the Treatment Plant ===
Near the southern entrance to the city used to be a 'rubbish mountain' called at the time by the locals the ''Makab''; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with [[medical waste]] and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Sidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the ''Makab'' crisis—which has endangered residents health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the City's decades-old chronic waste problem. He established IBC Enviro, privately funded, and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city's coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon's sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Antelava |first=Natalia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8426091.stm |title=Lebanese city's mountain of rubbish |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127204925/http://www.business24-7.ae/Articles/2009/11/Pages/24112009/11252009_73db570b8298406b974037f9b3a23bbb.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 November 2009|title=Mountain of rubbish overwhelms Sidon|work=Emirates 24/7|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloubnan.info/environment/actualite/id/37182/titre/Sidon-chokes-under-rubbish-dump|title=Sidon chokes under rubbish dump|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=1&amp;article_id=108602|title=Syringes plague Sidon beach as dump spills medical waste|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
The city of Sidon is administrated by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality's jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city's suburbs is administrated by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the [[Governorate of South Lebanon]], and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Saray (building)|Saray]] that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the [[Tyre District|Tyre]] and [[Bint Jbeil]] districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.{{cn|date=July 2017}}



==Demographics==
Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and [[Deir el Qamar]], and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Sidon also hosts the seats of the [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]] Mufti and the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shiite]] [[Ayatollah]] of South Lebanon.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jewish]] population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, with 3,060 in [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Reeva S., Michael M. Laskier, and Sara Reguer, eds. 2003. The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times. New York: Columbia University Press. P. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
[[File:Carpsaida.jpg|thumb|Alleyway inside the Old Souks.]]
* [[Sidon Sea Castle]], a fortress built by the [[Crusaders]] in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon.
* [[Sidon Soap Museum]]. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps.
* ''Khan el Franj'' ("[[Caravanserai]] of the French"), built by Emir [[Fakhreddin II|Fakhreddine]] in the 17th century to accommodate French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries.
* Debbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. It is currently in the process of being transformed into the History Museum of Sidon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsaida.org/english/projet.htm |title=Welcome to Debbane Palace |publisher=Museumsaida.org |accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the [[Abaza clan]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas.
* [[Saint Louis Castle|The Castle of St. Louis]] (''Qalaat Al Muizz''). It was built by the [[Crusaders]] in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Al Muizz]]. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near [[Murex Hill]].
* [[Eshmun Temple]], dedicated to the [[Phoenicia]]n God of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali river.
* The British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty's (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps that only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reading Room Manchester |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2016405/Sidon%20War%20Cemetery |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date= |accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
'''Sidon I''' is an [[archaeological]] site located to the east of the city, south of the road to [[Jezzine]]. An assemblage of [[flint]] tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow [[axe]]s or [[chisel]]s that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt; The collection appears to have gone missing from the [[Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Gigues, P.E., Leba'a, Kafer Garra et Qraye, nécropoles dde la région sidonienne. BMB, vol. 1, pp. 35–76, vol. 2, pp. 30–72, vol. 3, pp. 54–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidon II''' is said to be "near the church" at approximately fifty meters [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the [[Acheulean]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

'''Sidon III''' was found by E. Passemard in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the [[National Museum of Beirut]] marked "Camp de l'Aviation". It includes large [[flint]] and [[chert]] bifacials that may be of [[Heavy Neolithic]] origin.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"/&gt;

'''Sidon IV''' is the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] mound of ancient Sidon with Early [[Bronze Age]] (3200 BC -) deposits, now located underneath the ruined [[Saint Louis Castle]] and what are also thought to be the ruins of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1965"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorraine Copeland|author2=P. Wescombe|title=Inventory of Stone-Age sites in Lebanon, p. 136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YsRRwAACAAJ|accessdate=21 July 2011|year=1965|publisher=Imprimerie Catholique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar [[Ernest Renan]] was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: ''Mission de Phénicie'' (1864–1874; ''Phoenician Expedition'').

The St. Louis land-castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |title=Previous Excavation |publisher=SidonExcavation |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020419074213/http://www.sidonexcavation.org/ht_d_pre/ht_d_pre1.html |archivedate=19 April 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognise the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with [[Byblos]], even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.

==The Biblical Sidon==
[[File:Shrinepeter.jpg|thumb|Shrine commemorating the last meeting place between [[St. Paul]] and [[St. Peter]] inside the Old City of Sidon.]]
The Bible describes Sidon in several passages:
* It received its name from the "first-born" of [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], the grandson of [[Noah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:15, 19).
* The [[Tribe of Zebulun]] has a frontier on Sidon. (Gen. 49:13)
* It was the first home of the [[Phoenicia]]ns on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a "great" city. (Joshua 11:8; 19:28).
* It was the mother city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued (Judges 1:31).
* The Sidonians long oppressed [[Israelites|Israel]] (Judges 10:12).
* From the time of [[David]] its glory began to wane, and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], its "virgin daughter" (Isaiah 23:12), rose to its place of pre-eminence.
* [[Solomon]] entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the [[land of Israel]] (1 Kings 11:1, 33).
* [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] was a Sidonian princess (1 Kings 16:31).
* It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (1 Kings 5:6; 1 Chronicles 22:4; Ezekiel 27:8).
* It is frequently referred to by the prophets (Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12; Jeremiah 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezekiel 27:8; 28:21, 22; 32:30; Joel 3:4).
* [[Elijah]] sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles (1 Kings 17:9–24; {{bibleref|Luke|4:26}}).
* Jesus visited the region or "coasts" ([[King James Version]]) of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and Sidon ({{bibleref|Matthew|15:21}}; {{bibleref|Mark|7:24}}) and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (Mark 3:8; Luke 6:17), leading to the stark contrast in {{bibleref|Matthew|11:21–23}} to [[Korazin]] and [[Bethsaida]].
* From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving [[Caesarea]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] finally sailed for Rome (Acts 27:3, 4).

==Sanchuniathon==
* The account ascribed to the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]] makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of [[Nereus]]. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.

The '''Theosophical Society of Aryavarta''', also sometimes called ''Theosophical Society of India'', and abbreviated as ''Theosophical Society '' was a Theosophical Society from May 22, 1878 until March 1882. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The masters revealed: Madam Blavatsky and the myth of the Great White Lodge|last=Johnson |first=K.

== History ==
{{Main|Arya_Samaj#The Arya Samaj and the Theosophical Society}}
In 1875 Swami Dayanda Saraswati founded in Mumbai the Hindu reform movement [[Arya Samaj]]. In the same year, the [[Theosophical Society]] was founded by [[Madame Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Olcott]] in [[New York City|New York]].

Olcott met ''Moolji Thakurshi'' (Moolji Thackersey) already in 1870, but they lost contact with each other. In 1877 Olcott wrote to Thakurshi, and described the Theosophical Society and its goals to him. Thakurshi replied to Olcott, and told him about the Arya Samaj. He described its goals and gave Olcott the address of its president in Mumbai ''Hari Chand Chintamani'' (Hurrychund Chintamon). In the following exchange of letters, they illustrated the positions of their own societies, and noted the agreements between them. Chintamani then became a member of the Theosophical Society, and Olcott began a correspondence with Dayananda Saraswati.

It was suggested to unite the two societies, and the proposal was accepted at a meeting of the Theosophical Society on May 22, 1878 in New York.  
A branch of the ''Theosophical Society'' was founded in June 27, 1878 by [[Charles Carleton Massey]] in [[London]]. Its name was the [[London Lodge|British Theosophical Society of the Aryavart]].

In December 1878, Blavatsky and Olcott travelled to Mumbai, where they arrived in February 1879. They met Hari Chand Chintamani, and founded the first theosophical lodge in India. They moved the headquarters of the society to Mumbai.

There were however tensions between the two societies, and on March 26, 1882 Dayananda spoke about the ''Humbuggery of the Theosophists'', Olcott replied to Dayanandas charges in [[The Theosophist]] in July 1882 in an article titled  ''Swami Dayanand's Charges''.

[[File:Taijojo Sanshi.jpg|thumb|300px| ''Sanshi'' 三尸 "Three Corpses" illustration from the (c. 9th century) ''Chu sanshi jiuchong baoshengjing'' 除三尸九蟲保生經]]

The ''sanshi'' 三尸 "'''Three Corpses'''" or ''sanchong'' 三蟲 "'''Three Worms'''" are a [[Daoist]] physiological belief that demonic creatures live inside the human body, and they seek to hasten the death of their host. These three supernatural parasites allegedly enter the person at birth, and reside in the three ''[[dantian]]'' "energy centers", respectively located within the head, chest, and abdomen. After their human host dies, they are freed from the body and become malevolent [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghosts]].

The pernicious Three Corpses/Worms work to harm their host's health and fate by initiating sicknesses, inviting other disease-causing agents into the body, and reporting their host's transgressions to the gods. The Three Corpses are supposed to keep records of their host's misdeeds, ascend to [[tian]] "heaven" bimonthly on the night of Chinese [[sexagenary cycle|sexagenary]] ''gengshen'' 庚申 "57th of the 60-day cycle" while the host is sleeping, and file reports to the Siming 司命 "Director of Destinies" who deducts a certain number of days from the person's life for each misdeed. One way of avoiding this bureaucratic snitching is to stay awake for the entire ''gengshen'' day and night, thus preventing the Three Corpses from leaving one's body (a belief later assimilated into the Japanese [[Kōshin]] 庚申 tradition).

For a Daoist adept to achieve the longevity of a ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' "transcendent; immortal", it was necessary to expel the Three Corpses from the body. Since these evil spirits feed upon decaying matter produced by grains being digested in the intestines, the practice of ''[[bigu (avoiding grains)|bigu]]'' "abstinence from grains and cereals" is the first step towards expelling them. ''Bigu'' alone will not eliminate the Three Corpses, but weakens them to the point where they can be killed with ''[[waidan]]'' alchemical drugs such as [[cinnabar]], and ultimately eliminated through ''[[neidan]]'' meditation techniques.

==Terminology==
The Chinese terms ''sānshī'' and ''sānchóng'' [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''sān'' [[wikt: 三|三]] meaning "three, 3; several, many" with ''shī'' [[wikt:尸|尸]] or [[wikt:屍|屍]] "corpse, dead body; ritual [[shi (personator)|personator]] representing a dead relative during [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]" and ''chóng'' [[wikt:蟲|蟲]] or [[wikt:虫|虫]] "insect; worm; bug".

The usual English translation of ''sanshi'' is "three corpses" or "Three Corpses". However, this Daoist term does not literally refer to "corpses; dead bodies" within the human body, but is linguistically [[causative]] meaning the eventual "death; mortality" produced by these demonic agents (Arthur 2013). Compare the English slang verb ''corpse'' meaning "to make a corpse of, to kill" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' 2009). More accurate translations of ''sanshi'' are "Three Deathbringers" (Kohn 1993), "Three Death-bringers" (Komjathy 2007)  [cf. the video game [[Death Bringer]]], "three corpse-demons" (Strickmann 2002), or "three corpse [evils]" (Zhang &amp; Unschuld 2014).

Synonyms for ''sanshi'' include ''fúshī'' 伏尸 "hidden corpse", ''shīchóng'' 尸虫 "corpse worms", ''shīguǐ'' 尸鬼 "corpse ghosts", and in reference to the three corpses named Peng (see ''Baoshengjing'' below), ''shīpéng'' 尸彭 "corpse Pengs" or ''sānpéng'' 三彭 "three Pengs". ''Sānshīshén'' 三尸神 "Lord Three Corpses" is an honorific alternate with ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' "spirit; god; deity''

''Sanchong'', which the ''Lunheng'' (see below) used to mean "[[intestinal parasites]]", is normally translated as "three worms" or "Three Worms"; "Three Cadavers" is another version (Schipper 1993). Owing to the semantic [[polysemy]] of ''chong'', the term is also translatable as "three pests" (Needham and Lu 1986) or "three bugs" (Zhang and Unschuld 2014).

The expressions Three Corpses and Three Worms are used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Zhang and Unschuld (2014: 414) translate ''sanchong'' 三蟲 as "three bugs; three worms" and define two meanings: "[[Etiology (medicine)|Etiological Agent]] of all microorganisms in the body that bring forth disease", citing [[Li Shizhen]]'s (1578) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (''chongbu'' 蟲部 "bugs/worms section") that, "Bugs/worms are small organisms. There are very many types. This is the meaning of 'three bugs/worms'"; and "Combined Designation of ''huichong'' 蛔蟲, roundworms, ''chichong'' 赤蟲, red worms, and ''naochong'' 蟯蟲, pinworms", citing the (c. 610) ''Zhubing yuanhou zonglun'' 諸病源候總論 "General Treatise of Causes and Symptoms of Illnesses", "The three worms include long worms, red worms, and pinworms". They give ''sanshi'' 三尸 "three corpse [bugs/worms]" as an Alternative Name for ''shichong'' 屍蟲 "corpse bugs/worms", and define it as the "[[Etiological]] Agent of microorganisms that can bring forth all types of ''shibing'' 屍病 "corpse [qi] disease", citing the ''Zhubing yuanhou zonglun'' again that, "Inside the human body there are from the beginning all the three corpse [bugs/worms]. They come to life together with man, but they are most malicious. They are able to communicate with demons and the numinous, and they regularly invite evil [qi] from outside, thereby causing human suffering".

[[Demonic possession]] and demonic medicine are ancient Chinese beliefs (Unschuld 1986: 29-46). For example, the ''Bencao gangmu'' chapter (52) on [[Traditional Chinese medicines derived from the human body|medicines derived from the human body]] says "[[bregma]]; skull bone" is good for treating tuberculosis-like [[consumptive]] diseases that are supposedly caused by evil spirits, such as ''chuánshī'' 傳尸, which is translated as "cadaver vector disease" (Cooper &amp; Sivin 1973), "consumptive and infectious disease" (Luo 2003), and "corpse [evil] transmission" (Zhang &amp; Unschuld 2014).

Since the Chinese notion of "Three Corpses" within the human body is unfamiliar to most Westerners, meaningful English descriptions are problematic. Scholars have termed them as '''[[gods]]''' ("transcendental beings" Fischer-Schreiber 1996, "supernatural beings with physical and ephemeral spirit components" Arthur 2013, "internal gods" Benn 2001); '''[[demons]]''' ("a sort of demon" Pas 1988, "maleficent demons" Maspero 1981, "malevolent beings in the body" Eskildsen 1998, "demonic supernatural creatures" Kohn 1993); or both ("semi-divine, semi-demonic agents" Campany 2005); '''[[parasites]]''' ("biospiritual parasites" Campany 2002, "body parasites" Yamada 1989, "parasites said to live inside the human body" Cook 2008); and other terms ("factors in the human body" Needham and Lu 1986).

==Daoist internal deities==

In Daoist physiology, the [[human body]] contains many indwellers besides the Three Corpses. ''Nèishén'' 内神 "internal spirits/gods" and ''shēnshén'' 身神 "body spirits/gods" are Daoist terms for deities inhabiting various parts of the body, including the ''wǔzàng'' 五臟 "the five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys", ''liùfǔ'' 六腑 "the six receptacles: gall bladder, stomach, large intestine, small intestine, [[San Jiao|triple burner]], and bladder", and ''qīqiào'' 七竅 "the seven apertures in the human head: eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth".

These "body residents" (Huang 2011: 57) were either health threats or health protectors, and said to engage in constant struggles with one another. The upper, middle, and lower ''dantian'' energy-centers contained both the Three Corpses/Worms and the counterpart guardian gods called the ''sanyi'' 三一 "Three Ones" (Maspero 1981: 356). When the Three Corpses approach spirits within the body, they can [[shapeshift]], sometimes appearing as evil demons and sometimes taking human form (Maspero 1981: 331).

The ancient Chinese believed in [[soul dualism]] between the [[hun and po|''hun'' and ''po'' souls]]: heavenly ''hún'' 魂 "spiritual, ethereal, [[Yin and yang|yang]] soul" that leaves the body after death and the earthly ''pò'' 魄 "corporeal, substantive, [[Yin and yang|yin]] soul" that remains with the corpse of the deceased. In some Daoist traditions, the body was thought to contain three ''hun'' and seven ''po'' souls. The good ''hun''-souls are clad in red and carry a red [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] in their hands, the bad ''po''-souls, "who long for the body to die and therefore perform mischief to try to hasten the adept's demise", are clad in black and carry black seals (Eskildsen 1998: 49). Strickmann says the Three Corpses/Worms represent a specialized development of the ''po''-souls' destructive propensities.
&lt;blockquote&gt;But unlike the ''hun'', whose nature (though flighty and inconstant) is entirely benign and whose tendencies are all heavenward, the seven ''p'o'' yearn for the earth. Their strongest wish is to rejoin the damp, dank underground springs whose moist, heavy nature they share, and so they seek to undermine and rid themselves of the constraining human body they inhabit. Thus at night, while their host is sleeping (and the airborne ''hun''-souls are sporting and gambling with the ''hun'' of other sleepers, thereby causing dreams), the ''p'o'' beckon to passing phantoms and disease-demons and invite them in to take possession of the sleeper’s body and work toward his destruction. The very names of the seven ''p'o''-souls suggest their harmful function, and one early list significantly begins with a corpse: corpse-dog, hidden dung, sparrow-sex, greedy-guts, flying venom, filth-for-removal, and rot-lung. (2002: 77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daoists were fascinated with correlations between the human body and the cosmos. Maspero (1981: 339) says, "Man and world, for the Chinese, are absolutely identical, not only as a whole but also in every detail." For examples, the human head is round like heaven, the feet are square like the earth; the Five Viscera correspond to the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]], the 24 [[vertebra]] to the [[24 solar terms]], the 365 [[acupoint]]s to the 365 days of the year; and the veins and arteries compare to rivers and streams.

Later texts like the ''[[Neijing Tu]]'' and ''[[Xiuzhen Tu]]'' depict the "inner landscape" of the human body as a microcosm of the universe, which helps ''neidan'' mediators visualize their personal internal spirits. While body gods travel in and out of the body, their prolonged exit may result in sickness or death. Hence, detailed visualizations of the corpse-worms within the meditator's body is a powerful means of keeping them in place and thus promoting health and longevity (Robinet 1993: 64‑65, Huang 2010: 61).

==Classical descriptions==
The received canon of [[Chinese classics]] first mentioned the Three Corpses and Three Worms in the [[Han dynasty]] period (206 BCE-220 CE). Beginning in the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265-420 CE), Daoist texts portrayed them in both zoomorphic and bureaucratic metaphors (Campany 2005:43). According to Isabelle Robinet (1993: 139), the Three Worms or Corpses are well known by all of the Daoist schools; for instance, they are mentioned in early [[Shangqing School]] texts such as the ''Huangting jing'' 黃庭經 "Scripture of the Yellow Court" and ''Dadong zhenjing'' 大洞真經 "Authentic Scripture of the Great Cavern". The Three Corpses are among the most widely‑documented body parasites in early and medieval Chinese literature (Huang 2011: 36).

===Liexian zhuan===
[[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]]'s (c. late 1st century BCE) Daoist [[hagiography]] ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' "Biographies of Exemplary Immortals" (tr. Kaltenmark 1953: 177-78) first records the Three Corpses in the biography of Zhu Huang 朱璜. His Daoist master Ruan Qiu 阮丘 expelled the Three Corpses from Zhu Huang by means of a prescription combining seven drugs, administered nine times daily, over a period of a hundred days. It also quotes the ''Huangtingjing'' (tr. Schipper 1978:372) that for ''genghsen'' days, "Do not sleep either day or night, and you shall become immortal."

===Lunheng===
[[Wang Chong]]'s (c. 80 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'' (tr. Forke 1907 2: 316) compares the ''sanchong'' 三蟲 "Three Worms" to ''zhì'' 蛭 "leeches" (also written with [[radical 142|insect radical]] 虫 generally used for characters naming insects, worms, spiders, and smaller reptiles). Wang censures critics who metaphorically describe corrupt officials as worms or parasites, "Man has three worms in his intestines [人腹中有三蟲]. The worms living in low marshes are called leeches. They eat man’s feet, as the three worms eat his bowels [蛭食人足，三蟲食腸]. To whom will these critics, so fond of similarities, compare the three worms?" In another ''Lunheng'' section (tr. Forke 1907 1: 534), Wang Chong mentions ancient exorcisms of "flying corpses and floating goblins" [飛尸流凶].

===Baopuzi===
The "Inner Chapters" of the (c. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'', written by the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]], is the earliest source of detailed information about the Three Corpses. This text describes the ''sanshi'' parasites causing illnesses during unlucky times in the [[Chinese calendar]] and reporting sins on ''gengshen'' days, as well as gives several methods for preparing poisonous ''waidan'' alchemical elixirs to eliminate the Three Corpses.

The ''Baopuzi'' records how the Three Corpses and ''Zaoshen'' 竈神 "[[Kitchen God|God of the Stove]]" make regular reports to ''Siming'' 司命 "Director of Destinies", who shortens the host's lifespan accordingly. Answering a question about the importance of ''jìnjì'' [[wikt:禁忌|禁忌]] "taboo", Ge Hong cites three [[Apocrypha#Confucianism and Taoism|apocryphal Han texts]], the ''Yineijie'' 易內戒 "Inner Commands of the ''[[Book of Changes]]''", ''Chisongzijing'' 赤鬆子經 "Classic of [[Chisongzi|Master Redpine]]", and ''Hetu jimingfu'' 河圖記命符 "[[Yellow River Map|River Chart]] Life Talisman", which is attributed to the Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Taboos are most urgent for avoiding harm and losses. ''Inner Commands of the Book of Changes'', ''Ch'ih-sung tzu's Classic'', and ''The Life-dealing Amulets of the Ho-t'u-chi'' are unanimous in saying that the gods of heaven and earth who are in charge of misdeeds make deductions from people's three-day reckonings according to the degree of their wrongdoing. As these reckonings decrease, a man becomes poorer and falls ill; frequently he suffers anxiety. When no more are left, he dies. Since there are hundreds of things that may give rise to deductions, I cannot give a complete account. It is also said that there are Three Corpses [三尸] in our bodies, which, though not corporeal, actually are of a type with our inner, ethereal breaths, the powers, the ghosts, and the gods [魂靈鬼神之屬也]. They want us to die prematurely. (After death they become a man's ghost and move about at will to where sacrifices and libations are being offered.) Therefore, every fifty-seventh day of the sixty-day cycle they mount to heaven and personally report our misdeeds to the Director of Fates. Further, during the night of the last day of the month the hearth god also ascends to heaven and makes an oral report of a man's wrongs. For the more important misdeeds [''ji'' 紀 "12 year period; discipline; mark"] a whole period of three hundred days is deducted. For the minor ones they deduct one reckoning [''suan'' 算 "calculate; count"], a reckoning being three days. Personally, I have not yet been able to determine whether this is really so or not, but that is because the ways of heaven are obscure, and ghosts and gods are hard to understand. (6, tr. Ware 1966:115-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare Campany's (2002: 49) translation, "As for the sort of beings they are, they have no physical forms but are nevertheless real, of a type with our cloud-souls and numina, ghosts and spirits (''hunling guishen'' 魂靈鬼神)". Among present-day Quanzhen School Daoists in Chengdu, Arthur (2013: 85) says they remain awake in meditation all night on each new moon to effectively hinder the Three Worms' damning travels. "The idea here is that if adepts successfully hinder the Deathbringers' travels for seven consecutive ''gengshen'' nights, the Director of Destiny will fire these supernatural entities from their appointed positions, and they will die."

Another germane ''Baopuzi'' passage explains how the Three Corpses take advantage of ''shuaiyue weiri'' 衰月危日 "months of weakness and days of peril", which is a technical term for cyclical times of special vulnerability (Campany 2002: 51). Ge Hong says even someone with ''xindao zhi xin'' 信道之心 "a heart believing in the Dao" must expel the Three Corpses.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If all you have is a heart faithful to God and yet do nothing for your own benefit – your predestined life span being defective and your body threatened with harm – the Three Corpses will take advantage of your weak months and perilous days [三尸因其衰月危日], the hours when your longevity could be interrupted or sickness incurred, to summon vicious breaths and bring in any demons they might be able to find to do you injury. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 252-253) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baopuzi'' uses ''sanchong'' 三蟲 "Three Worms" to mean ''sanshi'' 三尸 "Three Corpses", and mentions both ''jiuchong'' 九蟲 "Nine Worms" (or "Nine Vermin", Benn 2001) internal parasites, and the all-encompassing ''sanshi jiuchong'' "Three Corpses and Nine Worms".

''Sanchong'' "Three Worms" synonymously means "Three Corpses", and the ''Baopuzi'' says both can be expelled through cinnabar-based alchemical elixirs. The first method of Xianmenzi 羡門子 expels the corpse-worms, provides immortality, and exorcises ghosts.
&lt;blockquote&gt;... mixes three quarts of wine with a pound of cinnabar and exposes it to the sun for forty days. After it has been taken for one day the Three Worms and all illnesses are immediately purged from the patient [三蟲百病立下]. If taken for three years, it will confer geniehood and one is sure to be served by two fairies, who can be employed to summon the Traveling Canteen. This elixir can exorcize ghosts. When the unburied dead everywhere are possessing people and harming them, inflicting injuries upon our homes, and throwing up earthworks to obstruct people, no harm will come to us if this elixir is hung pointed toward the sources of disaster.  (4, tr. Ware 1966: 84) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second method of Wu Chengzi 務成子 expels the Three Worms, works miracles, and provides virtual immortality. The complex instructions involve melting mercury and lead in a special crucible – made from heating realgar, earthworm excreta, and cinnabar inside iron and copper tubes – in order to produce 1500 pounds of gold.
&lt;blockquote&gt;After soaking for a hundred days in Vitex or red panicled millet wine, this gold softens sufficiently to be miscible with other things. If one pill of it the size of a gram is taken three times daily until one pound has been consumed, the Three Worms will cry for mercy and all illnesses will quit the body [三蟲伏尸百病皆去]. The blind will see; the deaf, hear; the aged will become like thirty; those entering fire will not be burned; all evils, all poisons, cold, wind, heat, and dampness—none of these will be able to attack such a man. If he continues the dosage until three pounds have been consumed, he will be able to walk on rivers and all the gods of the mountains and streams will come to serve and protect him. His lot of longevity will last as long as all nature. (16, tr. Ware 1966: 275-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Jiuchong'' "Nine Worms" broadly means "internal worms and parasites" in the ''Baopuzi'', for instance, (5, tr. Ware 1966: 103), "Eulalia and male fern are vermifuges" [萑蘆貫衆之煞九蟲]. Ge Hong says that medicinal lacquer, instead of mercury, will eliminate the Nine Worms.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If pure, unadulterated lacquer is taken, it will put a man in communication with the gods and let him enjoy Fullness of Life. Directions: Mix it with ten pieces of crab. Take it with mica water, or mixed with jade water. The Nine Insects will then drop from you, and the bad blood will leave you through nose-bleeds [九蟲悉下惡血從鼻去]. After a year, the six-''chia'' gods and the Traveling Canteen will come to you. (11, tr. Ware 1966:190) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Sanshi jiuchong'' "Three Corpses and Nine Worms" is a generic name for "bodily parasites". They can be eliminated with an elixir called ''shendan'' 神丹 "Divine Cinnabar" or ''shenfu'' 神符 "Divine Amulet".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Take it for one hundred days and you will be a genie. To cross streams or pass through fire, smear the soles of your feet with it and you will be able to walk on water. After taking only three spatulas of it you will see that the Three Corpses and the Nine Worms in your body will disappear, and all your illnesses will be cured [三尸九虫皆即消壞百病皆愈也]. (4, tr. Ware 1966: 77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cinnabar, the reddish ore of mercury, is the essential ingredient in many Daoist magical elixirs that expel corpse-worms, most of which (including those above attributed to Xianmenzi, Wu Chengzi, and Shendan) are also said to cure ''bǎibìng'' 百病 "100 sicknesses; all kinds of diseases and ailments". Ge Hong gives the Recipe for Nibbling Melted Gold attributed to Liangyizi 兩儀子 (4, tr. Ware 1966: 96), which involves alternately dipping gold 100 times into boiling hog fat and vinegar, and concludes, "If you wish to take medicine that will banish [the Three Corpses] from your body, you must take cinnabar." For example, the ''xiaodan'' 小丹 "Lesser Elixir",
&lt;blockquote&gt;Take one pound of cinnabar, pestled and sifted, three quarts of strong vinegar, and two quarts of lacquer. Mix these three thoroughly, and cook over a slow fire until the compound can be shaped into pills. Take three, the size of a hempseed, twice daily for thirty days, and all abdominal illnesses will be cured, and the Three Corpses that are in your body will depart [腹中百病愈三尸去]. Take for one hundred days, and your flesh and bones will become strong and sturdy. Take for one thousand days, and the Governor of Fates will strike your name from the Book of Death; you will last as long as all nature, and the sun and moon will always shine on you. You can change shape continuously. You will cast no shadow in the sun, for you will radiate your own light. (4, tr. Ware 1966: 95) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lastly, a ''Baopuzi'' discussion about avoiding illnesses uses what commentators gloss as a variant name for the ''sanshi'' Three Corpses: ''sānshǐ'' 三使 "Three Envoys [of Death]", with ''shǐ'' "send (an envoy); make; cause".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The minor elixirs for recalling a man's ethereal breaths, the pills for countering the three Messenger-corpses [召魂小丹三使之丸], and lesser medicines made from the Five Brilliances and the Eight Minerals will sometimes melt hard ice instantly or keep one afloat in water. They can intercept ghosts and gods, lay tigers and leopards, and disperse accumulations in the digestive system and our organs. They dislodge the two lackeys of illness from the heart region and the diaphragm (Tso, Ch'eng 10.5); they raise those who have just died; return frightened ethereal breaths to the body they had quit. All these are common, everyday medicines. And, if they can still restore the dead to life, why should the superior medicines not be able to make the living immortal? (5, tr. Ware 1966: 102) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This refers to the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' (tr. Legge 1872: 374) recording that after [[Duke Jing of Jin (Ju)|Duke Jing of Jin]] dreamed about being cursed with two boyish disease-demons hiding in his body, he fell into a latrine and died in 581 BCE.

===Shenxian zhuan===
Ge Hong's (c. 3rd-4th century) ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' Daoist hagiography of Liu Gen 劉根 quotes instructions passed from legendary [[Qin dynasty]] ''xian'' Han Zhong 韓眾, which explain how the Three Corpses can cause nightmares.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you desire long life, the first thing you must do is to expel the three corpses. Once the three corpses are expelled, you must fix your aim and your thought, eliminating sensual desires. I [Liu Gen] then received [from Han Zhong the scripture] ''Divine Methods in Five Sections'' (''Shenfang wupian'' 神方五篇) [for this purpose]. It says: "The ambushing corpses always ascend to Heaven to report on people's sins on the first, fifteenth, and last days of each month. The Director of Allotted Life Spans (''Siming'' 司命) deducts from people's accounts and shortens their life spans accordingly. The gods within people's bodies want to make people live, but the corpses want to make them die. When people die, their gods disperse; the corpses, once in this bodiless state, become ghosts, and when people sacrifice to [the dead] these ghosts obtain the offering foods. This is why the corpses want people to die. When you dream of fighting with an evil person, this is [caused by] the corpses and the gods at war [inside you]." So I followed his [or the scripture's?] instructions, synthesized [the elixir] and ingested it, and thereby attained transcendence. (tr. Campany 2002: 51, 245-6) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The (c. 1029) ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' Daoist anthology (tr. Maspero 1981: 333) also describes internal gods and the Three Corpses fighting within the human body, "When in dreams one finds oneself fighting with wicked men, this is the Corpses struggling with the Spirits."

Nightmares were also a significant [[side-effect]] of expelling the Three Corpses through ''bigu'' fasting and poisonous elixirs. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The corpse-demons may manifest themselves in the ascetic’s dreams in the guise of three men garbed in rather old-fashioned costumes. As the program of anti-corpse treatment gets underway and the drugs begin to take effect, the adept will dream that his father or mother has died, or that his wife and children have been murdered. Or else the victims will be his sisters or brothers, or a woman, or he will dream that a grave has been destroyed and the coffin has vanished, or else that he is undergoing the five types of mutilating punishment. All these are said to be indications that the corpse-demons are about to be destroyed. (Strickmann 2002: 78) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Zhouhou beiji fang===
The ''Zhouhou beiji fang'' 肘后备急方 "Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies", which is also attributed to Ge Hong but contains later emendations, lists the ''wǔshī'' 五尸 "Five Corpses"—external corpse-demons that enter the body at the invitation of the Three Corpses.
*The ''fēishī'' 飛尸 "flying corpse", which "roam about a person’s skin and bore through to his inner organs. Their action is manifested in intermittent stabbing pains."
*The ''dùnshī'' 遁尸 "reclusive corpse", which "attaches itself to your bones and so enters your flesh from within. It then burrows into the veins and arteries of your blood; its symptoms break out when it beholds a funeral or hears the sound of wailing." 
*The ''fēngshī'' 風尸 "wind corpse", which "course exuberantly through all four limbs until you are unable to say where exactly the pain is situated. They lead to dizziness and loss of consciousness, and their outbreaks are provoked by wind and snow." 
*The ''chénshī'' 沉尸 "sinking corpse", which "enwraps the vital organs and strikes against the heart and ribs, causing a knotting, slicing sensation there; this happens whenever it encounters cold." 
*The ''shīzhù'' 尸疰 "corpse-infusion" or "corpse-infestation", which "is the dire culmination of the series. The victim feels that his entire body is sunken and weighted down, his vital spirits are in confusion, he is constantly oppressed by feelings of dullness and exhaustion, and the vital breaths are shifting and changing in his body’s every joint." (1, tr. Strickmann 2002: 76-77, cf. Zhang and Unschuld 2014: 543)

===Ziyang zhenren neizhuan===
The (4th century CE) ''Ziyang zhenren neizhuan'' 紫陽真人內傳 "Inner Biography of the True Person of Purple Yang" described the appearance of the Three Corpses and how to eliminate them. Ziyang zhenren is the honorific name of the legendary Daoist ''xian'' Zhou Yishan 周義山 (b. 80 BCE), who supposedly bestowed the Shangqing revelations on [[Yang Xi]] 楊羲 (330-c. 386). According to Zhou's biography, he learned alchemical and dietetic recipes to expel the Three Corpses from his master Su Lin 素林, who had learned them from his masters Qin Gao 琴高 and Qiusheng 生仇. 
*''Qīnggǔ'' 青古 "Old Blue" dwells in the Muddy Pellet Palace within the Upper Dantian, "It is he who makes men blind, or deaf, or bald, who makes the teeth fall out, who stops up the nose and gives bad breath."
*''Bái gū'' 白姑 "White Maiden" dwells in the Crimson Palace within the Middle Field, "She causes palpitations of the heart, asthma, and melancholy."
*''Xuè shī'' 血尸 "Bloody Corpse" dwells in the Lower Dantian, "It is through him that the intestines are painfully twisted, that the bones are dried out, that the skin withers, that the limbs have rheumatisms..." (tr. Maspero 1981:332)
This Shangqing text records a widely quoted recipe, attributed to Zhou Yishan, for killing the Three Worms/Corpses. It combines 7 drugs: 7/10 of a bushel of hemp-seeds, 7 ounces of ''[[Smilax]]'', 6 ounces of ''[[Rehmannia glutinosa]]'', 5 ounces of [[aconitine|aconite]], 5 ounces of cloud-shaped [[agaric]] mushrooms, 4 ounces of cinnamon, and a 7-inch long ''[[Zanthoxylum]]'' root.  Then, one boils a root of ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' in 1 1/2 bushels of wine to produce pure essential liquor. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Soak the seven drugs in this, then decant the mixture into a vase; but that will still not do. After leaving the drugs to macerate for three nights, take them out and put them in the sun to dry out. (Then) again take the aforesaid liquor and steep (the seven drugs) in it for three nights. Once more draw off (the wine) from them and put them in the sun (and continue this alternative steeping in the wine and drying them) until the wine is exhausted; then stop putting them out to dry. Pound them in an iron mortar and put them through a fine sieve to reduce them to powder. Then take white honey and mix the powder with it for making pills. In the morning, facing East, roll two pills the size of a small pea; then increase this by one pill (each day) to ten or more. This regimen cures third-degree fever within the belly, it truly makes the breath rise up in such a way that the heart and breast are freed of all obstruction, coagulates the flesh and skin, makes the body light and produces a halo around it. When a whole dose has been taken, the cereal Worms die; when the Worms are dead the Corpses dry out; when they are dry, they drop down by themselves. This has to be done several times, not restricting oneself to a single dose. (tr. Maspero 1981: 336)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Taishang Lingbao wufuxu===
[[File:Flora Sinensis - Pepper.JPG|thumb|Illustration of ''hújiāo'' 胡椒 "''[[Piper nigrum]]'', black pepper" and ''fúlíng'' 茯苓 "''[[Wolfiporia extensa]]'', China-root fungus", from [[Michael Boym]]'s (1656) ''[[Flora Sinensis]]''.]]
The (c. 400 CE) ''Taishang Lingbao wufuxu'' 太上靈寶五符序 "Explanations of the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans" or ''Wufuxu'', compiled by the [[Lingbao School]] founder [[Ge Chaofu]], describes various techniques for expelling the Three Corpses/Worms.

The ''Wufuxu'' uses both ''sanchong'' "Three Worms" and ''fushi'' "Concealed Corpses" as interchangeable names for the malevolent beings residing in the human body, interpreted as either the reconciliation of regional [[varieties of Chinese]] names or the conflation of common names with religious terms. Among the 11 ''Wufuxu'' recipes for expelling corpse-worms, 6 mention ''sanchong fushi'' 三蟲伏尸 integrating two previously separate names for similar ideas, which allows the text to address both readers familiar with the Three Worms concept as well as those who knew of the Concealed, or Three, Corpses (Campany 2005, 43). "The Immortal's Method for Expelling the Three Worms and Concealed Corpses" (tr. Arthur 2013: 80) explicates the worm/corpse synonymy: "[T]he Concealed Corpses which live in people's abdomens limit the powers of medicines. [ ... ] This is all caused by the Three Worms. [ ... ] Simple commoners laugh at these things; therefore after people die they become 'Corpse' bones. This is the nickname of the Three Worms."

Among ''Wufuxu'' prescriptions for eliminating the Three Worms/Corpses, the primary [[anthelmintic]] herbs (Eskildsen 1998: 60, Arthur 2013: 87) are: ''shānglù'' 商陸 "''[[Phytolacca|Phytolacca rivinoides]]'', pokeweed" root, ''tiānméndōng'' 天門冬 "''[[Asparagus (genus)#Selected species|Asparagus cochinchinensis]]'', asparagus" root, ''huángjīng'' 黄精 "''[[Polygonatum#Species|Polygonatum sibiricum]]'', Solomon's seal", and ''fúlíng'' 茯苓 "''[[Wolfiporia extensa]]'', China-root fungus" (often misidentified as "''[[Smilax glabra]]'', sarsaparilla"). Pokeweed—which the ''Wufuxu'' says is effective alone or in combination with other medicinal herbs—is poisonous for humans, with the highest toxicity in the roots, yet it has been used in folk medicine as a purgative, emetic, diuretic, and hunger suppressant. Pokeweed root, asparagus root, and Solomon's seal all contain chemical compounds called [[saponins]], which are poisons that irritate the [[gastric mucosa]] and thus can dislodge any intestinal parasites (Arthur 2013: 87).

"The Immortal's Method for Expelling the Three Worms and Concealed Corpses" (mentioned above) claims taking pokeweed root pills will make the Three Worms decompose and come out in the host's feces. The instructions say to mix pokeweed, China-root fungus, alcohol, wheat flour, and yeast, and to seal this in an earthenware jar for 20 days. Once fermented, the adept mixes this with boiled beans in order to make large pills the size of chicken egg yolks.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Daily ingest three pills for thirty days in order to expel [the Three Worms] and to gain a few benefits. The Upper Deathbringer [takes] one hundred days. The Middle Deathbringer [takes] sixty days. The Lower Deathbringer [takes] thirty days. [As they leave,] rotten smells will emerge: the Upper Deathbringer will smell like animal hair, the Middle Deathbringer will smell like feet, and the Lower Deathbringer will smell like a [rotten] chicken egg. The Upper Deathbringer will be black, the Middle Deathbringer will be dark blue-green (''qing'' 青), and the Lower Deathbringer will be white. (tr. Arthur 2013: 89)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The context (tr. Eskildsen 1998: 61) concludes that once the Three Worms are removed, the adept "never again feels hungry nor thirsty, and his heart is calm and free of thoughts".

The ''Taishang Lingbao wufuxu'' (tr. Arthur 2013: 78) cites Ge Hong that his great-uncle [[Ge Xuan]] transmitted a recipe containing Solomon's-seal, and said that "all the various ways to cultivate long life must begin with expelling the Three Worms and flushing out the Concealed Corpses".

While most ''Wufuxu'' methods for expelling the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe attributed to the Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, "Pluck peach leaves on the third day of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." One anomalous ''Wufuxu'' method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. "The Recipe of [[Chisongzi|Master Redpine]]" (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, "When you cut the nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines." Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that  cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the [[Ghost Festival]] that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.

===Hou Hanshu===
The (c. 445) ''Hou Hanshu'' "[[Book of the Later Han]]" (6-189 CE) mentions removing the Three Worms twice in the Biographies of ''[[Fangshi]]'' section (82B). The biography of the acupuncturist A Shan 阿善 says he lived to an age of over 100 years using the method of [[Hua Tuo]] 華佗, a famous physician who introduced surgical anesthesia, to remove the Three Worms. This prescription uses green leaves from a lacquer tree, which taken continuously will remove the Three Worms, benefit the internal organs, lighten the body, and prevent hair from turning white [言久服去三蟲利五藏輕體使人頭不白].

The biography of [[Fei Changfang]] 費長房 tells how he met the Daoist ''xian'' Xie Yuanyi 謝元一 who offered to teach him the Way.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;Fei Changfang then followed the old man deep into the mountains. Penetrating into dense underbrush, they found themselves in the midst of a group of tigers, and the old man left Fei alone there, but he was not afraid. Then they reclined in a chamber in which a thousand-catty stone hung by a single length of old twine directly over Fei's heart. A mass of snakes appeared and gnawed on the twine till it was about to be severed, but Fei did not budge. The old man then returned, patted him and said "You're teachable!" Then the old man directed him to eat a pile of terribly foul-smelling excrement full of the three worms in it [糞中有三蟲], but Fei thought it too despicable. The old man then said, "You almost attained the Way, but unfortunately you have failed to complete it at this point. What a pity!" (82, tr. Campany 2002: 166) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Zhen'gao===
The (c. 499) ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 "Declarations of the Perfected" is a collection of Shangqing materials edited by [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536) as part of the Shangqing canon, based upon the notes of Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-386) and his patrons Xu Mai 許邁 (300-348) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376).

''Nü xianren Liu Gang qi koujue'' 女仙人劉綱妻口訣 "The Oral Lesson of the Female Immortal, the wife of Liu Gang" explains how the Three Corpses in the bodies of men and women lust and mingle with each other, regardless of their conscious intentions. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who seek immortality must not associate with women. On the ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month, [they] should remain in their rooms and make sure not to look at women. If the Six Corpses (the Three Corpses of the adept himself and of the woman that he looks at?) cause chaos, the blood in your viscera will be disturbed and aroused, your three ''hun'' souls will be unguarded. Your spirit will weaken and your ''qi'' will leave. All of these [factors] will accumulate, and bring about death. As for why you avoid [women] on these days, it is not only to block off lasciviousness. It is [also] to pacify the female palaces. The female palaces are in the ''shen'' and the male palaces are in the ''yin''. ''Yin'' and ''shen'' punish each other. Both execute each other. On these days the Three Corpses of men and women come out from the pupils of the eyes. Female Corpses beckon the male, and male Corpses beckon the female. Misfortune and harm pass back and forth, making the spirit perish and thus blemishing your rectitude. Even if a person does not notice it, his body is exposed and has already been harmed because the Three Corpses fight within the eyes, while blood is shed within the ''Niwan'' (a compartment in the brain). On these days, even if it is a girl who you are extremely fond of, or a wife of a close friend, you absolutely must not look them face to face. My predecessor and teacher became an Immortal by simply practicing this method. The [prescription] does not apply to [your] closest of relatives to whom you have no thoughts [of sexual attraction]. (tr. Eskildsen 1998: 76) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Chu sanshi jiuchong baoshengjing===
The (c. 9th century) ''Chu sanshi jiuchong baoshengjing'' 除三尸九蟲保生經 "Scripture on Expelling the Three Corpses and Nine Worms to Protect Life" contains illustrations and comprehensive discussions of the various corpse-worms, and gives methods for expelling them from the body. The text likely originated in the [[Sichuan]] region, and its original illustrations were attributed to a student of the famous Tang doctor [[Sun Simiao]] (581-682 CE) (Arthur 2013: 81).

The ''Baoshengjing'' gives the [[Chinese names]] of the death-hastening Three Corpse brothers, who share the [[Peng (surname)]] [[wikt:彭|彭]] "sound of a drum; strength"—compare the God of Longevity named [[Peng Zu]] 彭祖.
*The Upper Corpse, Péng Jū 彭琚 [...] lives in the upper part of the head and attacks people's ''Niwan Dantian'' 泥丸丹田  [the upper energy locus in the center of the head where Daoists claim many of the corporeal deities reside]. It makes peoples' heads heavy, eyes blur with cold tears, noses fill with green mucus, ears deaf, teeth fall out, [...] and faces wrinkle. It causes good people, wealthy people, and rebellious people all to be regarded as evil and dirty. 
*The Middle Corpse, Péng Zhì 彭瓚 [...] is good at corrupting the five flavors, and it desires the five colors. It resides in the heart and stomach. It attacks the Red Palace [the middle energy locus at the level of the heart] and burns the inside. It causes peoples' hearts to be confused and always forgetful. With very little supportive ''qi'', [people] become exhausted and subsequently fall over, see wild things, become depressed, and become dehydrated. It will make the mouth dry and the eyes white [indicating cataracts and blindness], and it will chisel at peoples' teeth. Day and night it tries to subdue and destroy its host. All of one's organs will become diseased.
*The Lower Corpse, Péng Jiǎo 彭矯 [...] lives in peoples' stomachs and legs. It attacks peoples' lower extremities and injures and disperses the Ocean of Qi (氣海) [the lower energy storage field located three finger-widths below the navel]. It causes people to develop the hundred illnesses, to begin thinking injurious and rebellious thoughts, to desire women, to be daring and zealous, to become addicted to lust, to be offensive, to wantonly destroy things, and to be unable to control themselves. (tr. Arthur 2013: 81)
This text's woodblock illustrations depict the Upper Corpse as a male scholar or corrupt court official, the Middle as a short quadruped resembling a [[Chinese guardian lion]], and the Lower Corpse as "a monster that looks like a horse's leg with a horned human head" (tr. Maspero 1981: 333, Campany 2005: 43-44).

The text differentiates the mythological Three Corpses from the intestinal ''jiǔchóng'' 九蟲 "Nine Worms", which seem to be based on observations of harmful parasites such as roundworms or tapeworms (Cook 2008: 844). The text explains that the Nine Worms are the physical counterparts of and acting agents for the Three Corpses (Arthur 2013: 82). They are:
*The "ambush worm" (''fuchong'' 伏蟲) saps people's strength by feeding off their essence and blood.
*The "coiling worm" (''huichong'' 蛔蟲 [now meaning "[[roundworm]]"]) infests the body in pairs of male and female that live above and below the heart, consuming their host's blood.
*The "inch-long white worm" (''cun baichong'' 寸白蟲) chews into the stomach, weakening the inner organs and damaging the digestive tract.
*The "flesh worm" (''rouchong'' 肉蟲) causes itching and weakens the sinews and back. 
*The "lung worm" (''feichong'' 肺蟲) causes coughing, phlegm buildup, and difficulty in breathing.
*The "stomach worm" (''weichong'' 胃蟲) consumes food from its host's stomach, causing hunger.
*The "obstructing [or "diaphragm"] worm" (''gechong'' 膈蟲) dulls the senses, induces drowsiness, and causes nightmares.
*The "red worm" (''chichong'' 赤蟲) causes stagnation of the blood and pneuma, heaviness in the waist, and ringing in the ears.
*The "wriggling worm" (''qiaochong'' 蹺蟲) causes itching sores on the skin and tooth decay. (tr. Cook 2008: 846)

The ''Baoshengjing'' describes the ''sanhun'' 三魂 "Three ''hun''-souls" in the human body and how to meditate on them. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The three spirit souls are located beneath the liver. They look like human beings and wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go wandering about. At this time, lie down with your feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart about the size of an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: "Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!" (1, 7, tr. Kohn 2009: 168) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The text also describes countless ''weichong'' 微蟲 "micro organic worms", which resemble ''caizi'' 菜子 "vegetable seeds", residing on the surface of the body (Huang 2011: 40).

===Zhonghuang jing===
The (9th century) [[Quanzhen School]] text ''Zhonghuang jing'' 中皇經 "Classic of the Yellow Center" describes how an arduous ''bigu'' fasting regimen can result in weakness, loss of weight, yellowish complexion, and problems with the Three Worms.
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the adept first begins to fast, the air he swallows does not penetrate sufficiently, and he is constantly subjected to the mischief of the Three Worms. This causes frequent moods of depression and anxiety. He also becomes easily tempted to indulge in sensual or culinary pleasures. He must therefore make a constant effort to resist and overcome these woes and temptations. Quoting a certain ''Taishang shengxuan jing'', the commentary explains that the fast is a process during which the Three Worms are successively exterminated; the Upper Worm dies after thirty days, the Middle Worm dies after sixty days, and the Lower Worm dies after ninety days. After 100 days, the adept's body becomes healthy and strong, and his mind becomes "pure." He is no longer in danger of falling prey to his desires. When this stage is reached, the adept can see the "Five Sprouts," or the ''qi'' of his five viscera, which also are described as the "proper ''qi'' of the five agents." (Eskildsen 1998: 46) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins==
Scholars are unclear as to when the Three Corpse-Worms concept was first developed, and the best estimates are during the [[Western Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 9 CE).

Arthur (2013: 80) outlines the historical changes from the Three Worms as intestinal parasites to the Three Corpses as sin-reporting officials in the celestial bureaucracy. In one of the earliest discussions, the (1st century CE) ''Lunheng'' envisioned the Three Worms as actual parasites that gnaw through the human intestines in the way that leeches gnaw through the feet. Later 3rd and 4th century Daoist texts such as the ''Baopuzi'' renamed the Three Worms as the Three Corpses, developed ideas about religious characteristics of these parasites, and retooled them into "supernatural beings with physical and ephemeral spirit components that are capable of exerting directed efforts to hasten the body's death."

Converging evidence from textual records and parasite physiology support the hypothesis that the Three Worms/Corpses concept originated over 2000 years ago.

Toshiaki Yamada (1989: 107; cited by Campany 2005: 44 and Arthur 2013: 81) suggests that the Three Worms originated during the 1st-2nd century BCE early Han period. Both the ''Baopuzi'' and ''Wufuxu'' cite worm-expelling techniques from [[Apocrypha#Confucianism and Taoism|apocryphal Han texts]] associated with Chisongzi "Master Redpine" and Lezichang. These two semi-historical Daoist masters are frequently mentioned in connection with [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BCE), who wanted to become a Daoist immortal and employed numerous [[Taoist priest]]s 道士  "Daoist priest; fortune teller; diviner" and ''[[fangshi]]'' 方士 "alchemist; exorcist; doctor; magician".

Some scholars hypothesize that the Three Worms may have originated from the observation of parasites in human excrement. Campany (2002: 166) interprets the ''Hou Hanshu'' story about Master Xie Yuanyi telling Fei Changfang that he would never become a ''xian''-immortal because he refused to eat "terribly foul-smelling excrement full of the three worms", figuratively denoting the prerequisite of expelling the Three Worms from his body. Arthur (2013: 79) observes that, "Likely evidence for these worms was plentiful in people's feces, especially those of starving people, because many intestinal worms will evacuate the digestive system if they are not able to ingest enough sustenance. Otherwise, when intestinal parasites grow large, portions of them will break off and be evacuated with the feces, thus providing additional tangible evidence of their existence."

==Japanese Kōshin==
{{Main|Kōshin}}
The Japanese folk tradition of [[Kōshin]] (namely, the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of ''gengshen'' 庚申 "57th of the 60-day cycle") combines the Daoist Three Corpses with [[Shintō]] and [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] beliefs, including the [[Three Wise Monkeys]]. People attend ''Kōshin-Machi'' 庚申待 "57th Day Waiting" events to stay awake all night and prevent the ''Sanshi'' 三尸 "Three Corpses" from leaving the body and reporting misdeeds to heaven.

The '''Tree of Immortality''' (Arabic: شجرة الخلود ''Shajarat al-Kholoud'') is the [[tree of life]] motif as it appears in the [[Quran]]. It is also alluded to in [[hadith]]s and [[tafsir]]. Unlike the [[Tree of life (biblical)|biblical account]], the Quran mentions only one tree in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to [[Adam and Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;Brannon Wheeler Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis 0826449565 2002  Page 24 "Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet [[Muhammad]] said: "In Paradise is a tree in the shade of which the stars course 100 years without cutting it: the Tree of Immortality." "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman ''The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia'' 0415326397, 2006, p.11 "Unlike the biblical account of Eden, the Qur'an mentions only one special tree in Eden, the Tree of Immortality, from which Adam and Eve were prohibited."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satan]], disguised as a serpent, repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah.&lt;ref&gt; Three Translations of the Koran (Al-Qur'an) Side by Side "Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away? S: But the Shaitan made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam! Shall I guide you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which decays not? "&lt;/ref&gt; The hadiths however speak about other trees in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Maulana Muhammad Ali Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur'an 2011 "This in itself gives an indication that it is the well-known tree of evil, for both good and evil are compared to two trees in 14:24, 25 and elsewhere. This is further corroborated by the devil's description of it as “the tree of immortality” (20:120), ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acharya Vijayanand Suri''' (1837–1896), also known as '''Atmaramji of [[Gujranwala]]''', was the first [[Swetambar]] [[Murtipujaka]] [[Jain]] monk in modern times to receive the title of [[Acharya]].&lt;ref&gt;Mangilal Bhutoria, Itihas ki Amar Bel- Oswal, Priyadarshi Prakashan, Calcutta, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cort2009" /&gt; Born and raised in [[Punjab]], he was initiated as [[Sthanakvasi]] monk who later joined Murtipujaka tradition. He travelled extensively in [[Gujarat]], [[Rajputana]] and Punjab; and organised and reformed Jain community, ascetic orders and literature. He wrote several books in Hindi and was invited to the first World Parliament of Religions in 1893 which was attended by [[Virchand Gandhi]] later.

==Early life==

{{Jainism}}
He was born on 6 April 1837 CE (Chaitra Shukla 1 [[Vikram Samvat]] 1893) in [[Lehara]], Punjab to Ganeshchandra and Rupdevi. He was born in a [[Brahmakshatriya]] Hindu family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1835357M/The_Chicago_prashnottar_or_questions_and_answers_on_Jainism_for_the_Parliament_of_Religions_held_at_  The Chicago prashnottar, or questions and answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago, U.S.A. in 1893 1st ed. by Ātmānanda,  Published by Atmanand Jain Pustak Pracharak Mandal, Agra, 1918 ]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an army official of [[Ranjit Singh]]. His father died in his early childhood and he was raised by his mother. He was given to Sheth Jodhmal of Jira, Punjab for education in VS 1903. He studied  Hindi and arithmetic. He came into contact with Sthanakvasi monks during his school life. A couple of influential Sthanakavasi monks initiated him in 1853 (VS 1910) at the age of sixteen and was given the name of Atmaram.&lt;ref name="Cort2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cort|title=Framing the Jina : Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDBpq23-0QoC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=June 24, 2013|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973957-8|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

==Ascetic career==
[[File:Shrine of Vijayanandsuri Atmaramji Gujranwala.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial shrine in [[Gujranwala]], now used as police station of Sabzi Mandi area. From Chicago Prashnottar, 1918]]
&lt;!---[[File:Wall Painting unknown Sikh era architecture Parao road, Gujranwala..jpg|thumb|left|Modern Wall Painting, sign "Thana Sabzi Mandi, Guzaranwala". It is now a police station.]]---&gt;
Atmaram began the study of Jain scriptures along with his fellow ascetics. He was later joined by a ''Yati'' of [[Tapa Gaccha]] lineage. After several years of study, he was convinced that the Sthanakavasi position of opposition of Idol-worshiping contradicted the scriptures.&lt;ref name="Cort2009" /&gt; Later in 1876 (VS 1943), he was initiated again as a Murtipujaka monk in [[Ahmedabad]] by Muni Buddhivijay, also known as Buterayji of Tapa Gaccha who himself was Sthanakvasi monk before. He was given a new name, Anandvijay.

In 1886, he was conferred the title of [[Acharya]] by the [[Sangha (Jainism)|congregation]] of [[Palitana]] during his [[Chaturmas]] (four months stay during rainy season) there. This was a notable event because since four centuries, there wasn't an ascetic who was conferred with the title of Acharya. He was the first Acharya of contemporary Jain history as till then only ''Yati''s were conferred with the title.&lt;ref name="University2001"/&gt; As a result of reforms advocated by him, the influence of [[yati]]s  declined, although the  yatis still survive in some locations.&lt;ref&gt;The Penguin Handbook of the World's Living Religions
Penguin reference library, Penguin UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled extensively in Gujarat and Punjab. He convinced to open Jain Bhandaras (libraries) with Jain literature  kept closed for people since years and had texts copied and examined by scholars. He brought these literature to light and instilled sense of identity among Jains. In 1893, he was invited to participate in the first ever [[Parliament of the World's Religions#1893 Parliament|World Parliament of Religions]] at [[Chicago]] and since Jain monks do not travel overseas he sent [[Virchand Gandhi]] to United States to participate in the World Parliament of Religions. He won silver medal in 1893 at Chicago and was covered by many USA periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Jainism: The World of Conquerors By Natubhai Shah, 1998 Sussex Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Based on questions that he had received from the organizers of the Parliament, he wrote a book for the occasion entitled ''The Chicago-Prashnottar'' or ''Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893''. He was instrumental in reviving the tradition of fully initiated monks (''Samvegi sadhu''). He also convinced many Sthankvasis in the Punjab to join the Murtipujaka tradition. About 15000 people converted to Jainism due to his efforts. He also encouraged the construction and renovation of Jain temples. He had helped orientalist [[Rudolf Hoernlé]] in his studies on Jainism.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

He died in [[Gujranwala]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) on 20 May 1896 (Jayeshtha Shukla 13 VS 1953).&lt;ref name="University2001"/&gt; A memorial shrine dedicated to him was built there,&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt; which is now used as a police station of Sabzi Mandi area. His footprints along with the ''chhatri'' (cenotaph) over them, are moved to [[Lahore Fort]] Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8047/8112713857_fc1c0c0fa8_b.jpg  Foot prints of Atmaram ji]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He wrote a number of books in Hindi, including ''The Chicago-Prashnottar'' or ''Questions and Answers on Jainism for the Parliament of Religions Held at Chicago USA in 1893'' which was translated into English and published in 1918. His other important works are ''Jain Tattvadarsh'', ''Agyana Timira Bhaskara'', ''Samyaktva-shalyadwara'' and ''Tattva Nirnaya Prāsād''.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

==Legacy==
He used to give more importance to education and established several libraries and ''Pathshala'' (religious schools) in Punjab. Later [[Vallabhsuri]], his disciple, built many schools, hospitals and educational institutes. He was given the title of ''Navyug Nirmata'' (builder of a new era) by Vallabhsuri.&lt;ref name="CP"/&gt;

His monkhood lineage has large number of ascetics which roughly covers {{1/4}} of all current ascetics of Tapa Gaccha. Major ascetic groupings are Atma-Vallabh Samuday, Prem-Ramchandra Suri and Prem-Bhuvanbhanu Suri Samuday.&lt;ref name="Cort2009" /&gt;

'''Zhao Yingcheng''' 赵映乘 ([[Hebrew name]]: ''Moshe ben Abram'';&lt;ref name = "Pollack 4"&gt;Michael Pollack, "The Jews of Kaifeng", p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; 1619–1657?) was a Chinese scholar and [[mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. He and his brother '''Zhao Yingdou''', also a mandarin, held important government posts in the 1660s.&lt;ref&gt;Li Yu, ''A History of Reading in Late Imperial China, 1000–1800'', pp. 257–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Proficient in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Zhao, from the province of Henan, obtained the ''[[Imperial examination|jinshi]]'' degree in 1646. He was named director of the Ministry of Justice. Four years later he was sent to [[Fujian]] and [[Huguang]] as an official. He was remembered as an efficient administrator and excellent Confucian scholar who exterminated local bandits and founded schools.&lt;ref name = "Li 258"&gt;Li Yu, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642, near the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Kaifeng]] was flooded by the Ming army with water from the [[Yellow River]] to prevent the peasant rebel [[Li Zicheng]] from taking over. After this disaster, the city was abandoned. The synagogue of the [[Kaifeng Jews|Kaifeng Jewish community]] (reportedly dating from 1163) was destroyed, and the Jews took refuge on the north side of the Yellow River. They took with them the Torah scrolls, which had been saved after having been thrown into the river, though they had grown moldy and illegible.

Ten years later, Zhao was detailed to restore the city. With the aid of his brother, Zhao Yingdou (赵映斗), he induced the Jews to recross the river and take up their old quarters. The temple was rebuilt in 1653, with the personal financial support of Zhao, who had grown rich from land speculation and prostitution.&lt;ref name = "Li 258" /&gt; One complete scroll of the Law was made up out of the fragments which had been saved from the river, and other copies were made from this. A stone stele dated 1663 was afterward erected, giving the details of Zhao Yingcheng's action.

Zhao wrote an account of the saving of the scrolls and the rebuilding of the temple, ''Record of the Vicissitudes of the Holy Scriptures''. His brother wrote ''Preface to the Illustrious Way'', believed to be an exposition of the tenets of [[Judaism]]. Both works are now lost, although in recent years Chinese scholars have begun a search for them in the libraries of Kaifeng, [[Beijing]], and elsewhere.&lt;ref name = "Pollack 4" /&gt;

All known descendants of Zhao are recorded to have perished from dysentery by the 17th century.
