== Facts ==
The plaintiffs were Ronni Alexander, Margery Reifler, Pamela Price, Lisa E. Stone and [[Ann Olivarius]]. All were [[Yale College]] students between 1973 and 1980.

Alexander and Reifler alleged that they were sexually harassed by a flute teacher ([[Keith Brion]]) and hockey coach, respectively, and that Yale provided no procedure through which they could complain. Pamela Price alleged a classic case of what is now known as quid pro quo sexual harassment, when a course instructor offered to give her an ‘A’ if she complied with his sexual demands. Lisa Stone alleged that her discussions with a fellow female student who had been harassed and could not make a complaint distressed her and deprived her of the tranquil atmosphere necessary to her education. Ann Olivarius alleged that the absence of a procedure for complaining about sexual harassment forced her to expend her own time and money on helping fellow students who had been sexually harassed, and that in the course of providing that help she was threatened by individuals whom she was investigating, and that Yale failed to protect her from those individuals.

At the district court level, a male faculty member and Lisa Stone's thesis adviser, John Winkler, alleged that the poisoned atmosphere arising from sexual harassment made a good relationship with his students impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Allen, To break the silence.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not join the other plaintiffs’ appeal.

The plaintiffs did not seek damages from Yale. Rather, they wanted the court to order Yale to set up a grievance procedure for students who felt they had been sexually harassed.

== Decisions ==
The students were advised by [[Catharine MacKinnon]], who had just graduated from Yale Law School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/mackinnon.html&lt;/ref&gt;  MacKinnon was working on her groundbreaking book, ''Sexual Harassment of Working Women'', and shared pre-publication copies with the Women’s Rights Litigation Clinic at Rutgers Law School, which represented Alexander and her co-plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Olsen, Feminist Theory in Grand Style, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1147, 1147 &amp; n.4 (1989) (citing Conversation with Professor Nadine Taub, attorney with Rutgers Law School Women's Rights Litigation Clinic who litigated early sexual harassment cases (July 1985))&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Alexander v. Yale'' was an early test of MacKinnon’s theory that sexual harassment constituted sex discrimination.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

The plaintiffs argued that sexual harassment constituted sex discrimination and that Yale University was thus in contravention of Title IX, which stated that educational institutions receiving federal money could not discriminate on the basis of sex. This novel legal strategy, which made use of Title IX, was developed by MacKinnon, Olivarius (then still an undergraduate), and Anne E. Simon, then working for the New Haven Law Collective and now a California Public Utilities Commission Administrative Law Judge.&lt;ref&gt;For Simon's account of the case, see “Alexander v. Yale University: An Informal History,” Directions in Sexual Harassment Law, Catherine A. MacKinnon and Reva B. Siegel, eds, 2007, Yale University Press, pp. 51-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  The District Court upheld their legal argument, ruling that, “It is perfectly reasonable to maintain that academic advancement conditioned upon submission to sexual demands constitutes sex discrimination in education.” The Court, however, found that Price had not been sexually propositioned in exchange for better grades. It dismissed the other plaintiffs’ allegations as either moot because they had graduated, or untenable.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

The women appealed. [[Equal Rights Advocates]] (ERA) and Women Organized Against Sexual Harassment (WOASH) filed a joint friend-of-the-court brief when ''Alexander v. Yale'' was appealed.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie N. Baker, The women’s movement against sexual harassment, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another amicus brief was filed jointly by the [[ACLU]] and others.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}  The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the judgment of the lower court, holding in addition that the allegations were no longer relevant because Yale had instituted a grievance procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander v. Yale, 631 F.2d 178 (2nd Cir. 1980) II. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Although the women did not win their case, they achieved their objectives: Yale instituted a grievance procedure and a court held that sexual harassment constituted sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander v. Yale, 631 F.2d 178 (2nd Cir. 1980) II. 4&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
As a result of Alexander v. Yale most U.S. universities instituted grievance procedures for sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine MacKinnon and Reva Siegel, eds. Directions in Sexual Harassment Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case received media coverage in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Diane Henry ‘Yale Faculty Members Charged With Sexual Harassment in Suit’ ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;‘The Law: Man and Bod at Yale’ ''Time'', August 8, 1977. ‘Sexes: Fighting Lechery on Campus’ ''Time'', February 4, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[The Nation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Anne Nelson ‘Sexual Harassment at Yale’ ''The Nation'', January 7, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to the emerging concept of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie N. Baker The women’s movement against sexual harassment, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled, in [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]], that a hostile work environment constituted sexual discrimination, vindicating another line of argument in Alexander v. Yale.&lt;ref&gt;Ashlyn K. Kuersten Women and the Law: leaders, cases, and documents, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the five plaintiffs – [[Ann Olivarius]], Pamela Price and Ronni Alexander – have gone on to be prominent attorneys or law professors.

In April 2012, the plaintiffs were collectively honored by the [[ACLU]] in its list of the nine most influential actors in the history of Title IX.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/title-ix-nine&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Events leading to World War I}}
The [[arms race]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[German Empire]] that occurred from the last decade of the nineteenth century until the advent of [[World War I]] in 1914 was one of the intertwined [[causes of World War I|causes of that conflict]]. While based in [[Germany–United Kingdom relations|a bilateral relationship]] that had worsened over many decades, the arms race began with a plan by German Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] in 1897 to create a [[fleet in being]] to force Britain to make diplomatic concessions; Tirpitz did not expect the [[Imperial German Navy]] to defeat the [[Royal Navy]]. 

With the support of Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Tirpitz began passing [[German Naval Laws|a series of laws]] to construct an increasing number of a large [[Surface combatant|surface warships]]. The construction of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906 prompted Tirpitz to further increase the rate of naval construction. While some British observers were uneasy at German naval expansion, alarm was not general until Germany's naval bill of 1908. The British public and political opposition demanded that [[Liberal government, 1905–1915|the Liberal government]] meet the German challenge, resulting in the funding of additional [[dreadnought]]s in 1910 and escalating the arms race.

Maintaining Europe's largest army and second-largest Navy took an enormous toll on Germany's finances. [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], German Chancellor from 1909, undertook a policy of [[détente]] with Britain to alleviate the fiscal strain and focus on the rivalry with [[France]]. Under Bethmann-Hollweg, and particularly from 1912 onwards, Germany abandoned the dreadnought arms race and focused on a [[commerce raiding]] naval strategy to be conducted [[U-boat|with submarines]].

==Background==
{{more|Alfred von Tirpitz}}
Britain had the largest navy in the world and its policy was to ensure the Royal Navy was at least the size of the next two largest navies, known as the [[History of the Royal Navy#Two-power standard|two-power standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Cavanagh Hodge|title=Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5zTkGKy4wEC&amp;pg=PA549|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood |page=549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's economy was dependent on the ability to ship in raw materials and export out a finished product. By 1900, 58% of calories consumed by Britain's population came from overseas, meaning that an inability to guarantee free movement on the seas would result in food shortages. Even before the German naval challenge, British political and military leaders mused about catastrophic economic, social, and political consequences if the Royal Navy could not guarantee British freedom of action. Worry about Britain's ability to defend itself became the focus of the [[invasion literature]] genre, which began in 1871, remained popular to World War I, and was highly influential on public opinion.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

[[File:North Sea map-en.png|thumb|left|The [[North Sea]]]]
The first [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] of united Germany [[Otto von Bismarck]] had skillfully guided Germany's foreign relations so it was not firmly attached to any other European power. After his departure in 1890, Germany's foreign policy drifted into deeper commitment with the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Italy]]. [[Friedrich von Holstein]] of the German Foreign Office convinced the new Chancellor, [[Leo von Caprivi]], to not renew the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with the [[Russian Empire]] in 1890. Bismarck had designed the Reinsurance Treaty to keep Russia from an alliance with France; the Russian search for allies who could finance their enormous debts resulted in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] several years later. Holstein had hoped that the lapsing of the Reinsurance Treaty would result in a closer relationship with Britain, which was competing with both Russia and France, which did not occur. From 1890 to 1897, Germany wavered between pro-British and pro-Russian policies, reflecting the incoherence of German leadership.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}

In 1890, American naval historian [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] published ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', the single most important work in [[naval strategy]]. Mahan argued that sea power was the deciding factor that allowed strong nations to thrive and impose their will on weaker nations, and that the proper way to achieve naval supremacy was large-scale battle between fleets. At the time, the [[Imperial German Navy]] subscribed to the [[commerce raiding]] theory of navy strategy, but Mahan's arguments had enormous influence over subsequent German and British thinking. 

Translated into German by Admiral [[Ludwig Borckenhagen]] who supported Mahan's ideas, a copy of the book was placed in every German naval vessel. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] immediately subscribed to Mahan's ideas after reading his book in 1894 and sought [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] funding to implement them.&lt;ref&gt;Holger H. Herwig, ''The Influence of A.T. Mahan upon German Sea Power'' (U.S. Naval War College, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C1743, Alfred von Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|upright|German Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] was the primary architect of the strategy of creating a "[[fleet in being]]" to force concessions from Britain after 1897]]
The Reichstag funded four of the thirty-six cruisers that Wilhelm requested in 1895, and none at all the following two years. Frustrated at being rebuffed, Wilhelm recalled [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] from his duties in the Far East to be the Secretary of State of the [[German Imperial Naval Office]] in 1897. Tirpitz was a follower of anti-British nationalist [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] as well as Alfred Thayer Mahan's ideas on the primacy of battle fleets. In 1894, he wrote a famous memorandum section titled, "The Natural Purpose of a Fleet is the Strategic Offensive," dismissing commerce raiding and coastal defense, and arguing that Germany must prepare for offensive sea battle to ensure its place in the world.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}

In his first meeting with Wilhelm in June 1897, Tirpitz stated his case that Germany must confront Britain to ensure its place as a European power. He also outlined a strategy that he would follow for many years: build a German navy strong enough that the effort to destroy it would open Britain to attack from Britain's French and Russian rivals, which is a form of Mahan's "[[fleet in being]]".{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}} Tirpitz calculated that since the British navy was scattered to protect its possessions around the globe, "it comes to a battleship war between [[Heligoland]] and [[River Thames|the Thames]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epkenhans|first=M.| title=Tirpitz: Architect of the German High Seas Fleet |date=2008| location=Washington, DC|version=Kindle version| pages=loc. 427-31|postscript=, in {{harvnb|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}}} &lt;/ref&gt; Both Tirpitz and [[Bernhard von Bülow]], who was Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs from 1897 to 1900 and then Chancellor until 1909, calculated that once Germany possessed a navy that Britain could not destroy without imperiling itself, Britain would be forced to negotiate with Germany as an equal and perhaps even give up its "[[splendid isolation]]" to join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}

== The German Fleet Acts (1898–1912) ==
{{more|German Naval Laws}}
In accord with Wilhelm II's enthusiasm for an expanded German navy and the strategic vision of Tirpitz, five [[German Naval Laws|Fleet Acts]] in 1898, 1900, 1906, 1908, and 1912 greatly expanded the German [[High Seas Fleet]]. The German aim was to build a fleet that would be two thirds the size of the British navy.&lt;ref&gt;Andriessen, De andere waarheid, 1999, page 298&lt;/ref&gt; 

The First Naval Act passed in March 1898 after an extensive lobbying and public relations campaign led by Wilhelm, Tirpitz, and Bülow. The act funded the building of eleven [[battleship]]s in the next seven years.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}} Britain had little concern about the First Naval Act as Germany's navy would not be larger than the existing two largest navies, so would not trigger any new measures under the "two-power standard."{{cn|date=May 2018}} However, by November 1898 Tirpitz had begun work on a plan to double the fleet to include forty-five battleships and [[armored cruiser]]s, which he presented to the Kaiser in September 1899. The timing was fortuitous as the eruption of the [[Second Boer War]] and British seizure of a German steamer off southern Africa enraged the German public against Britain; the Reichstag passed the Second Navy Law in June 1900.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 4: ''Weltpolitik''}}

=== HMS ''Dreadnought'' ===
[[File:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} was believed to have the fighting capability of two or three normal [[battleship]]s.]]
The passage of the Second Naval Act in Germany increased worry among British policymakers. In 1902, [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Selborne]], Tirpitz's British counterpart, told his fellow Cabinet members that the German navy was being built with an eye for war with Britain. Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jacky Fisher]] was appointed [[First Sea Lord]] (professional head of the Royal Navy) in 1904, and massively reorganized the Royal Navy by bringing most of Britain's navy force close to the home isles. He also set up a committee to design a new [[Dreadnought|super battleship]], which especially in the wake of the May 1905 [[Battle of Tsushima]] seemed to be the future of naval warfare. {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} was launched in February 1906, just 14 months after being approved.&lt;ref name="firstworldwar.com"&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/origins/causes.htm "The Cause of World War I"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' noted that HMS ''Dreadnought'' was equivalent to two or three normal battleships.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}} 

[[File:First Sea Lord Admiral John Fisher 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jacky Fisher]], [[First Sea Lord]] from 1904 to 1910, guided the design process for the [[dreadnought]]-style of [[battleship]] and reorganized the [[Royal Navy]] to protect the home isles.]]
In the beginning of 1905, the German naval attache in Britain reported to Tirpitz that the British were planning a new class of battleship. That summer, Tirpitz consulted with his advisers; by autumn, he had decided that Germany would match the British naval building plan. Scholars highlight that Imperial German decision-making was so incoherent that Tirpitz could make this decision without consulting the Chancellor, foreign ministry, treasury, the naval strategic planning offices, or the two other naval offices: the [[German Imperial Naval High Command|Naval High Command]] and [[German Imperial Naval Cabinet|Naval Cabinet]]. He presented his new supplementary naval bill to the Reichstag, envisioning a 35% increase in spending over the Second Naval Act to build two dreadnoughts and one armored cruiser per year. The bill encountered fierce opposition from across the political spectrum because of the growing [[government budget balance]] and resistance by the Reichstag to raising taxes. Fortunately for the bill, the [[Algeciras Conference]] that concluded in April 1906 after the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] inflamed German nationalist sentiment against Britain and [[France]] and the third naval law passed easily in May 1906.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}    

Wilhelm and Tirpitz, among other German leaders, viewed British actions as working in concert with France and Russia to encircle Germany. Tirpitz believed that Britain knew that they had a mistake in building the expensive dreadnoughts and armored cruisers, and that Britain would realize their folly if Germany did not flinch in following them. German leaders had also become increasingly nervous about a 'Kopenhagen,' a British strike to disable their fleet like that conducted in the 1807 [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]]. In December 1904, during the heightened tensions of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], rumors spread that Japan's ally Britain would attack and the German ambassador to Britain, who was in Berlin, had to reassure Wilhelm and other senior officials that Britain did not intend to start a war. As fears rose, so did nationalist sentiment, including right-wing criticism of the leftist [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], who resisted higher defense spending and encouraged peaceful foreign relations.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}   

From 1905 onward, Admiral John Fisher developed war plans for blockading the German coast; it became a central British strategy and was implemented in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Gough|title=Churchill and Fisher: The titans at the Admiralty who fought the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBg0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|year=2017|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Fisher declared that Germany was the "only probable enemy" and that the Royal Navy should keep a force twice as powerful as Germany's navy within a few hours of Germany's shores. [[Eyre Crowe]] of the British Foreign Office wrote a memorandum on 1 January 1907 to Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] that became policy. In it, Crowe urged stalwart resistance to what he viewed as Germany's attempts at hegemony in Europe. He argued that German actions might be the result of a confused strategy, but that the intent was irrelevant to British national security.
{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

=== Fourth bill (1908) ===
[[File:Bernhard von Bülow by Erwin Raupp.jpg|thumb|[[Bernhard von Bülow]], German Chancellor from 1900 to 1909, initially supported Tirpitz's plan but grew increasingly skeptical of the strain upon German finances]]
In March 1908, Tirpitz got a fourth naval bill – the second supplementary bill – passed by the Reichstag. It increased the rate of new battleships from three to four per year for the next four years, before stabilizing at three per year. If implemented, Germany would have had 21 dreadnoughts in 1914. Tirpitz continued to assume that Britain would not be alarmed by the German naval buildup and assured Kaiser Wilhelm of the supplementary bill that "internationally and domestically it looks as small and harmless as possible."{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

The heightened tensions around the [[Bosnian crisis]] led Chancellor Bülow, who was responsible for finding the money to fund the military, to question the value of Tirpitz's strategy, which was costly and appeared to increase Germany's diplomatic isolation. Germany's national debt had doubled between 1900 and 1908 and most of the national budget went to the military. Bülow was coming to the conclusion that Germany could not afford both the largest army and second-largest navy in Europe. Though the German ambassador in London, [[Paul Wolff Metternich|Paul Metternich]], reported that the naval buildup was alienating Britain from Germany, Tirpitz stated that the conflict with Germany was based in economic rivalry, not competing navies. Tirpitz also argued that Germany had [[sunk cost fallacy|invested too much money]] into the naval program to halt it and that the domestic political coalition that that had been created to support the naval buildup would react unpredictably if the government left the arms race. Facing an ever-expanding budget deficit, but lacking the confidence of the Kaiser and unable to raise taxes in the face of Reichstag opposition, Bülow resigned in July 1909.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

=== British reaction ===
Up to Germany's 1908 naval bill, Britain in general had largely ignored the buildup, though some individuals in the military and government were already keenly aware of the potential threat. In December 1907, the [[Admiralty]] had in fact proposed reducing the rate of battleship construction to one dreadnought and one armored cruiser the following year, which was in line with the [[Liberal government, 1905–1915|Liberal government]]'s priorities to increase spending on social programs and reduce overall government spending, under the new leadership of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] in May 1908. However, in the summer following the 1908 bill, alarm among the public and in the government rose.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

[[File:King Edward VII Kaiser Wilhelm II Berlin circa 1908.jpg|thumb|left|King [[Edward VII]] and Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] in [[Berlin]], ca. 1908]]
In August 1908, King [[Edward VII]] visited his nephew Wilhelm in [[Kronberg im Taunus|Kronberg]]. He had been provided with a paper outlining British concerns but decided not to raise the issue of naval spending, as it might spoil the congenial mood. Wilhelm cheerfully commented to [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Charles Hardinge]] that he thought relations between Germany and Britain were quite good. Hardinge politely disagreed, stating that British concern at the German naval buildup would likely result in the Liberal government asking Parliament to expand British naval shipbuilding, resulting in a naval rivalry that would greatly increase tensions between the two countries. Wilhelm sharply replied that there was no reason for British concern and, incorrectly, that the German naval bill did not threaten the relative strengths of the two navies. No resolution was reached, and Wilhelm left the Kronberg meeting believing that he had convinced the British of the justness of Germany's position.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

A series of incidents escalated British tension. In autumn 1908, the British naval attache in Berlin reported that Germany was building an extra battleship; in reality, ship builder [[Schichau-Werke]] had asked the government for an early contract to build a ship scheduled for 1909 to avoid laying off workers in [[Danzig]] (now: [[Gdańsk]], Poland). Then on 28 October, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published what was described as an interview with the Kaiser. The ''Telegraph'' sent the piece to Wilhelm for approval, who in turn passed it to Chancellor Bülow, who passed it on to the Foreign Ministry for their review, which apparently did not take place. In the published piece, Wilhelm appeared, in the words of historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], both "self-pitying and accusatory",{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}} stating that the British "are [[Mad as a March hare|mad, mad, mad as March hares]]" because they did not, as he opined, realize that Germany is their good friend and that the naval buildup was not directed against them, but Japan. The [[Daily Telegraph Affair|''Daily Telegraph'' Affair]] was variously seen in Britain as evidence that Wilhelm was mentally unbalanced or that it was part of a sinister plan to sway British public opinion. However, the main effect was in Germany, where Germans were appalled that their leader would make such a public fool of himself, nationalists and conservatives were infuriated by Wilhelm's declarations of friendship with Britain, and leftists were convinced that the Reichstag needed more control over the Kaiser. Wilhelm and the throne were severely weakened, and the Kaiser fell into a dark depression. Wilhelm never forgave Bülow for allowing the publication, which was a contributing factor in the Chancellor's departure in July 1909.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}} 

[[Image:Naval-race-1909.jpg|thumb|right|1909 cartoon in ''Puck'' shows five nations engaged in naval race]]
After the German bill, the Admiralty abandoned its plan for reduced construction and, in December 1908, proposed building at least six more dreadnoughts. Opposition in the Cabinet revolved around the cost, led by [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]] and [[President of the Board of Trade]] [[Winston Churchill]], who both saw the military expenditures as threats to the [[liberal welfare reforms|welfare reforms]] promised by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Lloyd George warned Prime Minister Asquith that Liberal MPs would revolt at a proposal adding an estimated £38 million in naval expenditures to the budget. However, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative opposition]], the [[Marine Society &amp; Sea Cadets|Navy League]], and British [[arms industry]] advocated for the spending. In popular sentiment, they were joined by King Edward VII, who supported eight more dreadnoughts.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}} A Conservative MP coined the popular slogan 'We want eight and we won't wait!',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndclare.net/causes_WWI2.htm |title=Causes of WWI |publisher=Johndclare.net |date=1912-12-08 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the broad support for increased naval strength, Asquith arranged a compromise in February 1909 to start four dreadnoughts in the next financial year, with an additional four more by spring 1910 if they were needed. With the Liberals in support, the government defeated a [[Motions of no confidence in the United Kingdom|motion of no confidence]] brought by the Conservatives. Lloyd George included the additional dreadnoughts in his proposed "[[People's Budget]]" at the end of April 1909, which was rejected in November 1909 by the [[House of Lords]], who were outraged by the measures to [[redistribution of income and wealth|redistribute wealth]]. Asquith [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolved Parliament]] to hold [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|an election in January 1910]]; his government [[hung Parliament|lost its majority]] but remained in office with the support of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. In the wake of the election, the House of Lords dropped its opposition to the People's Budget, including funding for the dreadnoughts, which passed in April 1910 and was a significant escalation of the arms race.{{sfn|MacMillan|2013|loc=Ch. 5: ''Dreadnought''}}

=== Arms race ends (1912–1914) ===
In 1912, German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] ended the naval arms race. His aim was to secure an understanding with the British to end the increasingly isolated position of Germany. Russian military expansion compelled the Germans to prioritise spending on their army and therefore less on the navy. The initiative led to the [[Haldane Mission]] in which Germany offered to accept British naval superiority in exchange for British neutrality in a war in which Germany could not be said to be the aggressor. The proposal was rejected, as Britain felt that it had nothing to gain by such a treaty since its naval superiority was insecure, but the British Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] favoured a more assertive policy against Germany.{{sfn|Clark|2012|pp=318–319}}

By 1913, there was intense internal debate in Britain about new ships because of the growing influence of Fisher's ideas and increasing financial constraints. It is now generally accepted by historians that in the first half of 1914, the Germans adopted a policy of building submarines instead of new dreadnoughts and destroyers, effectively abandoning the arms race, but since they kept the new policy secret, other powers would be delayed in following suit.{{cn|date=May 2018}} By the start of the First World War, Britain had 49 battleships, compared with Germany's 29.&lt;ref name="firstworldwar.com"/&gt;

The '''Asian Touring Car Series''' ('''ATCS''') is a [[touring car racing]] series that takes place each year across several [[Asia]]n nations. It includes events at circuits in [[Malaysia]], [[China]] and [[Indonesia]]. It ran as the Asian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) between 2000-2001, and 2005-2006.

The championship consists of three classes. Division 1 uses cars built to [[Super 2000]] or [[BTC Touring]] regulations. [[Proton (company)|Proton]] provides the only factory team, whose main opposition is the independent German [[BMW]] team of Engstler Motorsport. Division 2 uses Super Production regulations for cars with engine capacities of not more than 2000cc. Engstler Motorsport has a single entry in this class and is the main competition to the four-car line-up of DTM Bel’Air Racing from [[Hong Kong]]. Division 3 is a 1600cc class and is the most production-based of the three. Only DTM Bel’Air Racing fielded entries in this class during 2006.

==2000 Super Production Era==
In 2000, the ATCC moved from [[Super Touring]] to [[Super Production]] regulations. Reigning champion [[Charles Kwan]], with his teammate Paul Chan and EKS Motorsports entered two BMW 320i to defend his title. Rival [[Henry Lee Junior]] joined ''WK Longman Racing'' to fight for the championship. Charles famously won the race at [[Shah Alam]] from the very back of the grid that year, but his car broke down in [[Zhuhai International Circuit|Zhuhai]] and [[Macau Guia|Macau]], allowing Henry Lee Junior to win.

In 2001, Charles Kwan moved with EKS Motorsport to race in the [[JGTC]]. WKS Longman Racing entered Thai driver Nattavude Charoensukhawatana in the championship and he won the title almost unopposed. The only serious rival he had was Chen Jun-San's [[Toyota Altezza]] of AAI Motorsports from [[Taiwan]].

[[Image:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|On January 5, 1895, Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] being cashiered]]
'''Cashiering''' (or '''degradation ceremony'''), generally within [[military]] forces, is a [[ritual]] dismissal of an individual from some position of responsibility for a breach of [[discipline]].

==Etymology==
From the Flemish 'Kasseren' the phrase entered the English language in the late 16th century, during the wars in the [[Low Countries]]. Although the [[Oxford English Dictionary|O.E.D.]] states that the first printed use in this sense appears in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (1603), it appeared in the 1595 tract ''The Estate of English Fugitives'' by [[Lewes Lewkenor]], 'imploring his help and assistance in so hard an extremity, who for recompence, very charitably cashiered them all without the receipt of one penny'.

==Military==
[[File:Galons arrachés à Alfred Dreyfus le jour de sa dégradation.jpg|thumb|[[Alfred Dreyfus]]'s ripped off officer stripes, kept in Paris's [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]
It is especially associated with the public degradation of disgraced [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. Prior to World War I this aspect of cashiering sometimes involved a parade-ground ceremony in front of assembled troops  with the destruction of symbols of [[Social status|status]]: [[epaulette]]s ripped off shoulders, [[badge]]s and insignia stripped, [[sword]]s broken, [[cap]]s knocked away, and [[medal]]s torn off and dashed upon the ground.

The term originated in the era when [[British Army]] officers generally [[Sale of commissions|bought their commissions]]; being cashiered meant that the amount they had paid was lost, as they could not "sell-out" afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Holmes (military historian) |title=Redcoat: the British soldier in the age of horse and musket |origyear=2001 |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=Hardback |series= |year=2001 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[London]] |language= |isbn=0-00-257097-1 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= Chapter III - Brothers of the Blade|chapterurl= |quote=|page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the commission purchase price was a cash bond for good behaviour, forfeited to the Army's cashiers (accountants) in the event of cowardice, desertion or gross misbehaviour.

==Famous examples==
Famous victims of cashiering include [[Francis Mitchell]] (1621), [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald]] (after the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]]), [[Alfred Dreyfus]] (1894, see [[trial and conviction of Alfred Dreyfus]] and [[Dreyfus affair]]), and [[Philippe Pétain#Postwar trial and legacy|Philippe Pétain]] (1945).

While most closely associated with Captain Dreyfus, the ceremony of formal degradation (''Degradation militaire'') occurred several times in the French military under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. At least one other army officer and a naval officer were subjected to the ritual of having their swords broken and the insignia, braid and buttons publicly torn from their uniforms, after being found guilty of charges of treason. More commonly a number of NCOs and private soldiers underwent similar punishments for committing various serious offenses, before execution or imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean-Louis|last=Larcade|page=529|title=Zouaves &amp; Tirailleurs: les regiments de march et les regiments mixes (1914–1918). |ISBN=2-9515171-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">'''Charles Sabin Taft''' (August 1835 – December 18, 1900) was a bystander physician who was pressed into service during the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].

==Lincoln's assassination==
On April 14, 1865, Taft was watching ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' at [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], which President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was attending. Taft had a good view of those in the presidential box. He observed that First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and "seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy |last=Goodrich |first=Thomas |page=88 |publisher=Indiana University Press |date=2006 |isbn=9780253218896}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lincoln was shot, Taft was boosted up from the stage to the president's box.&lt;ref&gt;Kunhardt. ''Twenty Days''. Pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
becoming either the second or third physician to reach the President.

Yeah!'''" on the vinyl edition) is a track from [[Sufjan Stevens]] 2005 [[concept album]] ''[[Illinois (Sufjan Stevens album)|Illinois]]'', released on [[Asthmatic Kitty]]. The song tells the semi-autobiographical&lt;ref name=gape&gt;{{cite web|title="Illinois seems like a dream to me now": An Interview with Sufjan Stevens|url=http://www.gapersblock.com/detour/illinois_seems_like_a_dream_to_me_now_an_interview_with_sufjan_stevens/|publisher=Gapers Block|author=Matthew L. Peck|date=July 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; story of a young man on a road trip, and his youthful idealism. The track is one of Stevens' most popular songs, and he usually ends his live shows with a version of this song. The song has been recorded in five different versions by Stevens himself, the versions not on ''Illinois'' being included on the collection ''[[The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album|The Avalanche]]'', and one demo released digitally on Stevens' website, later released as a 12" single bundled with the "Illinois: Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition".&lt;ref name=chic&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago (Demo) Sufjan Stevens|url=http://music.sufjan.com/track/chicago-demo|publisher=Asthmatic Kitty|author=Asthmatic Kitty|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track has also been sampled by [[Chiddy Bang]] on their single "All Things Go".

== Production ==

In the process of making the second album in his ambitious [[Sufjan Stevens#The Fifty States Project|Fifty States Project]], which involved recording an album for each of the states of America, Stevens had committed a large amount of time to researching the people and history of [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=pitch&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufjan Stevens, ''The Avalanche'' interview|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6335-sufjan-stevens/|publisher=Pitchfork Media|author=Jason Crock|date=May 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this track is one of the most autobiographical on the album. Sufjan Stevens states in interviews around the release, that, "I've had quite a few exceptional and traumatic experiences in Illinois, a few times when visiting Chicago at a particularly difficult time in my life or driving cross country and being pulled over by the cops just outside [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]],"&lt;ref name="gape"/&gt; and that he saw his first rock show there.&lt;ref name=pitch /&gt; However, he self-deprecatingly qualifies the story of the song as only being partly true, stating, "The writer is the inventor, the designer, the creative force behind a body of work. The author is the actual man or woman, in reality, in society, in person. I like [[Woody Allen]] the director/writer, circa 1975, but I doubt I would like Woody Allen the person, circa 1975."&lt;ref name=gape /&gt; Stevens also cited the poem "Chicago" by [[Carl Sandburg]] as an influence on the track, and had intended to include a track about [[Saul Bellow]] on ''Illinois'', but could not find a way to adequately cover the writer.&lt;ref name=dust&gt;{{cite web|title=National Anthems|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/features/383|publisher=Dusted Magazine|author=Michael Cramer|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate versions ==
The year after the track was released on ''Illinois'', three further versions were included on the outtakes album, ''[[The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album]]'', these being an acoustic version, the "Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version", which is a [[baroque pop]] version of the original track, and a "Multiple Personality Disorder Version", of which Stevens stated, "James, my drummer was in town, and we decided it would be kind of fun to deconstruct the song".&lt;ref name=pitch /&gt; One further "(Demo)"&lt;ref name=chic /&gt; version was recorded during the album recording sessions in 2004 and released digitally on Stevens' homepage on  February 25, 2016. It was released as a 12" bundled with the "Illinois: Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition" on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref name=tent&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufjan Stevens - Illinois (Special 10th Anniversary Blue Marvel Edition)|url=https://store.asthmatickitty.com/products/sufjan-stevens-illinois-special-10th-anniversary-blue-marvel-edition|publisher=Asthmatic Kitty|author=Asthmatic Kitty|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The track was well received as the centerpiece of the acclaimed album ''Illinois''. Allmusic described the track as having "An expansiveness that radiates with the ballast of history and the promise of new beginnings.", and the track was included as one of the [[Pitchfork 500]] most important tracks since punk broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepitchfork500.com/about/ |title=The Pitchfork 500 |publisher=Pitchfork Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227055704/http://thepitchfork500.com/about/ |archivedate=2009-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clean Pastures''''' is a [[1937]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].

==Title==
The cartoon gets the title from the Warner Bros.' 1936 film ''[[The Green Pastures (film)|The Green Pastures]]''.

==Plot==
''Clean Pastures'' opens in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], where African American caricatures gamble, drink, and dance in a sea of bars, clubs, and dancing girls. In Heaven, known as "Pair-O-Dice", a black [[Saint Peter]] reads the headline, "Pair-O-Dice Preferred Hits New Low As Hades Inc. Soars". The angel rings an angelic [[Stepin Fetchit]] with enormous lips&lt;ref name="Goldmark 94"&gt;Goldmark 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 79"&gt;Weisenfeld 79.&lt;/ref&gt;—probably a reference to [[Oscar Polk]]'s performance as [[Gabriel]] in ''The Green Pastures''—&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 80"&gt;Weisenfeld 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and orders him to rectify the situation. Gabriel descends to Harlem and stands by a sign (modeled after [[James Montgomery Flagg]]'s World War I [[Uncle Sam]] poster)&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 79"/&gt; that reads, "Pair O Dice Needs You! Opportunity, Travel, Good Food, Water Melon, Clean Living, Music, Talkies". Nevertheless, the denizens of Harlem continue with their iniquity.

[[File:Stepin Fetchit wants you.png|thumb|right|An angelic caricature of [[Stepin Fetchit]] tries to recruit souls for Pair-O-Dice using a pastiche of [[James Montgomery Flagg]]'s World War I army recruitment poster.]]
Angels, caricatures of [[jazz]] performers [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Jimmie Lunceford]], tell Saint Peter that to get people to paradise he will need "rhythm"&lt;ref name="Goldmark 94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark 186, note 41.&lt;/ref&gt; (the short's credits list no voice actors, but a member of the all-black jazz group the [[Four Blackbirds]] —possibly Leroy Hurt—provides the cartoon's celebrity impressions).&lt;ref name="Goldmark 186 note 44"&gt;Goldmark 186, note 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The musicians go to Harlem and break into a performance of "[[Swing for Sale]]", and the Harlemites flock to listen. The film's climax takes on the characteristics of "a [[revival meeting|revivalist camp meeting]]" as the band makes its way to Pair-O-Dice, and people follow them in droves.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark 95–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The newcomers receive their halos, and in the cartoon's final gag, the Devil himself asks to be admitted.

''Clean Pastures'' is a [[musical film]], which means that it shifts between musical and non-musical sections, both of which are integral to the story.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark 93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Stalling]]'s musical score makes use of both public-domain music and songs owned by Warner Bros. Stalling's music "supplies both the foundation for the story and the driving force behind the animation." Music is of such importance that characters in ''Clean Pastures'' dance about even when no performers are pictured.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 97"/&gt; The all-black jazz group the Four Blackbirds performs the backing vocals for these songs.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 186 note 44"/&gt;

A choir of a cappella, black male voices opens the cartoon with "Save Me, Sister, from Temptation", a song from the 1936 Warner Bros. film ''[[The Singing Kid]]'' featuring [[Al Jolson]]. Thus, Stalling establishes one of the cartoon's themes, that sinners may be redeemed, from the opening credits. As the scene shifts to Harlem, the jazz standards "[[Nagasaki (song)|Nagasaki]]" and "[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]" accompany the bevy of African American vices. Caricatures of [[Bill Robinson|Bill "Bojangles" Robinson]] and Al Jolson perform snippets of the [[blackface]] tunes "[[Old Folks at Home]]" and "[[I Love to Singa]]". However, the short's major number is "[[Swing for Sale]]", performed by caricatures of popular black jazz performers. The short ends with a jazzed-up version of [[James A. Bland]]'s minstrel spiritual "[[O Dem Golden Slippers|Oh! Dem Golden Slippers]]".&lt;ref name="Goldmark 94"/&gt;

==Critical Reception==
Black critics in the 1930s wrote about the play and film ''The Green Pastures'', but they were silent on its animated parody. Weisenfeld speculates that this is because animated cartoons were not seen as significant at the time.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 80"/&gt; Modern critics of ''Clean Pastures'' fault the film for its stereotypical depictions of black culture. Cultural studies scholar William Anthony Nericcio sees the film as representative of a pattern in the works of Friz Freleng, who also produced such stereotype-ridden films as ''[[Jungle Jitters]]'', ''[[Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears]]'', and the [[Speedy Gonzales]] cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Nericcio 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindvall and Fraser are more forgiving and call the cartoon "playful", "light", and "mischievous".&lt;ref name="Lindvall and Fraser 129"&gt;Lindvall and Fraser 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Goldmark alleges that the film is a burlesque of black religion and culture in its portrayal of Pair-O-Dice as "heavenly Harlem shops and singing choirs".&lt;ref name="Goldmark 96"&gt;Goldmark 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In his interpretation, the film's use of rhythm is a metaphor for faith. This demonstrates white Americans' placement of jazz alongside religion and "the unfettered expressions of emotion associated with it" as aspects of African American culture. The cartoon implies that jazz cannot be replaced in the black psyche, as the musicians in the film must appropriate jazz, not compete with it, to draw Harlemites to Pair-O-Dice.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The mortal characters are given no information about why Pair-O-Dice is better than Harlem, but the upbeat music is enough to lure them there. Even the Devil himself takes the bait.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 96"/&gt; In the end, the film reaffirms the vision of Paradise from ''The Green Pastures'', with its "perpetual Negro holiday [and] everlasting weekend fish fry."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Bogle, quoted in Goldmark 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Judith Weisenfeld sees ''Clean Pastures'' as an explicit rejection of Connelly's fish fry. Instead, she argues that the short is a metaphor for the replacement of one generation of African American performers and stereotypes for a new one as the result of African Americans moving to urban areas.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 80"/&gt; In contrast to ''The Green Pastures'' and its portrayal of rural black culture, the cartoon is set in a solidly urban framework. ''Clean Pastures'' replaces stereotypes of [[Watermelon stereotype|black watermelon eaters]] and chicken stealers with black dancers, drinkers, and gamblers.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 79"/&gt; Old-style black stereotypes are represented by the Stepin Fetchit angel and his recruitment sign, which promises delights that only appeal to rural black stereotypes. Yet even Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Al Jolson, who built their careers on blackface depictions of rural blacks, reject Fetchit's plea for souls and opt for the Kotton Klub nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;Weisenfeld 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The angelic jazz performers represent new, urban black culture. Through their rendition of "Swing for Sale", the souls of the Harlemites are saved, and the cartoon makes the point that the African American culture of the period was increasingly urban culture, and by extension, that the black Heaven is an urban, Northern place.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 80"/&gt; Lindvall and Fraser take a similar view, seeing the cartoon as part of the Warner directors' transition from stereotyping blacks as "rural bumpkins" to featuring them as "urban hepcat[s]".&lt;ref name="Lindvall and Fraser 129"/&gt;

[[File:Clean Pastures black caricatures.png|thumb|right|Jazz-performing angels use rhythm to lead the souls of Harlemites to heaven. Freleng's choice to caricature [[Cab Calloway]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] shows the crossover appeal of those performers among white audiences in the 1930s.]]
Goldmark and Weisenfeld agree that the film's portrayal of black culture is a negative one. Goldmark criticizes the film's implication that certain kinds of black music or black performers are better than others. He interprets the short's jazzy finale, which juxtaposes contemporary popular jazz with a traditional African American [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]], as representative of this theme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Furthermore, placing the creators of "good" hot jazz in heaven suggests that certain types of black music are better than others: "hot" music made in such places as Harlem would lead to debauchery and eventually to Hades, Inc. Only through the noble efforts of famous black musicians could souls be turned to a better direction.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 96"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary black commentators argued that to white audiences, Connelly's ''The Green Pastures'' simply reinforced the notion that black people presented a danger that needed to be contained. Weisenfeld argues that this is also the case with Freleng's parody. To white viewers in the 1930s, the film's implication that blacks care for nothing but gambling, drinking, and dancing only reinforces notions of the dangers posed by urban blacks.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 80"/&gt; According to Goldmark, the choice of performers caricatured is telling; that Armstrong and Calloway are depicted as angels indicates that their crossover appeal was strong enough among whites that white audiences would not have felt threatened by the notion that they were angels in Heaven.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 96"/&gt; Weisenfeld notes that by focusing the narrative on Saint Peter and his Stepin Fetchit underling, the animators ducked the potential offense white audiences might have felt upon seeing a black God.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 79"/&gt;

==Notes==
*Many Hollywood cartoons from the 1930s are based on feature films.&lt;ref&gt;Weisenfeld 266, note 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was only natural for [[Leon Schlesinger]]'s cartoon studio to parody the 1936 Warner Bros. musical film ''[[The Green Pastures]]'', itself an adaptation of a play by [[Marc Connelly]] which won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1930. ''The Green Pastures'' features an all-black cast and proved a success for Warner Bros., despite generating controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmark 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Animator [[Friz Freleng]] had directed the short ''[[Sunday Go to Meetin' Time]]'' in 1936. The cartoon lampoons African American religious beliefs to the backdrop of jazz music&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 266"&gt;Weisenfeld 266, note 95.&lt;/ref&gt; and tells the story of a rural black man who shirks church on Sunday in favor of worldly pastimes and finds himself in Hell as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Lindvall and Frasier 128.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clean Pastures'' was thus keeping with his past work. Freleng even reuses animation of a jitterbugging couple from the ''Sunday Go to Meetin' Time'' in ''Clean Pastures''. The short's use of caricatures of famous performers was in the same vein as such Freleng films as ''[[At Your Service, Madam]]'' and ''[[Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 238.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Schlesinger and Warner Bros. had problems with ''Clean Pastures'' from the start. Hollywood censors alleged that the film ran afoul of the Hays [[Production Code]] because it burlesqued religion. Later commentators surmise that the censors also objected to the portrayal of a Heaven run by African Americans.
:*Modern critics have been no kinder to the film and cite its portrayal of black characters as offensive and reliant on negative stereotypes. Musicologist Daniel Goldmark interprets the film as a send-up of black religion and culture and the increasing identification of 1930s white audiences of [[jazz]] music with black culture. Religion scholar [[Judith Weisenfeld]] sees ''Clean Pastures'' as a metaphor for the replacement of rural, [[minstrel show]] stereotypes of blacks for modern, urban ones.Warner Bros. had trouble distributing the film. In an interview for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, producer Leon Schlesinger complained that ''Clean Pastures'' gave him more trouble with Hollywood censors than any live-action film.&lt;ref name="Cohen 29"&gt;Quoted in Cohen 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Censor Joseph I. Breen alleged that the cartoon violated the Hays [[Production Code]], a set of rules for the content of American films, because it burlesqued religion. In a letter to Schlesinger, Breen complained about the scenes set in a parodic Heaven known as "Pair-O-Dice" and said, "I am certain that such scenes would give serious offense to many people in all parts of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Breen, Joseph I. Letter to Leon Schlesinger. Quoted in Barrier, Michael (1999). ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''. Quoted in Goldmark 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities also requested that Schlesinger remove the halo from one of the black characters.&lt;ref name="Cohen 29"/&gt; The letter does not specify to what exactly Breen objected, but musicologist Daniel Goldmark speculates that it was the idea of Heaven being run by blacks and the cartoon's implication that Heaven holds a place for "gamblers, dancers, drinkers, and, above all else, jazz fans", making it "even more threatening to white viewers."&lt;ref name="Goldmark 97"&gt;Goldmark 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger managed to quell the censors by making alterations, such as cutting the phrase "De Lawd".&lt;ref name="Cohen 29"/&gt; The short debuted in theatres on May 22, 1937. ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', a 1943 cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett]], was inspired in part by ''Clean Pastures'' and has a similar theme of redemption.&lt;ref name="Goldmark 97"/&gt;
*Because of the [[ethnic stereotyping|racial stereotypes]] used against [[African-American|black people]] throughout the short, it prompted [[United Artists]] to withhold it from [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] within the United States in 1968. As such, the short was placed into the so-called [[Censored Eleven]], a group of eleven ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' shorts withheld from television distribution in the United States since 1968 due to heavy stereotyping of black people.&lt;ref&gt;The Straight Dope.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Green Pastures'', on the other hand, is still in distribution.&lt;ref name="Weisenfeld 266"/&gt;

'''''Dearest Enemy''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Herbert Fields]], lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]], and music by [[Richard Rodgers]]. This was the first of eight book musicals written by the songwriting team of [[Rodgers and Hart]] and writer Herbert Fields, and the first of more than two dozen Rodgers and Hart Broadway musicals.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kay. ''Broadway musicals, show by show'' (1996, Edition:5), p. 48, Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical takes place in 1776, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], when [[Mary Lindley Murray]] detained British troops long enough in Manhattan to give [[George Washington]] time to move his vulnerable troops. 

==Production and background==   
Hart got the idea for the musical from a plaque in Manhattan about Murray.  He, Rodgers and Fields first took their musical to Fields' father, [[Lew Fields]], to produce, but he declined, thinking the Revolutionary War story would not be commercial.&lt;ref name=green&gt;Green, Stanley.

==Plot==
The story is based on an [[American Revolutionary War]] incident in September 1776 when [[Mary Lindley Murray]], under orders from General [[George Washington]], detained General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] and his British troops by serving them cake, wine and conversation in her [[Kips Bay, Manhattan]] home long enough for some 4,000 American soldiers, fleeing their loss in the [[Battle of Long Island|Battle of Brooklyn]], to reassemble in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] and join reinforcements to make a successful counterattack. 

Patriot Mary Murray (of the [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Muray Hill]] Murrays) and her young ladies are working to sew uniforms for American soldiers, but they are sad at the absence of their young men. Mary's flirty daughter Jane leads British [[William Tryon|General Tryon]]'s son Harry to her house; she finds him charming. His commander, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Howe]], and some British officers commandeer Mary's house as their temporary headquarters. Mary instructs the houseful of beautiful young ladies to discourage the British soldiers, but the girls are eager to engage the enemy in more than just conversation. [[George Washington]] sends word to Mary asking her to try to detain Howe and his officers overnight. Mary's feisty, feminist Irish niece Betsy Burke comes home wearing only a barrel after a dog steals her clothes while she is swimming. British Captain Sir John Copeland has gallantly supplied the barrel. Though divided by nationality and Copeland's sexism, they fall in love ("Here In My Arms"). 

Mary gives a Ball for the British officers, promising to show them some of the beauties of the local countryside. The British soldiers are happy to spend time consuming refreshment and indulging in music, dancing and flirtation at the Murray mansion. Betsy and Sir John dream of being together when the war is over as Jane and Harry also fall in love ("Bye and Bye"). Mary's messenger is captured, and Betsy volunteers to take an update to General Washington. She is told to return to Mary's house and, when the coast is clear for the American soldiers to move, to light a lantern then put it out. Upon her return, Sir John and she acknowledge their love for each other.  When Sir John falls asleep, Betsy lights the signal. The American soldiers march North safely. Sir John is captured but, in the post-war epilogue, he is freed and reunited with Betsy.

:''Note'': During the tryouts, numerous songs were cut from the production, including Ale, Ale, Ale!, "Duet (in the barrel)" (which became the solo song "Oh, Dear"), "Girls Do Not Tempt Me", and "The Three Musketeers". The duet "Dear Me" (formerly "Oh, Dear") is believed to have been cut from the show because Mrs. Ford could not dance in only a barrel costume while holding a parasol.&lt;ref name=NWR/&gt;

==Critical response==
The critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' "waxed rhapsodic over [songs] 'that are as uncommon as most of them are beautiful'", and the ''[[New York Evening World]]'' called the book "wise and truly witty and genuinely romantic" and praised the beauty and freshness of the songs.&lt;ref name=Moon/&gt; Historian Stanley Green wrote that there was a "well-sustained attempt" to match the music to the plot and period.  The ballads were "dainty, charming pieces."&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The ''Telegram'' reviewer wrote that "We have a glimmering notion that someday they will form the American counterpart of the once great triumvirate of Bolton, Wodehouse, and Kern."&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

==Parent organisation ''Fashion in Film''==

'''Fashion in Film''' is based at [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] in London. It was founded by Marketa Uhlirova, Roger Burton and Christel Tsilibaris in 2005 as a way of encouraging critical response to the use of fashion, clothing, jewellery, make-up and accessories in film, and addressing current practices in the context of film’s long history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csm.arts.ac.uk/research/staffresearchprofiles/marketauhlirova/ Marketa Uhlirova] CSM staff profile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/fashion-in-film-festival-a-magical-material-world-2147812.html Fashion in Film Festival: A magical, material world] Independent&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign body aspiration''' occurs when a foreign body enters the airways and causes [[choking]].&lt;ref name="urlForeign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298940-overview |title=Foreign Body Aspiration: Overview - eMedicine |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects can enter the esophagus through the mouth, or enter the trachea through the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Pediatrics, 24e, "Respiratory Tract &amp; Mediastinum"|last=Federico|first=Monica|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=1259862909|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Most cases of foreign body aspiration are in children ages 6 months to 3 years due to the tendency for children to place small objects in the mouth and nose. Children of this age usually lack molars and cannot grind up food into small pieces for proper swallowing.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Surgery, 14e, "Otolaryngology: Head &amp; Neck Surgery"|last=Weinberger|first=Paul|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=9781259255168|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, round objects including nuts, hard candy, popcorn kernels, beans, and berries are common causes of foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the [[Heimlich maneuver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muntz|first=Harlan|title=Pediatric Otolaryngology for the Clinician: Foreign Body Management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=978-1-58829-542-2|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In adults, foreign body aspiration is most prevalent in populations with impaired swallowing mechanisms such as the following: neurological disorders, alcohol use, sedative use, advanced age (most common in the 6th decade of life), and loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases and Disorders, Fifth Edition, "Upper Airway Obstruction in Adults"|last=Won|first=Christine|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2015|isbn=0071807284|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Signs and Symptoms ==
[[File:Foreign body aspiration.jpg|thumb|foreign body aspiration]]
Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction, the size of the foreign body, and the severity of obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 20% of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway, while 80% become lodged in the mainstem or lobar bronchus.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Emergency Medicine, 8e, "Respiratory Distress"|last=Lucia|first=Dominic|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2017|isbn=0071840613|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset with coughing, choking, and/or wheezing; however, symptoms can be more progressive if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Classically, patients present with acute onset of choking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these cases, the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling, stridor, and the ability to speak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or cough, and signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor, while objects below the larynx present with wheezing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction, patients may present with chronic cough, asymmetrical breath sounds on exam, or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults can sometimes mimic other lung disorders such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment, "Pulmonary Disorders"|last=Chesnutt|first=Asha|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2019|isbn=126011743X|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Diagnosis ==
If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the oral cavity is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Most patients receive a chest x-ray to determine the location of the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a negative chest x-ray cannot rule out foreign body aspiration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lateral neck, chest, and bilateral decubitus end-expiratory chest x-rays should be obtained in patients suspected of having aspirated a foreign body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Signs on x-ray that can be indicative of foreign body aspiration include visualization of the foreign body or hyperinflation of the affected lung.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other x-ray findings that can be seen with foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema, atelectasis, and consolidation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

While, x-ray can be used to visualize the location and identity of a foreign body, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold-standard for diagnosis since the foreign body can be visualized and removed with this intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rigid bronchoscopy is indicated when two of the three following criteria are met: report of foreign body aspiration by the patient or a witness, abnormal lung exam findings, or abnormal chest x-ray findings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Treatment ==
Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the severity of obstruction of the airway involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer's arm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the event that the above measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheostomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Complications ==
Many complications can develop after a foreign body is removed, or if a foreign body remains in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Patients may develop inflammation of the airway walls or lung abscess from a foreign body remaining in the airway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hyperinflation of the airway distal to the obstruction can also occur if the foreign body is not removed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patients can also develop pneumonia from retained foreign bodies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Episodes of recurrent pneumonia in the same lung field should prompt evaluation for a possible foreign body in the airway.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even if the foreign body is removed, complications such as chemical bronchitis, mucosal reactions, and the development of granulation tissue are possible.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Gdańsk Shakespeare Festival''' is an international theatre festival devoted to the idea of the [[Elizabethan theatre]], and especially to the works of [[William Shakespeare]]. The event was first organized in 1993, on the initiative of [[Theatrum Gedanense Foundation]], which had been created by Professor Jerzy Limon and Władysław Zawistowski, with [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] as its patron. Its original name, "Gdańsk Shakespeare Days" was transformed into "Gdańsk Shakespeare Festival" in 1997, during the celebration of Gdańsk's millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teatr-szekspir.gda.pl/article/miedzynarodowy_festiwal_szekspirowski/article.php/id_item_tree/cea263bd2e3bf195db0e2e222838f6f9/id_art/7ef617796df8ccc5574c9317187e51c3 |title=Fundacja Theatrum Gedanense.

The Festival is held annually during the first week of August. Most of the plays are performed on the theatre scenes of [[Gdańsk]], [[Sopot]], and [[Gdynia]] ([[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]]). Some are shown in spaces such as st. John's Church, the former Royal Gun Factory, or [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] and in the open air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://klata.e-teatr.pl/inside.php?str=12| title = Klata Fest. "H." w Teatrze Wybrzeże w Gdańsku| language = Polish|trans-title=Klata Fest. "H." in the Wybrzeże Theatre, Gdańsk}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Festival aims at presenting and popularizing the output of William Shakespeare by presentation of his plays, but also by other means. After the performances the public can meet with directors and actors. Within the framework of the festival an educational program for students is organized as well. It is called "Letnia Akademia Szekspirowska" (Summer Shakespeare Academy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festiwalszekspirowski.pl/article/festiwal_szekspirowski/xiii_festiwal_szekspirowski_2009/program_edukacyjny/index.php |title=Festiwal Szekspirowski |language=Polish |trans-title=Shakespeare Festival.

==Accompanying events==

'''Summer Shakespeare Academy''' consists of theatrical and creative workshops conducted by Polish artists and famous foreign personalities. The participants are encouraged to develop their passions for theatre, dance, [[photography]] or [[painting]].

'''Shakespeare Daily''' is the newspaper that has accompanied the festival for many years. It is created and edited by the participants of [[journalism]] workshops. It contains the information about festival events, [[review]]s, and [[Article (publishing)|article]]s about plays and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festiwalszekspirowski.pl/article/festiwal_szekspirowski/xiii_festiwal_szekspirowski_2009/gazeta_festiwalowa/index.php/id_item_tree/b6a4ebd6fde343de9d2fa742540eae21 |title=Gdańsk Shakespeare Festival.

''''Dolne Miasto Górą'''' (which could be translated as "Dolne Miasto is the Best") is the common name of various artistic workshops organised in [[Dolne Miasto]] and [[Orunia]] (districts of Gdańsk). It is also called "Shakespeare mania" and consists of free workshops for children and teenagers conducted by young artists from Gdańsk. The project was created by Joanna Śnieżko-Misterek, [[Teatrum Gedanense Foundation]] and Gdańsk Shakespeare Theatre. The aim of the action is to make the youth conscious of their abilities and to help them develop their interests and self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teatr-szekspir.gda.pl/article/miedzynarodowy_festiwal_szekspirowski/xi_festiwal_szekspirowski/article.php/id_item_tree/8e67f460657790d71a327e174bfc3332/id_art/64c12a7079fdc98fdda9dd001fb90dab |title=Dolne Miasto Górą!!! |language=Polish |trans-title=Dolne Miasto is the Best!!! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317103308/http://www.teatr-szekspir.gda.pl/article/miedzynarodowy_festiwal_szekspirowski/xi_festiwal_szekspirowski/article.php/id_item_tree/8e67f460657790d71a327e174bfc3332/id_art/64c12a7079fdc98fdda9dd001fb90dab |archivedate=2009-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the workshops is always celebrated with a theatrical parade. Actors, human-shaped [[puppet]]s and various artists, together with the residents of Dolne Miasto, march along [[Długi Targ]], which is the centre of the [[Old Town (Gdańsk)|Old Town of Gdańsk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatr.dlawas.com/tdw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6532&amp;Itemid=29 |title=Teatr dla was.

The events do not end with the festival's last day. After the festival photographic and [[literary]] competitions are organised. Each year a competition for the best festival photograph and review is held. There is also an annual exhibition of the works of young independent artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatrszekspirowski.pl/article.php/id_item_tree/86cc76226c669f58ffb7a4f558e7478d/id_art/2405dc8569adf4ca646e14536551c73f |title=Wystawa "Migawki Szekspirowskie" |language=Polish |trans-title="Shakespearean Photos" exhibition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009151757/http://www.teatrszekspirowski.pl/article.php/id_item_tree/86cc76226c669f58ffb7a4f558e7478d/id_art/2405dc8569adf4ca646e14536551c73f |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gordo''' was one of the first [[monkey]]s to travel into [[Outer space|space]]. As part of the [[NASA]] space program, Gordo, also known as '''Old Reliable''', was launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] on December 13, 1958, in the U.S. [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] rocket on its [[Jupiter AM-13|AM-13]] mission. The rocket would travel over 1,500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles (500&amp;nbsp;km) before returning to Earth and landing in the [[South Atlantic]]. A technical malfunction prevented the capsule's parachute from opening and, despite a short search, neither his body nor the vessel were ever recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Animals In Space: From Research Rockets to the Space Shuttle, Chris Dubbs and [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Gordo was a [[South American]] species of [[squirrel monkey]], about one foot tall and weighing between 1 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg. He was chosen for space travel because of his species' similar anatomical makeup to man and sensitivity to changes in temperature. Missions using [[monkeys in space]] were not new: four monkeys called Albert, as well as monkeys called Patricia and Mike had all flown by 1962.

==The flight==

The flight took place at 0353 hours EST when the Jupiter AM-13 rocket containing Gordo was launched from the [[Atlantic Missile Range]] at Cape Canaveral. The rocket ascended to a height of 290 miles while travelling 1300 lateral miles.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space. A chronology and annotated bibliography through the year 1960. |journal=US Naval School of Aviation Medicine |volume=ONR TR ACR-64 |issue=AD0272581 |year=1962 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/9288 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists monitoring the flight found that, aside from a slight slowing of the pulse, Gordo suffered no ill effects from the entry into space or resultant weightlessness. Gordo wore a specially customized space suit and was fitted with instruments, including a thermometer and microphone, to monitor his health.

In total the flight lasted 15 minutes, of which Gordo was weightless for 8.3 minutes, as the craft exited and re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of over 10,000 miles per hour. The failure of Gordo's parachute meant that both he and the capsule were lost, despite efforts to recover them. It is believed that Gordo was alive at the time of impact.

==Legacy==

Despite the loss of Gordo, the mission was considered a success by NASA. It had gone some way towards alleviating the concerns over how the human body would cope with weightlessness and the difficulties of space travel. Less than a year later, Gordo was followed into space by the monkeys Able and [[Miss Baker|Baker]] who survived a similar launch profile. Despite these advances, though, it would be the Russian [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would become the first human in space.

'''IndieCade''' or '''Indiecade''' is an international [[Juried (competition)|juried]] festival of [[indie game|independent games]].  IndieCade is known as "the video game industry's [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]]."&lt;ref name=bfritz&gt;Fritz, Ben. [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/01/entertainment/et-indiecade1 "IndieCade, the video game industry's Sundance"], Los Angeles Times, October 1, 2009, accessed July 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  At IndieCade, independent [[video game]] developers are selected to screen and promote their work at the annual IndieCade festival and showcase events.&lt;ref name="Bellevue"&gt;Leigh Alexander [http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17762 IndieCade Announces Call For Submissions March 7, 2008 Gamasutra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://presszoom.com/story_146127.html# press release]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, IndieCade launched a conference track featuring classes, panels, workshops, and keynotes.

== Background ==

IndieCade was formed by Creative Media Collaborative, an alliance of industry producers and leaders founded in 2005. IndieCade's board of advisors includes (among others) [[Seamus Blackley]], [[Tracy Fullerton]], [[Megan Gaiser]], [[Andy Gavin]], [[Carl Goodman]], [[John Hight]], [[Robin Hunicke]], [[Henry Jenkins]], [[Richard Lemarchand]], [[Frans Mayra]], [[Jamil Moledina]], [[Janet Murray]], [[Robert Nashak]], [[Carolyn Rauch]], [[Kellee Santiago]], [[Keita Takahashi]], [[Will Wright (game designer)]], and [[Eric Zimmerman]]. IndieCade founder is [[Stephanie Barish]], Festival Chair is [[Celia Pearce]], and Festival Director is Sam Roberts.&lt;ref name=IC/&gt;

The festival started as part of [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] before being spun off as an independent event in [[Bellevue, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Bellevue"/&gt; In 2009 the festival moved to Culver City, where a [[Twitter]] game and an "urban" scavenger hunt were part of the festivities.&lt;ref name="indie"&gt;[Gaming's got the indie spirit] "Culver City's Indiecase festival showcases low-budget, artful video games". Los Angeles Times.  October 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indiecade festival]] is the only stand-alone festival for independent games in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/News/2009/Indiecade-2009-Reveals-Remaining-10-Finalist-Gam.aspx#] CGW.com - Indiecade 2009 Reveals Remaining 10 Finalist Games&lt;/ref&gt; and open to the public.  Games are submitted for consideration to the IndieCade festival jury&lt;ref name=IC&gt;[https://www.indiecade.com/"IndieCade Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; in the early spring and a selection of finalists for the culminating annual IndieCade festival is determined and announced by the fall.  Additional games from the pool of IndieCade submissions are showcased at a variety of events each year around the world. 2009 IndieCade showcase events included [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] (OIAF) partnered with the IndieCade organization "that focuses on independent games and works to cultivate innovation and artistry in interactive media" in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawastart.com/story/9973.php LEGENDS OF ANIMATION COME TO OTTAWA FESTIVAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715021814/http://ottawastart.com/story/9973.php |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an independent video gaming ("IndieCade Europe") festival has been held in the United Kingdom in 2007-2009 at [[Gamecity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130505124422/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/homenews/Indie-gaming-city-festival/article-1349361-detail/article.html Indie gaming at city festival] September 19, 2009 This is Nottingham&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 IndieCade Europe was rebooted and took place in that year and 2017 in Paris, where it will return in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.indiecade.com/recap_2016/europe IndieCade Europe Recap] IndieCade Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

In 2009, IndieCade moved its flagship stand-alone festival from [[Bellevue, Washington]] to [[Culver City]] (Los Angeles), California. Each year, IndieCade "invades"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndieCade 2011: Temporary Public Art|url=https://www.indiecade.com/2011/art/}}&lt;/ref&gt; downtown Culver City to create a "city-sized arcade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City-Sized Arcade No quarters needed at IndieCade|url=http://rundown.com/article.php?article_id=2688|publisher=rundown.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013050807/http://www.rundown.com/article.php?article_id=2688|archivedate=2011-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival transforms a central blacktop parking lot on Main Street, leveraging the open space by building temporary structures that host parties, individual games, and planned and spontaneous Big Games. The previous IndieCade festivals took place October 1–4, 2009, October 8–10, 2010, October 6–9, 2011, October 5–7, 2012, IndieCade 2013 took place on October 3–6 and between October 9 and 12 for 2014. Indiecade 2015 started later in the month taking place on October 22–25.

== Festival events ==

GameWalk is the heart of the IndieCade festival and consists of approximately 40 finalist games selected for their creativity, unique vision, and technological innovation. The games are exhibited in several locations in downtown [[Culver City]]: the Fire Station, NextSpace coworking offices, and the Gregg Fleishman Studio, which are turned into temporary galleries for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where is IndieCade?|url=https://www.indiecade.com/2011/where/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is free and open to the public.

The IndieCade GameSlam, in the vein of a [[poetry slam]], invites developers to the stage and provide a brief (90 second) showcase of their game, including the idea behind its creation and development. This presents an opportunity for developers to share their work via short presentations within a communal creative environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 5 Bits of Indiecade 2011|url=http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/11364269214/top-5-bits-of-indiecade-2011|publisher=blog.humblebundle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Games program serves as an extension to IndieCade's mission to promote games of all kinds. Big Games are large, multi-player games played outside and involving physical activity, and range to include technology, tactics, and personal interaction. Big Games are curated by on-site docents, and presents projects such as [[Ninja]] (a turn based game of tag), [[Reality]] (an Alternate Reality game), and [[Meatspace Invasion]] (a mixed virtual/real-world tag/shooting style game). It is free and open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Festival: Big Games|url=https://www.indiecade.com/2011/big_games/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Night Games are an evening event centered on showing and playing multiple games.  These games can be single player experiences played on a giant screen in front of an audience ([[superHYPERCUBE]]); multiplayer games that use only glowing wands or laser pointers ([[Johann Sebastian Joust]], [[Renga (video game)|Renga]]); or large performance pieces, involving many players ([[Humanoid Asteroids]]). IndieCade promotes the Night Games to feature the beauty and innovation of modern game design which is beyond what the audience currently conceives as a traditional game.

=== Annual events ===

The first IndieCade Mobile 3D [[Game Jam]] was hosted in Los Angeles at the [[University of Southern California]]'s Interactive Media Division on August 6–7, 2011. During the two-day event, 12 teams began the process of creating a fully functional 3D mobile game for the [[LG Thrill 4G]]. 6 finalists were chosen to go on to the next round of refining their games in order to compete for the LG Mobile 3D Award at the Red Carpet Award Ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndieCade Mobile 3D GameJam presented by LG Electronics|url=https://www.indiecade.com/index.php/2011/GameJam11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual IndieCade Holiday Party took place at [[Riot Games]] (''[[League of Legends]]'') headquarters in Santa Monica on December 14, 2011. The fundraiser featured postcard art sent in by the community, available for sale by silent auction. The art show was curated by Glitch Lab. Notable art contributors were [[Pendleton Ward]] (creator of [[Adventure Time]]), Jason Torchinsky, as well as Amanda Williams and Katherine Rubenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IndieCade &amp; Glitch Lab LA: Holiday Party!|url=https://www.indiecade.com/index.php/2011/holiday_party/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IndieCade awards ceremony ==

Approximately 40 games each year are selected to exhibit at GameWalk. The finalists are eligible to compete in IndieCade's Red Carpet Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Noah J|title=IndieCade’s Red Carpet Awards|url=http://turnstylenews.com/2011/10/07/indiecades-red-carpet-awards/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015191318/http://turnstylenews.com/2011/10/07/indiecades-red-carpet-awards/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-15|publisher=turnstylenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audience Choice and Developer Choice Awards are announced separately during the festival's Closing Party.

'''Jaycee Chan Joming''' (born 3 December 1982), better known as '''Jaycee Chan''', is an American-born [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] actor and singer. In 2004, he released his first [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] CD album in [[Hong Kong]]. He later went to [[Taiwan]] to continue his music career. He is the son of the Hong Kong [[martial artist]] and actor, [[Jackie Chan]] and his Taiwanese wife, [[Joan Lin]]. He sings and performs in Mandarin and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. He is currently on a hiatus from the entertainment industry after being arrested and jailed for providing his apartment in [[Beijing]] for acquaintances to smoke marijuana.

==Early life and education==
Jaycee was born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], California, the son of Hong Kong-Chinese action/martial arts star [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Taiwan]]ese actress [[Joan Lin]]. Sources, including Jackie Chan's autobiography, state that he was born in 1984 and that his parents were married in 1983. On the other hand, Jackie's official website states that he was born in 1982.

Jaycee briefly attended the [[College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], for two semesters, but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/arts/07iht-fmseno.3816164.html "Jaycee Chan: Like dad, but only up to a point"] ''New York Times''. 7 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of College of William &amp; Mary alumni|List of College of William and Mary alumni]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has a penchant for luxury cars and nightlife and stated that he left school because "all you can see in Virginia is sheep."&lt;ref&gt;[http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=239&amp;catid=7&amp;subcatid=42 Jackie Chan: His Life, Films, Stunts, Injuries, Endorsements And Troubles – China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924185633/http://factsanddetails.com/china.php?itemid=239&amp;catid=7&amp;subcatid=42 |date=24 September 2012 }}. Facts and Details (23 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seno|first1=Alexandra A.|title=Jaycee Chan: Like dad, but only up to a point|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/07/arts/07iht-fmseno.3816164.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=20 August 2014|date=7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaycee speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and English.

==Career==
Giving up on school, Jaycee moved to Hong Kong in 2003 to pursue his career. He composed the music and wrote the lyrics for 10 of the 13 tracks on his first CD, "Jaycee" (2004). His film debut was ''[[The Twins Effect II]]'', in which his father had a cameo role. His second role was a Hong Kong [[romance film]] ''[[2 Young]],'' in which he co-starred with Hong Kong [[Cantopop]] singer [[Fiona Sit]]. They both worked together again on ''[[Break Up Club]]'' in 2010. In 2007, he co-starred alongside [[Nicholas Tse]] and [[Shawn Yue]] in [[Benny Chan (film director)|Benny Chan]]'s action film ''[[Invisible Target]]''.

Despite heavy promotions and awards, his albums and movies have had dismal sales. His film ''[[Double Trouble (2012 Taiwanese film)|Double Trouble]]'' only grossed US$9,000 in Hong Kong, making it one of the biggest box office failures ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movieswithbutter.com/blogs/yikes-double-trouble-only-made-9000-hk-308004 Yikes! "Double Trouble" Only Made $9,000 in HK]. Movies With Butter (10 July 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, Chinese websites reported that he has given up his United States citizenship in favor of Chinese citizenship ([[Hong Kong residents|Hong Kong residency]]) to appeal to local audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ent.163.com/09/0121/22/507FKK3800031H2L.html 房祖名加入中国籍 美国移民局曾多次挽留_网易娱乐]. Ent.163.com (21 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He later confirmed this on his Instagram account shortly after [[Donald Trump]] was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BMlAx69hzCE/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He voiced the younger version of his father's character, Master Monkey in ''[[Secrets of the Furious Five]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talktalk.co.uk/tv-guide/content/n2v62/kung-fu-panda-secrets-of-the-furious-five&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he voiced Master Crane in the Cantonese version of ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Kung Fu Panda 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://ent.qq.com/a/20080621/000043.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaycee and his father Jackie starred together in Jackie's 100th film, ''[[1911 (film)|1911]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkmdb.com/db/movies/view.mhtml?id=14567&amp;display_set=eng 1911 (2011)]. Hkmdb.com (23 September 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The team-up resulted in Jackie Chan's least profitable and worst reviewed film to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21531524 Commemorating China's 1911 revolution: From Sun to Mao to now]. The Economist.&lt;/ref&gt;

To appeal to non-Chinese audiences, his studios hired [[Korea]]n and [[Singapore]]an artists, [[Jang Nara]] and [[Fann Wong]], to promote Jaycee's new film, ''Whoever''. The film was meant to satire Jaycee's life as a playboy from a famous father. Once again, the film was a [[Box office bomb|box office disaster]], not placing in the Chinese top ten, despite a government mandate requiring it to be played at half the nation's theaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.entgroup.cn/boxoffice/cn/Default.aspx?week=2012-10-01.]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studios decided not to release the film theatrically in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Before his arrest in August 2014, Jaycee was filming ''[[Monk Comes Down the Mountain]]'', for which his role was not credited due to his arrest.&lt;ref name=monk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/asia/monk-comes-down-the-mountain-review-chen-kaige-1201534046/|title=Film Review: 'Monk Comes Down the Mountain'|author=Maggie Lee|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=July 4, 2015|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his father revealed that Jaycee had shown interest on writing a script for a sequel to ''[[CZ12]]'' and will make the film "if it's right".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/movies/story/jail-has-made-jaycee-chan-better-man-so-his-dad-thinks-he-should-go-back-jail&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Jackie Chan==
During an awards ceremony in Beijing in April 2011, Jackie stated that he would be donating half his money to charity when he dies, instead of to his son.&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2011/04/06/jackie-chan-to-donate-entire-fortune-to-charity-and-leave-his-son-nothing-649627/]. Jackie Chan to donate entire fortune to charity and leave his son nothing (6 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Australian News"&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/tycoons-who-wont-give-money-to-their-children/story-e6frfm9r-1226702468883]. The 15 tycoons who refuse to leave their fortunes to their children  (22 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie explained, "If he is capable, he can make his own money. If he is not, then he will just be wasting my money."&lt;ref name=Metro /&gt;&lt;ref name="Australian News" /&gt;

It was reported that he and his father, [[Jackie Chan]] have an estranged relationship with each other. However, after serving six months in jail, Jaycee finally met up with his father for the first time in Taiwan. The two seem to have reconciled. "I hadn't seen him for too long. I feel he's matured this time," Jackie Chan said. "We didn't talk about unhappy things. It was all family chat. We talked into the night and didn't sleep."

On August 18, 2014, it was reported that Chan had been arrested on August 14, by [[Beijing]] police due to [[drug possession]], alongside [[Kai Ko|Ko Chen-tung]] (also known as Kai Ko&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://entertainment.toggle.sg/en/asianbuzz/article/jaycee-chan-still-tight-6262738|title=Jaycee Chan still tight with Kai Ko in Taipei | work = Toggle |access-date= 2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[Taiwan]]ese actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://happy.jinghua.cn/346/c/201408/18/n3916192.shtml 柯震东和房祖名在京吸毒被拘留] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083804/http://happy.jinghua.cn/346/c/201408/18/n3916192.shtml |date= 19 August 2014 }}, [[Beijing Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; Police later found more than 3 ounces of marijuana after searching Chan's apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/19/world/asia/china-jackie-chan-son-drugs/index.html|title= Jackie Chan's son held in anti-drugs crackdown in China's capital| first =Paul | last = Armstrong |publisher= [[CNN]] |date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ko was set to be released 14 days after his arrest, Chan faced criminal charges and sentences up to the [[death penalty]] or life imprisonment for allegedly hosting others to consume [[marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cri.cn/12394/2014/08/18/2361s840795.htm|title= Jackie Chan's Son and Taiwan Actor Ko Arrested in Drug Bust |publisher= CRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan, whose father Jackie had been China's anti-drug goodwill ambassador since 2009, admitted to taking drugs for 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/movies/story/ive-been-taking-marijuana-8-years-says-jaycee-chan-son-jackie-chan-20140819|title= I've been taking marijuana for 8 years, says Jaycee Chan, son of Jackie Chan | date = 2014-08-19 | work = The straits times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, [[Jackie Chan]] made a public apology for his son's drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = China drugs, Jackie Chan son | publisher = CNN | date = 2014-08-21 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/21/world/asia/china-drugs-jackie-chan-son/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, 2014, Beijing [[Dongcheng District, Beijing|Dongcheng]] [[Public procurator|procurator]]'s office approved the formal arrest of Chan on suspicion of "accommodating drug users".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2014-09/18/c_1112523871.htm 房祖名被北京东城检察院批捕 面临三年以下徒刑], [[Xinhua News Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan spent his 32nd birthday in custody with his mother stating that her son has borrowed more than a hundred books to read since he was detained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/showbiz/jaycee-chan-turns-over-new-leaf-detention|title=Jaycee Chan turns over new leaf in detention|work=Asia One}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2014, four months after his arrest, Chan was indicted by Chinese authorities for sheltering other people to use drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-30575938|title= Jackie Chan's son Jaycee charged with drug offence|work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trial finally began on January 9, 2015 in Beijing, after spending 148 days in detention.  Chan was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 2,000 yuan (~$320 USD). Chan confessed that he broke the law and he should be punished for his actions and that he would not do it again. His parents did not attend their son's hearing although the elder Chan was reportedly in Beijing. His father repeatedly said that he will not use his connections to lighten his son's sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Jackie Chan's | work = China post | date = 2015-01-10 | URL = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/china/national-news/2015/01/10/426155/Jackie-Chans.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Why Jackie Chan did not show up at son's trial | date = 2015-01-09 | work = Chin topics | URL = http://www.chinatopix.com/articles/31595/20150109/why-jackie-chan-didnt-show-up-sons-trial.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later revealed that during his detention, Chan wrote a three-page remorse letter to his mother in which he promised that he would not repeat his mistakes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The straits times | URL = http://www.straitstimes.com/node/3306456}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan was released from jail on February 13 during midnight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Jackie Chan's son Jaycee released from jail | work = Mid day | URL = http://www.mid-day.com/articles/jackie-chans-son-jaycee-released-from-jail/15987177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One day after his release, Chan held a conference in Beijing to make a public apology by saying that he had "no reason" and "no excuse" for his law breaking and his arrest had "a negative impact on society" and that it disappointed his supporters while causing losses for those who worked with him. In his four-minute speech, he promised that he will be a law-abiding citizen and while he still has plans to continue in the entertainment industry, he is more focused on spending [[Chinese New Year]] with his parents. He stated that prison life was "harsh" and his father did not use any connections to help ease his sentence. He extended a deep bow before and after his speech.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/14/jaycee-chan-released-beijing-jail-drug-use-jackie-chan-china&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immortal.org/5484/jackies-son-jaycee-chan-public-apology-drugs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ever since he was released from prison, he has been living with his mother in Taipei, keeps a low profile, and often wears a mask to avoid being seen in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://entertainment.toggle.sg/en/asianbuzz/article/jaycee-chan-spotted-in-taiwan-5257270 |title=Archived copy |access-date=13 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914141925/http://entertainment.toggle.sg/en/asianbuzz/article/jaycee-chan-spotted-in-taiwan-5257270 |archive-date=14 September 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He still keeps in touch with the Taiwanese actor Ko Kai.&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.toggle.sg/en/asianbuzz/article/jaycee-chan-still-tight-6262738&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger half-sister name Etta Ng, who was born in 1999 due to his father's affair with former Hong Kong beauty queen, [[Elaine Ng]]. However, the half siblings are not known to have met.

The '''John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer''' is an award given annually to the best new writer whose first professional work of [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] was published within the two previous calendar years.&lt;ref name="Locus"/&gt; The prize is named in honor of science fiction editor and writer [[John W. Campbell]], whose science fiction writing and role as editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' made him one of the most influential editors in the early history of science fiction.&lt;ref name="ESF199"/&gt; The award is sponsored by [[Dell Magazines]], which publishes ''Analog''.&lt;ref name="Locus"/&gt; The nomination and selection process is administered by the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) represented by the current [[Worldcon]] committee, and the award is presented at the [[Hugo Award]] ceremony at the Worldcon, although it is not itself a Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="WSFSCamp"/&gt; All nominees receive a pin, while the winner receives a plaque. Beginning in 2005, the award has also included a [[tiara]]; created at the behest of 2004 winner [[Jay Lake]] and 2005 winner [[Elizabeth Bear]], the tiara is passed from each year's winner to the next.&lt;ref name="RIPJayLake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whatever"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whatever2"/&gt;

Members of the current and previous Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount.&lt;ref name="WTCamp"/&gt; While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined as someone who has had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.&lt;ref name="WTCampElig"/&gt;

Works by winners and nominees of the Campbell Award were collected in the ''New Voices'' series of anthologies, edited by [[George R. R. Martin]], which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984.&lt;ref name="NewV"/&gt; Campbell nominees and winners, such as [[Michael A. Burstein]], who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers.&lt;ref name="WTCampQuotes"/&gt; Criticism has been raised about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.&lt;ref name="Locus"/&gt;

Over the 46 years the award has been active, 195 writers have been nominated. Of these, 47 authors have won, including one tie. There have been 51 writers who were nominated twice, 17 of whom won the award in their second nomination.

==Winners and nominees==
[[File:Jerry Pournelle with the 1973 John W. Campbell Award.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Jerry Pournelle]] with the first Campbell Award at the 1973 Hugo Awards Banquet]]

In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than the year when the writer's eligible work was first published. Each year links to the corresponding "year in literature". Although the Campbell Award is not given explicitly for any particular work, and such works are not recorded by the World Science Fiction Society or Dell Magazines, a selection of works that the writer in question published in the eligibility period are listed. This list includes novels and short stories, and is not intended to be comprehensive. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer's name have won the award; those with a white background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

[[File:UesugiKabuto.jpg|thumb|Floats make their way through the streets of [[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]] on the opening night of the festival.]]

'''Karatsu Kunchi''' (唐津くんち; the suffix "kunchi" simply meaning [[festival]]) is a [[matsuri|Japanese festival]] that takes place annually in the city of [[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]], [[Saga Prefecture]], on [[Japan]]'s island of [[Kyūshū]].

== About ==
The festival, which begins on the evening of November 2 and concludes on 4th, features daily parades of fourteen ''[[hikiyama]]'', massive floats in the form of [[samurai]] helmets, sea [[bream]], [[dragon]]s, and other fantastical creatures, all constructed from wood, lacquer, and other materials. It is the major event of the Karatsu calendar, regularly drawing crowds of anywhere between 150,000 to 500,000 people from the surrounding area over the course of the three-day holiday.

[[File:Hikiyama.jpg|thumb|''Hikiyama'' on display.]]
Each float — which stand between five and six meters, and which weigh anywhere from two to five [[ton]]s — is drawn through the streets of the city by teams of bearers selected from families living in the fourteen traditional neighborhoods of Karatsu, to the chant of "En-ya! En-ya! En-ya!"(or"Yoi-sa! Yoi-sa! Yoi-sa!") and the music of [[taiko]] drummers and [[flutist]]s perched on the floats' base. The event, which is coordinated by the local [[Jinja (shinto)|Shinto shrine]] (near which the floats are stored during the rest of the year), has been held for several centuries now; the current incarnations of the floats were constructed between 1819 and 1876. In 1980, the festival was designated an "Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property".

The '''London New Year's Day Parade''' also known as "LNYDP" is an annual parade through the streets of the [[West End of London]] on 1 January. The parade first took place in 1987,&lt;ref name="30 years"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35209338 | title=London New Year's Day parade marks 30 years | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=1 January 2016 | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Lord Mayor of Westminster's Big Parade'''. The parade was renamed in 1994 and for 2000 only it was called the '''Millennium Parade'''.

==Organisation==
The London [[parade]] is the biggest New Year's Day street event of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&amp;p_theme=oktb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1254859417A88C90&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Amador band goes international for London's New Year's parade | work=The Oakland Tribune| date=23 December 2008 | accessdate=10 May 2013 | author=Moellering, Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracts around a million spectators, and there is ticket-only seating at various points along the route.

==Parade route==  
The parade route is two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) long.&lt;ref name="Thousands"/&gt; Before 2010 it began at [[Parliament Square]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], continuing along [[Whitehall|Parliament Street]] and [[Whitehall]] to [[Trafalgar Square]]. It then continued along [[Cockspur Street]] and [[Regent Street]]. The final section was along [[Piccadilly]] and the parade ended at [[Green Park]].

In 2010 the parade route was reversed to "appease US television broadcasters" and to "give the American audience the best views of the capital's landmarks, such as the [[Elizabeth Tower]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (The Houses of Parliament, also known as Big Ben) and Trafalgar Square".&lt;ref name="Reverse"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8400331.stm | title=London New Year's Day parade reversed for US audience | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=1 January 2010 | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised route started at the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz Hotel]], along Piccadilly to [[Piccadilly Circus]], down [[Regent Street]], then along [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]] to [[Trafalgar Square]], then along [[Whitehall]] to [[Parliament Square]].

==Participants==
The parade is used to raise funds for charities in [[London]] and representatives from each of the 32 [[London borough]]s are encouraged to take part as a "borough entry", judged as part of the event. The winning entry in the 2017 parade was the [[City of Westminster]] with the entry titled Mary Poppins.

===Marching bands===
The Pride of New Mexico Marching Band from New Mexico State University was the first collegiate marching band to participate in the parade. The band, under the direction of George Hattendorf, marched in the first Lord Mayor of Westminster's Big Parade in 1987. 

The [[Shawnee Mission West High School]] marching band from [[Overland Park, Kansas]], USA, has marched in the parade nine times. The 130-member [[Dixie Heights High School]] Marching Colonels from [[Edgewood, Kentucky]] performed in the parade in 1991 led by Band Director Daryl Angel. The 240-member [[Walker Valley High School]] Band from [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], directed by Alan Hunt, and the vocal ensemble from the same school, marched in the 2007 parade. The vocal ensemble was also honoured by being asked to start the parade off by singing the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]]. The 140-member marching band from [[Fort Myers High School]] in [[Florida]], USA, were initially prohibited from taking part in the 2007 parade because US education officials feared they might be caught in a terrorist attack. The decision was later overruled.&lt;ref name="Thousands"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6222311.stm | title=Thousands watch New Year Parade | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=1 January 2007 | accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Overturned"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4886132.stm | title=US pupils allowed on London trip | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=7 April 2006 | accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also hosted the two winners of that year's BBC London competition.

'''Magnum Opus Con (MOC)''' was an annual [[List of multigenre conventions|multigenre convention]] which generally took place each spring in various cities in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] from 1986–2001. Organized by comics retailer Roland Castle, the convention was designed to attract science fiction fans of all stripes. Over its 16-year run, MOC featured hundreds of celebrity guests and ran hundreds of hours of programming for fans of [[science fiction]], [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]], [[comic books]], [[Role-playing game|gaming]], and other elements of [[fandom]].

Most MOCs took place over three days, from Friday to Sunday. The convention featured a large floorspace for exhibitors, including [[collectibles]] merchants and comic book dealers. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with industry professionals, MOC often featured previews of upcoming films and even a celebrity [[softball]] game.

Magnum Opus Con worked on a "membership" basis, which enabled attendees to gain admittance to the convention for the entire weekend.&lt;ref name=memberships&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020407100119/http://www.magnumopuscon.com/cgi-bin/mocpage.pl?page=memberships "Memberships,"] Magnum Opus Con official website (2000).

Accessed June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees were required to be 18 years or older, or accompanied by an adult.&lt;ref name=memberships /&gt; By the early 1990s, the show became known for its parties and risqué [[cosplay]] events such as the "Bimbo Pageant," the "Slave Auction," and the "Mr. Macho Contest." Other late-night activities included the "MOC-Alympics," [[belly dancing]], "MOC(k) Marriages," and "Casino Night." These events gradually became more of the focus of the convention, to the detriment of the panels and workshops.&lt;ref name = Rice&gt;Rice, Sharon.

Magnum Opus Con petered out by the early 2000s due to bad feelings and competition from the much larger and more popular [[Atlanta]]-based [[Dragon Con]].

== History ==
The '''Macon Opus Con''' was founded in 1986 by comics retailer Roland Castle, owner of Comics Castle in [[Macon, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Schweier, Philip. [http://www.comicbookbin.com/bubble085.html "Comic Shops: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"] ''ComicBookBin'' (Dec. 4, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Henry, Scott. [http://clatl.com/atlanta/the-wizard-of-dragoncon-stands-trial/Content?oid=1235454&amp;showFullText=true "The wizard of Dragon*Con stands trial: The force behind Atlanta's largest sci-fi convention finds himself in his own world of darkness,"] ''Creative Loafing'' (Jan. 20, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Castle was president of the [[Bloom County]] Fan Club (thus the name "Opus," in honor of the Bloom County [[Opus the Penguin|character]]); he hoped (and ultimately failed) to get ''[[Bloom County]]'' creator [[Berkeley Breathed]] as the con's guest of honor.&lt;ref&gt;''Southern Enclave'' #16 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Castle created a nonprofit, the Middle Georgia Society for Fantasy and Science Fiction, under which to run the show, and the first MOC was held April 18–20, 1986, at the Macon Hilton. Official guests included ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stars  [[Jon Pertwee]] and [[Louise Jameson]].

The second MOC moved locations 100 miles to [[Columbus, Georgia]], where it was co-organized by retailer Pat Robinson, owner of Columbus Book Exchange. It took place March 27–29, 1987, at the Columbus Ironworks Convention Center. That edition of MOC became notorious because of the death of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor [[Patrick Troughton]]. Although he had been warned by his doctors before leaving the UK not to exert himself because of his heart condition, Troughton appeared to be in good spirits and participated vigorously in the day's panels, and was looking forward to a belated birthday celebration, which was planned for the Saturday evening, as well as a screening of the ''Doctor Who'' story ''[[The Dominators]]'', which Troughton had requested personally, on the Saturday afternoon. Troughton suffered a heart attack at 7:25 AM the next day, just after he had ordered his breakfast from the hotel staff. According to the paramedics who were called, Troughton died instantly.&lt;ref&gt;''FidoNET Newsletter'' vol. 4, # 15 (March 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patrick Troughton, 67, played `Doctor Who' on British TV Series: Obituaries|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampabay/access/49961748.html?dids=49961748:49961748&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+31%252C+1987&amp;author=&amp;pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&amp;desc=Patrick+Troughton%252C+67%252C+played+%2560Doctor+Who%2527+on+British+TV+Series%253A+Obituaries&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=31 March 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOC 3, now officially known as '''Magnum Opus Con'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiacorporates.com/corp/480508.html "MAGNUM OPUS CON, INC.,"] Georgia Corporates website. Accessed June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; was held March 25–27, 1988, at the Columbus Ironworks Convention Center.

For MOC 4, held March 17–19, 1989, the convention shifted locations 250 miles to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and the Hyatt Regency, where it stayed for six years. MOC 5, held March 23–25, 1990, focused on Star Trek, Doctor Who, comics, and film (featuring [[anime]] and a "cinema contest"). The convention included an art show and live role-playing games. MOC 7, held March 26–29, 1992, expanded to four days, from Thursday–Sunday.

By this time, organizer Roland Castle felt that the Atlanta-based [[Dragon Con]] (est. 1987) was impinging on his territory, and that DC employees, including organizer [[Edward E. Kramer]], were disrupting MOC.&lt;ref name=Henry /&gt; [See ''[[#Fandom|Fandom]]'', below.] Castle began a policy of "banning" various individuals from MOC,&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; which eventually included official guests like [[Tom Deitz]].

MOC 10 signaled a shift in many ways for Magnum Opus Con. After five years in Greenville, South Carolina, Castle moved MOC 225 miles to [[Callaway Gardens]], in [[Pine Mountain, Harris County, Georgia|Pine Mountain, Georgia]]. As befitting its new location, MOC 10 attempted to become more family-friendly, toning down the revelry and eliminating the "Slave Auction" and the "Bimbo Pageant." Guests included the usual celebrities and science fiction authors, as well as [[NASA]] scientists and former astronauts. That year's show motto was "Bringing you the BEST in science AND science fiction!" In addition, after being held exclusively in March or April every year, MOC 10 was scheduled for July 13–16, 1995, the same weekend as [[Dragon Con]]. MOC 10 was dedicated to author [[Roger Zelazny]], a scheduled guest who died shortly before the show. Despite, or maybe because, of all the changes, MOC 10 was not well attended.

To make up for the perceived failures of MOC 10, Castle organized "MOC 10A," which took place February 15–18, 1996, at the Adams Mark Hotel, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Samuel A. [http://www.smithuel.net/sfchb/hbp3nc.html "North Carolina,"] ''1997 Southern Fandom Confederation Handbook &amp; History: PART III: Regional Survey'' (2000). Accessed June 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By all reports, MOC 10A returned to the debauchery of previous Magnum Opus Cons, with the Slave Auction, Bimbo Pageant, and Mr. Macho Contest all returning to prominence. Total attendance was reported to be around 450 people.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

MOC 11 was held June 13–16, 1996, at the Downtown Raddison, in Atlanta, Georgia, again in competition with [[Dragon Con]] (which took place the following weekend). MOC 12 returned to its traditional March schedule, staying in Atlanta, and featuring comics guests like [[Keith Giffen]], [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], and [[Simon Bisley]]. It also downsized a bit, returning to a three-day event. By this time, attendance at MOC was declining, in many ways due to competition from [[Dragon Con]]. (In June of that year, Castle publicly accused Dragon Con of sabotaging his convention and poaching MOC guests.)&lt;ref&gt;Castle, Roland. [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.fandom.cons/wa_BQoTRECA "DC is jealous and scared,"] Alt.fandom.cons / Google Groups (June 14, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

For MOC 13, held March 20–22, 1998, the convention moved 75 miles to [[Athens, Georgia]]. and the History Village Inn, where it stayed for the next three years. That year, Castle organized "MOCtoberfest '98," held October 30–November 1, 1998, also at the History Village Inn in Athens.

MOC 15, held March 31–April 2, 2000, was Roland Castle's final show as convention chairman; he stepped down early the next year&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;Bell, Greg. [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.fandom.cons/5eonWVxlRQE "MOC-16 Update,"] alt.fandom.cons newsgroup (Feb. 13, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; due to stress-related health reasons.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020216101800/http://www.magnumopuscon.com/cgi-bin/mocpage.pl?page=faq "FAQ,"] Magnum Opus Con official website (2000).

Magnum Opus Con's new co-chairmen were Monnie Robinson and Greg Bell, who had both been involved in MOC for many years.&lt;ref name = FAQ /&gt; Robinson and Bell dubbed MOC 16 " The Sweet Sixteen Party,"&lt;ref name=Bell /&gt; which was held March 15–18, 2001, at the Ramada Plaza Hotel Perimeter North, in Atlanta. Despite the new leadership, the show was not a success, and MOC 16 turned out to be the convention's last hurrah.

{{Chapters in the Gospel of Mark}}
'''Mark 15''' is the fifteenth chapter of the [[Gospel of Mark]] in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Christian]] [[Bible]]. It continues [[Jesus]]' [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]], including his [[Pilate's court|trial before Pontius Pilate]] and then his [[Crucifixion of Christ|crucifixion, death]] and [[Entombment of Christ|entombment]].

==Structure==
The [[New King James Version]] organises this chapter as follows:
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:1-5|NKJV}} = Jesus faces Pilate
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:6-15|NKJV}} = Taking the Place of Barabbas
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:16-20|NKJV}} = The Soldiers Mock Jesus
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:21-32|NKJV}} = The King on a Cross
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:33-41|NKJV}} = Jesus Dies on the Cross
*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:42-47|NKJV}} = Jesus Buried in Joseph’s Tomb

== Trial before Pilate ==
{{main|Pilate's court}}
It is early in the morning. The [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin reaches a decision]] and hands Jesus over to [[Pontius Pilate]]. Pilate was the Roman [[Prefect]] (governor) of [[Iudaea Province#Iudaea|Iudaea Province]] from 26 to 36, which was the Roman combination of [[Idumea]], [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] and did not include [[Galilee]], which was under the jurisdiction of [[Herod Antipas]]. According to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], the Sanhedrin had decided to [[Capital punishment|execute]] Jesus. Only the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] were allowed to execute someone, not the local officials, according to [[John 18:31]], yet {{bibleverse||Acts|6:12}} records the [[Sanhedrin]] ordering the [[stoning]] of [[Saint Stephen]] and also [[James the Just]] according to [[Antiquities of the Jews]] (20.9.1), resulting in a rebuke from the Roman authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/ant20.html Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', 20.9.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verse 2===
: ''Pilate asked him, 'Are you the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]?' 
:: ''He answered him, 'You say so.' ''(NRSV)&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|15:2|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verse 2 in Greek====
[[Textus Receptus]]/[[Byzantine text-type|Majority Text]]:
: καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Πιλάτος, Σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων;
:: ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, Σὺ λέγεις.

Cross reference: [[Matthew 27:11]]; [[Luke 23:3]]; [[John 18:37]]

An interpretation is that Pilate is asking Jesus if he is the [[messiah]], just as the [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] before in {{bibleverse||Mark|14:61}}, only with an explicit emphasis on the Messiah's political role, that of Jewish King.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 627"&gt;Brown ''et al.'' 627&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gospel of John|John's gospel]], in response to Pilate's question Jesus has a short conversation with Pilate and then answers, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me." [[Historical Jesus|Historically]] it is likely that perceived [[insurrection]] against [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was for what Pilate executed Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Brown et al. 628&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{bibleverse||Mark|12:17}}, however, Jesus said one should [[Render unto Caesar...|pay the Roman tax]] and was thus not a [[Zealot|revolutionary]]. The 1985 [[Jesus Seminar]] reached the conclusion that the [[Jesus and the Money Changers|temple incident]] was the cause of the crucifixion.

===Verse 3===
The chief priests make several further, unspecified, allegations, "heaping accusations on Him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/wey/mark/15.htm Mark 15:3], Weymouth New Testament&lt;/ref&gt; Some manuscripts state here that Jesus gives no reply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm Pulpit Commentary on Mark 15], accessed 27 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Pilate pushes him for one but he still remains silent, which amazes or surprises Pilate. According to [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Pilate at this point sent Jesus to [[Herod Antipas]] because Jesus, as a Galilean, was under Herod's jurisdiction. Herod was excited to see Jesus at first, but ended up mocking him and sending him back to Pilate.

===Release of Barabbas===
According to Mark's account, it was a custom to release a prisoner at [[Passover]], which was a celebration of freedom. No other historical record of the time records Pilate doing this, and he is known to have been cruel, for which he was eventually expelled from his post.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 281&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/ant18.html JA18].4.2) All the other [[Gospel]]s however also agree with Mark on this tradition. Some theologians suggest that Pilate did this once or a few times &lt;ref name="Brown et al. 627"/&gt; or that the Gospels accurately record this tradition even though other sources fail to mention. The [[Jesus Seminar]] argued doing this during a volatile situation like this would have been unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 49&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matthew, Pilate received a message from his [[Pontius Pilate's wife|wife]] that she believed Jesus was innocent because of a disturbing dream she had just had. He asks the crowd if they want the King of the Jews released to them because, according to Mark, Pilate knew the priests were [[envy|envious]] of Jesus and so presumably wanted to free him without a fight with them.

[[File:Eccehomo2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|''Ecce Homo'' (''Behold, the Man!''), [[Antonio Ciseri]], 19th century: Pontius Pilate presents a scourged Jesus of Nazareth to onlookers]]

The priests however convince the crowd to ask for the release of [[Barabbas]], a prisoner. Mark says he was in prison chained "with" insurrectionists who had committed murder during a recent στασισ (''stasis'', a riot), probably "one of ... numerous insurrections against the Roman power" &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/15.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Mark 15], accessed 11 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] says he was "at the head" of the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/mark/15.htm Gill's Exposition of Mark 15], accessed 11 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Both Luke and John say he was a [[zealots|revolutionary]]. Jesus seems to have already been declared guilty as this seems a choice between releasing two prisoners.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 627"/&gt;

Pilate then asks what should be done with Jesus. They say he should be crucified, but Pilate asks what he is guilty of. They still demand he be crucified so Pilate turns Barabbas over to the crowd and has Jesus [[Flagellation|flogged]] and then sent out to be crucified. Matthew has Pilate washing his hands and declaring the crowd responsible, which the crowd accepts.

For his flogging Jesus would have been tied to a pillar, and hit with [[bone]] or [[metal]] studded [[whip]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 628"&gt;Brown ''et al.'' 628&lt;/ref&gt; Crucifixion was a particularly shameful form of death, with a stigma put onto even the condemned's family.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman magistrates had wide discretion in executing their tasks, and some question whether Pilate would have been so captive to the demands of the crowd. Summarily executing someone to calm the situation however would have been a tool a Roman governor would have used.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

== The soldiers mock Jesus ==
[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ by Grünewald]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{main|Mocking of Jesus}}
Mark says the soldiers took Jesus to the [[Praetorium]], either [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's palace]] or the [[Antonia Fortress|Fortress Antonia]].&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 628"/&gt; They gather together all the other soldiers. These were probably mostly recruits from the area of Palestine or Syria.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 628"/&gt;

The soldiers put a [[purple]] robe on Jesus and put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head and mockingly hail him as the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]. They hit him in the head with a staff and pay fake [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to him. According to Matthew they put the staff in his hand first before beating him with it. They dress him in his own clothes and take him out to be crucified. According to John they left his purple robe and crown on.

Jesus is given the trappings of a King. Purple is a [[Tyrian purple|royal color]]. He wears a crown and is hit with a staff, also a royal [[symbol]]. This whole scene is colored with [[Divinity|divine]] [[irony]], as everything the soldiers do to mock Jesus' claim of being a King is used by Mark to show this, at the height of the Passion, as Jesus' crowning as messiah according to [[God]]'s plan.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John after the [[Flagellation of Christ|flogging]] Pilate brought Jesus back a second time and tried to convince the crowd that he was innocent but the crowd still demanded Jesus' death and so then Pilate had him crucified. Luke has no account of the soldiers beating Jesus.

On the way to their final destination the soldiers force a man passing by, [[Simon of Cyrene]], to carry Jesus' cross for him, though Mark does not say why. [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] was in North [[Africa]] and Simon would have moved from there or would have been visiting. Mark lists his children, Alexander and Rufus. That Mark takes the time to list only their names suggests they might have been [[Early Christians]] known to Mark's intended audience.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 628"/&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] also lists a Rufus in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=52&amp;chapter=16&amp;version=31 16:13]. Luke has Jesus talking to some of his women followers along the way.

They arrive at [[Aramaic of Jesus#Golgotha .28.CE.93.CE.BF.CE.BB.CE.B3.CE.BF.CE.B8.CE.B1.29|Golgotha]], which Mark says means the place of the [[skull]]. This was probably an exhausted rock quarry whose remaining rock had been damaged in an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 286&lt;/ref&gt;

They offer Jesus [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses. Mark then simply says they crucified him. They then take his clothes and divide lots to distribute them. People have seen a relationship with this and Psalm [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=23&amp;chapter=22&amp;version=31 22:18], which John actually quotes as a fulfillment of [[prophecy]].

According to Mark, it was the "third hour" when Jesus was crucified. This would be the third hour of daylight, or about 9:00 AM. John however says Jesus was condemned to death around the sixth hour, or [[noon]]. The charge listed on Jesus' cross is "THE KING OF THE JEWS" ([[INRI]]) According to John, the chief priests complained to Pilate about this but he refused to change the charge.

Two [[Theft|robbers]] were also crucified on each side of him and according to Mark 15, both of them mocked Jesus, even when they were in their processes of death. Luke reports the robbers' conversation with Jesus. People come by and insult Jesus and mock him for claiming he would destroy and then rebuild [[Herod's Temple]] in three days, which Jesus has not said so far in Mark but was falsely accused of claiming to destroy the "man-made" Temple and rebuilt it in three days in Mark [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=14&amp;version=31 14:57–58]. The chief priests are also there and say that if he is really the [[Christ]] then he should be able to come down from the cross and save himself as he had saved others, a reference to his many [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] earlier in Mark.

Mark relates these two mockings to perhaps highlight the question of why, if Jesus is indeed the messiah, can he not save himself from being put to death. Mark refutes these two charges later when Jesus rebuilds the Temple of his body and not only overcomes the cross but death itself in Mark [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=16&amp;version=31 16].&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 288&lt;/ref&gt; Mark might be stressing that if one follows Jesus, who Mark believes is the messiah, then one can expect help from God, such as Jesus' miracles, but one will not be saved from the pains of this world, and indeed in some way they are necessary to achieve a greater goal as Jesus' death is necessary for his role as the messiah.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[File:Uncial 0184 Mk 15,36–37.40-41.jpg| 250px|thumb|right |[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 15:36-37,40-41in [[Greek language|Greek]]-[[Coptic language|Coptic]] from [[Uncial 0184]] (Vindobonensis Pap. K. 8662; 6th century).]]
According to Mark:
:''And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, [[Aramaic of Jesus#Eli Eli lema sabachthani .28.CE.97.CE.BB.CE.B5.CE.B9 .CE.97.CE.BB.CE.B5.CE.B9 .CE.BB.CE.B5.CE.BC.CE.B1 .CF.83.CE.B1.CE.B2.CE.B1.CF.87.CE.B8.CE.B1.CE.BD.CE.B5.CE.B9.29|Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani]]? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood by, when heard it, said, Behold, he calleth [[Elijah|Elias]]. And one ran and filled a spunge full of [[vinegar]], and put it on a [[Phragmites|reed]], and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the [[soul|ghost]]. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. And when the [[Centurion (Roman army)|centurion]], which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.''

The soldier might be recognizing something that no one else could and thus vindicating Jesus,&lt;ref name="Brown 147"&gt;Brown 147&lt;/ref&gt; or he might be saying this [[Sarcasm|sarcastically]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 51&lt;/ref&gt; This statement may bring the Gospel full circle to {{bibleverse||Mark|1:1|31}} where Jesus is identified by the writer as "the Son of God" (only in some versions, see [[Mark 1]] for details). Luke records that he said that Jesus was a [[righteous]] man. Matthew adds that at the moment of Jesus' death tombs in Jerusalem were opened and many bodies of "the [[saints]]" were raised from the dead. They were seen subsequently in the "holy city," Jerusalem, by many ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:53–54|31}}).

The veil of the Temple was the barrier between the inner Temple, thought to be God's place on Earth, and the rest. Its destruction is a vindication of Jesus. This might be a [[metaphor]] for God now no longer being separated but free for all the world.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 291&lt;/ref&gt; Given the imagery of the temple veil (there were cherubim woven into it, like the cherub set as guard over the entrance to Eden after Adam and Eve were cast out) as a symbol of the barrier between the Holy God and sinful men, the rending of the veil indicates a propitiation of God's wrath.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to John, Jesus' mother [[Mary the mother of Jesus|Mary]] and her sister Mary were there with the [[Disciple whom Jesus loved]] and Jesus told the disciple to take Mary into his home.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Jesus' entombment ==
''For the subject in art, see [[Entombment of Christ]]''
[[File:Pieter Lastman - Graflegging.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Entombment of Christ by [[Pieter Lastman]]]]

It is notable that, according to Mark, it is only Jesus' women followers who are now still with him:

:''Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were [[Mary Magdalene]], Mary the mother of James the younger and of [[Joses]], and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]]. In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.'' ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2015:40–41;&amp;version=31; 40–41])

Mary Magdalene has not been mentioned so far in Mark, and the other Mary is perhaps Jesus' mother Mary as she is also mentioned as James' mother in Mark [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=6&amp;version=31 6:3]. She could also be another Mary, perhaps another relative.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 293&lt;/ref&gt; Salome was [[Saint James the Great|James]]' and [[John the Apostle|John]]'s mother. The fact the Mark has not explicitly related any of Jesus' interaction with them shows that Mark has left out many of the events of the life of the "[[Historical Jesus]]" and only related events he deems necessary to make his points about Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgallen 294&lt;/ref&gt;

John says the soldiers were told to take down the bodies for the Sabbath and broke the other two men's legs but stabbed Jesus with a spear to make sure he was dead. John claims this is eye witness testimony.

Evening is approaching and [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the [[sanhedrin]], who was also waiting for the "[[Kingdom of God]]," goes to Pilate and asks for Jesus' body. The Scholars Version&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; notes this as "unexpected .. Is Joseph in effect bringing Jesus into his family?" As the next day was the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] Jesus would have to have been buried before sundown or then not until the next night. According to [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]], if someone was hanged on a tree they were not to remain there at night.&lt;ref name="Brown 147"/&gt; ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:22–23}}) Pilate is surprised Jesus had died so soon and asks for confirmation, and then gives Jesus' body to Joseph.

Joseph wraps it in [[linen]] and puts it in a [[sepulchre]], rolls a stone over the entrance, and leaves. According to John, he was assisted by the Pharisee [[Nicodemus]]. The two Marys witness the burial, or at any rate the location where Jesus' body was buried: German biblical commentators [[Heinrich August Wilhelm Meyer|Meyer]] and [[Bernhard Weiss|Weiss]] infer from the Greek [[perfect tense]] τέθειται (''tetheitai'', he was laid) that "the women were not present at the burial, but simply approached and took note where Jesus lay after burial".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/mark/15.htm Expositor's Greek Testament on Mark 15], accessed 12 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Bodies were normally anointed, but there seems to be no time here. John however says Nicodemus wrapped up Jesus' body with spices, which seems to indicate an anointing. The tomb, one of many around Jerusalem, was a [[limestone]] [[cave]] and Jesus' body would have been laid on a pre-cut shelf, and then most bodies would have been left for a year.&lt;ref name="Brown et al. 628"/&gt;

Jesus' trial before Pilate and his crucifixion, death, and burial are also found in [[Matthew 27|Matthew]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=27&amp;version=31 27], Luke [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=23&amp;version=31 23], and John [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2018:28–19:42;&amp;version=31; 18:28–19:42].

==Background==

===Historical===
{{see also|Nittel Nacht}}
Historically, Jews in Europe would hide in their homes and villages during the Christmas holiday, for fear of violence from locals.&lt;ref name="JTA2009"&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/12/17/1009795/w ''What’s a Jew to do on Christmas Eve?'', JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency), December 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Christmas and Christmas Eve typically serve as times of family gathering and prayer for Christians and many others.&lt;ref name="TimesSeason"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE1DA143DF937A15751C1A96E9C8B63 Jennifer 8. Lee, ''A Season of More'', New York Times, December 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmosphere of religious liberalism and tolerance in the United States has offered American Jews the opportunity to enjoy the holiday period.&lt;ref name="JTA2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracy&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/115997/christmas-jews-greatest-holiday Marc Tracy, ''Christmas is the Greatest Jewish Holiday'', The New Republic, December 19, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many [[American Jews]] do not engage in the same family-gathering activities on the Christmas holiday that Christians in the United States do.&lt;ref name=Tracy /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesDeciding"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/16/garden/deciding-to-celebrate-christmas-or-not.html?pagewanted=all Brenda Lane Richardson, ''Deciding to Celebrate Christmas, or Not'', New York Times, December 16, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesOff"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/22/nyregion/off-on-yom-kippur-it-s-probably-time-to-work-a-holiday.html?pagewanted=all Daniel J. Wakin, ''Off on Yom Kippur? It's Probably Time To Work a Holiday'', New York Times, December 22, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social===
With [[Christmas Day]] a [[work holiday]] throughout the United States, there is a space of unfilled free time during which much of American commerce and society is not functioning, and which could lead to a sense of alienation or loneliness for American Jews.&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vigoda&gt;Arlene Vigoda, ''Cry No More'', USA Today, December 13, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether "by their own volition or by the insistent nudging of their parents and grandparents," many young American Jews now attend these Christmas Eve singles events.&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt; While some party-goers admit that they attend with an eye toward flirting and romance, others maintain that they go only to spend time with friends, dance, and drink cocktails.&lt;ref name=Vilensky /&gt;

Events such as the Matzo Ball are also seen by some leaders in the Jewish community as a last chance to engage some young American Jews who come "out of the woodwork" for drinking and socializing but are otherwise difficult to reach and uninvolved with Jewish organizations.&lt;ref name=Werthheimer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gH0RuVR24rYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%28%22matzo+ball%22+OR+matzoball%29+%22christmas+eve%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CQyRVPiNJpGqoQTLxoCYAQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%28%22matzo%20ball%22%20OR%20matzoball%29%20%22christmas%20eve%22&amp;f=false Jack Werthheimer, ''The New Jewish Leaders: Reshaping the American Jewish Landscape'', University Press of New England, 2011, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Boston University]] [[senior (education)|senior]] in [[political science]] and part-time bartender in 1986, Rudnick attended a Jewish young professionals Christmas Eve gathering at a local hotel, where he found a staid atmosphere similar to a high school prom, with women on one side of the room, and men on the other.&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; The environment, including the strong lighting, waits to purchase drink tickets and to receive a drink, bad music, and stale [[latkes]] were not conductive to meeting people and having fun.&lt;ref name=Kirchick&gt;[http://tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187629/matzo-ball-singles James Kirchick, ''Matzoball Memories: My uncle, godfather of the Jewish singles business, created a Christmas Eve tradition'', Tablet Magazine, December 22, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gluck /&gt;

Following that incident, Rudnick began developing the idea for hosting an event the next December 24 at the nightclub he then bartended part-time at, Metro.&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt; He and his friends built up awareness of the upcoming event through word of mouth, posters, and flyers hand-distributed, including at malls.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt; Some coverage of the event by local radio DJs, who invited Rudnick on-air to promote it,&lt;ref name=Gluck /&gt; and Rudnick's on-air exaggerations about expected ticket sales,&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt; helped spread the word and 2,000 people attended the first Matzo Ball.&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gluck /&gt; Rudnick soon quit his job in [[commercial real estate]] to focus on the organization and event, and expanding to other cities.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;

The name of the event and the name of the organization were created on-the-spot in 1987. The event name was inspired by Rudnick's [[Irish-American]] coworker's question about Jewish cuisine,&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt; and the organization's name was thought up by Rudnick and his [[Italian-American]] nightclub bosses, Boston Entertainment mogul brothers John and Patrick Lyons, who were concerned about offending both Jews and Christians with the stereotypical name Matzo Ball for an event being held on Christmas Eve, and harming the club's reputation.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york-news/matzoball-founder-launches-matzobowl Heather Robinson, ''MatzoBall Founder Launches 'MatzoBowl''', New York Jewish Week, April 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for the event considered by Rudnick were 'Tribe Trot' and 'Heeb Hop', both of which were rejected upon the recommendation of Rudnick's mother, who also found the name Matzo Ball to be cute.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;

The event has permeated American Jewish consciousness, even winding up in fiction,&lt;ref name=Segre&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KfiT_zp9GRYC&amp;q=%22matzo+ball%22+%22christmas+eve%22&amp;dq=%22matzo+ball%22+%22christmas+eve%22 Francesca Segrè, ''Daughter of the Bride'', 2006, pp. 243–244]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liebman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=92i6FhHYthEC&amp;pg=PT32 Shana Liebman, ''Sex, Drugs &amp; Gefilte Fish: The Heeb Storytelling Collection'', Grand Central Publishing, 2009, p.

===Logistics===

====Tickets and crowd====
Matzo Ball events are generally held at popular nightclubs in the cities in which the event is located.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckett /&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KbwfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%28%22matzo+ball%22+OR+matzoball%29+%22christmas+eve%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CQyRVPiNJpGqoQTLxoCYAQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%28%22matzo%20ball%22%20OR%20matzoball%29%20%22christmas%20eve%22&amp;f=false Carin Davis, ''Life, Love, Lox: Real-World Advice for the Modern Jewish Girl'', [[Running Press]], 2010, p. 149]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA2007" /&gt; The average age range of the crowd spans from the 20s through 40s, unless otherwise specified.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckett /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rourke /&gt; A ticket purchased at the door can cost $30–40.&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vilensky /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeitlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2013 /&gt;

Attendance at the New York event can average from 1,100 to 1,700 people,&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2011 /&gt; with an entry line forming outside the venue 30 minutes before the scheduled start time.&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt; Crowd sizes at smaller venues, like in Boca Raton, can be 800 to 1,000 people.,&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily /&gt; but with a crowd that arrives later, leading to a long line for entry at midnight.&lt;ref name="Heyman2011"/&gt;

The event is typically scheduled to begin at 8 or 9 p.m. and run through the [[last call (bar term)|last call]] time for the state/locality, with peak attendance and flirting at approximately midnight.&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLPD&gt;[https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-32845063/the-matzo-ball-no-it-isn-t-something-to-eat ''The Matzo Ball: No, It Isn't Something to Eat'', St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 17, 1993, p. 3G]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Heyman&gt;[http://thematzoballparty.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_archive.html Stephen Heyman, ''Matzo Ball Offers Singular Senation for Jewish Partyers'', Palm Beach Post, December 26, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RobinsonNYB&gt;[http://www.nyblueprint.com/dating/reflections-matzo-ball Heather Robinson, ''Reflections on the matzo ball'', New York Blueprint, December 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, ticket prices include hors d'oeuvres and sometimes a ticket for a free drink, sometimes limited to early arrivals.&lt;ref name=Arseniuk&gt;[http://www.digitaleditiononline.com/publication/index.php?i=56606&amp;m=&amp;l=&amp;p=67&amp;pre=&amp;ver=swf Melissa Arseniuk, ''Nightlife: Seven Nights'', Vegas Seven, December 23, 2010, p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pesce&gt;Nicole Lyn Pesce, ''Monday in New York'', New York Daily News, December 24, 2007, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd is often well-dressed.&lt;ref name=Baicker&gt;[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/the-scene/archive/Jewish-at-Christmas.html Sarah Baicker, ''Jewish at Christmas?'', NBC 10 Philadelphia, December 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Associated activities====
Some party-goers to Christmas Eve singles events "[[pregaming|pregame]]" with friends at home before arriving at the event.&lt;ref name=Yadegaran&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11424305.html Jessica Yadegaran, ''Christmas Eve party alternative: Latke Ball'', Contra Costa Times, December 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, the Matzo Ball is linked officially or unofficially to other Jewish events on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, such as volunteering at local food banks.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;

Rudnick and SYJP have also experimented with a variety of other activities, including singles cruises, Valentine's Day and Passover-linked parties, and a magazine.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;

====Co-sponsorship====
The official organizer for the Matzo Ball events is Rudnick's Society of Young Jewish Professionals.&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt; An occasional sponsor of the Matzo Ball is JDate, even during those periods when JDate organized its own Christmas Eve event in Los Angeles under the name 'Schmooz-a-Palooza'.&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gluck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyman2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Block /&gt;

Local groups and individuals also sometimes work with SYJP, especially when the event is new or newly reintroduced in a given city.&lt;ref name=Rourke /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt;&lt;ref name=PostCourier /&gt;

====Crowd diversity====
At various times, the Matzo Ball has experimented with dividing some of its venues by age into different rooms or even separate adjacent venues, even giving a separate event name, "The Big Chill", to the party catering to 30-somethings seeking a less-noisy environment.&lt;ref name=Duckett /&gt;&lt;ref name="Heyman2011"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204464404577117014063912978 Marshall Heyman, ''The Matzo Ball Night Out'', Wall Street Journal, December 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Block /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zibart&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-981257.html Eve Zibart, ''Matzo Balls on Christmas Eve'', Washington Post, December 24, 1993, p. N13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MatzoBall2014 /&gt; The events are open to the public, and couples and non-Jews looking for a Christmas Eve activity are welcome to come,&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily /&gt;&lt;ref name=Block&gt;[http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/12/matzoballin_a_christmas_eve_ba.php Tracy Block, ''Matzo Ballin': A Christmas Eve Bash for the Chosen People'', Miami New Times, December 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  "though, obviously, it caters largely to young people who aren't spending Christmas Eve with their families or at church."&lt;ref name=Vilensky&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304483804579280720216837300 Mike Vilensky, ''Another Kind of Christmas Eve Tradition: The Matzo Ball Brings 'Young Professionals, Jewish Singles' Together'', Wall Street Journal, December 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Matzo Ball cities, a number of attendees are from out-of-town, particularly in cities that have large numbers of visitors or where families tend to gather for the winter holidays, such as Boca Raton, which has a large number of New Yorkers during the holiday period.&lt;ref name="Heyman2011"/&gt;

====Atmosphere====
Rudnick's formula for the Matzo Ball atmosphere is to find a large venue that can handle the large crowds, and for the lights to get dimmer and the music to get louder gradually over the course of the night.&lt;ref name=Rourke /&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA2006"&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2006/12/27/archive/first-person-the-search-for-the-better-matzo-ball-leads-to-a-tour-of-manhattan-debauch ''First Person: The Search for the Better Matzo Ball Leads to a Tour of Manhattan Debauchery'', JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency), December 27, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for easier mingling and conversation earlier in the night before the hip-hop and dance/house music becomes loud enough to encourage dancing.&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoeneman&gt;Deborah Schoeneman, ''Have a Ball with Matzo or Monster's'', New York Post, December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudnick rejects the usual aspects of Jewish social events, including name tags, announcements, and live bands, because they would be a distraction from mingling.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rourke /&gt;

===Locations===
Rudnick and SYJP expand the Matzo Ball to new cities when they believe that have found the infrastructure and potential clientele of  young, upscale Jewish people necessary to make the event successful.&lt;ref name=Rourke /&gt;

As of 2014, it has expanded to the following cities:&lt;ref name="Canada" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MatzoBall2014&gt;[http://matzoball.org/matzoball_events/ Society of Young Jewish Professionals, ''Events'', 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MatzoBall"&gt;[http://matzoball.org/event.php Society of Young Jewish Professionals, ''Select Your City'', MatzoBall.org, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the mid-2000s, in [[Los Angeles]], the Matzo Ball had ceded the region to the much more locally long-standing [[#Schmooz-a-Palooza|Schmooz-a-Palooza]] hosted by Stu &amp; Lew Productions&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt; (which was acquired by [[JDate]] in 2006&lt;ref name="Schmooz"&gt;[http://www.onlinedatingscene.com/archives/214 Press Release, ''Spark Networks Acquires Schmooz-a-Palooza'', OnlineDatingScene, December 7, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;), before becoming a co-promoter for the event with JDate.&lt;ref name="MatzoBall" /&gt;  Starting at least as early as 2009, the Matzo Ball partnered with JDate and promoted as a Matzo Ball the JDate/Stu &amp; Lew Productions Schmooz-a-Palooza.&lt;ref name="MatzoBall" /&gt; By 2014, the Schmooz-a-Palooza brand appeared to have been retired from use.&lt;ref name=Schmooz2014 /&gt;

===Results===
Rudnick promotes the in-person meetings that take place at the Matzo Ball as an antidote to online dating and its tendency to urge daters to always look for an even better catch around the corner.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;

The socializing and flirting that takes place at the Matzo Ball gives rise to many romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=Hwang /&gt; The  organizers believe that more than 1,000 marriages have resulted from meetings at various Matzo Balls (and stopped counting after reaching the 1,000 mark&lt;ref name=Heyman2010 /&gt;), and Rudnick himself met his wife at a Matzo Ball in 1997, where she tended bar.&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boca"&gt;''Plans Under Way for holiday 'Matzo Ball' in Boca, Elsewhere'', Boca Raton/Delray Beach News, November 4, 2007, p. 6A, available via [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=20071104&amp;id=jQcQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GY8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,152635 Google News]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the mid-2010s, there is now a "second generation" of Matzo Ball attendees — children born to parents who first met at the Matzo Ball in previous decades — who are now old enough to attend.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt;

==Competitors==
There are also a number of competitors to the Matzo Ball and other events organized in cities where no Matzo Ball is held.&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA2007" /&gt;

The competition among the Christmas Eve parties has occasionally been stiff, especially during the "Matzo Ball wars of the early 90s", with use of similar-sounding event names, the use of [[touts]] and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]] to chase away those touts outside events, and ticket dumping to "crush" the competition.&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt;

===The Ball===
A major competitor to the Matzo Ball in New York is known simply as "The Ball",&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt; which began operations in 1994.&lt;ref name="Heyman2011"/&gt; In New York City, The Ball focuses on having separate venues, five as of the early 2010, targeted by age [[demographic]], and with attendees receiving limousine service between venues,&lt;ref name="JTA2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA1999"&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/1999/11/30/14809/Thesearchfortheb ''Seeking the perfect Matzo Ball'', JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency), November 30, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218214925/http://jta.org/news/article/1999/11/30/14809/Thesearchfortheb |date=December 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although party-goers must purchase an all-access pass to attend all five events.&lt;ref name=Heyman2011 /&gt;

However, the Los Angeles version of The Ball, which was instead co-sponsored and co-marketed by the young adults divisions of the LA Guardians, the [[Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging]] foundation, was successful and held again in 2009.&lt;ref name="HuffPo2009"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-spira/jewish-singles-gather-in_b_403698.html Julie Spira, ''Jewish Singles Gather in LA to Celebrate the Holidays in Style and Support the Elderly'', Huffington Post, December 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBCLA2009"&gt;[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/around-town/events/Mix-and-Be-Merry-at-The-Ball-79985352.html Alysia Gray Painter, ''Mix and Be Merry at The Ball: Jewish singles hobnob in Hollywood on December 24th'', NBC Los Angeles, December 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardians2009"&gt;[http://www.laguardians.com/magazines/winter_09.pdf ''Young Divisions' Holiday Ball'', The Guardian (newsletter), Winter 2009, p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; The co-sponsorship continued, raising money for the LA Jewish Home, through 2012.&lt;ref name=PRWeb&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/jewishsingles/ball/prweb10223786.htm Jeff Strank, Press Release, ''Christmas Eve Not a Silent Night for 4,000 Jewish Singles at "The Ball"'', PRWEb.com, December 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Guardians and The Ball broke off their association, as the Guardians began organizing their own Christmas Eve event.&lt;ref name=Donney&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/calendar_stories/article/calendar_december_21_january_3 Laura Donney, ''Calendar: December 21-January 3'', Los Angeles Jewish Journal, December 19, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ball, in turn, partnered nationally with online dating sites [[Match.com]] and [[OKCupid]], both of which advertised The Ball events across the country to their members.&lt;ref name=Zeitlin&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short-takes/o-holy-night Alan Zeitlin, ''O Holy Night!: Christmas Eve is abrim with lots 'o Matzo Balls and other events designed with Jewish singles in mind'', New York Jewish Week, December 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche and local events===

====New York City====
Other New York City Jewish Christmas Eve events include parties for "the pro-Israel crowd, Jewish gays and lesbians, and downtown Jewish hipsters."&lt;ref name="JTA2007" /&gt;

The sheer number of events, combined with the compactness of Manhattan, means that events are often held within a short walking distance, if not eyesight of one another.&lt;ref name="JTA2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JTA1999" /&gt;

====Chicago====
Likewise, by the late 2000s, Chicago Jewish Christmas Eve events ran the gamut of tastes and preferred crowd.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;[http://www.nbcchicago.com/the-scene/events/Tonight-Eve-of-Christmas-Eve-le-colonial-pasha-subterranean-112381579.html Marcus Riley, ''Tonight: Eve of Christmas Eve'', NBC 5 Chicago, December 23, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; These included gatherings named 'Rockmitzvah', 'Hubukkah', the 'Heebonism' bash (sponsored by [[Heeb Magazine]]), and the more mainstream 'The Juju Ball' and 'Retro Eve', a long running but now defunct event.&lt;ref name=Riley /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;[http://www.chicagomag.com/Radar/Nightspotting/December-2008/Matzo-Tov/ Sarah Preston, ''Matzo Tov!'', Chicago Magazine blog, December 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington, DC====
In Washington, DC, a longtime competitor and alternative to the Matzo Ball has been the Gefilte Fish Gala, an event with no admission charge but only a requested donation, which is usually also held on Christmas Eve unless the night of the 24th coincides with Friday night, the Jewish sabbath.&lt;ref name=Jain&gt;Aruna Jain, (December 23, 2004) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18057-2004Dec21.html For Those of Other Faiths, a Not-So-Silent Night] [[Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2010, an informal group of Washington, DC, Jewish young professionals decided to organize another competitor to the Matzo Ball, the Falafel Frenzy, with all proceeds going to charity.&lt;ref name=WJW2013&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2876101191.html Emily Jacobs, ''Falafel Frenzy'', Washington Jewish Week, January 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been successful in collecting money for local charities and continues to be held.&lt;ref name=WaPo2013&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/for-christmas-week-theres-matzo-ball-and-falafel-frenzy-and-post-holiday-parties/2013/12/23/0bb39598-6c17-11e3-aecc-85cb037b7236_story.html Fritz Hahn and Rhome Anderson, ''For Christmas week, there's Matzo Ball and Falafel Frenzy and post-holiday parties'', Washington Post, December 23, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WJW2013 /&gt;

====Atlanta====
Atlanta, which had previously hosted an annual "Matzah Ball" unrelated to the SYJP event,&lt;ref name="AJC2006" /&gt; has been the home of competing events for both mainstream audiences, such as the 'Bagel Bash',&lt;ref name="AJC2005"&gt;''SCENE: MUSIC / PARTY / CHARITY'', Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 29, 2005, p.

====Houston====
For a number of years, the Houston JCC sponsored that city's annual 'Bagel Ball' Christmas Eve party,&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;[http://www.houstonpress.com/2008-12-18/calendar/the-annual-jewish-community-center-bagel-ball/full/ Olivia Flores Alvarez, ''The Annual Jewish Community Center Bagel Ball'', Houston Press, December 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; which is now run independently.&lt;ref name=BagelBall2014&gt;[http://allevents.in/houston/5th-annual-holiday-party-bagel-ball-2014/1509776505968724# ''5th Annual Holiday Party (Bagel Ball 2014)'', AllEvents, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heeb Magazine 'Heebonism' events===
Heeb Magazine sponsored and organized its 'Heebonism' events in various U.S. cities on Christmas Eve, targeted toward a "hip" audience seeking an alternative to events like the Matzo Ball, beginning in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=JTA2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago /&gt;&lt;ref name=DenverPost2011&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/ci_19596055 ''Holiday parties offer something for everyone — from "Heebonism" to "Mistletoe Madness"'', Denver Post, December 23, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, Heebonism had expanded to five cities nationally.&lt;ref name=JTA2009 /&gt; Nationally, Heebonism organizers sought to offer a more "culturally substantive" and non-conformist event, with activities including "strip dreidel", video games, and light food.&lt;ref name=JTA2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DenverPost2011 /&gt; At the Los Angeles/[[Palm Springs]] Heebonism in 2009, strip dreidel was led by [[porn star]]s [[James Deen]] and [[Joanna Angel]].&lt;ref name=LAWeekly&gt;[http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2009/12/last_night_strip_dreidel_chris.php Jeff Weiss, ''Last Night: Strip Dreidel, Christmas Eve Heebonism and Jewjitsu in Palm Springs'', LA Weekly, December 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In Denver, the local Heebonism event had its origin as a private [[pregaming|pre-party]] for those seeking alternative entertainment before heading to the Matzo Ball.&lt;ref name=Rab&gt;[http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2008/12/heebonism_how_denver_jews_do_c.php Lisa Rab, ''How Jews Do Christmas'', Westword, December 12, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, Heebonism had retrenched and Heebonism events outside of Denver apparently had been eliminated.

===Jewish community organized events===
Other major cities have homegrown and well-attended Christmas Eve events that were established long before the Matzo Ball or The Ball entered the local scene.

===Schmooz-a-Palooza===
Schmooz-a-Palooza was the long-running Los Angeles counterpart to the Matzo Ball, and was held for the 20th straight year in 2013.&lt;ref name="AP2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NBCLA&gt;[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/the-scene/Social-and-Seasonal-Schmooz-a-Palooza-236745831.html  Alysia Gray Painter, ''Social and Seasonal: Schmooz-a-Palooza: Jewish singles will gather at Red O for a festive mixer of glammed-out proportions'', NBC 4, December 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JDateSchmooz"&gt;[http://static.jdate.com/events/schmooz-a-palooza JDate's 16th Annual Schmooz-A-Palooza, JDate.com (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated with Stu &amp; Lew Productions, which was acquired by [[JDate]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Schmooz" /&gt;  The event evolved over the years from a [[social mixer]] to a party atmosphere, bringing together, for example, southern Californians who had not seen each other since their younger years in Jewish communal settings.&lt;ref name="Journal2003"&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/up_front/article/have_a_holly_jolly_schmoozfest_20031219 Keren Engelberg, ''Have a Holly Jolly Schmooz-fest'', Jewish Journal (Los Angeles), December 18, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a noted opportunity for reconnecting and romance.&lt;ref name="Metromix"&gt;[http://losangeles.metromix.com/events/article/your-week-on-a/271538/content Alie Ward, ''Your week, on a platter: Dec. 24-30 brings you horny Jews and Hamburger combovers'', Metromix.com, December 24, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarly named events unaffiliated with SYJP==

===Other Christmas Eve singles events===
Prior to Rudnick's organizing of the Matzo Ball in Boston in 1987 and expansion into other cities, Jewish organizations in other cities had used similar names for their own Christmas Eve singles events.

The [[Jewish Community Center]] of [[Dallas]] organizes its annual "Matzoh Ball" or "Matzah Ball" event, having begun in either 1981&lt;ref name="NewsBank1981"&gt;''Get Out There!'', The Dallas Morning News, December 22, 2008, available via [https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22The+29th+annual+Matzoh+Ball%22 Google News Archives/NewsBank]&lt;/ref&gt; or 1984.&lt;ref name="NewsBank84"&gt;''Weekly Planner'', The Dallas Morning News, December 15, 2001, available via [https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22The+17th+annual+party+for+Jewish+singles%22 Google News Archives/NewsBank]&lt;/ref&gt;  The event continues to be run each Christmas Eve under that name, now jointly organized by the JCC of Dallas and the local Jewish Federation young adults division,&lt;ref name="Blair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JCCDallas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2009-12-24/calendar/kosher-kisses Katey Margolis, ''Kosher Kisses'', Dallas Observer, December 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and is unaffiliated with the Matzo Ball event and Rudnick.&lt;ref name="MatzoBall" /&gt;

Atlanta also had its own "Matzah Ball" for many years.&lt;ref name="AJC2006"&gt;''Detours: Alterna-thrills'', Atlanta Journal-Constitution, February 9, 2006, p. 28, available via [https://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=atlanta+%22matzah+ball%22+&amp;scoring=a&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;sa=N&amp;sugg=d&amp;as_ldate=2006&amp;as_hdate=2007&amp;lnav=hist8 Google News/NewsBank]&lt;/ref&gt;

====SYJP trademark disputes over Matzo Ball name====
Rudnick and SYJP have also come into conflict with organizers of other events named similarly to Matzo Ball,&lt;ref name=Kirchick /&gt; including Seattle's Jewish Federation young leadership division, which changed it event name from Matzah Ball to Latkapalooza in 2004 after receiving a [[cease-and-desist]] letter from Rudnik's attorneys.&lt;ref name=Rosenstein&gt;[http://jewishsound.org/the-battle-over-a-name/ Joshua Rosenstein, ''The battle over a name'', The Jewish Sound, December 18, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation's attorney's insisted that because of the lapse in SYJP's federal trademark registration for the term in the late 1990s, and because the Federation had been using the term locally during that period, they were entitled to continue to do so.&lt;ref name=Rosenstein /&gt;

===Bowling-related events===
The [[Jewish Federation]] of [[Greater Los Angeles area|Greater Los Angeles]] entertainment division organized a late spring "Matzah Bowl" event for a number of years, beginning in 1996.&lt;ref name="LABowl"&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/calendar_stories/article/calendar_singles_20010511/ Mike Levy, ''Calendar'', (Los Angeles) Jewish Journal, May 10, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Atlanta, the promoter of the 'Bagel Bash' organized an early spring bowling function for singles called the "Matzah Bowl".  A 2009 Christmas Eve musical event at [[Brooklyn Bowl]], co-sponsored by Israel's New York [[Consulate General]], was dubbed "The Matzah Bowl".&lt;ref name="NYTBowl"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/urbaneye/24ubn3.html ''And To All a Good Night'', New York Times, December 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooklyn"&gt;[http://www.brooklynbowl.com/event-detail/?id=2881 ''Brooklyn Bowl's First Annual Matzah Bowl! - Inaugural Tribal Music Festival'', Brooklyn Bowl, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212111909/http://www.brooklynbowl.com/event-detail/?id=2881 |date=2009-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event derived its name in part from its location in a Brooklyn bowling alley.

===Other events not targeted at single adults===
Smaller Jewish community entities have also used variations on the "Matzo Bowl" name for a variety of events, including for knowledge competitions held by individual synagogues&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;[http://www.templebethtorahli.org/tbttimes-06-08.pdf Steve Dershowitz, ''From the Prexy's Computer'', in Temple Beth Torah Times, June 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123033155/http://www.templebethtorahli.org/tbttimes-06-08.pdf |date=2008-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fundraising events organized by chapters of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]].&lt;ref name="Greek"&gt;[http://www.greekchat.com/gcforums/archive/index.php/t-9966.html KSUViolet06, ''What's your big thing(s)?'', GreekChat.com, August 15, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greater Kansas City]] Council of [[BBYO]] and its [[Aleph Zadik Aleph|AZA]] [[Max Nordau|Nordaunian]] chapter  sponsor a large annual teen dance called the Matzo Ball, which celebrated its 75th anniversary in April 2010.&lt;ref name="KCS2004"&gt;Kansas City Star, March 31, 2004, p. 24, available via [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=101AB40AE39E4DAB&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM  NewsBank]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KCJC2010"&gt;[http://www.kcjc.com/201004029169/news/nordaunian-aza-alumni-plan-reunion-alongside-matzo-ball.html Rick Hellman, ''Nordaunian AZA alumni plan reunion alongside Matzo Ball'', Kansas City Jewish Chronicle, April 2, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409071158/http://www.kcjc.com/201004029169/news/nordaunian-aza-alumni-plan-reunion-alongside-matzo-ball.html |date=April 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The Matzo Ball and similar events have been subject to mild criticism that the events are "[[meet markets]]"&lt;ref name="JTA2009" /&gt; or, more punningly, "[kosher] meat markets."&lt;ref name="DCistOrig"&gt;[http://dcist.com/2008/12/22/good_to_be_a_jew_on_christmas.php Josh Novikoff, ''Hooking up This Hanukkah?'', DCist.com, December 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314051242/http://dcist.com/2008/12/22/good_to_be_a_jew_on_christmas.php |date=March 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Winn&gt;Amy Winn, ''Find Fun at Place on 'Fring of Christmas' '', Atlanta Journal-Constitution, December 23, 2002, p. 1E&lt;/ref&gt; Women attendees tend to dress inappropriately in a  revealing manner while men at the event are liable to use awkward pickup lines and noticeably prowl.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobinsonNYB /&gt;

NCK has a mandate to research, educate, compile and spread information. In 2008, its operations expanded to include violence and oppression in the name of honour, and violence in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action plan for combating men's violence against women, violence and oppression|url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/9761/a/98653|publisher=The [[Government of Sweden]]|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information om Nationellt centrum för kvinnofrid|url=http://www.nck.uu.se/Om_NCK/|publisher=NCK/[[Uppsala University]]|accessdate=20 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=law-sv&gt;{{cite web|title=Förordning (2006:1072) om nationellt kunskapscentrum för frågor om mäns våld mot kvinnor|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Forordning-20061072-om-nati_sfs-2006-1072/|publisher=The Swedish Government|accessdate=28 July 2014|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stepped down in November 2009 to concentrate on contesting [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]], the constituency of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], [[John Bercow]], at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], coming third. In November 2010, Farage successfully stood in the [[United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election, 2010|2010 UKIP leadership contest]],&lt;ref name="Sparrow"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparrow |first=Andrew |date=3 September 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/03/nigel-farage-stand-ukip-leadership |title=Nigel Farage to stand for Ukip leadership again |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |archivedate=27 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927215740/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/03/nigel-farage-stand-ukip-leadership |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; following the resignation of [[Malcolm Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch|Lord Pearson of Rannoch]].

Farage announced his resignation as leader when he did not win the [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]] seat in Kent at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], but his resignation was rejected and he remained in his post.

==Early life, education and early career==
Farage was born in [[Downe]] in [[Kent]], [[England]], the son of Barbara (''née'' Stevens) and Guy Justus Oscar Farage.&lt;ref name=goldsmith&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20543513 |last=Goldsmith |first=Rosie |title=Profile: Nigel Farage, UKIP leader |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419181336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20543513 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Durkin20140330&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10731266/My-six-months-with-normal-Nigel-Farage.html |title=My six months with normal Nigel Farage |first=Martin |last=Durkin |date=30 March 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140331165432/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10731266/My-six-months-with-normal-Nigel-Farage.html |archivedate=31 March 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U15437 'FARAGE, Nigel Paul', ''Who's Who 2012'', A &amp; C Black, 2012; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2011;] online edn, November 2011.

A 2012 [[BBC Radio 4]] profile described Guy Farage as an alcoholic&lt;ref name=goldsmith/&gt; who left the family home when Nigel was five years old.&lt;ref name=limb/&gt; In 1971, Guy Farage gave up alcohol and entered the antiques trade, having lost his Stock Exchange position; the next year, endorsed by friends, he returned to the trading floor at the new Stock Exchange Tower on Threadneedle Street.&lt;ref&gt;Flying Free, Nigel Farage, Biteback Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1975 to 1982, Farage was educated at [[Dulwich College]], a fee-paying [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in south London. In his autobiography he pays tribute to the careers advice he received there from England [[Test cricket]]er [[John Dewes]], "who must have spotted that I was quite ballsy, probably good on a platform, unafraid of the limelight, a bit noisy and good at selling things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Dewes obituary |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4439440.ece |accessdate=15 May 2015 |work=The Times |location= London |date=14 May 2015}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving school in 1982, he decided not to go to university, but to work in the City, trading commodities at the [[London Metal Exchange]].&lt;ref name=goldsmith/&gt; Initially, he joined the American commodity operation of [[broker]]age firm [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]],&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt; transferring to [[Crédit Lyonnais|Crédit Lyonnais Rouse]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt; He joined [[Refco]] in 1994, and [[Natixis|Natexis Metals]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="ukwhoswho.com"/&gt;

==Political career==

===Early years===
Farage was active in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from his school days, having seen a visit to his school by [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Keith Joseph]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcmIHT6J0wc|title = Nigel Farage on Absolute Radio: Full Interview|date = 17 April 2015|accessdate = 28 April 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = Google|last = Absolute Radio|authorlink = Absolute Radio|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019005421/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcmIHT6J0wc|archivedate = 19 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, an English teacher, Chloe Deakin, wrote to the head teacher of Dulwich College, David Emms, asking him to reconsider his decision to appoint Farage as a prefect, citing concerns over Farage's alleged 'fascist' views. Farage later stated that some teachers were hostile to him because he was an admirer of Enoch Powell. Farage said: "Any accusation I was ever involved in far right politics is utterly untrue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.channel4.com/news/nigel-farage-ukip-letter-school-concerns-racism-fascism | title = Nigel Farage schooldays letter reveals concerns over fascism | date = 19 September 2013 | website = Channel 4 | publisher = Chennel 4 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170802201628/https://www.channel4.com/news/nigel-farage-ukip-letter-school-concerns-racism-fascism | archivedate = 2 August 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He voted for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] in [[European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)|1989]] because of what he saw as their then "sensible" and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] policies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He left the Conservatives in 1992 in protest at Prime Minister [[John Major]]'s government's signing of the [[Treaty on European Union]] at [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Nigel Farage |date=12 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5338364.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 February 2013 |archivedate=19 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130419151041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5338364.stm |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Question Time: This week's panel |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2013 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/6499699.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831205129/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/6499699.stm |archivedate=31 August 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founding member of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] in 1993.

===European Parliament===
Farage was elected to the [[European Parliament]] in [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|1999]] and re-elected in [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004]], [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009]] and [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014]]. In 1999 the BBC spent four months filming a documentary about his European election campaign but did not air it. Farage, then head of the UKIP's South East office, asked for a video and had friends make copies which were sold for £5 through the UKIP's magazine. Surrey Trading Standards investigated and Farage admitted the offence.&lt;ref name=Rob&gt;{{cite news|last=Watts |first=Robert |newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1545162/Making-plans-with-Nigel.html |title=Making plans with Nigel |location=London |date=11 March 2007 |archivedate=6 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606071238/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1545162/Making-plans-with-Nigel.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage is presently the leader of the 24-member UKIP contingent in the European Parliament, and co-leader of the multinational Eurosceptic group, [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]]. Farage was ranked the fifth-most influential MEP by [[Politico]] in 2016, who described him as "one of the two most effective speakers in the chamber".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/list/the-40-meps-who-actually-matter-european-parliament-mep/nigel-farage/|title=NIGEL FARAGE|date=19 May 2016|language=en-US|access-date=26 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605033433/http://www.politico.eu/list/the-40-meps-who-actually-matter-european-parliament-mep/nigel-farage/|archivedate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jacques Barrot====
On 18 November 2004, Farage announced in the European Parliament that [[Jacques Barrot]], then French Commissioner-designate, had been barred from elected office in France for two years, after being convicted in 2000 of embezzling £2 million from government funds and diverting it into the coffers of his party. He said that French President [[Jacques Chirac]] had granted Barrot amnesty; initial BBC reports said that, under French law, it was perhaps illegal to mention that conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/europe/4032113.stm |title=Profile: Jacques Barrot |work=BBC News |date=22 November 2004 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529171852/http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/2/hi/europe/4032113.stm |archivedate=29 May 2012 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition in question applies only to French officials in the course of their duties.&lt;ref&gt;The prohibition contained in the French penal code against mentioning crimes covered by an amnesty only concerns French officials who may hear of such crimes in the course of their duties (CP L133-11), and does not apply generally (L133-10).&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Parliament, [[Josep Borrell]], enjoined him to retract his comments under threat of "legal consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLkcgaWc0o|title=MEP Nigel Farage replies to Parliament President Josep Borrell|date=18 November 2004|accessdate=22 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910002624/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPLkcgaWc0o|archivedate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, it was confirmed that Barrot had received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in the case, and that this had been quickly expunged by the amnesty decided by Chirac and his parliamentary majority. {{cn|date=November 2018}} The Socialist and Liberal groups in the European Parliament then joined forces with UKIP in demanding the resignation of Barrot for failing to disclose the conviction during his confirmation hearings. {{cn|date=November 2018}}

====José Manuel Barroso====
In early 2005, Farage requested that the [[European Commission]] disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the information requested, on the basis that the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' reported that the President of the European Commission, [[José Manuel Barroso]], had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire [[Spiros Latsis]]. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor [[Romano Prodi]] approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |title=Barroso survives confidence debate over free holiday with Greek tycoon |location=London |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 May 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |first=Stephen |last=Castle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091311/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article223215.ece |archivedate=1 October 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became known that [[Peter Mandelson]], then the British [[EU Commissioner]], had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.

Farage persuaded around 75 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from across the political divide to back a motion of no confidence in Barroso, which would be sufficient to compel Barroso to appear before the European Parliament to be questioned on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&amp;refer=europe |date=25 May 2005 |title=Barroso Fights No-Confidence Vote Amid French Treaty Debate |last=Neuger |first=James G. |work=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York |accessdate=8 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000085&amp;sid=aFq2hOeCcYZc&amp;refer=europe |archivedate=16 November 2006 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was successfully tabled on 12 May 2005, and Barroso appeared before Parliament&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578261.stm |title=Barroso rebuffs yacht questions |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4578261.stm |archivedate=16 November 2006 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a debate on 26 May 2005. The motion was heavily defeated. A Conservative MEP, [[Roger Helmer]], was expelled from his group, the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|European People's Party – European Democrats]] (EPP-ED), in the middle of the debate by that group's leader [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] as a result of his support for Farage's motion.

===UKIP leadership and resignations===
[[File:Nigel Farage of UKIP.jpg|thumb|Farage at the UKIP Conference in 2009]]
On 12 September 2006, Farage was [[United Kingdom Independence Party leadership election, 2006|elected leader of UKIP]] with 45 percent of the vote, 20 [[percentage point]]s ahead of his nearest rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&amp;id=2526 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013075242/http://www.ukip.org/ukip_news/gen12.php?t=1&amp;id=2526 |archivedate=13 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |title=Nigel Farage is the new Leader of the UK Independence Party |publisher=UKIP |date=12 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pledged to bring discipline to the party and to maximise UKIP's representation in local, parliamentary and other elections. In a ''[[PM (Radio 4)|PM]]'' programme interview on [[BBC Radio 4]] that day he pledged to end the public perception of UKIP as a single-issue party and to work with allied politicians in the [[Better Off Out]] campaign, committing himself not to stand against the MPs who have signed up to that campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6209386.stm |title=UKIP leader 'offered Tory seat' |first=Brian |last=Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206231332/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6209386.stm |archivedate=6 December 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his maiden speech to the UKIP conference, on 8 October 2006, Farage told delegates that the party was "at the centre-ground of British public opinion" and the "real voice of opposition". He said: "We've got three [[social democratic]] parties in Britain – Labour, Lib Dem and Conservative are virtually indistinguishable from each other on nearly all the main issues" and "you can't put a cigarette paper between them and that is why there are nine million people who don't vote now in general elections that did back in 1992."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UKIP 'voice of British majority' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5415252.stm?ls |date=7 October 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919230637/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5415252.stm?ls |archivedate=19 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 10pm on 19 October 2006, Farage took part in a three-hour live interview and phone-in with [[James Whale (radio)|James Whale]] on the national radio station [[talkSPORT]]. Four days later, Whale announced on his show his intention to stand as UKIP's candidate in the [[London mayoral election, 2008|2008 London Mayoral Election]]. Farage said that Whale "not only has guts, but an understanding of what real people think".

Farage stood again for the UKIP leadership in 2010 (having stood down the year before, to focus on his unsuccessful campaign for the Buckingham seat) after his successor [[Malcolm Pearson, Baron Pearson of Rannoch|Lord Pearson]] had stood down,&lt;ref name="Sparrow"/&gt; and on 5 November 2010 it was announced he had won the leadership contest.&lt;ref name="sky20101105"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Sky News]] |url=http://news.sky.com/story/817965/nigel-farage-re-elected-ukip-party-leader |title=Nigel Farage Re-Elected UKIP Party Leader |date=5 November 2010 |author=Barnett, Ruth |accessdate=22 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012180508/http://news.sky.com/story/817965/nigel-farage-re-elected-ukip-party-leader |archivedate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Farage led UKIP to win the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament election]] with 4,376,635 votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014/eu-uk-results|title=Vote 2014 Election Results for the EU Parliament UK regions – BBC News|work=bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qNwEjOtM?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014/eu-uk-results|archivedate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first time a UK political party other than Labour or Conservatives had won a national election in over 100 years. Farage was returned as MEP for the South East region, a seat he has represented since 1999.

As an MEP, Farage leads the [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] grouping in the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efdgroup.eu/members|title=Members|work=efdgroup.eu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317042838/http://www.efdgroup.eu/members|archivedate=17 March 2015|access-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2015, Farage resigned as leader of UKIP after he failed to win the seat of [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|Thanet South]] in the general election held the previous day, although he kept open the possibility of re-entering the ensuing leadership contest.&lt;ref name="BBC News 8 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Nigel Farage resigns as UKIP leader | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32654046 | author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date= 8 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 11 May 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511010550/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32654046 | archivedate= 11 May 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, ''The Purple Revolution'', he had written:

{{quote|It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat. […] Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No – if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.&lt;ref name="BBC News 11 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Farage stays as UKIP leader after resignation rejected | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32696505 | author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date= 11 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 11 May 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150511154348/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32696505 | archivedate= 11 May 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 11 May, it was announced that Farage would continue to serve as the party's leader, with the BBC reporting: "Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a ‘great success’ and members had ‘unanimously’ rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation".&lt;ref name="BBC News 11 May 2015"/&gt; Interviewed about his continued leadership by the BBC the following day, Farage said: "I resigned. I said I'd resign. I turned up to the NEC meeting with letter in hand fully intending to carry that through. They unanimously said they didn't want me to do that, they presented me with petitions, signatures, statements from candidates saying it would be a bad thing for UKIP. So I left the meeting, went and sat in darkened room to think about what to do, and decided for the interest of the party I would accept their kind offer for me to stay and tear up the letter." He added that he would consider standing for parliament again should a by-election be called in a Labour-held seat.&lt;ref name="BBC News 12 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title= Nigel Farage hints at Labour by-election| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32710708| author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| date= 12 May 2015| website= BBC News| accessdate= 12 May 2015| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150513115050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32710708| archivedate= 13 May 2015| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage resigned as UKIP leader on 4 July 2016 with the following comment: "During the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Brexit]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; referendum I said I wanted my country back … now I want my life back"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=4 July 2016 |title=Nigel Farage resigns as Ukip leader after 'achieving political ambition' of Brexit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=4 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705150119/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/nigel-farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader |archivedate=5 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and added that this resignation was final: "I won’t be changing my mind again, I can promise you",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-04/farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader-adding-to-brexit-political-turmoil |title=Farage Resigns as UKIP Leader After Brexit Vote |last=Kennedy |first=Simon |date=4 July 2016 |website=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |access-date=4 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704100027/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-04/farage-resigns-as-ukip-leader-adding-to-brexit-political-turmoil |archivedate=4 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently referring to his two previous resignations (in 2009 and 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/brexit-ukip-leader-nigel-farage-resigns-160704091835096.html |title=Brexit: UKIP leader Nigel Farage resigns |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 July 2016 |website=Al Jazeera English |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date= |quote=After running divisive campaign to leave the EU, Farage quits, while Britain faces economic and political challenges. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704112739/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/brexit-ukip-leader-nigel-farage-resigns-160704091835096.html |archivedate=4 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westminster elections===
Farage had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] in 1999. Under the 2002 European Union decision to forbid MEPs from holding a [[dual mandate]], if he were to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], he would have to resign his seat as MEP.

When he contested the [[Bromley and Chislehurst (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley &amp; Chislehurst]] constituency in a [[Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, 2006|May 2006 by-election]], following the death of Eurosceptic Conservative MP [[Eric Forth]], Farage came third, winning 8 per cent of the vote, beating the Labour Party candidate. This was the second-best by-election result recorded by UKIP out of 25 results, and the first time since the [[Liverpool Walton by-election, 1991|Liverpool Walton by-election]] in 1991 that a party in government had been pushed into fourth place in a parliamentary by-election on mainland Britain. {{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Prince Charles===
[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] was invited to speak to the European Parliament on 14 February 2008; in his speech he called for EU leadership in the battle against [[climate change]]. During the standing ovation that followed, Farage was the only MEP to remain seated, and he went on to describe the Prince's advisers as "naïve and foolish at best."&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=UKIP anger at prince's EU speech |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |date=14 February 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2009 |archivedate=17 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217205903/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage continued: "How can somebody like Prince Charles be allowed to come to the European Parliament at this time to announce he thinks it should have more powers? It would have been better for the country he wants to rule one day if he had stayed home and tried to persuade [[Gordon Brown]] to give the people the promised referendum on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]." The leader of the UK [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s MEPs, [[Gary Titley]], accused Farage of anti-Royalism. Titley said: "I was embarrassed and disgusted when the Leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, remained firmly seated during the lengthy standing ovation Prince Charles received. I had not realised Mr Farage's blind adherence to [[right-wing politics]] involved disloyalty and discourtesy to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]. He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself and should apologise to the British people he represents."&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

===Expenses disclosure===
In May 2009, ''[[The Observer]]'' reported a Foreign Press Association speech given by Farage in which he had said that over his period as a Member of the European Parliament he had received a total of £2 million of taxpayers' money in staff, travel, and other expenses.&lt;ref name=Tob&gt;{{cite news|work=The Observer |date=24 May 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/24/mps-expenses-ukip-nigel-farage |title=Ukip leader boasts of his £2m in expenses |accessdate=8 June 2009 |first=Toby |last=Helm |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527061523/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/24/mps-expenses-ukip-nigel-farage |archivedate=27 May 2009 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Farage said that in future all UKIP MEPs would provide monthly expense details.&lt;ref name=Tob/&gt;

===Herman Van Rompuy===
After the speech of [[Herman Van Rompuy]] on 24 February 2010 to the European Parliament, Farage&amp;nbsp;– to protests from other MEPs&amp;nbsp;– addressed the former [[Prime Minister of Belgium|Belgian Prime Minister]] and first long-term [[President of the European Council]] saying that he had the "charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of low grade bank clerk".&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|date=24 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8535121.stm |title=Tirade against 'damp rag' EU president shocks MEPs |work=BBC News |accessdate=24 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225025721/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8535121.stm |archivedate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage questioned the legitimacy of Van Rompuy's appointment, asking, "Who are you? I'd never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you." He also asserted that Van Rompuy's "intention [is] to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states".&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=EUX.TV|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypLwI5AQvY|title=Nigel Farage harangues EU President Herman van Rompuy|accessdate=27 February 2010|date=24 February 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309210826/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bypLwI5AQvY|archivedate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rompuy commented afterwards, "There was one contribution that I can only hold in contempt, but I'm not going to comment further."&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; After refusing to apologise for behaviour that was, in the words of the [[President of the European Parliament]], [[Jerzy Buzek]], "inappropriate, unparliamentary and insulting to the dignity of the House", Farage was reprimanded and had his right to ten days' allowance (expenses) "docked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEP Nigel Farage fined over 'insulting' tirade |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8544904.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304045601/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8544904.stm |archivedate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jerz&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/expert/shotlist/20100303SHL92842 |title=EP President Jerzy BUZEK on MEP Nigel FARAGE – 68659 |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307164027/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eng-internet-publisher/eplive/expert/shotlist/20100303SHL92842 |archivedate=7 March 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzek said after his meeting with Farage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I defend absolutely Mr Farage's right to disagree about the policy or institutions of the [[European Union|Union]], but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility&amp;nbsp;– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore&amp;nbsp;– as an expression of the seriousness of the matter&amp;nbsp;– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.&lt;ref name=Jerz/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Questioned by [[Camilla Long]] of ''[[The Times]]'', Farage described his speech: "it wasn't abusive, it was right."&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;

===2010 UK general election===
On 4 September 2009, Farage resigned as the UKIP's leader to focus on his campaign to become Member of Parliament for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] at [[British Parliament|Westminster]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News |date=4 September 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8237304.stm |title=Farage to quit as leader of UKIP |accessdate=28 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930001212/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8237304.stm |archivedate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told ''The Times'' journalist Camilla Long that UKIP internal fights took up far too much time.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Camilla Long |author=Long, Camilla |location=London |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |subscription=yes |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7069638.ece |title=Nigel Farage: Brimming over with bile and booze |date=21 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094714/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7069638.ece |archivedate=11 August 2011 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage stood against sitting Buckingham MP, [[John Bercow]], the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, despite the convention that the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]], as a political neutral, is not normally challenged in his or her bid for re-election by any of the major parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News |date=3 September 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8235626.stm |title=Farage to stand against Speaker |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905015156/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8235626.stm |archivedate=5 September 2009 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage came third with 8,401 votes. Bercow was re-elected and in second place with 10,331 votes was [[John Stevens (English politician)|John Stevens]], a former Conservative MEP who campaigned as an independent accompanied by "Flipper the Dolphin" (a reference to MPs [[Second home flipping|flipping second homes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/07/nigel-farage-ukip-john-bercow |title=Election results: Ukip's Nigel Farage finishes behind John Bercow and Flipper |last=Dowling |first=Tim |work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 May 2010 |location=London |date=7 May 2010 |archivedate=11 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511010455/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/07/nigel-farage-ukip-john-bercow |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2010, Justin Adams, the pilot of the aircraft involved in the accident, was charged with threatening to kill Farage in a separate incident.

UKIP forgot to put their party name on their candidate's ballot paper for the [[London mayoral election, 2012]],&lt;ref name=up&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/how-ukip-became-fresh-choice-london |title=How UKIP became "Fresh Choice for London" |work=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |last=Eaton |first=George |date=4 May 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |archivedate=7 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507012523/http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/how-ukip-became-fresh-choice-london |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence Webb appearing as "a fresh choice for London".

[[File:Nigel Farage talking to the media.jpg|thumbnail|left|Farage at the opening of the UKIP office in [[Basingstoke]], in 2012]]
Asked what would happen to UKIP if the Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to a referendum on EU membership, Farage said they had already failed to honour a "cast iron" commitment to a referendum on the [[Lisbon Treaty]].&lt;ref name=andy/&gt; Challenging Farage's viewpoint, Neil said that UKIP aspired to come top of the European elections, but while UKIP wanted to join the big time they were still seen as "unprofessional, amateur and even unacceptable".&lt;ref name=andy/&gt; In an interview, Farage described [[Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi|Baroness Warsi]] as "the lowest grade Chairman the Tory Party has ever had".&lt;ref name=andy/&gt; He was voted politician of the year by the [[Online service provider|online service]] [[MSN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green |first=William |url=http://news.uk.msn.com/uk/ukip%E2%80%99s-nigel-farage-named-top-uk-politician-of-2012 |title=Ukip's Nigel Farage named top UK politician of 2012 |work=MSN News |date=31 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102163318/http://news.uk.msn.com/uk/ukip%E2%80%99s-nigel-farage-named-top-uk-politician-of-2012 |archivedate=2 January 2013 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2013 local elections===
In May 2013, Farage led UKIP to its best-ever performance in a UK election. The party received 23 per cent of the vote in the local elections, winning 147 council seats, and placing it only 2 points behind the governing Conservative Party and 9 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Farage was mobbed by well-wishers as he made his way to his favourite pub, the Marquis of Granby, for a celebratory drink.&lt;ref name=Tel20130503&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10036463/Local-elections-2013-Nigel-Farages-Ukip-surges-to-best-ever-showing-winning-150-seats.html |title=Local elections 2013: Nigel Farage's Ukip surges to best ever showing, winning 150 seats |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=3 May 2013 |archivedate=4 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504090045/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10036463/Local-elections-2013-Nigel-Farages-Ukip-surges-to-best-ever-showing-winning-150-seats.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the victory "a real sea change in British politics".&lt;ref name=Tel20130503/&gt; Subsequently, polling agency Survation found that 22 per cent of voters intended to support UKIP in the 2015 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survation.com/2013/05/survation-for-the-mail-on-sunday-reaction-to-the-woolwich-incident/ |title=Survation for the Mail on Sunday, Reaction to the Woolwich incident |publisher=Survation (blog) |date=25 May 2013 |archivedate=15 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915155650/http://survation.com/2013/05/survation-for-the-mail-on-sunday-reaction-to-the-woolwich-incident/ |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visit to Scotland===
In May 2013, Farage was interrupted by protesters during a press conference in the Canon's Gait pub on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile]]. The demonstration was organised by groups including the [[Radical Independence Campaign]] and saw protesters vocally accuse Farage of being "racist", "fascist", and a "homophobe", and tell him to "go back to London". Farage made attempts to leave by taxi but was prevented from doing so, and was eventually taken away in an armoured police van while protesters continued to shout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/nigel-farage-forced-to-flee-edinburgh-s-royal-mile-1-2933645 |title=Nigel Farage forced to flee Edinburgh's Royal Mile |date=16 May 2013 |work=[[The Scotsman]] |location=Edinburgh |accessdate=16 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518024014/http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/nigel-farage-forced-to-flee-edinburgh-s-royal-mile-1-2933645 |deadurl=no |archivedate=18 May 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22559526 |title=Farage swarmed by angry protesters in Edinburgh |date=16 May 2013 |work=BBC News |accessdate=16 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517014354/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22559526 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage flees barrage of abuse from Edinburgh protesters |last=Carrell |first=Severin |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/16/nigel-farage-edinburgh-protesters-van |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |archivedate=17 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517053616/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/16/nigel-farage-edinburgh-protesters-van |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was trying to raise the profile of UKIP in Scotland ahead of the [[Aberdeen Donside by-election, 2013|Aberdeen Donside by-election]]; the party at that point had no representation in the country, and took 0.91 per cent of the vote in the previous election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Herald |location=Glasgow |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/nigel-farage-in-bid-to-woo-scots-voters.2013058317 |title=Farrago as Nigel Farage is rescued by police from protesters |date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=16 May 2013 |archivedate=28 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428041752/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/nigel-farage-in-bid-to-woo-scots-voters.2013058317 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it won its first Scottish MEP the following year.

===2014 European election===
In a second visit to Edinburgh in May 2014 Farage correctly predicted that UKIP would win a Scottish seat in the European Parliament elections. Two hundred protesters heckled and booed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 May 2014 |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27339519 |title=European election: Farage sure UKIP will win Scotland seat |accessdate=10 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621233213/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27339519 |archivedate=21 June 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty police in two vans were needed to preserve order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gardham, Magnus |author2=Donnelly, Brian |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/police-keep-the-peace-as-ukip-leader-returns-to-edinburgh.24189260 |title=Police keep the peace as Ukip leader returns to Edinburgh |date=10 May 2014 |work=The Herald |location=Glasgow |accessdate=10 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021754/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/police-keep-the-peace-as-ukip-leader-returns-to-edinburgh.24189260 |archivedate=13 June 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament elections in 2014]], Farage led UKIP to win the highest share of the vote.

===Undeclared gifts===
In June 2014, Farage declared £205,603 for gifts over 10 years, including free use of a barn for his constituency office, which had been declared in the EU register in [[Brussels]] each year. The Electoral Commission said that the gifts should have been also declared in the UK within 30 days of receipt and fined Farage £200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27818780 |title=UKIP leader Nigel Farage declares £205,603 in gifts |author=Hawkins, Ross |work=BBC News |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=12 June 2014 |archivedate=13 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613021757/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27818780 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-two-party-finance-cases | title = Electoral Commission concludes two party finance cases | date = 21 October 2014 | publisher = [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]] | access-date = 3 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150628164218/https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/electoral-commission-concludes-two-party-finance-cases | archive-date = 28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 UK general election===
In October 2013, Farage announced on the BBC's ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'' that he would stand for election as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]], most likely contesting either [[Folkestone and Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Folkestone and Hythe]] or [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]]; meanwhile he stated that his duty and preference was to focus on his current role as an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 October 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24419317 |title=Nigel Farage: I will stand as MP at next general election |accessdate=12 October 2013 |work=BBC News |archivedate=6 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006101317/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24419317 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Francis |accessdate=12 October 2013 |url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone/news/ukip-leader-could-target-kent-7007/ |title=UKIP leader Nigel Farage could go for Folkestone and Hythe constituency at 2015 election |work=[[Kent Messenger]] |archivedate=6 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006123828/http://www.kentonline.co.uk/folkestone_express/news/ukip-leader-could-target-kent-7007/ |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Farage declared in his book ''The Purple Revolution'' that he would step down as UKIP leader should he not be elected as an MP; he stated his belief that it would not be "credible" for him to lead UKIP without sitting in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament at Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apps|first1=Peter|title=Nigel Farage will quit as Ukip leader if he fails to win a seat at general election|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/nigel-farage-will-quit-as-ukip-leader-if-he-fails-to-win-a-seat-at-general-election-10109927.html|accessdate=16 March 2015|work=The Independent|date=16 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317024620/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/nigel-farage-will-quit-as-ukip-leader-if-he-fails-to-win-a-seat-at-general-election-10109927.html|archivedate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2015, Farage was targeted by anti-UKIP activists who chased him and his family from a [[pub lunch]] in [[Downe]], [[Kent]]. His daughters ran away to hide and were later found to be safe. Farage, when asked what he thought about the incident, called the protesters "scum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London protesters' chase UKIP leader Farage out of pub'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32009961|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=22 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322222006/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32009961|archivedate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Farage calls anti-Ukip protesters who forced him out of pub 'scum'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/22/farage-calls-anti-ukip-protesters-who-forced-him-out-of-pub-scum|accessdate=29 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=23 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324095746/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/22/farage-calls-anti-ukip-protesters-who-forced-him-out-of-pub-scum|archivedate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage was unsuccessful in his bid to become MP for [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result#block-554c832ae4b0c7299d72ca93 |title=Election live: results day – as it happened |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154513/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result#block-554c832ae4b0c7299d72ca93 |archivedate=14 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although he came second (beating Labour by over 4,000 votes), reduced the Conservative majority to less than 3,000, and gained over 32% of the vote. He subsequently announced his resignation as the leader of UKIP, citing that he is a "man of his word" since he promised to resign if he did not win his seat. However, on 11 May 2015, the party chairman said they would not accept Mr Farage's post-election resignation because the party's "election campaign had been a great success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation |title=UKIP Rejects Nigel Farage's Resignation |work=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512164351/http://news.sky.com/story/1481942/ukip-rejects-nigel-farages-resignation |archivedate=12 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A row subsequently developed within the party, in which MEP and campaign chief [[Patrick O'Flynn]] described Farage's public image as "snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive" and said he risked turning the party into a "[[personality cult]]". O'Flynn accused Farage of paying too much attention to advisors that "would like to take UKIP in the direction of some hard-right, ultra-aggressive American Tea Party-type movement", singling out the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] and gun control liberalisation as particular issues. [[Raheem Kassam]], Farage's chief of staff and editor of [[Breitbart News#Breitbart London|Breitbart London]] was later sacked as a result, whilst O'Flynn insisted he continued to support Farage as party leader.&lt;ref name="BBC News 14 May 2015"&gt;{{cite news | title= UKIP adviser sacked in Nigel Farage row | url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32734220 | date= 14 May 2015 | work= BBC News | accessdate= 14 May 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150517064059/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32734220 | archivedate= 17 May 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage also faced a number of calls from senior figures within the party to stand down.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 14 May 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Nigel Farage 'facing a coup' over Ukip leadership | url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership | last= Mason | first= Rowena | date= 14 May 2015 | work= [[The Guardian]] | accessdate= 14 May 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093055/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-facing-a-coup-over-ukip-leadership | archivedate= 18 May 2015 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

He reported that he had spoken with the [[National Police (France)|French police]] but did not wish to pursue the matter any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Nicola|title=Nigel Farage fears he was victim of assassination attempt after motorway crash|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/12078683/Nigel-Farage-fears-he-was-victim-of-assassination-attempt-after-motorway-crash.html|accessdate=6 January 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=2 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106050542/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/12078683/Nigel-Farage-fears-he-was-victim-of-assassination-attempt-after-motorway-crash.html|archivedate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'', however, said Farage's story was untrue, and that [[Dunkirk]] prosecutors had no reason to suspect foul play or the police would have started an investigation.

===Tax avoidance===
Although previously denouncing [[tax avoidance]] in a speech to the [[European Parliament]], in which he attacked European bureaucrats who earned £100,000 a year and paid 12 per cent tax under EU rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=George|title=Watch: Nigel Farage denounces tax avoidance in speech last month|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/watch-nigel-farage-denounces-tax-avoidance-speech-last-month|work=New Statesman|date=21 June 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422015706/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/06/watch-nigel-farage-denounces-tax-avoidance-speech-last-month|archivedate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage said in 2013 that he had hired a tax advisor to set up the Farage Family Educational Trust 1654, a trust that Farage said was used "for inheritance purposes", on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name="Syal June 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Nigel Farage admits setting up tax haven trust fund was a mistake|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/21/nigel-farage-tax-haven-trust-fund-mistake|work=The Guardian|date=21 June 2013|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226175901/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/21/nigel-farage-tax-haven-trust-fund-mistake|archivedate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage later described this "as standard practice", but insisted he "decided I didn't want it.

Farage said in 2014 that most legal [[tax avoidance]] was "okay" after he was questioned on why £45,000 of his income was paid into his private company rather than a personal bank account, saying that criticism of his actions was "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Most forms of legal tax avoidance are ok, says Nigel Farage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/04/legal-tax-avoidance-ok-nigel-farage|work=The Guardian|date=4 June 2014|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427040002/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/04/legal-tax-avoidance-ok-nigel-farage|archivedate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, Farage also said that the possibility of him releasing his tax return was a "big no" as "I think in this country what people earn is regarded as a private matter",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|last2=Cooper|first2=Charlie|title=Nigel Farage is refusing to publish his tax return|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-tax-return-avoidance-evasion-haven-refuses-to-publish-details-a6978861.html|accessdate=19 April 2016|work=The Independent|date=11 April 2016|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414011306/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-tax-return-avoidance-evasion-haven-refuses-to-publish-details-a6978861.html|archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and criticised David Cameron as hypocritical, especially with regard to his past comments about [[Jimmy Carr]]'s tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Nigel Farage Publish Tax Return?

===British exit from the EU===
Although he was a member of the European Parliament, Farage campaigned to leave the EU as a key figurehead for the [[Brexit|British exit from the EU]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Polls on the day of the vote suggested defeat for the leave campaign, though they were successful with 52 per cent of the vote. [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] promptly told all UKIP members to leave the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/26/the-eu-will-treat-britain-like-greece/ |title=The EU will treat Britain like Greece |first=Matthew |last=Holehouse |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626080533/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/26/the-eu-will-treat-britain-like-greece/ |archivedate=26 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage also made the suggestion of a future second referendum in an interview with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' if Brexit lost but the result was closer than 52-48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681 |title=Nigel Farage: Narrow Remain win may lead to second referendum |work=BBC News |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913012929/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36306681 |archivedate=13 September 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2016, Farage made a speech in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a hypothetical failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would "be far worse for you than it would be for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that "virtually none" of them had ever had done "a proper job" in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Jon |date=28 June 2016 |title=Nigel Farage Mocked and Heckled by MEPs During Extraordinary Speech |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-european-parliament-speech-heckled-brexit-eu-referendum-a7107131.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |access-date=28 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628114435/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-european-parliament-speech-heckled-brexit-eu-referendum-a7107131.html |archivedate=28 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: "... when I came here 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.

Following a legal challenge to the use of the [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50#Legal proceedings against the government|Royal Prerogative to invoke article 50]], Farage appeared on television with [[Gina Miller]]. Miller stated that "politicians had lied all the way through" and the Referendum act clearly said that the result was advisory. Farage also agreed that it was advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-nigel-farage-forced-to-admit-the-eu-referendum-was-only-advisory-a7401151.html |title=Nigel Farage forced to admit that the EU referendum was only 'advisory' |first=Adam |last=Withnall |work=The Independent |location=London |date=6 November 2016 |accessdate=8 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107142604/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-nigel-farage-forced-to-admit-the-eu-referendum-was-only-advisory-a7401151.html |archivedate=7 November 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage was appearing on the Andrew Marr Show where he was described by the host as a lifelong political "insurgent." Although he talked of a peaceful protest he warned of unprecedented political anger if Parliament blocked Brexit. Miller pointed out that parliamentary democracy required parliament to debate issues and that Farage had spent the whole Brexit campaign arguing for parliamentary sovereignty. Calling his warnings "the politics of the gutter", [[Tim Farron]] said the British judges had merely interpreted British law and that fortunately Farage was the only person talking about taking to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37888849 |title=Nigel Farage warns of Brexit 'anger' protests |work=BBC News |date=6 November 2016 |accessdate=8 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043736/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37888849 |archivedate=8 November 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller has previously called Farage irresponsible and has blamed him and the tabloid media for death threats against her.

In October 2016, Farage praised Trump for "dominating" Hillary Clinton, comparing him to a [[silverback gorilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-defends-silverback-donald-trump-for-dominating-hillary-clinton-a3364766.html|title=Nigel Farage praises 'silverback gorilla' Donald Trump for 'dominating' Hillary Clinton|author=Robin de Peyer|work=Evening Standard|date=10 October 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016102939/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-defends-silverback-donald-trump-for-dominating-hillary-clinton-a3364766.html|archivedate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following revelations of a [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy|2005 audio recording]] in which Trump made lewd remarks about women, Farage said that Trump's comments were "ugly" but described them as "alpha male boasting" and stated that women also made remarks they would not want to see reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nigel Farage defends Donald Trump over 'alpha-male boasting' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting |accessdate=17 October 2016 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016153756/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/09/nigel-farage-defends-donald-trump-over-alpha-male-boasting |archivedate=16 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage's comments prompted several senior UKIP members to express concern  privately, and prompted public condemnation of Farage from two UKIP MEPs, [[Jane Collins]] and [[William Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/nigel-farage-donald-trump-ukip-meps |title=Nigel Farage criticised for defending Donald Trump by Ukip MEPs |author=Peter Walker |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 October 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015163027/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/12/nigel-farage-donald-trump-ukip-meps |archivedate=15 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more publicity appeared about [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|Trump's alleged groping]] and as the criticisms increased, Farage said he disagreed with Trump's comments about groping women and his comments on Muslim immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/nigel-farage-backtracks-on-donald-trump-support-amid-groping-claims|title=Nigel Farage backtracks on Donald Trump support amid groping claims|author=Jane Martinson, Rowena Mason and Molly Redden|work=The Guardian|date=15 October 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161016003719/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/15/nigel-farage-backtracks-on-donald-trump-support-amid-groping-claims|archivedate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage is reported to have had close links with Trump's chief strategist, [[Steve Bannon]], since at least 2014, when Bannon scheduled meetings for Farage with right-wing figures in Washington. In his book, ''[[The Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything]]'', Farage described Bannon as "my sort of chap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2sVPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96|title=The Purple Revolution: The Year That Changed Everything|first=Nigel|last=Farage|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Biteback Publishing|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121194105/https://books.google.com/books?id=2sVPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96|archivedate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Farage headlined a fundraiser for [[Lou Barletta]], the Republican nominee in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2018|2018 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigel Farage flies under radar to support Trump-backed Senate candidate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/21/nigel-farage-brexit-lou-barletta-pennsylvania-republican-senate|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 July 2018|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vice Chairman of Leave Means Leave===
In August 2018, Farage pledged his "absolute and total support" to the pro-Brexit organisation [[Leave Means Leave]], and subsequently announced that he would be returning to full-time campaigning for "the Brexit that people voted for".{{cn|date=September 2018}} Shortly after the announcement, he was made a Vice Chairman of the group.

==Political stances==

===Economy===
From taking office as a UKIP [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] in 1999, Farage has often voiced opposition to the "[[euro]] project". His argument is that "a one-size-fits-all interest rate" cannot work for countries with structurally different economies, often using the example of Greece and Germany to emphasise contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22183867 |title=MEPs angry at EU's Olli Rehn over treatment of Cyprus |date=17 April 2013 |work=BBC News |accessdate=12 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22183867 |archivedate=16 November 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage strongly opposes the use of [[bailout]]s and says that "buying your own debt with taxpayers' money" will not solve the problem and that, "if we do, the next debt crisis won't be a country&amp;nbsp;... it will be the [[European Central Bank]] itself".&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJ-MdikNr0|title=Nigel Farage – Europe Trapped Inside an Economic Prison (A collage of speeches by UKIP Leader Nigel Farage) MEP in the European Parliament|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910004237/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVJ-MdikNr0|archivedate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=europarl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/research-result-list?idmep=4525&amp;language=en&amp;pageby=unit&amp;page=0&amp;menusearchfrom=bymep&amp;nameMep=FARAGE,%20Nigel |title=Europarl speech archives, with full list of all of Mr Farage's speeches in plenary that are referred to in original source video |publisher=European Parliament |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315234304/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/research-result-list?idmep=4525&amp;language=en&amp;pageby=unit&amp;page=0&amp;menusearchfrom=bymep&amp;nameMep=FARAGE%2C%20Nigel |archivedate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of welfare, Farage wants migrants to live in the UK for five years before being able to claim benefits, and for them to be ineligible for tax credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage calls for five-year ban on migrant benefits|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25630036|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=7 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106101655/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25630036|archivedate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that tax avoidance is caused by "punitive tax rates", and wants "fairer" taxes as a way to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walton|first1=Gregory|title=Nigel Farage speaks out about gay marriage and tax avoidance on Newsnight|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11410079/Nigel-Farage-speaks-out-about-gay-marriage-and-tax-avoidance-on-Newsnight.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=12 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825155448/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11410079/Nigel-Farage-speaks-out-about-gay-marriage-and-tax-avoidance-on-Newsnight.html|archivedate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral reform===
Farage declared himself in favour of the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|Alternative Vote system]] of May 2011, saying first-past-the-post would be a "nightmare" for UKIP. The party's stance has to be decided by its central policy-making committee,&lt;ref name=WherePartiesStand&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 |title=AV referendum: Where parties stand |work=BBC News |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116033105/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11609887 |archivedate=16 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although Farage has expressed a preference for the [[AV+]] system as it "would retain the constituency link and then also the second ballot ensured there were no wasted votes".&lt;ref name=BlackburnMay2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blackburn|first1=David|title=Farage: AV is the thin of the wedge, that’s why we support it|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2011/05/farage-av-is-the-thin-of-the-wedge-thats-why-we-support-it/|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=Coffee House|publisher=The Spectator|date=4 May 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226175731/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2011/05/farage-av-is-the-thin-of-the-wedge-thats-why-we-support-it/|archivedate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2015 general election, in which UKIP took a lower proportion of seats than votes, Farage called the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system (FPTP) "totally bankrupt",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasan|first1=Medhi|authorlink1=Medhi Hasan|title=Why does it take Nigel Farage to make the case for electoral reform?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/nigel-farage-electoral-reform-left-first-past-the-post-proportional-representation|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023211620/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/nigel-farage-electoral-reform-left-first-past-the-post-proportional-representation|archivedate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Farage said: "I completely lost faith in [FPTP] [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|in 2005]] when Blair was returned with a 60 seat majority on 36 per cent of the vote, or 22 per cent if you factor in low turnout."&lt;ref name=BlackburnMay2011 /&gt;

===Energy and the environment===
Farage has criticised the shutting down of coal-fired power stations and has opposed the policy of creating wind farms as covering "Britain in ugly disgusting ghastly windmills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ward, Bob |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/ukip-energy-climate-policies |title=Ukip's energy and climate policies under the spotlight |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430042350/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/04/ukip-energy-climate-policies |archivedate=30 April 2014 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech made to the European parliament on 11 September 2013, Farage cited news, reported in several [[Rupert Murdoch]]-owned papers and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', that the Arctic Sea ice cap had apparently grown from 2012 to 2013, saying that this was evidence of decades "of Euro-federalism combined with an increasing Green obsession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mathiesen, Karl |date=18 September 2013 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/18/how-fast-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting |title=How fast is Arctic sea ice melting? |archivedate=25 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525202416/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/18/how-fast-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Farage takes an anti-prohibitionist position on recreational drugs. In an April 2014 phone-in interview hosted by ''The Daily Telegraph'' he argued that the [[War on Drugs]] had been lost "many, many years ago", stating that "I hate drugs, I've never taken them myself, I hope I never do, but I just have a feeling that the criminalisation of all these drugs is actually not really helping British society." He argued in favour of a [[Royal Commission]] on drugs, which would explore all avenues as to how to legislate most effectively and deal with their related criminal and public health problems, including the possibility of their [[Drug liberalization|legalisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage: I've Never Done Drugs, But Legalise Them |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/04/nigel-farage-ukip-drugs-legalisation_n_5091437.html |accessdate=25 May 2014 |newspaper=Huffington Post UK |date=4 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195442/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/04/nigel-farage-ukip-drugs-legalisation_n_5091437.html |archivedate=25 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farage, the smoking ban in enclosed public spaces is "silly and illiberal"; he recommends separate smoking areas along the lines of some German states. He believes that banning things makes them more attractive to children, and said that "Obesity is killing more people than smoking, you could ban chip shops, you could ban doughnuts. The point is we are big enough and ugly enough to make our own decisions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage Says Smoking Ban 'Silly And Illiberal'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/30/nigel-farage-smoking-ban-germany-_n_3182909.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=30 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216061740/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/30/nigel-farage-smoking-ban-germany-_n_3182909.html|archivedate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2015 book, Farage reflected that based on his experiences, "the NHS is so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine. In the NHS, the system is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks. The NHS is, however, astonishingly good at critical care. But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.&lt;ref name=purplerev/&gt;

Farage says that money which the NHS could spend on treating taxpayers with serious conditions is instead spent on recent immigrants with [[HIV]], an opinion which has been controversial. A [[YouGov]] poll found 50 per cent of those taking part to support Farage, with 37 per cent saying that he is scaremongering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gander|first1=Kashmira|title=Nigel Farage on the NHS: Half of voters agrees that HIV patients cost UK too much money|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nigel-farage-on-the-nhs-half-of-voters-agrees-that-hiv-patients-cost-uk-too-much-money-10158767.html|accessdate=10 April 2015|work=The Independent|date=6 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409203039/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/nigel-farage-on-the-nhs-half-of-voters-agrees-that-hiv-patients-cost-uk-too-much-money-10158767.html|archivedate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence Day national holiday===
Farage has argued strongly in favour of a British Independence Day being observed within the United Kingdom, on 23 June each year. On 24 June 2016, in a televised speech on the morning of the [[Brexit]] result, he stated; "let June 23rd go down in our history as our Independence Day",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-24/farage-let-june-23-be-the-uks-independence-day/ |title=UK votes to leave the EU in historic referendum |publisher=[[ITV plc|ITV]] |date=24 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203020057/http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-24/farage-let-june-23-be-the-uks-independence-day/ |archivedate=3 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36613295 |title=EU Referendum: Farage declares 'independence day' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226175929/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36613295 |archivedate=26 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later said that it "must now be made a [[National Day|national holiday]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/746231271571939329 |title=June 23rd must now be made a national holiday. #IndependenceDay |publisher=Nigel Farage |date=23 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130192747/https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/746231271571939329 |archivedate=30 November 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===
Farage has said that he supports Muslim immigrants who integrate to British society, but is against those who are "coming here to take us over", citing [[John Howard]]'s Australia as a government to emulate in that regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Observer]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/31/boris-johnson-nigel-farage-in-quotes |location=London |author=Bromwich, Kathryn |title=Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: their wit and wisdom |accessdate=31 August 2014 |date=30 August 2014 |archivedate=31 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831163934/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/31/boris-johnson-nigel-farage-in-quotes |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He told a [[Channel 4]] documentary in 2015 that there is a "[[fifth column]]" of Islamic extremists in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Nigel Farage: British Muslim "fifth column" fuels immigration fear|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/12/nigel-farage-british-muslim-fifth-column-fuels-immigration-fear-ukip|accessdate=12 March 2015|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=12 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130041/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/12/nigel-farage-british-muslim-fifth-column-fuels-immigration-fear-ukip|archivedate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage has said that the "basic principle" of [[Enoch Powell]]'s "[[Rivers of Blood speech]]" was correct.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Farage Rivers of Blood"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Georgia|title=Nigel Farage: 'the basic principle' of Enoch Powell's River of Blood speech is right|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10552055/Nigel-Farage-the-basic-principle-of-Enoch-Powells-River-of-Blood-speech-is-right.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=7 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106081743/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10552055/Nigel-Farage-the-basic-principle-of-Enoch-Powells-River-of-Blood-speech-is-right.html|archivedate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview on the [[LBC]] radio station, Farage said that he would feel "concerned" if a group of [[Romanian people|Romanian]] men moved next door to him. When interviewer [[James O'Brien (radio presenter)|James O'Brien]] inquired what would be the difference between Romanian men moving next door and a group of German children, in reference to Farage's German wife and children, Farage replied: "You know the difference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=16 May 2014|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukips-nigel-farage-tells-lbc-radio-i-dont-want-romanians-my-neighbours-audio-1448900|author=Gover, Dominic|title=Ukip's Nigel Farage Tells LBC Radio: I Don't Want Romanians as my Neighbours|work=International Business Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517153631/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukips-nigel-farage-tells-lbc-radio-i-dont-want-romanians-my-neighbours-audio-1448900|archivedate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e23ce9e8-dd0f-11e3-8546-00144feabdc0.html |author=Pickard, Jim |date=16 May 2014 |title=Nigel Farage radio interview brought to abrupt close |work=Financial Times |location=London |archivedate=18 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518144447/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e23ce9e8-dd0f-11e3-8546-00144feabdc0.html |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/16/nigel-farage-ukip-car-crash-radio-interview-lbc|title=Nigel Farage aide disrupts interview amid racism and expenses claims|work=The Guardian|location=London|author=Wintour, Patrick|date=16 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226175854/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/16/nigel-farage-ukip-car-crash-radio-interview-lbc|archivedate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later expanded on this on the UKIP website, explaining that "if we were able to operate a proper work permit scheme for Romanian nationals, with suitable checks, as recommended by UKIP, then nobody would need to be concerned if a group of Romanian nationals moved in next door to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=UKIP |url=http://www.ukip.org/ukip_leader_stands_by_his_assertion_that_people_have_a_right_to_be_concerned_if_a_group_of_romanians_move_in_next_door |title=UKIP leader stands by his assertion that people have a right to be concerned if a group of Romanians move in next door |archivedate=17 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517155736/http://www.ukip.org/ukip_leader_stands_by_his_assertion_that_people_have_a_right_to_be_concerned_if_a_group_of_romanians_move_in_next_door |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farage is in favour of crackdowns on immigration from Eastern Europe, but is favourable to immigration from India and Australia.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Foreign policy===
Farage is critical of Britain's involvement in the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]], [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]] and [[Libya]], and cited their financial and human expenses and poor outcomes as reasons for Britain to not become involved militarily in Syria. He has expressed fears that [[List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War|rebel forces in Syria]] may be Islamic extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farage|first1=Nigel|title=EXCLUSIVE ‘We’re tired of wars’ – Nigel Farage explains why we MUST resist striking Syria|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/425185/EXCLUSIVE-We-re-tired-of-wars-Nigel-Farage-explains-why-we-MUST-resist-striking-Syria|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=Daily Express|date=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that "Nobody should forget that the most devastating direct consequences of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have not been suffered by the likes of Mr Blair, but by the civilian populations of these countries and of course by our own brave service personnel".&lt;ref name="Al Bawaba 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=#Leave UKIP: Farage’s top comments on the Middle East | website=Al Bawaba | date=4 July 2016 | url=http://www.albawaba.com/loop/leave-ukip-farage-top-comments-middle-east-859294 | accessdate=4 July 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705145627/http://www.albawaba.com/loop/leave-ukip-farage-top-comments-middle-east-859294 | archivedate=5 July 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage stated that [[European migrant crisis|migrant exodus]] from Libya had been caused by [[2011 military intervention in Libya|NATO military intervention]], approved by [[David Cameron]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], in the [[Libyan Crisis (2011–present)|civil war in Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11548171/Nigel-Farage-David-Cameron-directly-caused-Libyan-migrant-crisis.html |title=Nigel Farage: David Cameron 'directly caused' Libyan migrant crisis |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 April 2015 |author=Holehouse, Matthew |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419184702/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11548171/Nigel-Farage-David-Cameron-directly-caused-Libyan-migrant-crisis.html |archivedate=19 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Daily Express''. 4 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "I think we need a complete re-appraisal of who Saudi Arabia are, what our relationship with them is, and stop extremist talk turning the minds of young, male Muslims in this country."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lbc.co.uk/farage-we-need-to-re-appraise-our-relationship-with-saudi-arabia---122465 Farage: We Need To Re-Appraise Our Relationship With Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818232824/http://www.lbc.co.uk/farage-we-need-to-re-appraise-our-relationship-with-saudi-arabia---122465 |date=18 August 2016 }}". [[LBC]]. 3 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 2014 which leaders he admired, Farage said, "As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]. The way he played [[Russia's role in the Syrian Civil War|the whole Syria thing]]. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigel Farage: I admire Vladimir Putin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/farage-i-admire-putin |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Press Association |location=London |date=31 March 2014 |archivedate=31 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331170810/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/31/farage-i-admire-putin |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage has criticised what he sees as EU militarism agitating western [[Ukrainians]] against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wintour|first1=Patrick|title=Nigel Farage hits out at 'militarist' EU over Ukraine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/28/nigel-farage-eu-miltarist-ukraine-nick-clegg|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=28 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808111355/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/28/nigel-farage-eu-miltarist-ukraine-nick-clegg|archivedate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2015, he said about Putin that "The European Union, and the West, view Putin as the devil. They want to view Putin as the devil.

Farage's stance on Iran has shifted over time. In 2013, Farage opposed sanctions on Iran, and criticised a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, stating: "I do not support acts of aggression, even from countries that feel their existence is threatened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Jewish Chronicle]]|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-west-wrong-on-iran-sanctions-1.46724|date=11 July 2013|title=Nigel Farage: West wrong on Iran sanctions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he condemned [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s "record for standing up and defending this hardline Islamist regime" and declared that regime change was "absolutely the right thing" in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[LBC]]|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nigel-farage/nigel-farage-jeremy-corbyns-silence-iran-protests/|date=2 January 2018|title=Nigel Farage Calls Out Jeremy Corbyn's Silence On Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Campaign against Irish fiscal treaty====
In May 2012. Farage was interviewed by Karen Coleman of the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' about the campaign in Ireland against the [[Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Irish fiscal treaty]]. Ireland had [[List of members of the European Parliament for Ireland, 2009–14|no anti-EU MEPs]] and according to [[Pat "the Cope" Gallagher]] MEP, UKIP's involvement was counterproductive as "Irish voters strongly dislike foreigners like Mr Farage telling them how to vote." Coleman who believed the campaign had "little to do with what's best for Ireland" described the campaign as "particularly egregious" and said the interview became 'nasty' when she asked Farage about the campaign funding.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coleman|first=Karen|title=Beware of No campaigners with agendas of their own|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/karen-coleman-beware-of-no-campaigners-with-agendas-of-their-own-3119166.html|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Interference" in Austrian election====
During the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 Austrian presidential election]] campaign, Farage said that [[Norbert Hofer]], the [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] candidate, would call for a "Brexit style referendum" if he won. Hofer however ruled out a referendum and asked Farage not to interfere in Austria's internal politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/04/dont-interfere-austrias-far-right-presidential-candidate-tells/|title='Don't interfere,' Austria's far-right presidential candidate tells Nigel Farage|author=Roland Oliphant|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 December 2016|accessdate=4 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204213951/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/04/dont-interfere-austrias-far-right-presidential-candidate-tells/|archivedate=4 December 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firearms policy===
In 2014, Farage said that it is UKIP policy for handguns in the UK to be legalised and licensed, describing the current legislation, brought in after the [[Dunblane school massacre]], as "ludicrous".&lt;ref name="Graham 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Graham | first=Georgia | title=Hand guns should be legalised and licensed, Nigel Farage has said | website=Telegraph.co.uk | date=24 January 2014 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10595087/Hand-guns-should-be-legalised-and-licensed-Nigel-Farage-has-said.html | accessdate=19 February 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315194534/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10595087/Hand-guns-should-be-legalised-and-licensed-Nigel-Farage-has-said.html | archivedate=15 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that there was no link between responsible handgun ownership and gun crime.&lt;ref name="Williams 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Williams | first=Jennifer | title=Farage: No return to 'Gunchester' if handguns legalised | website=Manchester Evening News | date=25 January 2014 | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/ukip-leader-nigel-farage-no-6593401 | accessdate=19 February 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302213246/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/ukip-leader-nigel-farage-no-6593401 | archivedate=2 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Jewish lobby" comments===
In October 2017, Farage asserted in an [[LBC]] radio appearance that the "Jewish lobby" in the United States was more concerning to him than [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in American politics]], saying: "There are other very powerful lobbies in the United States of America, and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, is one of those strong voices...There are about 6 million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it's quite small, but in terms of influence it's quite big."&lt;ref name="Goodkind"&gt;Nicole Goodkind, [http://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-jewish-farage-brexit-698486 Jews Should Concern Americans More Than Russian Influence, Nigel Farage Says] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102083802/http://www.newsweek.com/trump-russia-jewish-farage-brexit-698486 |date=2 November 2017 }}, ''Newsweek'' (1 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JN"&gt;[http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/nigel-farage-urged-to-apologise-for-jewish-lobby-remark/ Nigel Farage urged to apologise for ‘Jewish lobby’ remark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101112524/http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/nigel-farage-urged-to-apologise-for-jewish-lobby-remark/ |date=1 November 2017 }}, ''[[Jewish News]]'' (31 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Farage's remarks were condemned by the [[Campaign Against Antisemitism]]&lt;ref name="JN"/&gt; and the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which said that Farage's comment "plays into deep-seated [[Antisemetic canard|anti-Semitic tropes]]" and was fuel for extremist conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="Goodkind"/&gt;

&lt;!--Health--&gt;
On 25 November 1985, Farage was hit by a car after a night out, and suffered injury to his head and left leg, the latter nearly requiring amputation. He was in casts for 11 months, but recovered, and the nurse who treated him became his first wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farage|first1=Nigel|title=Nigel Farage: A car crash nearly killed me, but at least I got a wife out of it|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11466527/Nigel-Farage-A-car-crash-nearly-killed-me-but-at-least-I-got-a-wife-out-of-it.html|accessdate=10 April 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416154302/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/11466527/Nigel-Farage-A-car-crash-nearly-killed-me-but-at-least-I-got-a-wife-out-of-it.html|archivedate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 1986, Farage first felt symptoms of what was later discovered to be [[testicular cancer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8627">'''Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991''' was a video game competition sponsored by [[Nintendo]] and held at nearly 60 [[college]] campuses throughout the [[United States]]. It was the first of [[Nintendo Campus Challenge|two Campus Challenges]].

==Games==
[[File:Campus-challenge-1991.jpg|thumb|right|''Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991'' Cartridge]]
Like [[Nintendo World Championships]] 1990, the official event gave each player 6 minutes and 21 seconds to play in the contest, but there are three different minigames. The first minigame of the competition is to collect 25 coins in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. The next minigame is a version of ''[[Pin*Bot (video game)|Pin*Bot]]'' where players must get 100,000 points. The final minigame is ''[[Dr. Mario (video game)|Dr. Mario]]'' and this lasts until time expires. Once time does expire, a player's score is totaled using the following formula:

*''Super Mario Bros. 3'' score times 10
*+ ''[[Pin Bot (video game)|Pin Bot]]'' score times 1
*+ ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' score times 100

There is only one known original copy of the 1991 Campus Challenge cartridge in existence. The game was found by a [[video game collector]], Rob Walters, at a garage sale in [[New York City]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Greatest Video Game Garage Sale | publisher = VGPC.com | url = http://blog.videogamepricecharts.com/2009/07/greatest-video-game-garage-sale-ever.html | accessdate = 2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game sold for $14,000 in July 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991 Price History | publisher = VGPC.com | url = http://www.videogamepricecharts.com/game/nes/nintendo-campus-challenge-1991 | accessdate = 2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 3 months, the game was resold on eBay for $20,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nintendo Campus Challenge 1991 Ebay | publisher = ebay | url = http://cgi.ebay.com/Nintendo-Campus-Challenge-1991-NES-World-Championships_W0QQitemZ370266968824QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item5635a192f8 | accessdate = 2009-10-08 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991 Event Structure==
The 1991 Campus Challenge was held at 58 college campuses and spring break locations. The event consisted of three stages. The main stage had the competition on 12 different game stations. The second stage was [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] systems with various games while the third stage had [[Game Boy]] systems. Attendees at the events could play as many times as they wanted and the highest score at the end of the day was announced the winner.

The winner from each location was flown to [[Disney World]] in Orlando over New Year's weekend in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Campus Challenge Video | publisher = VidLife.com | url = http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_698724_Nintendo_Campus_Challenge.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090718032418/http://www.vidilife.com/video_play_698724_Nintendo_Campus_Challenge.htm# | archive-date = 2009-07-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the competitors played in the first round where the twelve highest scoring players advanced to the second round, then the top six players advanced to the third round. The final round was a head-to-head match between Steven Lucas and Matt Sekelsky. Steven Lucas won with a score of 2,394,130.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Campus Challenge Winner Video | publisher = Youtube.com | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGjGrkavHYA | accessdate = 2016-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cosmology}}
A '''non-standard cosmology''' is any physical [[physical cosmology|cosmological model]] of the universe that was, or still is, proposed as an alternative to the then-current standard model of cosmology. The term ''non-standard'' is applied to any theory that does not conform to the [[scientific consensus]]. Because the term depends on the  prevailing consensus, the meaning of the term changes over time. For example, [[hot dark matter]] would not have been considered non-standard in 1990, but would be in 2010. Conversely, a non-zero [[cosmological constant]] resulting in an accelerating universe would have been considered non-standard in 1990, but is part of the standard cosmology in 2010.

Several major cosmological disputes have occurred throughout the [[timeline of cosmology|history of cosmology]]. One of the earliest was the [[Copernican Revolution]], which established the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the Solar System. More recent was the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] of 1920, in the aftermath of which the Milky Way's status as but one of the Universe's many galaxies was established. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] community was equally divided between supporters of the [[Big Bang]] theory and supporters of a rival [[steady state universe]]; this was eventually decided in favour of the Big Bang theory by advances in [[observational cosmology]] in the late 1960s. The current standard model of cosmology is the [[Lambda-CDM]] model, wherein the Universe is governed by [[General Relativity]], began with a Big Bang and today is a nearly-[[Shape of the universe|flat universe]] that consists of approximately 5% baryons, 27% [[cold dark matter]], and 68% [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|the Planck Collaboration's 2015 data release]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambda-CDM has been an extremely successful model, but retains some weaknesses (such as the [[dwarf galaxy problem]]). Research on extensions or modifications to Lambda-CDM, as well as fundamentally different models, is ongoing. Topics investigated include [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND) and its relativistic generalization [[TeVeS]], and [[warm dark matter]].

==The Lambda-CDM model==
Before observational evidence was gathered, theorists developed frameworks based on what they understood to be the most general features of [[physics]] and philosophical assumptions about the universe. When [[Albert Einstein]] developed his [[general theory of relativity]] in 1915, this was used as a mathematical starting point for most cosmological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, F., ''Home is Where the Wind Blows'', 1994, 1997, 399-423&lt;/ref&gt; In order to arrive at a cosmological model, however, theoreticians needed to make assumptions about the nature of the largest scales of the universe. The assumptions that the current standard model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM, relies upon are:

# the [[physical law|universality of physical laws]]&amp;nbsp;– that the laws of physics don't change from one place and time to another,
# the [[cosmological principle]]&amp;nbsp;– that the universe is roughly homogeneous and isotropic in space though not necessarily in time, and
# the [[Copernican principle]]&amp;nbsp;– that we are not observing the universe from a preferred locale.

These assumptions when combined with General Relativity result in a universe that is governed by the [[Friedmann–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FRW metric). The FRW metric allows for a universe that is either expanding or contracting (as well as stationary but unstable universes). When [[Hubble's Law]] was discovered, most astronomers interpreted the law as a sign the universe is expanding. This implies the universe was smaller in the past, and therefore led to the following conclusions:

# the universe emerged from a hot, dense state at a [[Wikt:finite|finite]] time in the past,
# because the universe heats up as it contracts and cools as it expands, in the first moments that time existed as we know it, the temperatures were high enough for [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] to occur, and
# a [[cosmic microwave background]] pervading the entire universe should exist, which is a record of a [[phase transition]] that occurred when the atoms of the universe first formed.

These features were derived by numerous individuals over a period of years; indeed it was not until the middle of the twentieth century that accurate predictions of the last feature and observations confirming its existence were made. Non-standard theories developed either by starting from different assumptions or by contradicting the features predicted by Lambda-CDM.&lt;ref name="Burbidge, Hoyle"&gt;Burbidge, G., Hoyle, F. 1998, ApJ, 509 L1-L3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Modern physical cosmology as it is currently studied first emerged as a scientific discipline in the period after the [[Shapley–Curtis debate]] and discoveries by [[Edwin Hubble]] of a [[cosmic distance ladder]] when astronomers and physicists had to come to terms with a universe that was of a much [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|larger scale]] than the previously assumed [[Milky Way galaxy|galactic size]]. Theorists who successfully developed cosmologies applicable to the larger-scale universe are remembered today as the founders of modern cosmology. Among these scientists are [[Arthur Milne]], [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Alexander Friedman]], [[Georges Lemaître]], and Albert Einstein himself.

After confirmation of the Hubble's law by observation, the two most popular cosmological theories became the [[Steady State theory]] of [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]], [[Thomas Gold|Gold]] and [[Hermann Bondi|Bondi]], and the [[big bang theory]] of [[Ralph Alpher]], [[George Gamow]], and [[Robert Dicke]] with a small number of supporters of a smattering of alternatives. Since the discovery of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] in 1965, most cosmologists concluded that observations were best explained by the big bang model. Steady State theorists and other non-standard cosmologies were then tasked with providing an explanation for the phenomenon if they were to remain plausible. This led to original approaches including [[integrated starlight]] and [[cosmic iron whiskers]], which were meant to provide a source for a pervasive, all-sky microwave background that was not due to an early universe phase transition.
[[File:WMAP2.jpg|thumb|left|Artist depiction of the [[WMAP]] spacecraft at the L2 point. Data gathered by this spacecraft has been successfully used to parametrize the features of standard cosmology, but complete analysis of the data in the context of any non-standard cosmology has not yet been achieved.]]
Scepticism about the non-standard cosmologies' ability to explain the CMB caused interest in the subject to wane since then, however, there have been two periods in which interest in non-standard cosmology has increased due to observational data which posed difficulties for the big bang. The first occurred was the late 1970s when there were a number of unsolved problems, such as the [[horizon problem]], the [[flatness problem]], and the lack of [[magnetic monopole]]s, which challenged the big bang model. These issues were eventually resolved by [[cosmic inflation]] in the 1980s. This idea subsequently became part of the understanding of the big bang, although alternatives have been proposed from time to time. The second occurred in the mid-1990s when observations of the ages of [[globular cluster]]s and the primordial [[helium]] abundance, apparently disagreed with the big bang. However, by the late 1990s, most astronomers had concluded that these observations did not challenge the big bang and additional data from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]], provided detailed quantitative measures which were consistent with standard cosmology.

In the 1990s, a dawning of a "golden age of cosmology" was accompanied by a startling discovery that the expansion of the universe was, in fact, accelerating. Previous to this, it had been assumed that matter either in its visible or invisible [[dark matter]] form was the dominant [[energy density]] in the universe. This "classical" big bang cosmology was overthrown when it was discovered that nearly 70% of the energy in the universe was attributable to the cosmological constant, often referred to as "dark energy". This has led to the development of a so-called concordance [[ΛCDM model]] which combines detailed data obtained with new telescopes and techniques in observational astrophysics with an expanding, density-changing universe. Today, it is more common to find in the scientific literature proposals for "non-standard cosmologies" that actually accept the basic tenets of the big bang cosmology, while modifying parts of the concordance model. Such theories include alternative models of dark energy, such as quintessence, [[phantom energy]] and some ideas in [[brane cosmology]]; alternative models of dark matter, such as modified Newtonian dynamics; alternatives or extensions to inflation such as [[chaotic inflation]] and the [[ekpyrotic|ekpyrotic model]]; and proposals to supplement the universe with a first cause, such as the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking boundary condition]], the [[cyclic model]], and the [[string landscape]]. There is no consensus about these ideas amongst cosmologists, but they are nonetheless active fields of academic inquiry.

Today, heterodox non-standard cosmologies are generally considered unworthy of consideration by cosmologists while many of the historically significant nonstandard cosmologies are considered to have been [[Falsifiability|falsified]]. The essentials of the big bang theory have been confirmed by a wide range of complementary and detailed observations, and no non-standard cosmologies have reproduced the range of successes of the big bang model. Speculations about alternatives are not normally part of research or pedagogical discussions, except as object lessons or for their historical importance. An open letter started by some remaining advocates of non-standard cosmology has affirmed that: "today, virtually all financial and experimental resources in cosmology are devoted to big bang studies...."&lt;ref name="cosmologystatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmology.info/open-letter|title=Open Letter on Cosmology|work=cosmology.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative gravity==
{{main|Alternatives to general relativity}}
General relativity, upon which the FRW metric is based, is an extremely successful theory which has met every observational test so far. However, at a fundamental level it is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]], and by predicting [[gravitational singularity|singularities]], it also predicts its own breakdown. Any alternative theory of gravity would imply immediately an alternative cosmological theory since current modeling is dependent on general relativity as a framework assumption. There are many different motivations to modify general relativity, such as to eliminate the need for dark matter or dark energy, or to avoid such paradoxes as the [[Firewall (physics)|firewall]].

===Machian universe===
{{See also|Brans–Dicke theory|Mach's principle}}
[[Ernst Mach]] developed a kind of extension to general relativity which proposed that [[inertia]] was due to gravitational effects of the mass distribution of the universe. This led naturally to speculation about the cosmological implications for such a proposal. [[Carl Brans]] and Robert Dicke were able to successfully incorporate Mach's principle into general relativity which admitted for cosmological solutions that would imply a variable mass. The homogeneously distributed mass of the universe would result in a roughly [[scalar field]] that permeated the universe and would serve as a source for Newton's [[gravitational constant]]; creating a theory of [[quantum gravity]].

===MOND===
{{main|Modified Newtonian Dynamics}}
Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a relatively modern proposal to explain the [[galaxy rotation problem]] based on a variation of [[Newton's Second Law]] of Dynamics at low accelerations. This would produce a large-scale variation of [[Newtonian gravity|Newton's universal theory of gravity]]. A modification of Newton's theory would also imply a modification of general relativistic cosmology in as much as Newtonian cosmology is the limit of Friedman cosmology. While almost all astrophysicists today reject MOND in favor of dark matter, a small number of researchers continue to enhance it, recently incorporating Brans–Dicke theories into treatments that attempt to account for cosmological observations.

===TeVeS===
{{main|Tensor–vector–scalar gravity}}
Tensor–vector–scalar gravity (TeVeS) is a proposed relativistic theory that is equivalent to Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the non-relativistic limit, which purports to explain the galaxy rotation problem without invoking dark matter. Originated by [[Jacob Bekenstein]] in 2004, it incorporates various dynamical and non-dynamical [[tensor field]]s, [[vector field]]s and scalar fields.

The break-through of TeVeS over MOND is that it can explain the phenomenon of [[gravitational lensing]], a cosmic optical illusion in which matter bends light, which has been confirmed many times. A recent preliminary finding is that it can explain [[structure formation]] without CDM, but requiring a ~2eV massive [[neutrino]] (they are also required to fit some [[Clusters of galaxies]], including the [[Bullet Cluster]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0608602|title=[astro-ph/0608602] Can Cosmic Structure form without Dark Matter?|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=97|issue=23|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|last2=Liguori|first2=Michele|year=2006|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.231301|bibcode=2006PhRvL..97w1301D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0505519|title=[astro-ph/0505519] Large Scale Structure in Bekenstein's theory of relativistic Modified Newtonian Dynamics|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|issue=11301|last1= Skordis|first1=C.|last2= Mota|first2=D.

===f(R) gravity===
{{main|f(R) gravity}}
''f''(''R'') gravity is a family of theories that modify general relativity by defining a different function of the [[Scalar curvature|Ricci scalar]]. The simplest case is just the function being equal to the scalar; this is general relativity. As a consequence of introducing an arbitrary function, there may be freedom to explain the [[Accelerating universe|accelerated expansion]] and structure formation of the Universe without adding unknown forms of dark energy or dark matter. Some functional forms may be inspired by corrections arising from a [[Quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]]. ''f''(''R'') gravity was first proposed in 1970 by [[Hans Adolph Buchdahl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Non-linear Lagrangians and cosmological theory| last=Buchdahl |first=H. A.| journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]| volume = 150| pages = 1–8| year = 1970| bibcode = 1970MNRAS.150....1B| doi=10.1093/mnras/150.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although ''φ'' was used rather than ''f'' for the name of the arbitrary function). It has become an active field of research following work by Starobinsky on [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A new type of isotropic cosmological models without singularity| last=Starobinsky |first=A. A.| journal = [[Physics Letters B]] | volume = 91| pages = 99–102| year = 1980|doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(80)90670-X| bibcode = 1980PhLB...91...99S }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of phenomena can be produced from this theory by adopting different functions; however, many functional forms can now be ruled out on observational grounds, or because of pathological theoretical problems.

==Steady State theories==
{{main|Steady State theory}}
The Steady State theory extends the [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] assumption of the cosmological principle to reflect a homogeneity in [[time]] as well as in [[space]]. This "perfect cosmological principle" as it would come to be called asserted that the universe looks the same everywhere (on the large scale), the same as it always has and always will. This is in contrast to Lambda-CDM, in which the universe looked very different in the past and will look very different in the future. Steady State theory was proposed in 1948 by [[Fred Hoyle]], [[Thomas Gold]], [[Hermann Bondi]] and others. In order to maintain the perfect cosmological principle in an expanding universe, steady state cosmology had to posit a "matter-creation field" (the so-called [[C-field]]) that would insert matter into the universe in order to maintain a constant density.&lt;ref name="Burbidge, Hoyle" /&gt;

The debate between the Big Bang and the Steady State models would happen for 15 years with camps roughly evenly divided until the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation is a natural feature of the Big Bang model which demands a "time of last scattering" where photons [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decouple]] with [[baryon]]ic matter. The Steady State model proposed that this radiation could be accounted for by so-called "integrated starlight" which was a background caused in part by [[Olbers' paradox]] in an infinite universe. In order to account for the uniformity of the background, steady state proponents posited a fog effect associated with microscopic iron particles that would scatter radio waves in such a manner as to produce an isotropic CMB. The proposed phenomena was whimsically named "cosmic iron whiskers" and served as the [[Thermalisation|thermalization]] mechanism. The Steady State theory did not have the horizon problem of the Big Bang because it assumed an infinite amount of time was available for thermalizing the background.&lt;ref name="Burbidge, Hoyle" /&gt;

As more cosmological data began to be collected, cosmologists began to realize that the Big Bang correctly predicted the abundance of light elements observed in the cosmos. What was a coincidental ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[deuterium]] and helium in the steady state model was a feature of the Big Bang model. Additionally, detailed measurements of the CMB since the 1990s with the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck Satellite|Planck]] observations  indicated that the [[spectrum]] of the background was closer to a [[blackbody]] than any other source in nature. The best integrated starlight models could predict was a thermalization to the level of 10% while the COBE satellite measured the deviation at one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. After this dramatic discovery, the majority of cosmologists became convinced that the steady state theory could not explain the observed CMB properties.

Although the original steady state model is now considered to be contrary to observations (particularly the CMB) even by its one-time supporters, modifications of the steady state model has been proposed, including a model that envisions the universe as originating through many little bangs rather than one big bang (the so-called "quasi-steady state cosmology"). It supposes that the universe goes through periodic expansion and contraction phases, with a soft "rebound" in place of the Big Bang. Thus the Hubble Law is explained by the fact that the universe is currently in an expansion phase. Work continues on this model (most notably by [[Jayant V. Narlikar]]), although it has yet to gain widespread mainstream acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=E.

==Anisotropic universe==
{{see also|Dark flow}}
Isotropicity – the idea that the universe looks the same in all directions – is one of the core assumptions that enters into the FRW equations. In 2008 however, scientists working on Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data claimed to have detected a 600–1000&amp;nbsp;km/s flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of Centaurus and Vela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

The detection is controversial, and other scientists have found that the universe is isotropic to a great degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.earlyuniverse.org/does-the-universe-look-the-same-in-all-directions/|title=Does the Universe look the same in all directions?|author=Daniela Saadeh|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exotic dark matter and dark energy==
{{main|Dark matter|Dark energy}}
In Lambda-CDM, dark matter is an extremely inert form of matter that does not interact with both ordinary matter (baryons) and light, but still exerts gravitational effects. To produce the large-scale structure we see today, dark matter is "cold" (the 'C' in Lambda-CDM), i.e. non-relativistic. Dark energy is an unknown form of energy that tends to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Both dark matter and dark energy have not been conclusively identified, and their exact nature is the subject of intense study. For example, scientists have hypothesized that dark matter could decay into dark energy, or that both dark matter and dark energy are different facets of the same underlying fluid (see [[dark fluid]]). Other theories that aim to explain one or the other, such as warm dark matter and quintessence, also fall into this category.

==Proposals based on observational skepticism==
As the observational cosmology began to develop, certain astronomers began to offer alternative speculations regarding the interpretation of various phenomena that occasionally became parts of non-standard cosmologies.

===Tired light===
{{main|Tired light}}
Tired light theories challenge the common interpretation of Hubble's Law as a sign the universe is expanding. It was proposed by [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1929. The basic proposal amounted to light losing energy ("getting tired") due to the distance it traveled rather than any metric expansion or physical recession of sources from observers. A traditional explanation of this effect was to attribute a [[dynamical friction]] to photons; the photons' gravitational interactions with stars and other material will progressively reduce their momentum, thus producing a redshift. Other proposals for explaining how photons could lose energy included the [[scattering]] of light by intervening material in a process similar to observed [[interstellar reddening]]. However, all these processes would also tend to blur images of distant objects, and no such blurring has been detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/tiredlit.htm|title=Errors in Tired Light Cosmology|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional tired light has been found incompatible with the observed [[time dilation]] that is associated with the cosmological redshift.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/06/tired-light-hypothesis-gets-re-tired|title="Tired-Light" Hypothesis Gets Re-Tired|publisher=Science|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is mostly remembered as a falsified alternative explanation for Hubble's law in most astronomy or cosmology discussions.

===Dirac large numbers hypothesis===
{{main|Dirac large numbers hypothesis}}
The Dirac large numbers hypothesis uses the ratio of the size of the visible universe to the radius of quantum particle to predict the age of the universe. The coincidence of various ratios being close in [[orders of magnitude|order of magnitude]] may ultimately prove meaningless or the indication of a deeper connection between concepts in a future [[theory of everything]]. Nevertheless, attempts to use such ideas have been criticized as [[numerology]].

===Redshift periodicity and intrinsic redshifts===
[[File:Halton-arp.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Halton Arp]] in London, Oct 2000]]
{{See also|Redshift quantization}}
Some astrophysicists were unconvinced that the cosmological redshifts are caused by universal cosmological [[metric expansion of space|expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, I.E., Nicoll, J.F., Wu, P., Zhou, Z. 1993, ''Statistically Efficient Testing of the Hubble and Lundmark Laws on IRAS Galaxy Samples'', Astrophys. J. 465-484&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arp 1998"&gt;Arp, H., ''Seeing Red, Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Skepticism and alternative explanations began appearing in the scientific literature in the 1960s. In particular, [[Geoffrey Burbidge]], [[William Tifft]] and [[Halton Arp]] were all observational astrophysicists who proposed that there were inconsistencies in the redshift observations of [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s. The first two were famous for suggesting that there were [[redshift quantization|periodicities in the redshift distributions]] of galaxies and quasars. Subsequent statistical analyses of [[redshift survey]]s, however, have not confirmed the existence of these periodicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | display-authors =etal | date=2007| title =  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog. IV. Fifth Data Release| bibcode=2007AJ....134..102S | journal = The Astronomical Journal | volume = 134 | issue = 1| pages = 102–117 |doi = 10.1086/518474 |arxiv = 0704.0806 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the quasar controversies of the 1970s, these same astronomers were also of the opinion that quasars exhibited high redshifts not due to their incredible distance but rather due to unexplained ''intrinsic redshift'' mechanisms that would cause the periodicities and cast doubt on the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="Arp 1998" /&gt; Arguments over how distant quasars were took the form of debates surrounding quasar energy production mechanisms, their [[light curve]]s, and whether quasars exhibited any [[proper motion]]. Astronomers who believed quasars were not at cosmological distances argued that the [[Eddington luminosity]] set limits on how distant the quasars could be since the energy output required to explain the [[apparent brightness]] of cosmologically-distant quasars was far too high to be explainable by [[nuclear fusion]] alone. This objection was made moot by the improved models of gravity-powered [[accretion disk]]s which for sufficiently dense material (such as [[black hole]]s) can be more efficient at energy production than nuclear reactions. The controversy was laid to rest by the 1990s when evidence became available that observed quasars were actually the ultra-luminous cores of distant [[active galactic nuclei]] and that the major components of their redshift were in fact due to the [[Hubble flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Throughout his career, Halton Arp maintained that there were anomalies in his observations of quasars and galaxies, and that those anomalies served as a refutation of the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="Arp 1998" /&gt; In particular, Arp pointed out examples of quasars that were close to the line of sight of (relatively) nearby [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN). He claimed that clusters of quasars were in alignment around AGN cores and that quasars, rather than being the cores of distant AGN, were actually much closer and were starlike-objects ejected from the centers of nearby AGN with high intrinsic redshifts. Arp also contended that they gradually lost their non-cosmological redshift component and eventually evolved into full-fledged galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;Arp and others who agree with him have been known to support the argument for a varying non-cosmological redshift by referring to a so-called "magnitude-redshift discrepancy". When a Hubble's law-type plot of quasar magnitudes versus redshift is made, a graph with a diffuse scatter and no clear linear relation is generated. However, since [[absolute magnitude]]s can only be independently calibrated to an upper limit using size constraints from variability and an Eddington luminosity, it is likely that quasars are exhibiting differing luminosities that cannot necessarily be derived from such simplistic first principles. Arp, Burbidge, and others maintain that the scatter in these plots further supports the idea that quasars have a ''non-cosmological'' component to their redshift, but nearly everyone else in the field accepts that quasars have variable luminosity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burbidge, Hoyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arp 1998" /&gt; This stands in stark contradiction to the accepted models of [[galaxy formation]].

The biggest problem with Arp's analysis is that today there are hundreds of thousands of quasars with known redshifts discovered by various sky surveys. The vast majority of these quasars are not correlated in any way with nearby AGN. Indeed, with improved observing techniques, a number of host galaxies have been observed around quasars which indicates that those quasars at least really are at [[cosmological distances]] and are not the kind of objects Arp proposes.&lt;ref&gt;The first instance of observing the host galaxies around quasars was announced in 1983 by Gehren as published in the ''Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth Liege International Astrophysical Colloquium''. p. 489-493.&lt;/ref&gt; Arp's analysis, according to most scientists, suffers from being based on [[Hasty generalization|small number statistics]] and hunting for peculiar coincidences and odd associations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/science/space/halton-c-arp-astronomer-who-challenged-big-bang-theory-dies-at-86.html&lt;/ref&gt; Unbiased samples of sources, taken from numerous [[galaxy survey]]s of the sky show none of the proposed 'irregularities', nor that any [[statistically significant]] correlations exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0807.2641|title= Evidence against non-cosmological redshifts of QSOs in SDSS data|last1= Tang|first1= Sumin|author2= Shuang Nan Zhang|class= astro-ph|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is not clear what mechanism would be responsible for intrinsic redshifts or their gradual dissipation over time. It is also unclear how nearby quasars would explain some features in the spectrum of quasars which the standard model easily explains. In the standard cosmology, [[intergalactic medium|clouds of neutral hydrogen]] between the quasar and the [[earth]] create [[Lyman alpha]] [[absorption lines]] having different redshifts up to that of the quasar itself; this feature is called the [[Lyman-alpha forest]].  Moreover, in extreme quasars one can observe the absorption of neutral hydrogen which has not yet been [[reionization|reionized]] in a feature known as the [[Gunn–Peterson trough]]. Most cosmologists see this missing theoretical work as sufficient reason to explain the observations as either chance or error.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of mainstream cosmology's view of Arp's suggestions in this regard see Jones, H. ''What makes an astronomical controversy?'' ''Astronomy Now'' Vol. 19, No. 3, p. 58–61 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Halton Arp has proposed an explanation for his observations by a [[Mach's principle|Machian]] "variable mass hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ApJ...405...51N Flat Spacetime Cosmology: A unified framework for extragalactic redshifts in ''Astrophysical Journal'' by J Narlikar and H Arp]&lt;/ref&gt; The variable-mass theory invokes constant matter creation from active galactic nuclei, which puts it into the class of steady-state theories. With the passing of Halton Arp, this cosmology has been relegated to a dismissed theory.&lt;ref&gt;“When he died, he took a whole cosmology with him,” said Barry F. Madore, a senior research associate at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif. https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/science/space/halton-c-arp-astronomer-who-challenged-big-bang-theory-dies-at-86.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, [[Hannes Alfvén]] proposed a "plasma cosmology" theory of the universe based in part on [[plasma scaling|scaling]] observations of [[space physics|space plasma physics]] and experiments on [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in terrestrial laboratories to cosmological scales [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater.&lt;ref name=scaling&gt;Hannes Alfvén, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1983Ap%26SS..89..313A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=4521318e0206333 On hierarchical cosmology]" (1983) ''Astrophysics and Space Science'' (ISSN 0004-640X), vol. 89, no. 2, Jan. 1983, p. 313-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking [[CP-violation|matter–antimatter symmetry]] as a starting point, Alfvén together with [[Oskar Klein]] proposed the [[Plasma cosmology#Alfvén-Klein cosmology|Alfvén-Klein cosmology]] model, based on the fact that since most of the local universe was composed of [[matter]] and not [[antimatter]] there may be large bubbles of matter and antimatter that would globally balance to equality. The difficulties with this model were apparent almost immediately. Matter–antimatter [[annihilation]] results in the production of high energy [[photon]]s which were not observed. While it was possible that the local "matter-dominated" cell was simply larger than the [[observable universe]], this proposition did not lend itself to observational tests.

Like the [[steady state theory]], plasma cosmology includes a Strong Cosmological Principle which assumes that the universe is isotropic in time as well as in space. Matter is explicitly assumed to have always existed, or at least that it formed at a time so far in the past as to be forever beyond humanity's empirical methods of investigation.

While plasma cosmology has never had the support of most [[astronomers]] or [[physicists]], a small number of plasma researchers have continued to promote and develop the approach, and publish in the special issues of the IEEE [[Transactions on Plasma Science]].&lt;ref&gt;(See IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, issues in [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?db_key=AST&amp;db_key=PHY&amp;sim_query=YES&amp;ned_query=YES&amp;aut_logic=OR&amp;obj_logic=OR&amp;author=&amp;object=&amp;start_mon=12&amp;start_year=1986&amp;end_mon=12&amp;end_year=1986&amp;ttl_logic=OR&amp;title=&amp;txt_logic=OR&amp;text=&amp;nr_to_return=100&amp;start_nr=1&amp;jou_pick=ALL&amp;ref_stems=ITPS.&amp;data_and=ALL&amp;group_and=ALL&amp;start_entry_day=&amp;start_entry_mon=&amp;start_entry_year=&amp;end_entry_day=&amp;end_entry_mon=&amp;end_entry_year=&amp;min_score=&amp;sort=SCORE&amp;data_type=SHORT&amp;aut_syn=YES&amp;ttl_syn=YES&amp;txt_syn=YES&amp;aut_wt=1.0&amp;obj_wt=1.0&amp;ttl_wt=0.3&amp;txt_wt=3.0&amp;aut_wgt=YES&amp;obj_wgt=YES&amp;ttl_wgt=YES&amp;txt_wgt=YES&amp;ttl_sco=YES&amp;txt_sco=YES&amp;version=1 1986], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=1989&amp;isnumber=928 1989], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=1990&amp;isnumber=1720 1990], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=1992&amp;isnumber=5186 1992], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=2000&amp;isnumber=19507 2000], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isYear=2003&amp;isnumber=28301 2003], and 2007 Announcement [http://plasmascience.net/ieeetps/SpecialIssuesUpcoming/SpacePlasmas.html 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115503/http://plasmascience.net/ieeetps/SpecialIssuesUpcoming/SpacePlasmas.html |date=28 September 2007 }} here)&lt;/ref&gt; A few papers regarding plasma cosmology were published in other mainstream journals until the 1990s. Additionally, in 1991, [[Eric J. Lerner]], an independent researcher in [[plasma physics]] and nuclear fusion, wrote a popular-level book supporting plasma cosmology called ''The Big Bang Never Happened''. At that time there was renewed interest in the subject among the cosmological community along with other non-standard cosmologies. This was due to anomalous results reported in 1987 by Andrew Lange and Paul Richardson of UC Berkeley and Toshio Matsumoto of Nagoya University that indicated the cosmic microwave background might not have a [[blackbody spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Echo of the Big Bang|author=[[Michael Lemonick]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2003|pages=63–64|isbn=0-691-10278-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the final announcement (in April 1992) of COBE satellite data corrected the earlier contradiction of the Big Bang; the popularity of plasma cosmology has since fallen.

==Nucleosynthesis objections==
One of the major successes of the Big Bang theory has been to provide a [[prediction]] that corresponds to the observations of the abundance of light elements in the [[universe]]. Along with the explanation provided for the Hubble's law and for the cosmic microwave background, this observation has proved very difficult for alternative theories to explain.

Theories which assert that the universe has an infinite age, including many of the theories described above, fail to account for the abundance of deuterium in the cosmos, because deuterium easily undergoes nuclear fusion in stars and there are no known astrophysical processes other than the Big Bang itself that can produce it in large quantities. Hence the fact that deuterium is not an extremely rare component of the universe suggests that the universe has a finite age.

Theories which assert that the universe has a finite life, but that the Big Bang did not happen, have problems with the abundance of helium-4. The observed amount of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is far larger than the amount that should have been created via stars or any other known process. By contrast, the abundance of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He in Big Bang models is very insensitive to assumptions about baryon density, changing only a few percent as the baryon density changes by several orders of magnitude. The observed value of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is within the range calculated.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
'''Planned obsolescence''', or '''built-in obsolescence''', in industrial design and economics is a policy of planning or designing a [[good (economics)|product]] with an artificially limited useful life, so it will become [[obsolete]] (that is, unfashionable or no longer functional) after a certain period of time.&lt;ref name=bulow1986&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bulow |first=Jeremy |title=An Economic Theory of Planned Obsolescence |date=November 1986 |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=729–749 |jstor=1884176 |doi=10.2307/1884176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind the strategy is to generate long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases (referred to as "shortening the replacement cycle").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bidgoli |first1=Hossein |title=The Handbook of Technology Management, Supply Chain Management, Marketing and Advertising, and Global Management |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0470249482 |pages=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers that pursue this strategy believe that the additional sales revenue it creates more than offsets the additional costs of research and development, and offsets the [[opportunity cost]]s of repurposing an existing product line. In a competitive industry, this is a risky policy, because consumers may decide to buy from competitors instead if they notice the strategy.

Planned obsolescence tends to work best when a producer has at least an [[oligopoly]].&lt;ref name="orbach"&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Orbach, Barak |title= The Durapolist Puzzle: Monopoly Power in Durable-Goods Market |version= |publisher= Yale Journal on Regulation, vol. 21, pp. 67–118 |year= 2004 |ssrn= 496175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before introducing a planned obsolescence, the producer has to know that the consumer is at least somewhat likely to buy a replacement from them. In these cases of planned obsolescence, there is an [[information asymmetry]] between the producer, who knows how long the product was designed to last, and the consumer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jeremy|last1=Bulow|title=An Economic Theory of Planned Obsolescence|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/101/4/729/1840176|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=1 November 1986|issn=0033-5533|pages=729|volume=101|issue=4|doi=10.2307/1884176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Adam|last1=Hadhazy|accessdate=2018-07-13|title=Here’s the truth about the ‘planned obsolescence’ of tech|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160612-heres-the-truth-about-the-planned-obsolescence-of-tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when Japanese vehicles with longer lifespans entered the American market in the 1960s and 1970s, American carmakers were forced to respond by building more durable products.&lt;ref name=dickinson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dickinson |first1=Torry D. |last2=Schaeffer |first2=Robert K. |title=Fast Forward: Work, Gender, and Protest in a Changing World |date=2001 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-7425-0895-1 |pages=55–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origins of the phrase ==
[[File:1923 Chevrolet Superior Series B, National Road Transport Hall of Fame, 2015.JPG|thumb|The 1923 Chevrolet is cited as one of the earliest examples of annual facelifts in the car industry, because it had a restyled body covering what essentially was nine-year-old technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autonews.com/article/20080914/OEM02/309149950/annual-model-change-was-the-result-of-affluence-technology-advertising Annual model change was the result of affluence, technology, advertising]. Automotive News, September 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Alfred P. Sloan Jr.===
In the United States, [[automotive design]] reached a turning point in 1924 when the American national automobile market began reaching saturation. To maintain unit sales, [[General Motors]] head [[Alfred P. Sloan|Alfred P. Sloan Jr.]] suggested annual model-year design changes to convince car owners that they needed to buy a new replacement each year, an idea borrowed from the bicycle industry, though the concept is often misattributed to Sloan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Babaian |first=Sharon |title=The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada |date=1998 |publisher=National Museum of Science and Technology |location=Ottawa |isbn=0-660-91670-3 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics called his strategy "planned obsolescence". Sloan preferred the term "dynamic obsolescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Laura|last1=Grattan|title=Populism's Power: Radical Grassroots Democracy in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnJVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT116&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX2_nElZvcAhXyYt8KHSFnDMsQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dynamic+obsolescence+GM&amp;f=false|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=6 January 2016|isbn=9780190277659|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This strategy had far-reaching effects on the auto business, the field of product design, and eventually the American economy. The smaller players could not maintain the pace and expense of yearly re-styling. [[Henry Ford]] did not like the constant stream of model-year changes because he clung to an engineer's notions of simplicity, economies of scale, and design integrity. GM surpassed Ford's sales in 1931 and became the dominant company in the industry thereafter. The frequent design changes also made it necessary to use a [[body-on-frame]] rather than the lighter, but less easy to modify, [[unibody]] design used by most European automakers.

===Bernard London===
[[File:London (1932) Ending the depression through planned obsolescence.pdf|thumb|''Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence'', by [[Bernard London]], 1932]]
The origins of phrase ''planned obsolescence'' go back at least as far as 1932 with [[Bernard London]]'s pamphlet ''Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/London_(1932)_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf Bernard London's pamphlet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819154515/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/London_%281932%29_Ending_the_depression_through_planned_obsolescence.pdf |date=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of London's plan would have the government impose a legal obsolescence on consumer articles, to stimulate and perpetuate consumption.

===Brooks Stevens===
However, the phrase was first popularized in 1954 by [[Brooks Stevens]], an American industrial designer. Stevens was due to give a talk at an advertising conference in [[Minneapolis]] in 1954. Without giving it much thought, he used the term as the title of his talk. From that point on, "planned obsolescence" became Stevens' catchphrase. By his definition, planned obsolescence was "Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary."

===Volkswagen===
The phrase was quickly taken up by others, but Stevens' definition was challenged. By the late 1950s, ''planned obsolescence'' had become a commonly used term for products designed to break easily or to quickly go out of style. In fact, the concept was so widely recognized that in 1959 [[Volkswagen]] mocked it in an advertising campaign. While acknowledging the widespread use of planned obsolescence among automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen pitched itself as an alternative. "We do not believe in planned obsolescence", the ads suggested. "We don't change a car for the sake of change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80kEAAAAMBAJ |title=LIFE |last=Inc |first=Time |date=1959-08-03 |publisher=Time Inc |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228030304/https://books.google.com/books?id=80kEAAAAMBAJ |archivedate=February 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign by [[DDB Worldwide|Doyle Dane Bernbach]], one advert showed an almost blank page with the strapline "No point in showing the 1962 Volkswagen, it still looks the same".

===Vance Packard's ''The Waste Makers''===
In 1960, cultural critic [[Vance Packard]] published ''[[The Waste Makers]]'', promoted as an exposé of "the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals". Packard divided planned obsolescence into two sub categories:
* obsolescence of desirability; and
* obsolescence of function.

"Obsolescence of desirability", a.k.a. "psychological obsolescence", referred to marketers' attempts to wear out a product in the owner's mind. Packard quoted industrial designer [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]], who wrote: "Design... is an attempt to make a contribution through change. When no contribution is made or can be made, the only process available for giving the illusion of change is 'styling!'"

== Types ==

===Contrived durability===
Contrived durability is a strategy of shortening the product lifetime before it is released onto the market, by designing it to deteriorate quickly.&lt;ref name="orbach"/&gt; The design of all consumer products includes an expected average lifetime permeating all stages of development. Thus, it must be decided early in the design of a complex product how long it is designed to last so that each component can be made to those specifications. Since all matter is subject to [[entropy]], it is impossible for any designed object to retain its full function forever; all products will ultimately break down, no matter what steps are taken. While it is known that products are optimized to match their required lifespan, such designs are often chosen for cost or weight saving reasons. Limited lifespan is only a sign of planned obsolescence if the lifespan of the product is made artificially short by design.

The strategy of contrived durability is generally not prohibited by law, and manufacturers are free to set the durability level of their products.&lt;ref name="orbach"/&gt;

A possible method of limiting a product's durability is to use inferior materials in critical areas, or suboptimal component layouts which cause excessive wear. Using soft metal in screws and cheap plastic instead of metal in stress-bearing components will increase the speed at which a product will become inoperable through normal usage and make it prone to breakage from even minor forms of abnormal usage. For example, small, brittle plastic gears in [[toy]]s are extremely prone to damage if the toy is played with roughly, which can easily destroy key functions of the toy and force the purchase of a replacement. The short life expectancy of smartphones and other handheld electronics is a result of constant usage, fragile batteries, and the ability to easily damage them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/life-expectancy-smartphone-62979.html |title=Life Expectancy of a Smartphone |access-date=2017-05-27 |language=en |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325021121/http://smallbusiness.chron.com/life-expectancy-smartphone-62979.html |archivedate=March 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of repairs===
[[File:IPhone 6s - Lightning connector with pentalobe screws-92677.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pentalobe screw]]s used in an [[iPhone 6S]]. Critics have argued that Apple's use of pentalobe screws in their newer devices is an attempt to prevent the consumer from repairing the device themselves.]]
The ultimate examples of such design are single-use versions of traditionally [[durable goods]], such as [[disposable camera]]s, where the customer must purchase an entire new product after using them a single time. Such products are often designed to be impossible to service; for example, a cheap "throwaway" digital watch may have a casing which is simply sealed in the factory, with no designed ability for the user to access the interior without destroying the watch entirely.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  Manufacturers may make replacement parts either unavailable or so expensive that it makes the product uneconomic to repair, for example [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printers]] made by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] incorporate a print head which eventually fails, however the high cost of a replacement forces the owner to scrap the entire device.

Other products may also contain design features meant to frustrate repairs, such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] "[[Tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]]" [[pentalobe screw]]s that cannot easily be removed with common consumer tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/01/apple-screwing-new-iphones-out-of-simple-diy-repair/ |title=Apple "screwing" new iPhones out of simple DIY repair |last=Foresman |first=Chris |date=January 20, 2011 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=January 28, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514171627/http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/01/apple-screwing-new-iphones-out-of-simple-diy-repair/ |archivedate=May 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Front loading [[washing machine]]s often have the drum [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] - a critical and wear-prone mechanical component  - permanently molded into the wash tub, making it impossible to renew without replacing the entire tub. The cost of this repair may exceed the residual value of the appliance, forcing it to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poulter |first1=Sean |title=Washing machines 'cheaper to replace than fix': Manufacturers accused of making appliances too costly and complicated to repair |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3130577/Washing-machines-cheaper-replace-fix-Manufacturers-accused-making-appliances-costly-complicated-repair.html |website=Daily Mail Online |accessdate=18 October 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019012512/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3130577/Washing-machines-cheaper-replace-fix-Manufacturers-accused-making-appliances-costly-complicated-repair.html |archivedate=October 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Daniel R.|last2=Skelton|first2=Alexandra C.

According to Kyle Wiens, co-founder of an online repair community, a possible goal for such design is to make the cost of [[Maintenance, repair and operations|repairs]] comparable to the replacement cost, or to prevent any form of servicing of the product at all. In 2012, Toshiba was criticized for issuing [[cease-and-desist]] letters to the owner of a website that hosted its copyrighted repair manuals, to the detriment of the independent and home repair market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/cease-and-desist-manuals-planned-obsolescence/ |title=The Shady World of Repair Manuals: Copyrighting for Planned Obsolescence |first=Kyle |last=Wiens |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327192009/http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/cease-and-desist-manuals-planned-obsolescence/ |archivedate=March 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some products contain [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] that are not user-replaceable after they have worn down. While such a design can help make the device thinner, it can also make it difficult to replace the battery without sending the entire device away for repairs or purchasing a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/mar/03/has-planned-obsolesence-had-its-day-design End of the line for stuff that's built to die?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023171156/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/mar/03/has-planned-obsolesence-had-its-day-design |date=October 23, 2016 }}. The Guardian. March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived obsolescence===
Obsolescence of desirability or stylistic obsolescence occurs when designers change the styling of products so customers will purchase products more frequently due to the decrease in the perceived desirability of unfashionable items.

Many products are primarily desirable for aesthetic rather than functional reasons. An obvious example of such a product is clothing. Such products experience a cycle of desirability referred to as a "fashion cycle". By continually introducing new aesthetics, and retargeting or discontinuing older designs, a manufacturer can "ride the fashion cycle", allowing for constant sales despite the original products remaining fully functional. [[Sneakers]] are popular fashion industry where this is prevalent - [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Max]] line of running shoes is a prime example where a single model of shoe is often produced for years, but the color and material combination ("colorway") is changed every few months, or different colorways are offered in different markets.  This has the upshot of ensuring constant demand for the product, even though it remains fundamentally the same.

To a more limited extent this is also true of some consumer electronic products, where manufacturers will release slightly updated products at regular intervals and emphasize their value as [[status symbol]]s.

===Systemic obsolescence===

Planned systemic obsolescence is the deliberate attempt to make a product obsolete by altering the system in which it is used in such a way as to make its continued use difficult. Common examples of planned systemic obsolescence include not accommodating [[forward compatibility]] in software, or routinely changing screws or fasteners so that they cannot easily be operated on with existing tools.

This approach was employed by [[Samsung]] in the case of the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 7]]. This device was recalled due to [[Samsung Galaxy Note 7#Battery faults|battery defects]] that caused several units to catch fire or explode. There are several holdouts, however, with people refusing to send the device back and these constituted 4 percent of close to 2 million total devices sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/27/samsung-galaxy-note-7-rebels-who-refuse-the-recall.html|title=Meet the die-hards who refuse to give up their recalled Samsung Note 7 phones|last=Balakrishnan|first=Anita|date=2017-01-27|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-software-update-kill-smartphone/|title=As Samsung kills Note 7s, some users won't let go of phone|last=|first=|date=January 5, 2017|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this and avoid more cases of overheating devices, the South Korean company began rolling out software updates for the Note 7 that throttled its functionalities. The final update landed on December 19, 2016, with an update that prevented the batteries from charging, effectively [[Brick (electronics)|bricking]] the phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-12/11/c_135897117.htm|title=Samsung to obsolete Galaxy Note 7 with software update for safety reasons - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2016|website=www.xinhuanet.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmed obsolescence===

In some cases, notification may be combined with the deliberate disabling of a product to prevent it from working, thus requiring the buyer to purchase a replacement. For example, inkjet printer manufacturers employ [[Inkjet printing#Business model|smart chips in their ink cartridges]] to prevent them from being used after a certain threshold (number of pages, time, etc.), even though the cartridge may still contain usable ink or could be refilled (with ink toners, up to 50 percent of the toner cartridge is often still full&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;RTBF documentary "L'obsolescence programmée" by Xavier Vanbuggenhout&lt;/ref&gt;). This constitutes "programmed obsolescence", in that there is no random component contributing to the decline in function. 

In the Jackie Blennis v. HP class action suit, it was claimed that [[Hewlett Packard]] designed certain inkjet printers and cartridges to shut down on an undisclosed expiration date, and at this point consumers were prevented from using the ink that remained in the expired cartridge. HP denied these claims, but agreed to discontinue the use of certain messages, and to make certain changes to the disclosures on its website and packaging, as well as compensating affected consumers with a total credit of up to $5,000,000 for future purchases from HP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hpinkjetprintersettlement.com|title=HP Inkjet Printer Settlement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are some [[workaround]]s for users, for instance, that will more than double the life of the printer that has stopped with a message to replace the imaging drum.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Samsung-CLP-365-Laser-Printer-DIY-Imaging-Drum-Uni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013080601/http://www.instructables.com/id/Samsung-CLP-365-Laser-Printer-DIY-Imaging-Drum-Uni/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{Further|Waste hierarchy}}
Estimates of planned obsolescence can influence a company's decisions about [[product engineering]]. Therefore, the company can use the least expensive components that satisfy [[product lifetime]] projections.

Also, for industries, planned obsolescence stimulates demand by encouraging purchasers/putting them under pressure to buy sooner if they still want a functioning product. These products can be bought from the same manufacturer (a replacement part or a newer model), or from a [[Competition (economics)|competitor]] who might also rely on planned obsolescence. Especially in developed countries (where many industries already face a [[Market saturation|saturated market]]), this technique is often necessary for producers to maintain their level of revenue.

While planned obsolescence is appealing to producers, it can also do significant harm to the society in the form of negative [[externalities]]. Continuously replacing products, rather than repairing them, creates more waste and pollution, uses more natural resources, and results in more [[consumer spending]]. Planned obsolescence can thus have a negative impact on the environment in aggregate. Even when planned obsolescence might help to save scarce resources per unit produced, it tends to increase output in aggregate, since due to laws of [[supply and demand]] decreases in cost and price will eventually result in increases in demand and consumption. However, the negative environmental impacts of planned obsolescence are dependent also on the process of production.&lt;ref name=Guiltinan2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guiltinan |first=Joseph Guiltinan |title=Creative Destruction and Destructive Creations: Environmental Ethics and Planned Obsolescence |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=2009 |volume=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the potential backlash of consumers who learn that the manufacturer invested money to make the product obsolete faster; such consumers might turn to a producer (if any exists) that offers a more durable alternative.

==Regulation==
In 2015, as part of a larger movement against planned obsolescence across the European Union, France has passed legislation requiring that appliance manufacturers and vendors declare the intended product [[service life|lifespan]]s, and to inform consumers how long [[spare part]]s for a given product will be produced. From 2016, appliance manufacturers are required to repair or replace, free of charge, any defective product within two years from its original purchase date. This effectively creates a mandatory two-year [[warranty]].&lt;ref name="sgs"&gt;Drew Prindle. [http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/france-planned-obsolescence-law/ New French law tells consumers how long new appliances will last] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201102006/http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/france-planned-obsolescence-law/ |date=February 1, 2016 }}. Digitaltrends. March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics and supporters==
[[File:Kotler-DSC_0510.jpg|thumb|Marketing writer [[Philip Kotler]]]]
Shortening the replacement cycle has critics and supporters.

[[Philip Kotler]] argues that: "Much so-called planned obsolescence is the working of the competitive and technological forces in a free society—forces that lead to ever-improving goods and services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned obsolescence |publisher=The Economists |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13354332 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207162419/http://www.economist.com/node/13354332 |archivedate=December 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics such as [[Vance Packard]] claim the process is wasteful and exploits customers. With psychological obsolescence, resources are used up making changes, often cosmetic changes, that are not of great value to the customer. Miles Park advocates new and collaborative approaches between the designer and the consumer to challenge obsolescence in fast-moving sectors such as consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;Park, M. (2010). "Defying Obsolescence." In Cooper T (ed) Longer Lasting Products: Alternatives to the Throwaway Society. Gower, Farnham, UK.".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people, such as Ronny Balcaen, have proposed to create a new label to counter the diminishing quality of products due to the planned obsolescence technique.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;

==In software ==
Software companies sometimes deliberately drop support for older technologies as a calculated attempt to force users to purchase new products to replace those made obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Idea: Planned obsolescence |date=March 25, 2009 |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13354332 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515215713/http://www.economist.com/node/13354332 |archivedate=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[proprietary software]] will ultimately reach an [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] point - usually because the cost of support exceeds the revenue generated by supporting the old version -  at which the supplier will cease updates and support. As [[free software]] and [[open source software]] can always be updated and maintained by somebody else, the user is not at the sole mercy of a proprietary vendor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassia |first=Fernando |title=Open Source, the only weapon against 'planned obsolescence' |date=March 28, 2007 |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |accessdate=August 2, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420223957/http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |archivedate=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software which is abandoned by the manufacturer with regard to manufacturer support is sometimes called ''[[abandonware]]''.

== In academia ==
[[Russell Jacoby]], writing in the 1970s, observes that intellectual production has succumbed to the same pattern of planned obsolescence used by manufacturing enterprises to generate ever-renewed demand for their products.

{{quote|The application of planned obsolescence to thought itself has the same merit as its application to consumer goods; the new is not only shoddier than the old, it fuels an obsolete social system that staves off its replacement by manufacturing the illusion that it is perpetually new.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Jacoby]], ''Social Amnesia'' (1975), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Camille Paglia]] characterizes contemporary academic discourse influenced by French theorists such as [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[Derrida]], and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] as the academic equivalent of name brand consumerism. "Lacan, Derrida, and Foucault," she says, "are the academic equivalents of BMW, Rolex, and Cuisinart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paglia |first=Camille |year=1991 |title=Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders: Academe in the Hour of the Wolf |journal=Arion: A Journal of Humanities and the Classics |series=Third Series |volume=1 |number=2 |issn=0095-5809 |jstor=20163474 |p=186 &lt;!--139-212--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the inspiration of the latest academic fashions, academic planned obsolescence is to manufacture content with little merit for the same reason fashion designers come out with new fashions.

==Future ==
{{one_source|section|date=July 2015}}

Planned obsolescence has been assumed a necessity when it comes to stimulating consumption; however, this practice has come into question. In 2015 the French Parliament ruled and further established a fine of up to 300,000 euros and jail terms of up to two years for those manufacturers planning the death of their products in advance. The  rule is not only relevant because of the sanctions that it establishes but also because it is the first time that a legislature openly recognizes the existence of planned obsolescence. These techniques may include "a deliberate introduction of a flaw, a weakness, a scheduled stop, a technical limitation, incompatibility or other obstacles for repair", reads the text regarding what may be considered as planned obsolescence.

The European Union is also beginning to address this problem. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), an advisory body of the EU,&lt;ref&gt;European Economic and Social Committee. retrieved June 7, 2016 from {{cite web|url=http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.the-committee |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620235955/http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.the-committee |archivedate=June 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced in 2013 that it was studying "a total ban on planned obsolescence". It said replacing products that are designed to stop working within two or three years of their purchase was a waste of energy and resources and generated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;The EESC calls for a total ban on planned obsolescence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9707">'''Les Rencontres Trans Musicales''' (generally referred to as ''Les Transmusicales de Rennes'') is a music festival that lasts for 3 or 4 days. It is held annually in December. The festival takes place in [[Rennes]], [[Brittany]], France.
Since the festival's beginning, it has been renowned for revealing the "next big thing" in music.
The festival has become one of the most significant musical events in Europe, attracting over 62,000 people in 2013. It attracted over 80 groups and artists from over 26 nationalities and music industry professionals coming from all continents.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2014/12/03/03006-20141203ARTFIG00323-les-trans-musicales-revelateur-de-talents.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical ==

Les Rencontres Trans Musicales, often called ''Les Trans'', was created in 1979 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2014/12/03/03006-20141203ARTFIG00323-les-trans-musicales-revelateur-de-talents.php&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Béatrice Macé]], [[Jean-Louis Brossard]], [[Hervé Bordier]] (until 1996), [[Jean-René]] (until 1989), and other music students. The association was initially in debt, which led to programming a benefit concert. The first concert took place in la salle de la Cité in June. Twelve bands performed on two nights to an audience of approximately 1800 people. The second concert was in December 2013. 
Jean-Louis Brossard is the artistic director and Sandrine Poutrel is the production manager. Jean-Louis Brossard and Béatrice Macé together lead Les Rencontres Trans Musicales. From the first concerts, before the word ‘festival’ had been attached to the event, the artistic bias of the line up was toward originality and new artistic forms. The artists who participated in the festival would often rise to the top of the music charts within a few months following their performance. [[Björk]], [[Ben Harper]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]] all performed for the first time in public in the festival. It is considered that the festival boosted the popularity of [[Étienne Daho]], [[Arno (singer)|Arno]], [[Stephan Eicher]], [[Les Négresses Vertes]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Bérurier Noir]], [[Denez Prigent]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Amadou &amp; Mariam]], [[Birdy Nam Nam]], [[Justice]], [[Fugees]], [[Stromae]], [[London Grammar]] and many other bands.

In 2004, the festival moved to the Parc Expo, close to [[Rennes Saint-Jacques Airport|Rennes Bretagne Airport]]. Some concerts are still organized in the town of Rennes.  In 2004, the festival moved to the Parc Expo
Since 1979, TRANS has shown the ability to capture the musical zeitgeist and to maintain with it a combination of discovery and influence.
TRANS exported itself to China, Norway, Czech Republic and Russia. On December 8, 2010, l'Association des Trans Musicales launched a website that recounts the history of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memoires-de-trans.com/ (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trans Musicales made it clear from the first edition, in June 1979, and their philosophy never changed:
* Reflect the reality of musical life
* Showcase emerging artists
* Find and promote artistic originality
* Help fulfill all the necessary conditions for experimentation

== The International Trans project ==

The international work has been going on since the end of the 1980s.
Turned towards research and exploration of musical movements and where they originate, the programming puts us in touch with artists, labels, editors and agents on all continents. On the other hand, the Trans collaboration with foreign media and professionals is strong and continuous.
Since the 2001 edition, the International Trans project consolidates and extends their work overseas, in partnership with [[Cultures France]], a governmental operator on all international actions.
The project was conceived as a way to extend the collaboration with the artists beyond the time span of a single edition. The line-up included bands that have performed or are about to perform the Trans in Rennes; they are joined by local artists.

=== Previous actions ===

==== Expo 2002 ====
The Trans Musicales team programmed two evenings at the Cargo, in Neuchâtel, for the Expo.

==== Trans/Ubu/Bato Fou ====
In March 2003 two evenings and two residencies opposing Dj Morpheus vs. El Diabolo (Réunion) and Dj Buddha vs. Tamm Ha Tamm (Réunion).

==== Norway 2005 ====
During the festival, By-Larm, one evening in honour of Rennes and one improvised concert at the top of a glacier.

==== Beijing ====
18 and 19 June 2005 at Chaoyang Park. A huge stage, 16 artists in front of 16 000 spectators for the first open air festival in the Chinese capital.

==== Russia ====
In 2010, concerts took place in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Hip-Hop, jazz and electronic music were the main events.

== Trans on Tour ==
Co-produced by the association Trans Musicales, Trans on Tour offers for the ninth year in a row, the opportunity for local bands to perform in the venues of the Great West.
Kick-starting the festival, the main aim of this tour is to assist artists in developing their professionalism. The high point of this tour is a performance at the Trans Musicales for each participating band. The aim is to challenge aspiring artists with a stream of events requiring total immersion in a professional framework.
Being on tour means many concert dates, in this case ending with a performance at a festival visited by professionals: this project is a life-size rehearsal for the life of a professional performer.
Trans on Tour, conceived first as a boost to the local artistic scene, offers a wide range of tools to the bands: interviews at the beginning and the end of the tour, working time on the stage of the Ubu (local stage in [[Rennes]]), a regular follow-up by a specialised team, a promotional video and a dedicated stand at the festival's Village.
During this tour with its twenty bands - out of which eight are on an accompaniment program – each concert concludes with the performance of an artist recommended by the host venue.

'''SpaceX CRS-19''', also known as '''SpX-19''', is a [[Commercial Resupply Services|Commercial Resupply Service mission]] to the [[International Space Station]] currently manifested to be launched on November 2019.&lt;ref name=pietrobon /&gt; The mission was contracted by [[NASA]] and is flown by [[SpaceX]].

==Launch schedule history==
On February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions ([[SpaceX CRS-16|CRS-16]] to [[SpaceX CRS-20|CRS-20]]).&lt;ref name=sn-20160224spxwinsaddlcrs1 /&gt; In June 2016, a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for December 2018.&lt;ref name=nasaaig-2016025 /&gt; {{asof|2018|11}}, this had been pushed back to November 2019.&lt;ref name="pietrobon" /&gt;

==Primary payload==
NASA has contracted for the CRS-19 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and [[orbital elements|orbital parameters]] for the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] [[space capsule]]. According to a 2018 press release, the external payload manifested for this flight is the [[NanoRacks]] [[Bishop Airlock Module]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nanoracks.com/nanoracks-adds-thales-alenia-space-to-airlock/ |title=NanoRacks adds Thales Alenia Space to team up on Space Station Airlock Module |publisher=NanoRacks |date=4 February 2018 |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spraoi''' (pron. "spree") is a festival of international street theatre and world music which takes place for three days each August in the Irish city of [[Waterford]]. The festival takes its name from the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] word ''spraoi'', or ''play''. The Waterford Spraoi has taken place each summer since 1992 and is now the largest festival event in Waterford. The main activity is centred on two main stages located in the John Roberts Square and William Vincent Wallace Plaza where various acts have been hosted including the [[Royal Drummers of Burundi]] and the [[Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain]], as well as  more contemporary bands and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverireland.ie/Search-Results/Details.aspx?touristItemID=748 2010 Spraoi page] on [[Discover Ireland]] tourism guide&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spraoi is a professional event that is also  supported by more than 300 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volunteeringireland.ie/page.php?id=67 Spraoi] on [[Volunteering Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival attracts audiences of over 80,000 to see events in music, art installations, storytelling, circus skills workshops, science and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munster-express.ie/entertainment/theatre/spraoi-unveils-its-2010-programme/ Spraoi unveils its 2010 programme], [[Munster Express]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toilet Revolution'''({{zh|s=厕所革命}}) is a campaign in [[China]] aiming at improving the sanitary conditions in [[Mainland China]]. In 2015, [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], announced that China is going to improve the sanitary conditions in tourist attractions, which once complained by foreign travelers. During 2015 to 2017, over 68,000  [[public toilet]]s were reconstructed in China. In 2017, a re-construction to other 64,000 public toilets was planned.&lt;ref name=Cheang2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/chinas-toilet-revolution-will-give-domestic-tourism-boost-xi-says.html|title=Toilet revolution': China has its sight set on reforming its bathrooms|publisher=CNBC|author=Cheang Ming|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong2017&gt;{{cite web|author=Maggie Hiufu Wong|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/china-toilet-revolution/index.html|title=China to get extreme toilet makeover to boost tourism|publisher=CNN|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shikun Cheng|author2=etal|title=Toilet revolution in China|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.09.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, The campaign was expanded. The authorities are going to improve the poor sanitary conditions in rural area in China. State Media in China says that the poor sanitary conditions in rural area contribute to spreading of diseases like [[malaria]] and the campaign is aiming at solve such problems.&lt;ref name=CD2017&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.chinadaily.com.cn/2017-11/29/content_35121846.htm|title=习近平：农村也要来个"厕所革命"(Xi Jinping: Toilet Revolution should also be unfolded in rural area)|publisher=中国日报([[China Daily]])|year=2017|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Israel, 37 claimed that he videotaped alleged "small balls of light dancing frenetically in the evening sky over his Silver St neighborhood, Carmela Homes IV in Las Piñas on Sept. 3, 2000." The shouts of Israel’s neighbors can be heard on the video footage as the sight made them gasp in awe and disbelief. Israel claimed that the UFOs were also seen by a nearby [[barangay]], and possibly residents of [[Parañaque City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://farshores.org/ufolaspi.htm "Farshores UFO Dimensions: Incident At Las Piñas"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516070650/http://farshores.org/ufolaspi.htm |date=May 16, 2008 }}. Retrieved November 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2004 Las Piñas UFO incident ==

More than 10 UFOs were seen in [[Las Piñas]] at around 7 p.m. Saturday, August 28, 2004. Three children noticed two unusual reddish-etheric glares moving above some partly cloudy skies from their residence in Mabolo St., Verdant Acres, Pamplona, Las Piñas City.

The first object they saw headed east to where the moon sits around that time. Another two emerged and three more objects appeared from the western horizon. "These unusual objects could not be mere airplanes because two of them were already pretty close to the moon," exclaimed 11-year-old Nica Canarias as she apparently had the impression that the objects were heading to the moon.

Nica, the eldest in the Canarias siblings and one of the early witnesses, immediately called her nine-year-old friend Adrian Israel. Adrian - whom the Canarias knew as a UFO experiencer is the son of Antonio (Tony) Israel, who took video footage of UFOs above the Las Piñas skies back on September 3, 2000.

Adrian confirmed that these objects were similar to those he saw four years ago. So he rushed back to his house and prompted his older brothers, who then told their father Tony.

Tony rushed outside with his video camera. He was joined by his neighbors who watched while the objects moved erratically, jerking, floating and jumping in various directions.

From 7:30 to 8:15pm, Israel was shooting videos of at least five UFOs - each emerging from the horizon at time intervals of approximately eight minutes.

Israel told [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] that he was now more composed in aiming his video camera at the subjects compared to his first encounter. He added, "I learned a big lesson from the previous investigations made by the [[PAGASA]] UFO Investigating Team (Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration) and from criticisms telling that in my first UFO encounter, the video lacked panning that’s why there was no referential point to approximate size and distance. So from this chance, I think I panned well-enough and a probable estimation of the objects' altitude and size could be established."&lt;ref&gt;TV PATROL-ABS-CBN News (August 30, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2011 Bulacan UFO incident==
A couple of UFOs were seen in [[Bulacan]] in the first week of May. But it disappeared and never seen. On May 27, people caught a sight of two UFOs in the middle of the night. Same as the September 2000 UFO sightings, it was red and large like a basketball. Some people said that one of them was at the east and the other at the west, colliding each other and then disappeared.

==Cavite sightings==
There were UFO sightings in [[Cavite]] in 2011.

Another sighting occurred on May 16, 2018. Witness said he saw two luminous light which came from a distant star. It looked like it left the star and followed what seems like a diagonal route according to the witness.
Unfortunately, no other person saw the phenomena thus, no one can confirm what the witness said.

== Alleged "UFO" sighted in Pampanga ==
The alleged "UFO" was sighted on evening of April 26, 2015 was quickly circulated across the Facebook. The video shows the motionless lights was apparently floating in the sky. According to the person who took the video, while they in Lubao-Pampanga diversion road, they notice that the lights later formed a letter "V". At first, they only saw three lights until the lights are appeared seven more. Later, the lights vanishes a little bit. The next morning, they returned to the area where the lights appeared in the sky; there is no buildings situated in this area. The video was shown by [[PAGASA]], according to them, they estimate about 800–1000 meters high from the ground. Also, PAGASA states that is impossible that the lights coming from the airplane, hot air balloon, or drones due to its size of the lights. The lights appeared in 5–8 minutes based on the concept of eyewitnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygML-DAMgLE "UFO" sighted in Pampanga] uploaded on April 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Untied Aid'''
is assistance given to developing countries which can be used to purchase goods and services in virtually all countries.&lt;ref&gt; “Untied aid,”&lt;u&gt;OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 18 July 2007 &lt;http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=2817&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is contrasted with [[tied aid]] which stipulates that goods and services bought with it can only be purchased from the donor country or from a limited selection of countries.&lt;ref&gt; “Tied aid credits,” OECD Glossary of Statistical Terms&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 18 July 2007 &lt;http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3089&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for using untied aid==
One of the main arguments in favour of untied aid is that [[tied aid]] can create important [[distortions]] in the market by limiting the number of countries where the recipient can make purchases. These limitations impede the recipient country’s ability to find the most cost-effective way to spend the aid they receive. It is estimated that goods and services purchased with tied aid cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with untied aid. Furthermore, tied aid often favours capital-intensive goods and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise. That may lead recipient countries to make purchases which are inappropriate for realising their development goals.

In addition, the administration of tied aid requires larger bureaucracies in both the donor and recipient countries. Untying aid would presumably give recipient countries greater freedom to choose how they spend their resources, focusing on the goods and services they need most and allowing them to purchase from the most cost-effective sources. Untying aid would allow it to be more efficiently employed, effectively increasing its value.&lt;ref&gt; “Untying aid to the Least Developed Countries,” OECD Policy Brief, &lt;u&gt;OECD Observer&lt;/u&gt; July 2001, OECD.org, 18 July 2007 &lt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/24/2002959.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!----------------End of Infobox----&gt;'''Ward Hill Lamon''' (January 6, 1828 – May 7, 1893) was a personal friend and self-appointed [[bodyguard]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Lamon was famously absent the night [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln was assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theatre]] on April 14, 1865, having been sent by Lincoln to [[Richmond, Virginia]].

==Background==
Lamon's relation with Lincoln has been traced by Clint Clay Tilton in ''Lincoln and Lamon''. Lamon was born near [[Winchester, Virginia]], studied medicine for two years, and moved to [[Danville, Illinois]], when he was 19 to live with relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, Clint Clay: "Lincoln and Lamon: Partners and Friends," ''Publication of the Illinois State Historical Library'', page 175. Phillips Brothers State Printers, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Louisville]] to receive his law degree and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Hamand, L: "Lincoln's Particular Friend," ''Essays in Illinois History'', page 19. Southern Illinois University Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, he moved back to Virginia, married Angelina Turner, and then returned to [[Illinois]] to practice law. Angelina was a daughter of Ehud and Priscilla Strode Turner, whose house at [[Beddington, West Virginia]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002 as the [[Priscilla Strode Turner House]].&lt;ref name="dhr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/berkeley/02001527.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Priscilla Strode Turner House|date=June 2002|accessdate=2011-06-02 |author=Geoffrey B. Henry and Jared N. Tuk|publisher=State of West Virginia, West Virginia Division of Culture and History, Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelina died in April 1859, leaving a daughter, Dorothy, who was raised in Danville by Lamon's sister, Mrs. William Morgan.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1860, Lamon married Sally Logan, daughter of Judge Stephen T. Logan.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Logan had been Lincoln's law partner from 1851 to 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, S: "Logan, Stephen Trigg, ''American National Biography Online'' http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00636.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years with Lincoln==
Lamon's professional association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting attorney for the Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to [[Bloomington, Illinois]], in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, pages 178-9, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860.  Lincoln was up against [[New York (state)|New York]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters.&lt;ref&gt;"I Beg Leave to Offer. . . Abraham Lincoln", ''The New York Times'', May 15, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lincoln was elected President, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post, but received a letter from his friend that said, "Dear Hill, I need you.  I want you to go to Washington with me and be prepared for a long stay." &lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lamon then accompanied him as he traveled from [[Springfield, Illinois]], to [[Washington D.C.]] in February 1861.  This trip would prove to be eventful.

==Lamon and the Baltimore Plot, 1861==
{{Main|Baltimore Plot}}
Lamon was a physically imposing man, and during the presidency, often took it upon himself to guard Lincoln. In February 1861, detective [[Allan Pinkerton]] uncovered a plot whereby Lincoln would be assassinated when he arrived in [[Baltimore]] on his way to his inauguration in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  Pinkerton advised Lincoln that rather than ride publicly through the city between train stations as planned, he should take a midnight train straight through to Washington.   Lamon was the sole friend chosen to accompany him.

Lamon and Pinkerton famously clashed over the President-elect's protection. Lamon offered Lincoln "a Revolver and a Bowie Knife" but Pinkerton protested that he "would not for the world have it said that Mr. Lincoln had to enter the national Capital armed".&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbert, N: ''Lincoln and the Baltimore Plot, 1861'', page 79.  Huntington Library, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two men further disagreed over Lamon's desire to alert the ''Chicago Journal'' to their early arrival in Washington because Pinkerton, more prudently, wished not to publicize their change of plans.  In Pinkerton's account of the plot, he wrote disparagingly of Lamon, referring to him as a "brainless, egotistical fool".&lt;ref&gt;Cuthbert, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinkerton allowed [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]] to copy his report, which was obtained by Lamon when he purchased Herndon's papers to write his ''Life of Abraham Lincoln''.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, J: ''Allan Pinkerton: The First Detective'', page 104.  John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Herndon first requested copies of Pinkerton's report, Pinkerton agreed only on the condition that certain material be kept confidential, specifically naming his remarks about Lamon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, D. and Davis R: ''Herndon's Informants'', page 264.  University of Illinois Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamon's description detailed the manipulations of Pinkerton.  Months before Lincoln traveled through Baltimore, Samuel M. Felton, president of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]], had hired Pinkerton.  There was unemployment in Baltimore. It is conceivable that Felton's security concerns may have been about workers destroying bridges to create jobs for themselves and that homeless persons were living near railroad facilities.

Pinkerton began an entrapment scheme by opening an office in Baltimore.  Pinkerton publicized his duplicity and attracted dissatisfied elements.  Lamon asserts that the motive of Pinkerton was to increase the demand for his service and profits.  Pinkerton's agents were reputed to frequent bars and [[brothel]]s to utilize local information sources.  Barr's saloon on South Street was one of the bars they patronized.  The agents established that intemperate persons were not modulating their speech about politics while drinking with the targets of their investigation.  Informants were paid money.

There were disputes among the power brokers accompanying Lincoln on his journey to Washington as to who had more common sense or the most courage to assist the President-elect.  Pinkerton, accompanied by a female spy, met Lincoln in Philadelphia on 21 February and advised him of the need for increased security because he heard credible stories from intoxicated sources.  In the coded messages of Pinkerton's operatives, apparently the female spy was "Plums" and Lincoln was "Nuts".

Lincoln was secreted through Baltimore during the night.  The train carrying Mrs. Lincoln and others went through Baltimore unharmed the next day, despite the claim of Pinkerton that hand grenades and fire bombs would be used to attack the train.&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, Ward Hill. ''The Life of Abraham Lincoln: His Birth to His Inauguration as President''. Boston, MA: James R. Osgood and Company, 1872, pp. 511-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamon summed up his disbelief in the plot in the biography:  "It is perfectly manifest that there was no conspiracy, – no conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of three; no definite purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr. Lincoln in Baltimore."&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, W., ''Life of Abraham Lincoln'', page  513.  James R. Osgood and Company, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lamon as U.S. Marshal and his relationship with Lincoln 1861–1865==
Shortly after his inauguration in 1861, Lincoln appointed Lamon [[United States Marshal]] of the [[District of Columbia]]; he resigned his commission in June 1865. One of Lamon's first acts as Marshal was to visit [[Fort Sumter]], [[South Carolina]] in March 1861, to meet with [[Major Robert Anderson]], commander of the fort, and [[Francis Pickens|Governor Francis Pickens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmarshals.gov/history/lincoln/lincoln_and_his_marshal.htm|title=U.S. Marshals Service|first=U.S. Marshals Service|last=(USMS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports vary on Lamon's responsibilities with regard to that visit.

One account chronicles that Lamon was just one of a few emissaries sent by Lincoln, the first being [[Gustavus Fox|Captain Gustavus Fox]], who went to determine if Fort Sumter could be relieved by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Oedel, H: "Lincoln Takes the Pulse of the Confederacy at Charleston in March, 1861," page 158. ''Lincoln Herald'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lamon was sent concurrently with another Illinois friend of Lincoln's, [[Stephen Hurlbut]], with the implication that Lamon was sent to take the focus off of Hurlbut's visit as Hurlbut was there to measure anti-Union sentiment in Charleston (he discovered it was high).&lt;ref&gt;Oedel, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lamon incurred Lincoln's displeasure by meeting with Governor Pickens and informing him of the government's interest in withdrawing from Fort Sumter.&lt;ref&gt;Oedel, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account represents Lamon as traveling with the full confidence of Lincoln: "It called for courage and the trip was made over the objection of Secretary Seward. 'Mr. Secretary,' said Lincoln, 'I have known to be in many a close place and he's never been in one he didn't get out of.  By Jing.  I'll risk it.  Go, Lamon, and God bless you.'"&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another account characterizes Lamon as being under Seward's influence and angering Lincoln:  "It was under Seward's influence that he actually told Governor Pickens that he had come to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison, and that after his return he wrote the governor that he would be back in a few days to assist with the evacuation.  He also gave Major Anderson the impression that no relief would be attempted.  All this was outrageous, and when Lincoln heard of Lamon's letter to Pickens, he indignantly denied that the man possessed any authority to make such a statement."&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, A. ''The War for the Union'', page 54. Scribner, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  Missions to Fort Sumter aside, the marshal's position was not an onerous one and afforded Lamon legitimate access to the President.  What Lamon took upon himself, however, was to represent himself as Lincoln's bodyguard, which he did out of friendship rather than the requirements of the position.&lt;ref&gt;Hamand, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamon took this so seriously that his friend Leonard Swett recounted that in the three months he stayed with Lamon in the Fall of 1864, he saw Lamon leave every night to go to the White House where he patrolled the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hamand, pages 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential secretary [[John Hay]] adds to this portrait of devotion by noting in his diary that one night he observed Lamon wrap himself up in his cloak and lie down to sleep in front of Lincoln's bedroom door.&lt;ref&gt;Hamand, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lamon was not in Washington on the night of [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's assassination]], being on assignment in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].  In his ''Recollections of Abraham Lincoln,'' Lamon reveals that before he left for Richmond, he implored the president not to "go out at night after [he] was gone, ''particularly to the theatre.''"&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, ''Recollections of Abraham Lincoln, 1847–1865'', page 280. A.C. McClurg and Company, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the assassination, Lamon accompanied the funeral procession to Springfield, Illinois.

==Lamon as Lincoln's biographer==
[[File:Lincolnatgettysburg.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Abraham Lincoln]] at [[Gettysburg address|Gettysburg]] (seated center, highlighted in sepia). Ward Hill Lamon is seated to Lincoln's right.]]
After Lincoln's death, Lamon published two books (one posthumously) about the late President. The more famous of the two is a biography that was largely [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by [[Chauncey Black]], the son of former [[Attorney General of the United States]] [[Jeremiah Black]]. The elder Black was Lamon's law partner from 1865 until 1879. The book, published in 1872 by James R. Osgood and Company of [[Boston]] under the title ''The Life of Abraham Lincoln; From his Birth to his Inauguration as President'', contained allegations and personal information about Lincoln that were deemed scandalous by nineteenth century society. It was a financial failure. One of the most shocking claims was that Lincoln was not a man of faith:  "Mr. Lincoln was never a member of any church, nor did he believe in the divinity of Christ, or the inspiration of the Scriptures in the sense understood by evangelical Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, W: ''Life of Abraham Lincoln'', page 486. James R.Osgood and Company, 1872.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis of the book was the papers of [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], which Lamon purchased for either $2,000 or $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, W: ''The Soul of Abraham Lincoln'', page 129. George H. Doran Co., 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald, D: ''Lincoln's Herndon'', page 253. Alfred A. Knopf, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after his death, Lamon's daughter collected and edited many of his unpublished writings about Lincoln into a biography of the president, ''Recollections of Abraham Lincoln'' (1895). In ''Recollections'', Lamon reversed his earlier denial of the Baltimore plot of 1861, writing, "It is now an acknowledged fact that there was never a moment from the day he crossed the Maryland line, up until the time of his assassination, that he was not in danger of death by violence, and that his life was spared until the night of the 14th of April, 1865, only through the ceaseless and watchful care of the guards thrown around him."&lt;ref&gt;Lamon, W: ''Recollections of Abraham Lincoln'', page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} of this book is generally more highly regarded by the scholarly community than is the earlier volume by Lamon and Black.

==Lamon after Lincoln's death==
Lamon had tendered his resignation as Marshal of the District of Columbia in June 1865. In April 1866, Lamon purchased the funeral rail car that transported Lincoln's remains to Springfield, Illinois. The price he paid for the rail car was a little less than $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;The Evening Telegraph Vol. V, No.88, page 1, Philadelphia, Thursday April 12, 1866.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025925/1866-04-12/ed-1/seq-1/&lt;/ref&gt; He was offered the cabinet position of Postmaster General but declined.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 222.&lt;/ref&gt;  He formed his law partnership with Jeremiah Black (referenced above), and the law practice dissolved in 1879 due to the poor reception of ''The Life of Lincoln'' ghostwritten by Black's son Chauncey.  In 1879, Lamon and his wife Sally moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], and later to [[Denver]] where he formed a friendship with poet [[Eugene Field]].&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ill health of both Lamon and Sally caused them to return to Washington in 1886, and in 1889, they traveled to Europe for the spas and subsequently Sally died in [[Brussels]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 226-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ward Hill Lamon.jpg|thumb|left|Lamon's grave in Gerrardstown, West Virginia.]]
Lamon moved to [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], [[West Virginia]], where he was cared for by his daughter Dorothy until his death on May 7, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was 65 years old. Lamon was buried in [[Gerrardstown, West Virginia]], in the Presbyterian Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|7490219}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sally had been buried in Springfield, Illinois.)  The home built by Lamon's cousin Joseph in [[Danville, Illinois]], has become a museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamonhouse.org/history.html  The Lamon House History].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions of Lamon==
Some contemporaries and biographers of Lincoln tend to treat Lamon with a certain casual contempt.  In 1862, during his tenure as Marshal, a number of senators called for his removal from office.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Lincoln refused this demand, the Senate was able to decrease some of Lamon's official duties and thus reduce his income.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allan Pinkerton's opinion of him was voiced above, during the Baltimore Plot.  Historian [[Allan Nevins]] in ''The War for the Union'' characterizes Lamon as "a big loquacious bumbler of more self-assurance than discretion".&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even one of Nevin's footnotes that discusses the controversial trip to Charleston in 1861 further dismisses Lamon: "Lamon's papers in the Huntington Library throw no light on the subject except to confirm his general ineptness."&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some accounts are more sympathetic to Lamon, however. In 1931, Clint Clay Tilton repeatedly affirmed Lamon's generosity and good humor and dubbed him "the Cavalier".&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lamon campaigned for Lincoln's re-election in 1864, a song was written with this verse remaining:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A great good man is Ward Hill Lamon;&lt;br&gt;
Abe is [[Damon and Pythias|Pythias]]; he is [[Damon (mythology)|Damon]];&lt;br&gt; 
He's the President's protector,&lt;br&gt;
He's his political protector,&lt;br&gt;
Who?&lt;br&gt;
Ward Hill Lamon.  Ward Hill Lamon.

&lt;ref&gt;Tilton, page 214. The tune has been lost to history''';''' the unusual metrical pattern is compatible with [[:de:Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht|STILLE NACHT]], the tune for "[[Silent Night]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lamon's story is told in the film ''[[Saving Lincoln]]'', which details the threats against Lincoln from Lamon's point of view.
