      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5087">In [[second-language acquisition]], the '''Acculturation Model''' is a theory proposed by John Schumann to describe the acquisition process of a second language (L2) by members of ethnic minorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA230 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically include immigrants, migrant workers, or the children of such groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition process takes place in natural contexts of majority language setting. The main suggestion of the theory is that the acquisition of a second language is directly linked to the acculturation process, and learners’ success is determined by the extent to which they can orient themselves to the target language culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= VanPatten |first=Bill |authorlink= |title=Key Terms in Second Language Acquisition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KO-ZDi_lpYIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=ja&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher= Continuum|location= |isbn=9780826499158 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The acculturation model came into light with Schumann’s study of six non-English learners where one learner named Alberto, unlike the other five, had little progress in the acquisition process of [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631214823_chunk_g97806312148235_ss1-2 |title= Acculturation |author= |date= |work=Blackwell Reference Online |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Inc |doi=10.1111/b.9780631214823.1999.x |accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The process of acculturation was defined by Brown as "the process of being adapted to a new culture" which involves a new orientation of thinking and feeling on the part of an L2 learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url= |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |pages=169–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brown, as culture is an integral part of a human being, the process of acculturation takes a deeper turn when the issue of language is brought on the scene. Schumann based his Acculturation Model on two sets of factors: social and psychological. Schumann asserts that the degree to which the second-language learners acculturate themselves towards the culture of target-language (TL) group generally depends on social and psychological factors; and these two sorts of factors will determine respectively the level of ''social distance'' and ''psychological distance'' an L2 learner is having in course of his learning the target-language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schumann |first=John H |title=The Pidginization Process: A Model for Second Language Acquisition |url= |accessdate= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House Publishers|location=Rowley |pages=367–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social distance, as Ellis notes, concerns the extent to which individual learners can identify themselves with members of TL group and, thereby, can achieve contact with them. Psychological distance is the extent to which individual learners are at ease with their target-language learning task.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (1994), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann identifies eight factors that influence social distance: social dominance, integration pattern, enclosure, cohesiveness, size factor, cultural congruence, attitude factor, and intended length of residence. He also identifies three factors that influence psychological distance: motivation, attitude, and culture shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3203534|title=The pidginization process : a model for second language acquisition|last=H.|first=Schumann, John|date=1978|publisher=Newbury House Publishers|isbn=0883770962|location=Rowley, Mass.|oclc=3203534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumann later sought to extend the acculturation model by assessing contemporary cognitive models for second language acquisition, including McLaughlin’s cognitive theory, Hatch and Hawkins’ experiential approach, Bialystok and Ryan’s model of knowledge and control dimensions, Anderson’s active control of thought framework, and Gasser's connectionist lexical memory framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schumann|first=John|date=Winter 1990|title=Extending the Scope of the Acculturation/Pidginization Model to Include Cognition|url=https://www.jstor.org.proxy-bc.researchport.umd.edu/stable/3587114|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|pages=667–684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Always Becoming''''' is an artwork created in 2007 by [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]] (born 1953), a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Pottery|Potter]] and [[poet]]. She currently resides in [[Española, New Mexico|Española]], [[New Mexico]], just north of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and is a member of the [[Santa Clara Pueblo]].

==Description==

The sculpture consists of five separate sculptures, that make up a family.

Grounded in figures from [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] oral tradition the sculptures are named:
* Father
* Mother
* Little one
* Moon Woman
* Mountain Bird

The sculptures were built in-situ over the summer of 2007, Nora Naranjo-Morse worked with her niece Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband Bill Steen who are experts at building structures with natural material, and the family of Don Juan Morales ([[Tepehuan]]) from the Mexican state of  [[Durango]], as well as many volunteers including museum staff and visitors.

{{quote|Being strangers at the beginning of this journey, we came from distant places with the intent to build sculptures, and in the process built a family as well.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/alwaysbecoming/AlwaysBecoming.html|title=NMAI: NORA NARANJO-MORSE-ALWAYS BECOMING MALL SCULPTURE PROJECT|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Materials==

The Sculptures are made entirely of natural materials: dirt, sand, straw, clay, stone, black locust wood, bamboo, grass, and yam vines. These natural elements were selected to take on a life of their own and thus affect the sculptures over time. In this way the materials ensure the forms are 'always becoming'.

==Dimensions==

The five sculptures range in size from seven and a half to sixteen feet tall.

==History and Location==

On May 24, 2006, the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] announced that Naranjo-Morse had won its outdoor sculpture design competition. "Always Becoming" was selected unanimously from more than 55 entries submitted by Native artists from throughout the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmai.si.edu/press/releases/2006-05-24_outdoor_sculpture_release_final_1.pdf|title=Press {{!}} National Museum of the American Indian|website=www.nmai.si.edu|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2007, on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian, [[Washington, DC]], Naranjo-Morse built a family of clay sculptures. The commissioned work is located on the 'Native landscape' at the museum's south entrance on Maryland Avenue S.W. near 4th Street and Independence Avenue S.W., Washington, D.C.

A public dedication, officially opening these public works of art, took place on September 1, 2007.

The sculptures are intended to disintegrate over time, and the lives of sculptures from the initial idea through the continued process of [[stewardship]] are being documented by Filmmaker Dax Thomas ([[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]]/[[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]]). As the sculptures disintegrate the films of their life will form a more permanent record of their existence and are therefore an essential part of the artistic process, and the work of art itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/quatica|title=quatica|website=Vimeo|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Native culture and the environment served as the inspiration for the sculpture design.  'Always Becoming' will reflect themes of growth and adaptation and represent indigenous peoples' unique relationship to the environment, ...

The sculpture's metaphor of home and family not only conveys a universal theme to all peoples, but also enhances the visitors' experience that they have entered a Native place when they {{sic|step foot}} on the museum grounds.|Nora Naranajo-Morse, 2007 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caneloproject.com/pages/currrent%20projects/smithsonian.html|title=always becoming|website=www.caneloproject.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Geography==
Anakalang is situated in a valley, the megalithic tombs spread over many villages, in the district of Anakalang. This valley is situated to the east of [[Waikabubak]].&lt;ref name="Berkmoes2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ryan |last=Ver Berkmoes|title=Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GMBFsaFNN4C&amp;pg=PA587|accessdate=3 January 2013|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-830-8|pages=587–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anakalang is {{convert|20|km}} from Waikabubak and is close to the main road to [[Waingapu]];&lt;ref name="Hall1993"/&gt; buses arrive at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="Berkmoes2010"/&gt; The district has the greatest concentration of megalithic  tombs in Sumba. At Pasunga's main road, there is one of the largest tombs in Sumba.&lt;ref name="Hall1993"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Prentice Hall|title=Indonesia, Malaysia &amp; Singapore Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rYuAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=3 January 2013|year=1993|author=Trade &amp; Trade &amp; Travel Publications |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There is debate on the exact age of the site; [[radiocarbon dating]] has not been done to affirm this categorization. The stone [[schist]] grave with three adzes in it is inferred to be post-neolithic though no iron objects were found. The quadrangular adzes found in a small [[cist]]  do not exhibit characteristics of the Neolithic age and may be post-neolithic.&lt;ref name="Simanjuntak2006"/&gt; The tradition of building megalithic tombs has continued to the present age in West Sumba. Anakalang is said to be one of the few locations where the social practices and the traditional methods followed to build megaliths can still be seen. In 1880, Umbu Dongu Ubini Mesa became the first ''raja'' of Anakalang. In 1927, Umbu Sappy Pateduk succeeded to the title.&lt;ref name="Keane2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Webb|title=Christian Moderns: Freedom and Fetish in the Mission Encounter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z3YWMn6XQgC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=4 December 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93921-9|pages=156–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umbu Remu Samapati was the third ''raja'', and his brother-in-law, Umbu Sulung Ibilona, succeeded him.&lt;ref name="Barker2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Joshua|title=State of Authority: The State in Society in Indonesia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kqZjVElfS8C&amp;pg=PA131|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=1 July 2009|publisher=SEAP Publications|isbn=978-0-87727-780-4|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Megalithic tombs==
The megalithic grave tomb in the village of Kampung has a stone slab erected vertically. Its carved images date to 1926, taking six months to complete. The burial ceremony involved sacrifice of 150 buffaloes, and the horns of these are kept in a local house. Another tomb is on the same road about {{convert|2.5|km}} away at Koboduk village. This tomb is made of concrete and tiles. It is reported to be the largest tomb in Samba. Another tomb, chiseled out of a single rock, took six years to create and is known as the Umba Saola tomb. It is {{convert|5|by|4|m}} and {{convert|1|m}} in thickness, weighing 70 tons. It was pulled from the hill slope where it was carved over a distance of {{convert|3|km}} to the grave site in the Anakalang town. At the burial location there are also other tombs at the eastern side. These are upright slabs with carvings of the local king and queen with motifs of buffaloes and cockerels. Close to this tomb, the Raja’s son lives with his wife and narrates the story to visitors.&lt;ref name="Berkmoes2010"/&gt;

==Culture==
Linguistically, Anakalang belongs to East Sumba, although politically and geographically it is situated within the ''kabupaten'' of West Sumba.&lt;ref&gt;Webb (1997), p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; The women are mainly weavers, making baskets and mats, while the men are involved in string twining etc. Ornaments are taken care of and hidden away for ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Webb (1997), pp. 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40054">Preserving [[parchment]] becomes more difficult when [[pigments]], [[inks]], and illumination are added into the equation.  Pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638573|title=Printing on Parchment or Vellum|year=1992|last1=Jenkins|first1=Penny|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of restoring [[illuminated manuscript]]s should be to make them resilient to damage while altering them as little as possible.  Each individual manuscript, and even each individual page, must be considered as a separate object with different aspects that must be taken into consideration.

One of the best ways to become familiar with the variety of issues caused by various materials is to learn about how such manuscripts were made in the past and how they were subsequently treated in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nancy.

==Inks and pigments==

The best distinction between inks and pigments is that ink is a colored liquid while pigments are colored particles suspended in a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Kunjappu, Joy (March 2003). [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/March/inkchemistry.asp ”Ink Chemistry.”]. Chemistry World. rsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas colored by pigments usually have multiple layers of pigments and other mediums.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The most important aspect of preserving pigments and inks is to identify their composition.  Some techniques are not suitable for certain pigments and will do further harm.&lt;ref name="utexas1"&gt;[http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/pdfs/a-baker-04-pigments.pdf Common Medieval Pigments.].

===Some examples of issues with pigments===

*[[Iron gall ink]] – very popular black ink; corrosive; can become brittle and fade.&lt;ref&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/ 15, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lead white – darkens when exposed to air; reacts with verdigris and orpiment; generally stable to light.
*[[Orpiment]] – loses color quickly with exposure to [[ozone]]; decays slowly in water; dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]; reacts with lead- and copper-based pigments (such as lead white and verdigris); can corrode bindings; will not easily adhere to parchment and tend to flake off; cannot readily be consolidated with gelatin.
*[[Ultramarine]] – very stable to light but very unstable with [[acids]]; becomes [[friable]] and will crumble if outer skin is scraped, although this is hard to see at first without the aid of a microscope and can be made worse with the application of [[gelatin]] or other liquid consolidators.
*[[Verdigris]] – reacts with lead white and orpiment; decays parchment; tends to become friable and is not easily treated with gelatin or other liquid consolidators; [[chelate|chelating]] agents such as [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] appear to prevent further degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=Some Aspects of Degradation Phenomena of Paper Caused by Green Copper-Containing Pigments|url=http://web.me.com/elandbas/papier_sem-4/groenvraat_files/IPC%2082%2007%2001.pdf|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume= 7|pages=3–7|year=1982 |author1=Banik, Gerhard |author2=Ponahlo, Johann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

Identifying specific pigments is no easy task.  Descriptions may be wrong or misleading and choosing the wrong treatment may cause irreversible damage.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Brown, Michelle P. “Pigments and their Uses in Insular Manuscripts”, in: ''Roger Powell: The Compleat Binder''; edited by John L. Sharpe. (Bibliologia; 14: Elementa ad librorum studia pertenentia''), 1996, pp. 136–45 {{ISBN|2503504345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different ways to identify pigments: invasive and non-invasive.

;Invasive
These tests alter the manuscript in some way, usually by removing some pigment to test a sample.  They are generally reliable but results are not always clear.&lt;ref name="utexas1"/&gt;

;Non-Invasive

These tests do not alter the manuscript and are much better for conservation purposes than the invasive methods of identification.  Some methods include:

*[[Microscopes]]
*Observation under [[Ultra violet|UV]], [[Infrared|IR]], and [[visible light]]
*[[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence (XRF)]]
*[[PIXE|Particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE-α)]]
*[[Raman spectroscopy]]

;Raman spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy analyzes the [[molecular vibration]]s of the pigments and uses this data to map out its chemical makeup.&lt;ref &lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This works on the notion that every substance interacts with radiation in different ways, and these differing ways if measured can help identify the substance without having to take a sample. Unlike other non-invasive identification techniques the results of Raman spectroscopy are much more certain.  It is even possible to analyze a pigment beneath a glaze or other treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638581|title=Laser Raman Spectroscopy: a tool for non-destructive pigment analysis of manuscripts|year=1992|last1=Porter|first1=Cheryl|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of parchment==

Parchment is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic.]]  As such, environmental conditions such as [[relative humidity|humidity]] must be kept under control.  Pigments add another layer to the problem, forcing a preservationist to fit environmental conditions to two different (and possibly conflicting) sets of ideal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638571|title=Rediscovering Parchment: the nature of the beast|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems can occur when parchment is exposed to high humidity for a long period of time. For example, [[collagen]] in the pages could dissolve and stick together.&lt;ref&gt;Mowery, J. Franklin. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/bp10-12.html “The Conservation of a Thirteenth Century Armenian Manuscript.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ''The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL''] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/ 10, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are further compounded by the fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.  Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a relief effect to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638576|title=The Vellum of the Book of Kells|year=1992|last1=Cains|first1=Anthony|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition.  There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as [[Perspex]]) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638579|title=Alternative Methods of Mounting Parchment for Framing and Exhibition|year=1992|last1=Pickwoad|first1=Nicholas|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of repair==

===Consolidation===

Consolidation is a process that can either strengthen the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from [[aqueous]] treatments.  Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away.  The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Maheux, Anne F., and Wanda McWilliams. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-03.html “The Use of the Ultrasonic Mister for the Consolidation of a Flaking Gouache Painting on Paper.] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/ 14, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble [[nylon]] was used until the mid-1970s when concerns over the material’s stability emerged.  Parchment size was then favored until the mid-1990s when leaf [[gelatin]] gained popularity.  This is not to say that gelatin is always the best consolidant to use; no consolidation technique should be used without first considering the pigments and other materials involved, though.  For example, gelatin causes white lead to become [[friability|friable.]]  This problem is compounded by the flexible nature of parchment.  One solution to this particular problem is to use some form of a cellulose ether such as [[methylcellulose]], instead of gelatin.  Again, this is not necessarily the right choice for every situation.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

There are a few basic requirements for any consolidation agent:
*It has to cause a strong bond to form between the pigment and parchment;
*A strong bond also has to be formed between the layers of pigments and any loose particles;
*There has to be little alteration of the chemicals, including appearance;
*It cannot cause the parchment to lose flexibility.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

====Ultrasonic mister====

One device recently used in consolidation techniques is the ultrasonic mister.  Created in 1991 by Stefan Michalski, this device lends itself well to consolidating materials that react badly with liquids.  Gelatin is the preferred consolidant.

The ultrasonic mister is usually used in conjunction with a paper suction table to direct the mist at the media and prevent [[distortion]].  This is not the best treatment for illuminated manuscripts that have printing on both sides, though.  In this case it is better to forgo the suction table and instead use the lowest setting on the mister and to monitor the process carefully.

Problems may arise if condensed mist falls onto the parchment from the nozzle so it is advisable that the device be placed on the floor or a similarly low level to coax mist to drain back into the mister instead of falling upon the parchment.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Flattening and crease removal===

Traditional methods of removing creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been detrimental to the state of any pigments, causing them to come off the parchment slightly.  This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, causing them to expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface.  This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638572|title=A Conditioning Chamber for Parchment and Other Materials|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gore-Tex===

The question becomes whether flattening creased parchment to some extent will cause more or less damage to the image than would be caused by not removing the crease.  Sometimes not flattening the parchment in some respect will lead to the further degradation of an image.  In these cases some form of hydration is necessary.  Due to the nature of pigments, though, it is desirable to avoid direct contact with liquid water.  This can be accomplished with [[Gore-Tex]].

Gore-Tex now has controllable pore size and can block out many liquids, including liquid water and many conservation chemicals.  Water vapor can still pass through the pores, though, so it is possible to hydrate the parchment and remove a crease without introducing liquid water to the pigmented image.  This can be achieved by sandwiching a manuscript in Gore-Tex in varying ways to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=The Conservation of Parchment Objects Using Gore-Tex Laminate|year=1992|last1=Singer|first1=Hannah|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===

Repairing a tear in a parchment with images or text on it is more of a challenge than mending a piece of parchment that does not have any such issues.  Care must be taken to not cover up or obscure in any way the image or the text.  Materials such as [[Goldbeater's skin]] can be made transparent enough to do this but great care still needs to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1995.9638409|title=Leafcasting with Dermal Tissue Preparations: a new method for repairing fragile parchment, and its application to the Codex Eyckensis|year=1995|last1=Wouters|first1=Jan|last2=Peckstadt|first2=An|last3=Watteeuw|first3=Lieve|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=19|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The ethics of illuminated manuscript preservation involve the potential for adversely altering the source material during the course of the repair work. In order to ensure the integrity of the manuscript, great care must be taken during any preservation activity. Risk assessments should be made to determine the potential impact of preservation work on the manuscript, and weigh that against the potential benefits of the restoration work itself.

==In Depth on Conservation Challenges==
The Illuminated Book: Conserving an Art Form

The term illuminated manuscript comes from two sources, both of which originated in Medieval Latin.  The first is manuscriptus, a combination of manu ‘by hand’ and scriptus ‘written’.  The second is the Latin word illuminare, which translates to ‘adorned’.  It is this second term that immediately catches attention, letting readers know that this particular manuscript is special, illuminated or ‘adorned.’  An illuminated manuscript is a book, usually religious in nature, that has been intricately decorated with paints, inks, and metal leaf such as gold and silver.  This can include full page illustrations, intricate initials at the beginning of paragraphs and chapters, and embellishment to particularly important areas of text.  A surprising number of these books have survived the years to exist in the modern era; mostly thanks to their value and, in many cases, religious significance.  Nonetheless, the very embellishments that allowed these books to survive are the reason that today’s conservators find illuminated manuscripts more challenging to maintain than their plain counterparts.  This is important not just to conservators, but to the historians who rely on them to trace the economic trends and artistic evolution in a time that is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, or more properly known as the Migration Period (476–800 C.E.).  Thousands of illuminated manuscripts have survived the ages, yet many are slowly being lost today because they are not being properly conserved.  Illuminated manuscripts are some of the hardest books to conserve, but every effort must be made to preserve them not only for their own beauty and value but for their historical significance as some of the only surviving written records of an era.

Part of the complexity of illuminated manuscripts lies in their historical context.  An illuminated manuscript is, in simple terms, a decorated book.  They usually contain both painted illustrations, embellished text, and illumination with gold and other precious metals.  With the advent and propagation of Christianity in medieval Europe, illustrated books rapidly became a way to convey religious teachings in a time when most of the population was illiterate.  Because of this purpose, most of the illuminated manuscripts to have survived the ages are religious in nature.  In most cases, rich patrons or churches would commission the creation of their own copies of various religious scriptures.  These were most commonly complete copies of the Bible or a subsection, such as individual books of the Old Testament, collections of 150 psalms, or collections of the first four books of the New Testament (Anderson 9).  In later cases, when more people could read, books of hours were also widely called for.   All of these books were created by either nuns or monks, usually in a scriptorium connected to their church or abbey.  Outside of the church, there were some examples of secular texts being illuminated.  Astronomical treatises and copies of classical writers were some of the first examples, emerging as the trend of owning personal copies of religious texts spread among the wealthy.  Later, histories and chronicles became more popular, coinciding with the gradual spread of knowledge and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the latter part of the Middle Ages (Anderson 13).  These books were still most often produced by church scribes and illuminators; however, they were commissioned by private citizens or universities rather than the church.  Without the illuminated manuscripts historians have to study today, much of this information about the gradual return of wealth and learning in the Migration Period would be difficult or even impossible to accurately trace and date.
There were many reasons for the creation of illuminated manuscripts, and these varied with each commission.  However, the most common were either for teaching purposes or as shows of wealth.  Because most common people were illiterate, they could only relate to stories of church doctrine through pictures rather than reading the words.  Illustrating religious texts allowed people to see the stories that church leaders read to them, and to create a personal connection outside of the oral tradition.  In this instance, illuminated manuscripts served the same purpose as stained glass windows in churches.  They allowed the faithful to see the stories of their faith, lending them substance that might be absent from the spoken word.  They could also serve as reminders of religious faith when a church service was not in progress.  The second reason for the creation of illuminated manuscripts was as a show of wealth.  In the case of church manuscripts, the books could both tell religious stories and remind the people of the power and wealth of the church.  In the case of private commissions, the patron was able to demonstrate their wealth by purchasing lavish volumes for their personal libraries and chapels.  This also served to demonstrate their fidelity to and strengthen their ties with the church, whose support and influence with the common people played a major part in keeping the upper class in power.  Because all but the very smallest of local churches had at least a plain copy of the bible, the range from completely unadorned manuscripts to the lavish and intricate designs embellished with rich gold leaf seen in the more famous versions of the art are clearly represented.  Where each book fell on this range closely reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, whether that was an upper-class individual or a town.  While this influence is also represented in buildings and other archeological evidence such as coinage and works of art, the prevalence of illuminated manuscripts from different areas and time periods provides a sort of historical litmus test to the prosperity of the region.

Before the invention of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process.  The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the binding threads were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle.  Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe.  Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press.  The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D.  The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet.  These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse.  They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17).  Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications.  Over time, they became the standard form of written information.  Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves.  Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7).  

To understand the challenges conservators face when dealing with these intricately decorated books, it is first necessary to understand how they were made.  Bookbinders used some of the same techniques used today to create hand bound books.  Sheets were folded in half, so that each one would form two pages.  These were then nested one inside the other to create a gathering.  These gatherings could include as many pages as the bookbinder chose, however there were usually relatively few to prevent the gathering from becoming too bulky.  An alternative method was to fold a very large sheet of paper repeatedly to create many pages, then slit three of the four sides with a knife to create a sheaf of pages (Hamel 39).  Many gatherings were sown together though pre-punched holes known as sowing stations.  The pattern of sowing stations and the use of the thread was what determined the structure of the binding.  Because scribes and artists often needed access to the entire sheets of paper to do their work, books from this time period were often prepared in loose bindings that could be easily undone to free a sheet of paper (Hamel 40).  For both illuminated and unadorned books, these loose bindings cause problems for conservators when they have not been properly and firmly bound after the writing and decorating was completed.  Entire gatherings of pages can come loose, needing to be carefully re-stitched into their correct locations.  Because of the wide variance in materials used in the bindings of books from the era that illuminated manuscripts were made, it is possible to trace some back to specific binderies, meaning that the materials can be analyzed to understand what trade was going on in that area at the time.  For example, if a lavish cover was inlayed with lapis lazuli, if would be possible to infer that the bindery was able to source materials from as far east as Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Certain kinds of leather can also be traced back to specific geographical regions, as some breeds of cow and goat were only found in specific areas at this time.

The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns.  There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35).  Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure.  Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts.  As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark.  However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11).  It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time.  This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper.  Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts.  Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible.  The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44).  Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35).  This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts.  The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history.  There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: if is very susceptible to water damage.  Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace.  It is believed that “Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,” however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).

The issue of proper inks used on parchment also carries over to the paints used in the illustrations.  This set of problems is truly unique to decorated books, and is the beginning of just what sets them apart as conservation challenges as opposed to their plain counterparts.  In particular, the brilliant blue color of paint that is seen in many of the finest examples of the art is a challenge.  Made from ground lapis lazuli this was the most expensive color of paint, as it was sourced from far away Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Any book bearing this color would have been especially costly, and helps to map the economic structure of Migration Period Europe through the supply chain used to create it and the person wealthy enough to afford it.  Unfortunately, this particularly precious color is also the most difficult for conservators.  It is prone to flaking and cupping, a form of contraction which causes the paint to crack and curve outwards in many little flakes, giving the appearance of tiny shingles that have been flipped upside-down.  This means that even the slightest friction can catch the raised edges and cause the paint to flake off.  It must be carefully consolidated with a nonreactive adhesive, without damaging other surrounding decoration (Clarkson 47).  Many other paints used at the time were also poisonous.  The compositions of many paints were discovered using Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive method of analysis that bounces light off of a given pigment and reads back the compositions based on witch wavelengths are absorbed and reflected (De 75).  Using this and other spectroscopic methods, it has been determined that the very common red pigment found in these books was created from red lead, or, more dangerously, the highly toxic compound cinnabar.  Another variant of this common color was vermillion, created using heated mercury and sulfur.  Yellow was often made using poisonous orpiment, or arsenic sulfide, and white was almost invariably created using lead.  While there are some organic alternatives, such as yellow made from saffron, it is unknown if even a single illuminated manuscript does not contain toxic materials.  These compounds can pose a danger to conservators, researchers, or those putting the books of display if they are aerated and should be carefully consolidated and never abraded.  While many other paints and inks were used by the artist decorating the books, these examples convey both the wide ranges of the colors used and the dangers they posed. This added level of difficulty is a good example of what makes illuminated manuscripts harder to deal with than plan books.  It is also worth noting that while the paints were a finishing measure for the book the painter did not actually do any designing.  An earlier drawling would have set out the pattern and clearly labeled with colors should go where in places that would be covered with paint.  These patterns and labels are visible using various imaging techniques.  Some scribes also wrote or made small drawings in the margins of the books, often providing historians with a window into the life on the average man in the Migration Period. These little annotations are some of the only surviving records of everyday life from the time commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Complaints about long work hours and little drawings of people and monsters can be seen both in the margins and in some cases under the paint of the illustrations.  

The tradition of illustrating texts goes all the way back to the cradle of civilization, evolving through Egypt and the cultures of the Mediterranean.  However, it was far less common for books and papers to be embellished with precious metals, and this aspect of illuminated manuscripts adds another facet of difficulty for conservators that is not found elsewhere.  In the middle ages, gold was the symbol of royalty, a clear sign of wealth and status.  Yet for all of that, it was actually fairly common.  Indeed, by the late middle ages the most common use for gold was in coinage (De 65).  Because of this, using small quantities of the precious metal in a book was not prohibitively expensive.  Gold, and all other metals used for illumination, was hammered into incredibly thin sheets, allowing a tiny amount of gold to cover a large area.  This thin sheet was then adhered to the pages using the particular illuminator’s formula of adhesive.  This variation in adhesives mean that if any work needs to be done by a conservator, several tests must be undergone to ensure that no modern consolidation or adhesive will react with, damage, or loosen the old glue.  While this is an issue for conservators, in rare cases a glue can be traced to a specific bindery, thus placing the book in its correct area and context, making it far more useful to historians.  Another challenge for conservators lies in the fact that the gold used in books was not always pure.  Alloys of gold can be subject to corrosion, with can cause darkening of the metal, reaction with the adhesives and other paint, and staining of the paper.  This is an inherent vice of illuminations done with pure silver as well.  Regardless of the care and treatment, silver corrodes and darkens over time.  While modern conservators have ways of limiting this though control of humidity, older books have often seen their illumination corrode to the point that to attempt to clean it would simply remove the metal entirely.

Conservation in the modern era does not only face issues with the objects themselves.  While a corroded book is one issue, how to display that book to the public is another, potentially more complex problem.  From a conservator’s point of view, to best protect a book it should be placed in a controlled, dark environment, then swaddled in padding with plenty of circulating air and tightly controlled relative humidity.  Once old damage has been repaired, the goal is to keep new damage from occurring.  However, most illuminated manuscripts belong to museums and libraries.  Moreover, these beautiful works are the pride of the collection in most cases, and any curator will naturally want their most enticing items on display to woo the visiting public.  In addition, part of the cultural value of the books is what they can teach us about the missing part of history commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Historians will often want to study and run tests on the books in hopes of learning something about the time and place they were made, such as what trade was present.  Thus comes one of the great ethical issues in the field of conservation, the problem of preservation versus access.  The question most often faced by conservators is how to display a book to the least damage for the longest time.  The light that enables visitors to see the books also breaks down the lignin structures in paper pages, fades paints, and embrittles leather.  The cradle that holds the book open for viewing may also strain the spine. These are only two of the myriad issues that must be addressed when dealing with these fragile books.  Even more arise when tests need to be run or a historian wants to handle a book.  Removing a sliver of paint for analysis by a mass spectrometer may reveal information about trade routes, but it also damages the book.  Likewise, inspecting the drawings and inscriptions in the margins provides a unique historical window, but a careless historian might touch the page and damage fragile and flaking paint.  Not all institutions have the funds to properly care for their collections either.  While a few famous examples claim the spotlight in major institutions, small museums, libraries, and religious centers put their own, smaller treasures on display to the public without the expertise of a conservator to aid them.

The complex challenges of illuminated manuscripts make them a uniquely troublesome medium for conservation.  Their illumination, adhesives, paints, inks, papers, and even their very bindings can pose issues ranging from toxic chemicals to lost pages.  Some of these issues are universal to book conservation.  The troubles with ink on parchment pages and of loose bindings can be found in any book contemporary to the Medieval and Migration Periods.  Yet illuminated manuscripts take these usual issues and add to them with poisonous paint, corroding metals, and uniquely challenging materials such as the luxuriously expensive yet eternally flaking lapis lazuli paint.  Illuminated manuscripts are also problematic because of their popularity amongst displays.  For these reasons and many others, illuminated manuscripts are clearly more challenging to conservators than their plainer contemporaries.  Hidden away in private collections and small institutions, some of these books are gradually falling into disrepair.  This fact is all the more important when you look past the aesthetic and monetary value of these books and realize that they are some of the only surviving written pieces from a time when there is so little historical information available that textbooks call it the Dark Ages.  In the future, as technology evolves, it may be possible to gradually bring the economy and social system of the Migration Period into the light by carefully analyzing these books.  This is why it is so important that they survive in the modern age; and why the difficulty of their care matters to everyone, weather they see a beautiful artwork or a historical road map in the glittering pages.
 
==Digital preservation==
Manuscript preservation may also take the form of digital archiving, which is particularly useful for vulnerable manuscripts and fragments susceptible to deterioration such as the burnt fragments extant from the [[Cotton library#Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] which have now been recorded using multispectral imaging by the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name=bl2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=Fragmentarium and the burnt Anglo-Saxon fragments|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/09/fragmentarium-and-the-burnt-anglo-saxon-fragments.html|website=British Library: Medieval Manuscripts|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragmentarium]] (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database which, since September 2017, preserves and collates fragments of medieval manuscripts making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the [[British Library]], [[Harvard]], [[Stanford]], [[Yale]] and the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragmentarium - An international scholarly network that enables libraries, collectors, researchers and students to upload medieval manuscript fragments and to describe, transcribe and assemble them online.|url=http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/newsletter/archive/issue-18.html#fragmentarium|website=E-Codices|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of Science Editors''' ('''CSE''') is a [[United States]]-based nonprofit organization that supports editorial practice among scientific writers. In 2008, the CSE adopted the slogan "CSE: Education, Ethics, and Evidence for Editors (E4)".

A volunteer Board of Directors leads the Council, with the assistance of several committees. CSE is managed by Kellen Company, located in [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Colorado]].

== History and organization==

The organization was established in 1957 by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] as the '''Council of Biology Editors''' (CBE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/lls/students/cse_citation.html | title = CSE Quick Citation Guide | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214210911/http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/lls/students/cse_citation.html |archive-date=2012-12-14 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; being renamed the Council of Science Editors, with a broader mission, on January 1, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3280 History of the Council of Science Editors], 2013, Council of Science Editors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://polishedpaper.com/cse-style-guide | title = III.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], as of 2010, [[New York (state)|New York]] was the third largest [[U.S. state|state]] in population after [[California]] and [[Texas]], with a population of 19,378,102, an increase of over 400,000 people, or 2.1%, since the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-01.pdf |title=Population Distribution and Change: 2000 to 2010|date=March 2011 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |format= PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The population change between 2000-2006 includes a natural increase of 601,779 people (1,576,125 births minus 974,346 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 422,481 people out of the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 820,388 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of about 800,213. This means a very small population change for the state.

The distribution of change in population growth is uneven in New York State; the [[New York City metropolitan area]] is growing considerably, along with [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]], while most of [[Western New York]] is nearly stagnant. According to [[immigration]] statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Since 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that was reversed since 2006. New York State lost two house seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States.

The [[center of population]] of New York is located in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], in the town of [[Deerpark, New York|Deerpark]]. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in [[New York City]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 |accessdate=2007-01-05 |format=Text |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZRQVgCU?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==

{{US Demographics|state=New York}}

New York State has a primarily urban population. The largest city in the state is [[New York City]], which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] ([[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]).

As of the 2010 census, New York State has a population of 19,378,102, including 12,740,974 (65.7%) white, 3,073,800 (15.9%) black, 1,420,244 (7.3%) Asian, 8,766 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, and 1,441,563 (7.4%) of other races. 585,849 (3.0%) has two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of all races make up 3,416,922 (17.6%) of the state's population; non-Hispanic whites make up 58.3% of the state's population.

According to 2004 estimates, 20.4% of the population was foreign-born. Among cities in New York State, 36% of New York City's population is foreign-born; this figure of approximately 3 million is a higher total number of foreign-born residents than any other U.S. city. The top ancestry groups in New York State are [[Italian American]] (15.8%), [[African American]] (14.4%), [[Hispanic]] (14.2%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.9%), [[German American|German]] (11.1%), [[English American|English]] (6%), and [[Polish American|Polish]] (5.27%). 1.5% of the state population is multiracial.

New York contains the largest [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] [[Puerto Rican migration to New York#Currently|population]] in the country, concentrated in parts of New York City such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. New York also has the largest [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] population in the country, concentrated in New York City's Upper Manhattan and the Bronx. New York City is home to many [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|blacks]], the majority with roots in the United States but a group which includes those with roots in [[Caribbean]] Islands like [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]] and [[Haiti]], as well as recent immigrants from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries. The [[Bronx]] has a large population of blacks that are of [[Latin American]] origin, but so does northern [[Manhattan]] ([[Harlem, New York|Harlem]]) and [[Brooklyn]] which had American-born black majorities since the 1920s, as well the largest African American population of any state. New York City has 1 million of New York State's 1.4 million [[Asian Americans]]. At 520,000 of New York State's over 600,000 [[Chinese Americans]], New York City has a higher total number of Chinese Americans than [[Los Angeles County]]. New York also has the highest and growing proportion of [[Pakistani Americans]] and [[Bangladeshi Americans]] in the country, and a very high [[Indian American]] community, mainly concentrated in New York City. Unlike New York City, smaller cities in Upstate New York, especially [[Western New York]], are not as diverse. Cities such as Buffalo and Rochester are predominantly made of African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and ethnic European whites.

Among New York State's cities, as of 2010, New York City is 44% white, 28% Latino, 25% African American, and 13% percent Asian American. The city of Buffalo, New York state's second-largest city, is 50% white (45% non-Hispanic white), 38% African American, 10% Latino, and 3% Asian American. The state capital of Albany is 57% white (64% non-Hispanic white), 30% African American, 8% Latino, and 5% Asian American.

[[Image:Largest ancestry of each New York county (en).svg|thumb|left|220px|New York ethnic distribution]]
In the 2000 Census, [[Italian Americans]] make up the largest ancestral group in Staten Island and Long Island, followed by [[Irish Americans]] and Polish Americans. Manhattan's leading ancestry group is Dominicans since the 2000 census, followed by Irish Americans, then Italian Americans and more than 200 nationalities are counted, plus comparably large numbers of residents with [[Dutch American|Dutch]], [[Portuguese Americans|Portuguese]], [[Greek Americans|Greek]], [[Russian American|Russian]], and [[Swedish Americans|Swedish]] ancestry. Albany and southeast-central New York are heavily Irish American and Italian American. In Buffalo and western New York, [[German Americans]] are the largest group along with Polish Americans and other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nationalities; in the northern tip of the state, [[French Canadians]]. New York State has a higher number of Italian-Americans than any other U.S. state. New York City is also said to be home to two million of Italian descent alone. NYC was once called the largest German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Polish and Russian communities outside their representative countries of origin. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sometimes classified an [[ethnic group]] by some demographers and sometimes as a religious identity ([[Judaism]]), [[American Jews]] of various nationalities and various denominations, but most are American-born, are a major social presence in New York. An estimated 1 to 2 million alone in New York City and another 1 to 1.5 million live in surrounding areas, sometimes New York is referred to as the "world's largest [[Jew]]ish city" since the mid-19th century. The first wave of Jewish immigrants in New York are of [[Sephardic]] origin, a scant 10,000 from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Portugal in the 17th and 18th centuries, but in the 19th century more newcomers were first [[German Jewish|German]] and finally in the early 20th century millions from [[Eastern Europe]] like Poland and Russia, both of [[Ashkenazi]] origin. In the late 20th century, a smaller wave of [[Russian Jews]] and [[Ukrainian Jews]] settled in the [[Brighton Beach]] section in Brooklyn, and New York has many [[Israeli-American]] residents. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in the U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state [[megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis]] stretching 500 miles from [[Boston]] to [[Washington DC]], with New York City in the middle has 15 million residents in a 100-mile radius including [[Philadelphia]] (1.5 million in its city limits), northern [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]]. The bulk of New York's population lives within two hours of New York City. According to the July 1, 2004 Census Bureau Estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?-geo_id=04000US36&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP3&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U |title= DP-3. Profile of Selected Economic Characteristics: 2000, Geographic Area: New York |accessdate=2007-01-05 |work= U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City and its six closest New York State satellite counties ([[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]], [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]] and [[Orange County, New York|Orange]]) have a combined population of 12,626,200 people, or 65.67% of the state's population.

According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 13.61% of the population aged 5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 2.04% speak Chinese (including [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), 1.65% Italian, and 1.23% Russian [https://web.archive.org/web/20070816194109/http://www.mla.org/map_data_results%26state_id%3D36%26mode%3Dstate_tops].  &lt;!-- links to default window and does not display the results cited --&gt;
In age demographics: 6.5% of New York's population were under 5 years of age, 24.7% under 18, and 12.9% were 65 or older. Females made up 51.8% of the population. New York state has a fluctuating population growth rate, it has experienced some shrinkage in the 1970s and 1980s, but milder growth in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.

'''Elizabeth Hazelton Haight''' (February 11, 1872 - November 15, 1964) was an [[United States|American]] [[Classics scholar|classical scholar]] and [[academia|academic]] who specialised in Latin teaching. She spent most of her career working for [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

==Career==
"Hazel" Haight was born in [[Auburn, New York|Auburn]], to John White Haight and Helen M. (Meeker) Haight. Her father was one of the leading businessmen in Auburn during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John White Haight (1815-1895) - Find A Grave... |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65433891/john-white-haight |website=www.findagrave.com |date=27 October 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haight matriculated at [[Vassar College]] in 1890, and was commencement speaker for her undegraduate class, graduating from Vassar in 1894. She also edited the Yearbook for that year.&lt;ref name='ClassWorld' /&gt; She received her [[Master of Arts|AM]], also from Vassar, in 1899, with a dissertation entitled "Conditional Sentences in the Iliad and the Odyssey."&lt;ref name='ClassWorld' /&gt; She then moved to [[Cornell University]], where she studied with [[Charles E. Bennett (scholar)|Charles E. Bennett]], and received her PhD with a thesis titled "The Sea in Greek Poetry" in 1909.&lt;ref name=MemMin&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digitallibrary.vassar.edu/islandora/object/vassar%3A31891#page/1/mode/1up |title=Haight, Elizabeth Hazelton, 1872-1964 - Memorial Minute |publisher=Vassar College |author1=Erck, M.

Haight died in [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] and is buried in [[Fort Hill Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Hazelton Haight - Find A Grave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65433885/elizabeth-hazelton-haight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haight was the first woman to chair the Advisory Council of the then [[American School of Classical Studies at Rome]]. She was also elected as president of the [[American Philological Association]] in 1934 - the second woman to hold that post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/index.php?page=person&amp;id=590 |title=HAIGHT, Elizabeth Hazelton |publisher=Database of Classical Scholars |accessdate=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave her presidential address on "Prose Fiction in the Augustan Age."&lt;ref name='ClassWorld' /&gt; During the mid-1930s, many scholars were emigrating from Germany under Nazi rule; Haight organised a programme of these visiting scholars to Vassar College.&lt;ref name=MemMin /&gt;

During her long residency at Vassar College, Haight opened and voluntarily curated the Vassar Classical Museum and bought objects and inscriptions for it. This appreciation for the contributions of archaeology to a classical education was described by Donald Lateiner as "ahead of its time".&lt;ref name='ClassWorld' /&gt; She also wrote a history of the college, along with [[James Monroe Taylor]], its president from 1886 to 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haight |first1=Elizabeth Hazelton |last2=Taylor |first2=James Monroe |title=Vassar |date=1915 |publisher=Palala Press |isbn=9781347241851 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Vassar-Elizabeth-Hazelton-Haight/dp/134724185X |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated in the Nochixtlán Valley within the [[Mixteca Alta]], Etlatongo encompasses both a [[Mesoamerican chronology|Formative Period]] site, located between two rivers, and a Classic/Post-classic site, on a hill to the north.

Etlatongo experienced a sharp population growth beginning in roughly 1150 [[Common Era|BCE]] and lasting for 300 years.  It was during this period that trade goods, including figurines, ceramics, and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], including artifacts identified with the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]s, [[Olmec]]s, and the [[Valley of Mexico]], enter the archaeological record.

Studies of Etlatongo artifacts, including obsidian and pottery, indicate that Etlatongo participated in a wide-ranging trade network.

Etlatongo continued to be occupied through the Post-classic period.

'''''Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House''''' (New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2007) is a [[memoir]] by [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]]. Mrs. Wilson is the former [[Non-official cover|covert]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer whose then-classified [[non-official cover]] (NOC) identity as "[[Valerie Plame]]" was leaked to the press in July 2003, after her husband, former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson, IV]], had criticized the [[Presidency of the United States|George W. Bush administration]]'s rationale for the [[Iraq War]].  The outing made her the center of the [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|American political scandal]] known as the [[Plame affair]].  Her public outing led to her decision to resign from the CIA in December 2005, when she attempted to retire early at the age of 42. Being told that she could not collect her pension until the age of 56, she determined to write this book both as a means of telling her own story in her own words and as a means of earning income to replace her deferred retirement annuity.  She encountered resistance from the CIA in the course of chronicling her work with the organization.&lt;ref name=LiptakAug&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/washington/03plame.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;adxnnlx=1206245413-gmc8PySloz5lTGt0nKkH1Q "Judge Backs C.I.A. in Suit On Memoir"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 3, 2007, accessed March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;John Solomon, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-15-rove-testimony_x.htm "Rove Learned CIA Agent's Name from Novak"], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2005, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seidman&gt;Joel Seidman (Producer, [[NBC News]]), [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18924679/ "Plame Was 'covert' Agent at Time of Name Leak: Newly Released Unclassified Document Details CIA Employment"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', May 29, 2007, accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Bonnie Goldstein, [http://www.slate.com/id/2168490/entry/0/ "Free Valerie Plame's Memoirs!"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 15, 2007, accessed October 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Janet Maslin]] writes in her ''New York Times'' review on the day of publication, "the story of how her career was derailed and her C.I.A. cover blown ... has its combative side.  But the real proof of Ms. Wilson’s fighting spirit is the form in which her version of events has been brought into the light of day."

===="Wilson's wife is fair game"====
{{Main article|Plame affair}}
The phrase "fair game" in the title of Mrs. Wilson's [[memoir]] refers to a comment that [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Deputy White House Chief of Staff]] for Strategic Planning and Senior Advisor [[Karl Rove]] reportedly told [[Chris Matthews]], the host of [[MSNBC]]'s television show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'': "I just got off the phone with Karl Rove. He says, and I quote, '[[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]]'s wife is fair game.'"&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics&gt;Russ Hoyle, "The [[Niger uranium forgeries|Niger Affair]]: The Investigation That Won't Go Away," "Foreword" (xiii-xlix) in Joseph C. Wilson, IV, ''[[The Politics of Truth|The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]'', rev. ed. (2004; New York: [[Carroll &amp; Graf]] Publishers, 2005) xl: "[[Karl Rove|Rove]] reportedly told [[MSNBC]]'s [[Chris Matthews]], the host of the political talk show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', that the White House considered Wilson and his wife fair game for political payback."  Cf. Joseph C. Wilson, "The Sixteen Words", chap. 1 in ''The Politics of Truth'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'WILSON'S WIFE IS FAIR GAME.'" Those are fighting words for any man, and I'd just had them quoted to me by MSNBC's [[Chris Matthews]].  It was July 21, 2003, barely a week since a column by [[Robert Novak]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' had named my wife, Valerie, as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, and now the host of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' was calling to tell me that as far as the [[The White House|White House]] was concerned, they had declared open season on my family. ... In his signature staccato, Matthews was blunt: "I just got off the phone with [[Karl Rove]].  He says, and I quote, 'Wilson's wife is fair game.'" (1; cf. 4-5, 351, 373)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3&gt;[[Evan Thomas]] and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3129942/site/newsweek/ "Secrets and Leaks:] Pssst ...

But Here's Why This One May Be Different", ''[[Newsweek]]'', online version, October 13, 2003 ("Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET July 12, 2005"): 3 (of 4 pages), accessed August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Fair Game" serves as a metaphor derived from more recent contexts of her life that the author relates in this book; given the nature of [[Non-official cover|covert espionage]], it may suggest multiple meanings.&lt;ref name=Waas&gt;[[Murray Waas]], [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=plugging_leaks "Plugging Leaks:] More Details Emerge on the Plame Investigation, As Karl Rove's Testimony Is Revealed for the First Time", ''[[The American Prospect]]'', March 8, 2004, accessed August 23, 2007. (Web only.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meyerson&gt;[[Harold Meyerson]], [http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0714-25.htm "'Fair Game' Question for Bush: Has the President Asked Karl Rove, His Indispensable Aide, about His Role in the Valerie Plame Case?"], ''[[Newsday]]'', July 14, 2005, rpt. in ''[[Common Dreams]]'', "Featured Views", accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Karl Rove's disavowal of the phrase "fair game"=====
After the title of Valerie Plame Wilson's book had already been widely disseminated, on August 19, 2007, on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], Gregory asked Rove, who identified himself as an "avid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]",&lt;ref name=MTP1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.  (Page 1 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; among other statements pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] attributed to him, whether he "considered her fair game in this debate" between her husband and [[The White House]] over the President's so-called "[[September Dossier|sixteen words]]".  Rove responded that the phrase "fair game" attributed to him by [[Chris Matthews]] was Matthews' phrase not his own and that he himself did not consider Mrs. Wilson (in Gregory's phrase) "an appropropriate target in this debate."&lt;ref name=MTP3&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/page/3/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Do you think you owe Valerie Plame an apology?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You do not?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You considered her fair game in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  And you know what?  Fair game, that wasn’t my phrase.  That’s a phrase of a journalist.  In fact, a colleague of yours [Matthews].&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Was she an appropriate target in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  She was not.&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  (Page 3 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Related contexts=====
In October 2003 Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]] reported in ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "The White House spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous' the charge that Rove outed Plame."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3a&gt;Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3129941/site/newsweek/ "Secrets and Leaks:] Pssst ... You Might Think This Washington Leak Investigation Will Peter Out Like Most Others, with No Culprits and No Penalties. But Here's Why This One May Be Different", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 6, 2003,  online version, October 13, 2003 ("Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET July 12, 2005"): 3 (of 4 pages), accessed August 22, 2007: &lt;blockquote&gt;A source familiar with Rove's conversation acknowledged that Rove spoke to Matthews a few days after [[Robert Novak|Novak's]] column appeared, but said that Rove never told Matthews that Wilson’s wife was "fair game"—rather, that it "was reasonable to discuss who sent Wilson to Niger." Novak wrote last week that the leaker was "no partisan gunslinger."  That suggests that the original leak came from someone in [[the White House]] [[national security|national-security]] apparatus, which holds itself above politics. Many White House staffers are potential suspects, but various press reports have suggested that the Feds will want to interview [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney|Cheney's]] [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff]], an aggressive consumer of intelligence regarded by some CIA analysts as an intimidating figure.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Thomas and Isikoff note, "It may be significant that both Rove and Libby deny leaking classified information. They may say that in talking to reporters they used her name without knowing that she was undercover."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;

[[Chris Matthews]] reportedly declined to discuss the telephone conversation that he had had with Rove, according to Thomas and Iskikoff in ''[[Newsweek]]'', who quote the conversation that Wilson reported having with Matthews and then add parenthetically: "(Matthews told ''Newsweek'': 'I’m not going to talk about off-the-record conversations.')"&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt; [[David Corn]] of ''[[The Nation]]'' notes Matthews' statement to ''Newsweek'' "that he would not discuss off-the record conversations," adding, also parenthetically, that, earlier, "he [Matthews] told me the same...."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corn&gt;As cited in [[David Corn]], [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=991 "The Spin Is Not Holding"], ''Capital Games'' (blog),  ''[[The Nation]]'', October 4, 2003, accessed August 22, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The newsmagazine [Newsweek] also notes that, according to a source close to Wilson, shortly after the leak occurred Bush's senior aide Karl Rove told Hardball host Chris Matthews that Wilson's wife was "fair game." Matthews told Newsweek that he would not discuss off-the-record conversations. (He told me the same weeks ago when I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Isikoff&gt;[[Cf.]] [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/ "The Rove Factor: Time Magazine Talked to Bush's Guru for Plame Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050706043356/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek |date=2005-07-06 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 11, 2006, accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7102243 "Legal Affairs: Reporter Says Libby, Rove Told Him of Plame's Work"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ''[[National Public Radio]]'', January 31, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007; includes audio link (NPR Player).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews was one of over twenty-five journalists subpoenaed by [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] regarding their conversations with high-level [[Presidency of the United States|Bush administration]] officials pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] (2003–2005), leading to the indictment and prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'' (2007).{{Further information|Valerie Plame#Judicial and legislative actions pertaining to "Plamegate"}}

Ultimately, whereas Fitzgerald's grand jury did not indict Rove for committing any alleged crimes, and, in October 2005, it did indict Libby not for allegedly having leaked Mrs. Wilson's identity but for allegedly having lied in his sworn testimony pertaining to the leak investigation, federal [[felony|felonies]] for which a jury convicted and a judge sentenced him, a sentence which was commuted by Presidential proclamation.  On July 19, 2007, a district court judge dismissed the Wilsons' [[civil lawsuit]] ([[Plame v. Cheney]]) which charged related offenses by the various government officials. The dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, that the case belonged in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-19-plame-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Plame's lawsuit against Cheney dismissed - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/19/cia.leak/index.html|title=Judge tosses out ex-spy's lawsuit against Cheney in CIA leak case - CNN.com|website=us.cnn.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071901395.html?hpid=topnews|title=Plame's Suit Against  Top Officials Dismissed|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|date=2007-07-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1258-52|title=Memorandum Opinion|last=in "Valerie Wilson, et al., Plaintiffs, v.

On April 6, 2006, Matthews stated his own point of view on the CIA leak publicly in some detail in his conversation with Senator [[John Kerry]] on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', describing as "high drama" [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]]'s testimony that the [[President of the United States]] via the [[Vice President of the United States]] had "ordered" Libby to leak classified information pertaining to [[national security]] in order to bolster the case for the [[Iraq War]] after it began in March 2003.&lt;ref name="Matthews2006"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12193430/ "Kerry: 'Immoral to allow our kids to be killed':] Sen. John Kerry talks to Chris Matthews about Iraq, CIA leak: ''Following the CIA leak disclosure, Chris Matthews sat down with Senator John Kerry in his Capitol office to discuss the big developments in the CIA leak case and vision for Iraq policy''", ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', April 6, 2006, accessed August 22, 2007 (Transcript):&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's talk about the timing of this and we all remember this.  It was July 6th that Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who had been sent down there by the CIA to the government of [[Niger]] to check out the story which appeared mysteriously in an Italian newspaper, that there had been a deal by Saddam Hussein to purchase nuclear materials, [[yellowcake|uranium yellow cake]], from the government of Niger.
Within two days, the [[vice president of the United States]] said the [[president of the United States]] wanted [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] to leak to [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judy Miller]], someone he had been working with on stories, had written stories that were supportive of the war, in effect, if not in intent, to tell her, this is a specific determination by the president.
You tell Scooter to go tell Judy that there was a real case for these aluminum tubes being material for use in developing a nuclear weapon.  You tell her this.  This is the conversation we're getting recounted under oath from Scooter Libby.  Pretty high drama here, isn't it?
I mean, it tells you that the president himself was in charge of this operation. He wasn't some, faded backroom guy getting orders from the vice president.  He was in fact, calling the shots particularly, and making the case for the war after the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, the day after [[Lewis Libby]]'s sentencing, in a conversation with actor and political activist [[Ben Affleck]] about other matters, [[Chris Matthews]] used the phrase "fair game" several times, initially citing its use in a question submitted for Affleck by a viewer, whose own use of the phrase could reflect Matthews' already well-publicized reported use of it by Wilson, ''[[Newsweek]]'', and many other [[mass media|media]] sources.&lt;ref name=MatthewsJune2007&gt;[[Chris Matthews]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for June 7"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated June 8, 2007, 12:09 p.m. ET, accessed August 23, 2007: "Here's a question from [...].  'Are the personal or religious beliefs of candidates ''fair game'' for scrutiny when deciding for whom to vote?'  What do you make of that, Ben?  It's been happening in these debates, lots of questions about, you know, evolution, Genesis, the whole thing, creationism.  Are they ''fair game'', or is that a religious test?" (Italics added.) (Transcript; "Guests: [[Ben Affleck]], [[Loretta Sanchez]], [[Brian Bilbray]], [[Ezra Klein]], Karen Hanretty.")&lt;/ref&gt;  His later usage of the phrase "fair game" in talking with Affleck about other matters raises a possibility that the phrase "fair use" that he reportedly used in talking with Wilson about Rove's comments about "Wilson's wife" (as quoted in ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' [2004, 2005] and as previously quoted in ''[[Newsweek]]'' [2003]) was his own phrase and not Rove's, as Rove later disavowed it.

Nevertheless, whether or not Rove originated it, the phrase still conveys metaphorically what Matthews and the Wilsons appear to think that Rove literally may have intended: to "target" (in Gregory's later terminology) Wilson and, collaterally, to leak the information about his wife's CIA identity in the process.  The [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] did not result in charging that anyone leaked her name intentionally while knowing that it was a classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] identity, in part, Special Counsel Fitzgerald later argued in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', because of Libby's [[obstruction of justice]].  The jury [[Conviction|convicted]] Libby on four of the five counts in the indictment: one count of [[obstruction of justice]]; two counts of [[perjury]]; and one count of [[making false statements]] to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]], he was sentenced on June 5, 2007, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his 30-month prison sentence on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=TheCounts&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html "I.

Libby}}

On July 3, 2007, the day after President Bush commuted Libby's sentence, [[Chris Matthews]] talked again with former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]], who reiterated his belief that the Bush administration had inappropriately leaked his wife's then-classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] CIA identity to retaliate against him politically, in effect targeting her. Matthews asked Wilson: "When did you sense that the White House was trying to destroy your reputation?" and he replied: "Well, it was pretty clear to me shortly after I wrote my article [[Joseph C. Wilson#"What I Didn't Find in Africa"|"What I Didn't Find in Africa"]], when Mr. Novak spoke to a friend of mine on the street and said that, Wilson's a 'blank,' and his wife works for the CIA, that the nature of the smear campaign they were going to run against me was going to include the betrayal of her identity as a covert CIA officer.  And that would have been around July 8 or July 9 [2003]."&lt;ref name=MatthewsJuly2007&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19618592/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for July 3, 5 p.m. ET"], ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated: July 5, 2007, 2:54 p.m. ET, accessed August 22, 2007.

====Subtitle====
The subtitle "My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House" corresponds to parts of the subtitle of the 2005 paperback edition of former Ambassador Wilson's memoir ''[[The Politics of Truth|Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]''.  Since her identity was leaked by Richard Armitage, then Deputy Secretary of State, the subtitles are not entirely accurate.

==Review excerpts==
[[Janet Maslin]]:
{{cquote|'Anyone not living in a cave for the last few years [since the outing in 2003] knew I had a career at the C.I.A.,' writes Ms. Wilson .... Once that career was destroyed, she wrote this account of her experiences as a means of both supporting herself and settling scores. She was contractually obligated to submit a draft of the book to the Central Intelligence Agency’s Publications Review Board. That draft came back heavily expurgated. She was then expected to rewrite her book so that it made sense despite many deletions.

But Ms. Wilson and her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, contend that much of the censored information is in the public domain—and that the suppression of information is itself part of Ms. Wilson's story. So ''Fair Game'' has been published with the censor's marks visible as blacked-out words, lines, paragraphs or pages. The publisher amplifies the book with an 80-page afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter, who uses matters of public record to fill in some of the gaps.

'My days of spelling "P-L-A-M as in Mary-E" over the phone would be over,' she writes in what is this book's biggest understatement. But however widely known she has become, Ms. Wilson has not previously revealed what it was like for her to follow the trial of [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis Libby Jr.]], known as Scooter; to be infuriated that [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], then of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' tried to protect secret sources at Ms. Wilson's expense ('These reporters were allowing themselves to be exploited by the administration and were obstructing the investigation'); and to learn that Ms. Miller, in her notebook, had gotten her name wrong, calling her "Valerie Flame" ('my exotic-dancer stage name,' Ms. Wilson joked to friends). She was outraged by the extent to which she had become fodder for the gossip mill.

Citing the dismay voiced by [[Ari Fleischer]], the [[White House]] press secretary, that such loose talk about an undercover agent might actually be criminal, she writes angrily: 'If he was so surprised that his actions might have adverse national security implications, then he's not smart enough to work in the White House. That goes for all the officials who thought that using my name as catnip was just playing the Washington game as usual.'

That idea of gamesmanship gives 'Fair Game,' the book's already stinging title, an even harsher meaning.}}

Alan Cooperman:
{{cquote|There is no reason to doubt that Wilson wrote ''Fair Game'' herself. To put it kindly, the memoir lacks the sheen of a ghostwriter's work and has the voice of an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events. It doesn't help that the CIA redacted the manuscript heavily before approving it for publication. Each time she is about to launch into a juicy anecdote, it seems, lines are blacked out, sometimes for pages on end.

The book is, however, greatly assisted by an afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter for the ''American Prospect''. Rozen faithfully echoes Wilson's point of view but fills in many of the censored dates, places and other details from published sources. Readers would be smart to turn to the afterword first, before tackling Wilson's disjointed narrative.}}

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, the book was adapted into [[Fair Game (2010 film)|a film]] starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Naomi Watts]] as Plame.

'''Fluency''' (also called '''volubility''' and '''eloquency''') is the property of a [[person]] or of a [[system]] that delivers [[information]] quickly and with [[expertise]].

== Language use ==
{{further|Language proficiency}}Language fluency is one of a variety of terms used to characterize or measure a person's language ability,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|last=González|first=Josué M.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781412937207|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in conjunction with accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58970182|title=Analysing learner language|author=Ellis, Rod|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Barkhuizen, Gary Patrick.|isbn=0194316343|location=Oxford|oclc=58970182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no widely agreed-upon definitions or measures of language fluency,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Francine|title=What do we mean by fluency?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00046-8|journal=System|volume=25|issue=4|pages=535–544|doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(97)00046-8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; someone is typically said to be fluent if their use of the [[language]] appears ''fluid'', or natural, coherent, and easy as opposed to slow, halting use.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; In other words, fluency is often described as the ability to [[Language production|produce language]] on demand and be understood.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

Varying definitions of fluency characterize it by the language user’s automaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=R.|date=1992|title=Psychological mechanisms underlying second language fluency|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=14|pages=357–385|via=|doi=10.1017/s0272263100011189}}&lt;/ref&gt; their speed and coherency of language use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual differences in language ability and language behavior|last=Fillmore|first=C. J.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=85–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the length and rate of their speech output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennon|first=P|date=1990|title=Investigating fluency in EFL: A quantitative approach|url=|journal=Language Learning|volume=40|pages=387–417|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1990.tb00669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories of automaticity postulate that more fluent language users can manage all of the components of language use without paying attention to each individual component of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaBerge|first=D|last2=Samuels|first2=S.

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:
* '''Reading fluency''' refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and [[reading comprehension]],&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt; which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt;  To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the [[vocabulary]] being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], who may struggle with reading fluency.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;
* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oral reading fluency''' is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.&lt;ref name=Rasinski&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasinski, T. V. |year=2006 |chapter=A brief history of reading fluency |editor1=Samuels, S. |author2=Farstrup, A. |title=What research has to say about fluency instruction |pages=70–93 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=International Reading Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral reading fluency is often linked to Schreiber’s Theory of Prosody, which places importance on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], rhythm, and expressiveness of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Peter A.|date=1991-06-01|title=Understanding prosody's role in reading acquisition|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405849109543496|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=30|issue=3|pages=158–164|doi=10.1080/00405849109543496|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Written or compositional fluency''' can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the [[Composition (language)|composition]] (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40664312|title=Second language development in writing : measures of fluency, accuracy, &amp; complexity|author1=Wolfe-Quintero, Kate|date=1998|publisher=Second Language Teaching &amp; Curriculum Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa|author2=Shunji, Inagaki |author3=Hae-Young, Kim|isbn=9780824820695|location=Honolulu|oclc=40664312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}
# Pre-production OR Silent/receptive
# Early production
# Speech emergence
# Intermediate fluency
# Advanced fluency.

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

Both disorders have breaks in the fluidity of speech, and both have the fluency breakdown of repetition of parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65617513|title=Stuttering and cluttering : frameworks for understanding and treatment|last=9-|first=Ward, David, 1956 December|date=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841693347|location=Hove [England]|oclc=65617513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In creativity ==

Studies in the assessment of creativity list fluency as one of the four primary elements in creative thinking, the others being flexibility, originality and elaboration.

[[File:Frederick William Everest, 1945.JPG|thumb|Frederick William Everest, 1945]]
'''Frederick William Everest''' (3 December 1910 - 24 January 1977) was an Australian murderer who killed two American servicemen in [[Brisbane]] during [[World War II]]. He was known as ''The Man in the Grey Suit''.

In 1945 aged 34 years old, Everest shot and killed two US military officers, Lt. Allen C. Middleton and Chief Petty Officer John David McCollum, who were among the many American forces stationed in Brisbane at the time.

==First murder==
Evererst killed Middleton on 11 January at a lavatory near the [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]]. A man was seen fleeing the scene of the crime in a grey suit and the killer became dubbed ''The Man in the Grey Suit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article98301526 |title=AUSSIE SEAMAN CHASED CITY KILLER. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=14 January 1945 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second murder==
He killed McCollom at Denman St Alderly on 24 January with a [[sawn-off shotgun]]. The police heard reports that shots had been fired in a house at Farrington Street, Alderley. A squad of detectives arrived but could not find anything. They went into adjoining street, Denman Street, and found McCollom had been shot in the abdomen. He told the detectives had opened the back door of a house he was renting in answer to a knock and had been shot. McCollom managed to give a description of the man then was taken to hospital, where he was operated on but died at 10pm.

Everest had been delivering bread in the local area. Police tracked him down and arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48941708 |title=LAVATORY KILLING. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=1 February 1945 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81416101 |title="MAN IN GREY". |newspaper=[[The Northern Miner]] |location=Charters Towers, Qld. |date=25 January 1945 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentencing==
Everest was a mentally ill returned soldier who believed that ''"those [[Yankee|Yanks]]"'' had tried to poison him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48971353 |title="I GOT IN FIRST", POLICE CLAIM THEY TOLD BY EVEREST. |newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=31 January 1945 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found to be mentally ill and spent the rest of his days in a mental hospital, initially [[Goodna Mental Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article98356068 |title=WARNING GIVEN— 24 HOURS AFTER. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=21 September 1952 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71458743 |title=EVEREST TO BE KEPT In Strict Custody. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=19 March 1945 |accessdate=14 May 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mohenjodaro Sindh.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|The Great Bath of the Indus Valley civilization]]

The '''Great Bath''' is one of the best-known structures among the ruins of the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]] at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in [[Sindh]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name="ancientindia_uk"&gt;[http://www.ancientindia.co.uk/indus/explore/sd_intro_b1.html SD Area]. Ancient Museum. British India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242946/Great-Bath Great Bath]." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 9 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Archaeological evidence indicates that the Great Bath was built in the 3rd millennium BC, soon after the raising of the "citadel" mound on which it is located.&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Upinder| authorlink = Upinder Singh|title=A history of ancient and early medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century |year=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-317-1120-0|pages=149–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;dq=Upinder+singh#v=onepage&amp;q=Great%20Bath&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Another view of the Great Bath]] 

The Great Bath of Mohenjo-daro is called the "earliest public water tank of the ancient world".&lt;ref name=Kenoyer&gt;{{cite web|last=Harappa|first=com|title='Great Bath' Mohenjadaro|url=http://www.harappa.com/indus/8.html|department=Slide show with description by J. M. Kenoyer|publisher=Harappa.com|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 11.88 × 7.01 metres, and has a maximum depth of 2.43 metres. Two wide staircases, one from the north and one from the south, served as the entry to the structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohenjodaro.net/greatbath25.html Great Bath, SD Area, looking north].&lt;/ref&gt; A one metre wide and 40 centimetres high mound is present at the ends of these stairs. A hole was also found at one end of the Bath which might have been used to drain the water into it.

The floor of the tank was watertight due to finely fitted bricks and mud laid on edge with a kind of plaster and the side walls were constructed in a similar manner. To make the tank even more watertight, a thick layer of [[bitumen]] (waterproof tar) was laid along the sides of the pool and presumably also on the floor. Brick colonnades were discovered on the eastern, northern and southern edges. The preserved columns had stepped edges that may have held wooden screens or window frames. Two large doors lead into the complex from the south and other access was from the north and east. A series of rooms were located along the eastern edge of the building and in one room was a well that may have supplied some of the water needed to fill the tank. Rainwater also may have been collected for the purpose, but no inlet drains have been found. It had a long bathing pool built with waterproof bricks.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars agree that this tank would have been used for special religious functions where water was used to purify and renew the well being of the bathers.&lt;ref name=Kenoyer/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===College of Priests===
Across the street of Great Bath, there was a large building with several rooms and three verandas, and two staircases leading to roof and upper floor. Considering the size and proximity to Great Bath, this building is tentatively termed as house of priests and labelled as "college of priests".&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt;

==Discovery==
It was found in 1926 during archaeological excavations.

==Currency of Pakistan==
The site of Mohenjo-daro is depicted in the [[Pakistani rupee]] 20 Rs note.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">'''Guy W. D. Cook''' (born 10 October 1951) is an [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]]. He is currently{{When|date=April 2011}} Professor of Language in Education at [[King's College London]] in the UK and is also Chair of The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] for the period 2009-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kcl.academia.edu/GuyCook |title=Guy Cook - King's College London |accessdate=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baal.org.uk/committee.html |title=Committee |publisher=British Association for Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches and writes about [[English language learning and teaching|English language teaching]], [[Stylistics (linguistics)|literary stylistics]], [[discourse analysis]], advertising, and the language of [[food politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://creet.open.ac.uk/projects/language-of-food-politics |title=The language of food politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known for three strands of research:

*on language teaching, where he has argued for a return to the use of translation and bilingual methods, and for a move away from what he considers to be dull functional approaches{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*on language play and creativity, not only in literature and genres such as advertising, but as a phenomenon which permeates language use, bringing with it educational, social, and cognitive benefits{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*on the language of food politics, in particular [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified]] (GM) and [[organic food]], where he has shown how the campaign for GM crops and food is in his belief unscientific, driven by partisan interests, and characterised by bullying tactics, irrational arguments, and emotive language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Career ==
Cook is a graduate of the [[University of Cambridge]], where he read English.  He holds a master's degree and a Ph.D. from the [[University of London]]. He worked initially as a language teacher in the UK, Egypt, Italy, and the Soviet Union, before beginning his academic career in 1985. He was a lecturer at the [[University of Leeds]] 1985-1991, head of Modern Languages and [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]] at the London University [[Institute of Education]] 1991-1998, Professor of Applied Linguistics at the [[University of Reading]] 1998-2004, and Professor of Language and Education at [[The Open University]] 2005-2012.  He was co-editor of the journal [[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]] from 2004-2009.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The area now comprising Hamamatsu has been settled since prehistoric times, with numerous remains from the [[Jōmon period]] and [[Kofun period]] having been discovered within the present city limits, including the [[Shijimizuka site]] [[shell mound]] and the [[Akamonue Kofun]] ancient tomb. In the [[Nara period]], it became the capital of [[Tōtōmi Province]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], [[Hamamatsu Castle]] was the home of future ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Hamamatsu flourished during the [[Edo period]] under a succession of ''[[daimyō]]'' rulers as a castle town, and as a post town on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]].

Hamamatsu consists of a flat plain and the Mikatahara Plateau in the south, and a mountainous area in the north. It is roughly bordered by [[Lake Hamana]] to the west, the [[Tenryū River]] to the east, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south.

=== Climate ===
[[File:View of mt fuji from hamamatsu.JPG|thumb|View of Mt. Fuji from Hamamatsu]]
The climate in southern Hamamatsu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with cool to mild winters with little snowfall; however, it is windy in winter because of the dry monsoon called ''[[Enshū no Karakaze]]'', which is unique to the region. The climate in northern Hamamatsu is much harsher because of [[foehn wind]]s. Summer is hot with the highest temperature often exceeds 35 degrees in the Tenryu-ku area, while it snows in winter.

The interpreters are not formal teachers, yet Tsutsumi Angela Aparecida of Hamamatsu's Burajiru Fureai Kai wrote that "[t]heir assistance 
has become very useful".&lt;ref name=Aparecidap218/&gt; Toshiko Sugino of the [[National Defense Academy of Japan]] wrote that the municipal and prefectural schools in Hamamatsu "follow traditional views of education and enforce rigid school rules" despite the reputation of open-mindedness in the residents of Hamamatsu, causing some foreigners to send their non-Japanese children to foreign private schools.&lt;ref name=Suginop4/&gt;

{{As of|2008}} many Brazilian parents have difficulty in deciding whether to send their children to Japanese schools or Brazilian schools, and it is common for Brazilian children attending Japanese schools to switch to a Brazilian school and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Aparecidap218/&gt; By 2010 many Brazilian parents had lost their jobs due to an economic decline, and many were unable to afford the Brazilian school annual tuitions of ¥30,000 to ¥40,000.&lt;ref name=FukueForeigners/&gt;

{{As of|2010}} about 50% of Brazilians of high school age in Hamamatsu [[Fushūgaku|do not attend high school]]. The inability to afford high school and difficulty with Japanese resulted in lower high school attendance rates. Hamamatsu NPO Network Center has made efforts to increase school attendance.&lt;ref name=FukueForeigners/&gt;

In Hamamatsu volunteers and a non-profit organization have established Japanese-language classes and native language classes for foreign children.&lt;ref name=Kitawakip8/&gt;

==Sports==
===Football===
* [[Honda FC]] which plays [[Japan Football League]] (third division) games at their own [[Miyakoda Soccer Stadium]]. Honda competed in the [[Japan Soccer League]]'s First Division from 1981 to 1991, but chose to relegate itself and not compete in the professional divisions due to parent company [[Honda]]'s choice to retain team ownership. Many Hamamatsu football fans prefer to follow [[Júbilo Iwata]], across the [[Tenryū River]] in [[Iwata, Shizuoka|Iwata]]. Júbilo maintains a club shop within Hamamatsu.
* [[Volare FC Hamamatsu]], an autonomous club who competed in the Tokai Regional Football League Division 2 in 2011, flouted plans to either overtake Honda FC or merge with it, but it finished last in the Tokai League and was relegated. [[Hamamatsu University]] also keeps a team in the said division, but college teams cannot be promoted to the top three tiers.

===Basketball===
* [[SAN-EN NeoPhoenix]] plays in the [[B.League]], Japan's first division of professional basketball. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyohashi City General Gymnasium]].

The [[Hamamatsu Arena]] was one of the host arenas of the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]].

The festival originated about 430 years ago, when the lord of Hamamatsu Castle celebrated the birth of his first son by flying kites. In the Meiji Era, the celebration of the birth of a first son by flying ''Hatsu Dako'', or the first kite, became popular, and this tradition has survived in the form of Hamamatsu Kite Festival. During the nights of Hamamatsu Kite Festival, people parade downtown carrying over 70 ''yatai'', or palace-lake floats, that are beautifully decorated while playing Japanese traditional festival music. The festival reaches its peak when groups representing the city's various districts compete by energetically marching through the downtown streets.

'''Italian irredentism in Corsica''' was a cultural and historical movement promoted by Italians and by [[Corsican people|people from]] [[Corsica]] who identified themselves as part of [[Italy]] rather than [[France]], and promoted the [[Italy|Italian]] annexation of the island.

==History==
Corsica was part of the [[Republic of Genoa]] for centuries until 1768, when the Republic ceded the island to [[France]], one year before the birth of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the capital city of [[Ajaccio]]. Under France, the use of [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a regional tongue which is closely related to [[Italian language|Italian]]) has gradually declined in favour of the standard [[French language]].  

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] called for the inclusion of the "Corsican Italians" within Italy when [[Rome]] was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy, but [[Victor Emmanuel II]] did not agree to it.

The course of Italian irredentism did not affect Corsica very much, and only during the Fascist rule of [[Benito Mussolini]] were the first organizations strongly promoting the unification of the island to the Kingdom of Italy founded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cg06.fr/culture/pdf/rr187-rivendicazionefascista.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War I]] in [[Livorno]], professor Francesco Guerri founded the review ''Corsica antica e moderna'', inspired on the ''Archivio storico di Corsica'' of [[Gioacchino Volpe]]. Petru Rocca created in the 1920s the ''Partito autonomista'' (Autonomist Party) of Corsica, of which he was the leader, with the support of monsignor Domenico Parlotti and dr. Croce, director of the "Archivi di Stato della Corsica".

Before and during [[World War II]], some Corsican intellectuals staged pro-Italian propaganda and cultural activities in Italy (mainly in the ''Gruppi di Cultura Corsa'' "Corsican culture Associations"). These included Marco Angeli, Bertino Poli, Marchetti, Luccarotti, Grimaldi, and finally Petru Giovacchini, that was later proposed as a possible governor of Corsica in case Italy had annexed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturniatellus.com/portale/viewtopic.php?p=8218 |title=SATVRNIA TELLVS :: Mostra argomento - Petru Giovacchini, un patriota esule in patria |publisher=Saturniatellus.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415080929/http://www.saturniatellus.com/portale/viewtopic.php?p=8218 |archivedate=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most renowned was [[Petru Giovacchini]], who considered [[Pasquale Paoli]] (the hero of Corsica) as the precursor of Corsican irredentism in favor of the unification of the island to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Mastroserio, Giuseppe. ''Petru Giovacchini – Un Patriota esule in Patria''. pag 114&lt;/ref&gt; The "Gruppi di Cultura Corsa" of Giovacchini reached a membership of 72,000 members by 1940, according to the historian R.H. Rainero.&lt;ref&gt;Rainero, R.H. ''Mussolini e Pétain. Storia dei rapporti tra l’Italia e la Francia di Vichy (10 giugno 1940-8 settembre 1943)'', page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1942 the VII Army Corps of the [[Regio Esercito (WWII)|Regio Esercito]] occupied Corsica as part of the German-led response to the Ally landings in Africa, leaving the island still under the formal sovereignty of Vichy France. Because of the lack of partisan resistance at first, and to avoid problems with Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], no Corsican units were formed under Italian control (except for a labour battalion formed in March 1943). However, a [[French Resistance|Resistance]] movement based on local inhabitants loyal to France and boosted by [[Free French]] leaders developed, opposing the irredentist propaganda and the Italian occupation, and was repressed by the fascist forces and subsequently by German troops.

Some irredentist Corsican military officials collaborated with Italy, including the retired Major Pantalacci (and his son Antonio), colonel Mondielli and colonel Petru Simone Cristofini (and his wife, the first Corsican female journalist [[Marta Renucci]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Vita e Tragedia dell'Irredentismo Corso'', Rivista Storia Verità&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Free French forces]] and Resistance forces, together with some Italian troops which sided with the Allies, retook Corsica, Petru Cristofini was executed in 1943. Of nearly 100 irrendentist collaborators (including intellectuals) put on trial by the French authorities in 1946, eight were sentenced to death, but none were executed.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Petru Giovacchini was also condemned to death, but fled to Italy where he found refuge until his death in 1955. Italian irredentism as an active movement in Corsica died out with him, though separate groups calling for autonomy and even independence from France, as well as a local terrorist organization ([[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica]]), are currently active.

===Pietro Cristofini===
Colonel [[Simon Petru Cristofini|Pietro Cristofini]] (or Petru Simon Cristofini) was born in Calenzana (near [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]], Corsica) on 26 May 1903 and in 1939 became a captain of the 3rd Algerian Fusiliers regiment. He was initially a supporter of Pétain. After the Allied occupation of French North Africa he commanded the ''[[Phalange Africaine]]''. 

In [[Tunisia]] he was wounded in one eye and then, before returning to Corsica, met [[Benito Mussolini]] in Rome. He was a supporter of the union of Corsica to Italy and defended irredentist ideals. He actively collaborated with Italian forces in Corsica during the first months of 1943. In the island he worked with [[Petru Giovacchini]] (the possible governor of Corsica if the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] had won the war). Cristofini, as head of the Ajaccio troops, helped the Italian Army to repress Resistance opposition in Corsica before the Italian Armistice in September 1943.

He was put on trial for treason after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retook Corsica, and sentenced to death. He tried to kill himself, and was executed while suffering from his wounds in November 1943. His wife, [[Marta Renucci]], was sentenced in 1946 to 15 years of jail in [[Algiers]] for supporting irredentism and for collaborating with Italian fascism, but served only a reduced sentence.

==Language==
While Corsican was spoken at home as a local vernacular, Italian had been the public and literary language on the island until the first half of the 19th century,. 

The [[Corsican Constitution|Constitution]], written in 1755 for the short-lived [[Corsican Republic]], was written in Italian and Paoli proclaimed Italian as the official language of Corsica. Italian was the "language of culture" in Corsica until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Blancac, C. ''La Corsica. Identità Etnico-Linguistica e Sviluppo'' p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Even Paoli's second Corsican Constitution, for the [[Anglo-Corsican Kingdom]] in 1794, was in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIDRP Cumpagnìa |url=http://www.pasqualepaoli.com/english/royaume.htm |title=The Kingdom Anglo-Corsican |publisher=Pasqualepaoli.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 19th century [[French language|French]] replaced Italian, mainly because of [[Napoleon III]]. Corsican started to be used by Corsican intellectuals. 

Modern [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (''Corsu'') is directly related to the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] dialect of [[Pisa]], an Italian city that dominated the island before [[Genoa]]. In the north of the island ([[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]]), there was a local dialect (now nearly extinct) very similar to medieval [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]]. In the mountainous interior of Corsica there is a significant number of villages where most inhabitants have some proficiency of Corsican, a medieval Pisan [[lect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreignaffairs.tripod.com/armillotta/pisa94_corsica.html |title=Giovanni Armillotta: "I vincoli ultramillenari fra Pisa e la Corsica" |publisher=Foreignaffairs.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719062550/http://foreignaffairs.tripod.com/armillotta/pisa94_corsica.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extreme similarity of Corsican to Italian can be seen in an example phrase:
&lt;br /&gt;Corsican:   ''Sò natu  in Corsica è g'aghju passatu i megli anni di a mio ghjuventù''
&lt;br /&gt;Italian: ''Sono nato in Corsica e ci ho passato i migliori anni della mia gioventù''
&lt;br /&gt;English: ''I was born in Corsica and I spent there the best years of my youth''

Nearly 12% of Corsicans can speak [[Italian language|Italian]], while three-quarters understand it thanks to the television programmes from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Vignoli, Giulio. ''Gli Italiani Dimenticati''. pag 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The irredentist [[Marco Angeli di Sartèna]] wrote the first book in Corsican (titled ''Terra còrsa'') in 1924 and many lyrics (titled ''Malincunie'') in [[Ajaccio]]. He created and wrote the newspaper «Gioventù» of the ''Partito Corso d'azione'' ("Corsican Action Party"), partially in Italian and Corsican.

==Pasquale Paoli and Italian irredentism==
[[File:Bonifacio Porte de Genes 2.jpg|thumb|right|The "Porta dei Genovesi" in [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], a city where some inhabitants still speak a genoese dialect]]

[[Pasquale Paoli]] was considered by Niccolo Tommaseo, who collected his ''Lettere'' (Letters), as one of the precursors of Italian [[Italia irredenta|irredentism]]. 

The ''Babbu di a Patria'' ("Homeland's father"), as Pasquale Paoli was nicknamed by the Corsican separatists, wrote in his Letters &lt;ref&gt;N. Tommaseo. "Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli" (in Archivio storico italiano, 1st series, vol. XI).&lt;/ref&gt; the following message in 1768 against the French: "We (Corsicans) are Italians by birth and feelings, but first of all we feel Italian by language, roots, customs, traditions and all the Italians are all brothers for History and for God.... As Corsicans we do not want to be slaves nor "rebels" and as Italians we have the right to be treated like all the other Italian brothers.... Either we'll be free or we'll be nothing.... Either we'll win or we'll die (against the French) with our weapons in our hands.... The war against France is  just and holy as the name of God is holy and just, and here on our mountains will appear for all Italy the sun of liberty." ("''Siamo còrsi per nascita e sentimento ma prima di tutto ci sentiamo italiani per lingua, origini, costumi, tradizioni e gli italiani sono tutti fratelli e solidali di fronte alla storia e di fronte a Dio… Come còrsi non vogliamo essere né schiavi né "ribelli" e come italiani abbiamo il diritto di trattare da pari con gli altri fratelli d’Italia… O saremo liberi o non saremo niente… O vinceremo con l’onore o soccomberemo (contro i francesi) con le armi in mano... La guerra con la Francia è giusta e santa come santo e giusto è il nome di Dio, e qui sui nostri monti spunterà per l’Italia il sole della libertà…''")

Pasquale Paoli wanted the Italian language to be the official language of his Corsican Republic. His [[Corsican Constitution]] of 1755 was in Italian and was used as a model for the [[American constitution]] of 1787. Furthermore, in 1765 Paoli founded in the city of [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] the first University of Corsica (where the teaching was done in Italian).

==Literature==
The Italian language, promoted by the Corsican Italians, had been the language of culture in Corsica since the [[Renaissance]]. Many Corsican authors wrote an extensive literature in Italian in the last centuries.

In the 14th century there was ''La Cronica'' of Giovanni della Grossa (1388-1464), Pier Antonio Monteggiani (1464-1525) and Marcantoni Ceccaldi (1526-1559). ''Storia di Corsica'' was published in 1594 by Anton Pietro Filippini. In the 15th and 16th centuries there were Ignazio Cardini (1566-1602), Pietro Cirneo (1447-1507), Guiglielmo Guglielmi di Orezza (1644-1728) with ''A Malannata'' and ''Ottave giocose''.

In the 18th century, the ''Accademia dei Vagabondi'' was founded in [[Bastia]], following the model of the Italian "Accademie". Angelo Francesco Colonna wrote ''Commentario delle glorie e prerogative del Regno e Popoli di Corsica'' in 1685.

During the Corsican Republic of Pasquale Paoli, there were Giulio Matteo Natali (''Disinganno intorno alla Guerra de Corsica'' in 1736), Don Gregorio Salvini (''Giustificazione della Revoluzione di Corsica (1758-1764)'') and the same [[Pasquale Paoli]] (''Corrispondenza'', published only in 1846).

During the 19th century in Bastia, Salvatore Viale wrote ''La Dionomachia'' in 1817, ''Canti popolari corsi'' in 1843 and ''Dell'uso della lingua patria in Corsica'' in 1858. 

Many Corsican authors (who wrote in Italian) were influenced by the ideals of the Italian [[Risorgimento]] during the second half of the 19th century, such as Giuseppe Multado, [[Gian Paolo Borghetti]], Francesco Ottaviano Renucci (''Storia della Corsica dal 1789 al 1830'' and ''Novelle storiche corse''). Even the Italian Nicolo Tommaseo collected the ''Canti popolari corsi'' (with points of view of Italian irredentism) and made a compilation of the letters (''Lettere di Pasquale de Paoli'') of Pasquale Paoli.

Santu Casanova founded the famous literary review ''A Tramuntana'' (published in Ajaccio between 1896 and 1914) and wrote in Italian ''Meraviglioso testamento di Francesco'' in 1875 and ''La morte ed il funerale di Spanetto'' in 1892. He is considered the link between the old generations of Corsican writers who wrote in Italian language and the new ones, who started to use the [[Corsican language]].

During the first half of the 20th century, the most important Corsican publication in Italian was the literary review ''A Muvra'' of Petru Rocca. Other Corsican authors in Italian were Domenicu Versini (nicknamed ''Maistrale''), Matteu Rocca (''I lucchetti'' in 1925), Dumenicu Carlotti (''Pampame corse'' in 1926), Ageniu Grimaldi and Ugo Babbiziu (''Una filza di francesismi colti nelle parlate dialettali corse'' in 1930).

The Corsican Italians who promoted the ideal of Corsican irredentism published mainly in Italy, because of the persecutions from the French regime in the island in the first half of the 20th century. 

Thus, [[Petru Giovacchini]] wrote the poems ''Musa Canalinca'' and ''Rime notturne'' in 1933 in Corsica, but successively wrote and published ''Aurore, poesie corse'', ''Corsica Nostra'' and ''Archiatri pontifici corsi'' in [[Rome]] (the last, while he was in exile in 1951, a few years before his premature death). 

The irredentist Marco Angeli published in [[Milan]] ''Gigli di Stagnu'' and  ''Liriche corse'' in 1934 and Bertino Poli wrote ''Il pensiero irredentista corso e le sue polemiche'' in [[Florence]] in 1940.

'''''Knocking Our Own Ting''''' is a pamphlet-length [[satire]] written by [[Evan X Hyde]] discussing the [[Battle of St. George's Caye]], a naval battle off the coast of [[Belize]] occurring in 1798.&lt;ref name="XCommunication"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hyde|first=Evan X|date=1995|title=X Communication: Selected Writings|location=Belize City|publisher=Angelus Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunez"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nunez|first1=Abdulmajeed|title=History of the Muslims in Belize|date=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, Indiana|isbn=1452018529|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; This battle has been celebrated since 1898 on September 10 as St. George's Caye Day. In the 1950s, Belizeans were beginning to question their identity and beliefs as a people, and one of the first things questioned was the "myth" of St. George's Caye. Did white master and black slave fight as equals? Or were blacks subordinates?

== Arguments ==
Hyde, already exposed to [[Black Power]] theory, argues that the Battle of St. George's Caye tends to divide Belizeans more than unify them. The combatants in the battle- white slavemasters and black slaves- are ancestors and forefathers of the various shades of [[Belizean Kriol people|Belizean Creole people]] and their Spanish (Mexican) opponents are forefathers of the [[Mestizo]]s. The glorifying of the slaves' efforts only further alienates Mestizo people from the development of Belize.

For Hyde, the 10th really celebrates the successful division of the Belizean people. He also questions how, after disciplining the runaway slaves from the slave revolt of 1773 harshly, the British decided to use them in fighting the hated Spanish, who had already succeeded in removing the Baymen from the settlement previously. Hyde also questions the relevancy of a holiday for Creole in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic society. He concludes that the Battle is better off celebrated for the achievements of the blacks, rather than any national pride attached to it, as long as Belize remained a colony of Great Britain (Belize became independent in 1981).

== Publishing ==
Benex Press issued the first edition of ''Knocking'' in 1969. It then went out of print until the publication of ''X-Communication'' by Angelus Press in 1995.

'''Kurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister''' (13 October 1893 – 8 July 1971) was a [[mathematician]] born in [[Braunschweig]] (Brunswick), [[German Empire|Germany]].

==Life==
He was a brother of [[Marie Neurath]].
Beginning in 1912, he studied in [[Freiburg]], [[Munich]], [[Marburg]], and [[G&amp;ouml;ttingen]]. In 1920, he got the [[staatsexamen]] (master's degree) in mathematics, philosophy, physics, chemistry, and geology.
He received his doctorate in 1921 with a [[thesis]] in [[algebraic number theory]] at the [[University of Hamburg]] under the supervision of [[Erich Hecke]].&lt;ref name="MacTutor"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Reidemeister}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JDMV"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rafael Artzy | title=Kurt Reidemeister 13.10.1893 &amp;mdash; 8.7.1971 | journal=Jber.

He became interested in [[differential geometry]]; he edited [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]'s 2nd volume about that issue,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Blaschke, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=ABN4015 ''Vorlesungen über Differentialgeometrie''], Springer, Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, 1921-1929, vol. 2: Affine Differentialgeometrie&lt;/ref&gt; and both made an acclaimed contribution to the Jena [[German Mathematical Society|DMV]] conference in Sep 1921.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=resolveppn&amp;PPN=PPN37721857X_0030 Jahresversammlung in Jena vom 18.&amp;mdash;25.

In October 1922&lt;ref name="JDMV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MathAnn"/&gt; (or 1923)&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; he was appointed assistant professor at the [[University of Vienna]]. While there he became familiar with the work of [[Wilhelm Wirtinger]] on [[knot theory]], and became closely connected to [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and the [[Vienna Circle]]. Its  manifesto (1929) lists one of Reidemeister's publications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kurt Reidemeister | title=Exaktes Denken | journal=Philos. Anz. | volume=3 | number= | pages=15&amp;mdash;47 | year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a bibliography of closely related authors.

In 1925 he became full professor at [[University of Königsberg]]; he stayed until 1933, when he was regarded politically unsound by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], and dismissed from his chair. 

Blaschke managed to get a promise about Reidemeister's reappointment, and in autumn 1934 he got the chair of [[Kurt Hensel]] in Marburg. He stayed there, except for a visit to the Princeton [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1948&amp;ndash;1950, until he got appointed to Göttingen University in 1955, where he stayed until his [[emeritus|emeritation]].&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JDMV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MathAnn"/&gt;

==Works==
Reidemeister's interests were mainly in [[combinatorial group theory]], [[combinatorial topology]], [[geometric group theory]], and the foundations of [[geometry]]. His books include ''Knoten und Gruppen'' (1926), ''Einführung in die kombinatorische Topologie'' (1932), and ''Knotentheorie'' (1932). He co-edited the journal ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' from 1947 until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN235181684_0274&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0002 Title page] of vol.274 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mircea Eliade''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmirt͡ʃe̯a eliˈade|lang}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 9|1907|February 24}} – April 22, 1986) was a [[Romania]]n historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. He was a leading interpreter of religious experience, who established [[paradigm]]s in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that ''[[Hierophany|hierophanies]]'' form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] space and time, has proved influential.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most influential contributions to religious studies was his theory of [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|''Eternal Return'']], which holds that myths and rituals do not simply commemorate hierophanies, but, at least to the minds of the religious, that the hierophanies actually participate in them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

His literary works belong to the [[fantastic]] and [[Autobiographical novel|autobiographical]] genres. The best known are the novels ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' ("La Nuit [[Bengal]]i" or "Bengal Nights"), ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' ("The Forbidden Forest"), ''Isabel și apele diavolului'' ("Isabel and the Devil's Waters") and ''[[Romanul Adolescentului Miop]]'' ("Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent"), the [[novella]]s ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' ("Miss Christina") and ''[[Youth Without Youth (novella)|Tinerețe fără tinerețe]]'' ("Youth Without Youth"), and the short stories ''[[Secretul doctorului Honigberger]]'' ("The Secret of Dr. Honigberger") and ''[[La Țigănci]]'' ("With the Gypsy Girls").

Early in his life, Eliade was a journalist and essayist, a disciple of Romanian [[far-right]] philosopher and journalist [[Nae Ionescu]], and a member of the literary society ''Criterion''. In the 1940s, he served as cultural attaché to the United Kingdom and Portugal. Several times during the late 1930s, Eliade publicly expressed his support for the [[Iron Guard]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] political organization. His political involvement at the time, as well as his other [[Far-right politics|far right]] connections, were frequently criticised after [[World War II]].

Noted for his vast erudition, Eliade had fluent command of five languages ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[English language|English]]) and a reading knowledge of three others ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Sanskrit]]). He was elected a posthumous member of the [[Romanian Academy]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Born in [[Bucharest]], he was the son of [[Romanian Land Forces]] officer Gheorghe Eliade (whose original surname was Ieremia)&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smihai"&gt;Silviu Mihai, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3920&amp;art=8997&amp;diraut=123&amp;cHash=ae6af0be58 "A doua viaţă a lui Mircea Eliade" ("Mircea Eliade's Second Life")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 6, 2006; retrieved July 31, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeana ''née'' Vasilescu.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"&gt;Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] believer, Gheorghe Eliade registered his son's birth four days before the actual date, to coincide with the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] feast of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Mircea Eliade had a sister, Corina, the mother of [[Semiotics|semiologist]] [[Sorin Alexandrescu]].&lt;ref name="scnostal"&gt;Simona Chiţan, "Nostalgia după România" ("Nostalgia for Romania"), interview with Sorin Alexandrescu, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; His family moved between [[Tecuci]] and Bucharest, ultimately settling in the capital in 1914,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and purchasing a house on Melodiei Street, near [[Piața Rosetti]], where Mircea Eliade resided until late in his teens.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"&gt;Sergio Vila-Sanjuán, [http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20070530/51355796343/paseo-por-el-bucarest-de-mircea-eliade.html "Paseo por el Bucarest de Mircea Eliade" ("Passing through Mircea Eliade's Bucharest")], in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', May 30, 2007 {{es icon}}; retrieved January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade kept a particularly fond memory of his childhood and, later in life, wrote about the impact various unusual episodes and encounters had on his mind. In one instance during the [[World War I]] [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], when Eliade was about ten years of age, he witnessed the bombing of Bucharest by [[German Empire|German]] [[zeppelin]]s and the [[Patriotism|patriotic]] fervor in the occupied capital at news that Romania was able to stop the [[Central Powers]]' advance into [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"&gt;[[Ion Hadârcă]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ "Mircea Eliade la începuturi" ("Mircea Eliade at His Beginnings")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108070458/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ |date=2007-11-08 }}, in ''Revista Sud-Est'', 1/2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described this stage in his life as marked by an unrepeatable [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"&gt;[[Ioan P. Culianu]], "Mahaparanirvana", in [http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp ''El Hilo de Ariadna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230010917/http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp |date=2007-12-30 }}, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling his entrance into a drawing room that an "eerie iridescent light" had turned into "a fairy-tale palace", he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I practiced for many years [the] exercise of recapturing that epiphanic moment, and I would always find again the same plenitude. I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Autobiography'', in Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion who did his graduate studies under Mircea Eliade,&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; saw this type of [[nostalgia]] as one of the most characteristic themes in Eliade's life and academic writings.&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and literary debut===
After completing his primary education at the school on Mântuleasa Street,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Eliade attended the [[Spiru Haret National College]] in the same class as [[Arșavir Acterian]], [[Haig Acterian]], and [[Petre Viforeanu]] (and several years the senior of [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], who eventually became a close friend of Eliade's).&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"&gt;Steinhardt, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other colleagues was future philosopher [[Constantin Noica]]&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and Noica's friend, future art historian [[Barbu Brezianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2004-03-13/%E2%80%9CAm+luat+din+intamplarile+vietii+tot+ce+este+mai+frumos%E2%80%9D,+spune+cercetatorul+operei+brancusiene " 'Am luat din întâmplarile vieţii tot ce este mai frumos', spune cercetatorul operei brâncuşiene" (" 'I Took the Best Out of Life's Occurrences', Says Researcher of Brancusi's Work")], interview with [[Barbu Brezianu]], in ''[[Curierul Naţional]]'', March 13, 2004; retrieved February 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Eliade was fascinated with the natural world, which formed the setting of his very first literary attempts,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; as well as with [[Romanian folklore]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as expressed by peasants.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; The young Eliade's interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue [[mountaineering]] and [[sailing]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; and he also joined the [[Cercetaşii României|Romanian Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Vlădescu, "100 de ani de cercetaşi" ("100 Years of Scouting"), in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

With a group of friends, he designed and sailed a boat on the [[Danube]], from [[Tulcea]] to the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Roman, ''Continental Drift: Colliding Continents, Converging Cultures'', [[CRC Press]], [[Institute of Physics Publishing]], Bristol and Philadelphia, 2000, p.60 {{ISBN|0-7503-0686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the idea that he was uglier and less virile than his colleagues.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; In order to cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and only slept four to five hours a night.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was the study of the [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Instead, he became interested in [[natural science]] and [[chemistry]], as well as the [[occult]],&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and wrote short pieces on [[Entomology|entomological]] subjects.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite his father's concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; One of his favorite authors was [[Honoré de Balzac]], whose work he studied carefully.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also became acquainted with the [[Modernism|modernist]] short stories of [[Giovanni Papini]] and [[social anthropology]] studies by [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

His interest in the two writers led him to learn [[Italian language|Italian]] and English in private, and he also began studying [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At the time, Eliade became acquainted with [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]'s poems and the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; He was also interested in philosophy—studying, among others, [[Socrates]], [[Vasile Conta]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Epictetus]], and read works of history—the two Romanian historians who influenced him from early on were [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; His first published work was the 1921 ''Inamicul viermelui de mătase'' ("The Silkworm's Enemy"),&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; followed by ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'' ("How I Found the [[Philosopher's stone|Philosophers' Stone]]").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Four years later, Eliade completed work on his debut volume, the autobiographical ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

===University studies and Indian sojourn===

[[File:Mircea Eliade young.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eliade in 1933]]
Between 1925 and 1928, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1928, earning his diploma with a study on Early Modern [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; In 1927, Eliade traveled to Italy, where he met Papini&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and collaborated with the scholar [[Giuseppe Tucci]].

It was during his student years that Eliade met [[Nae Ionescu]], who lectured in [[Logic]], becoming one of his disciples and friends.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.954, 955; Nastasă, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially attracted to Ionescu's radical ideas and his interest in religion, which signified a break with the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition represented by senior academics such as [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Dimitrie Gusti]], and [[Tudor Vianu]] (all of whom owed inspiration to the defunct literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', albeit in varying degrees).&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Eliade's scholarly works began after a long period of study in [[British India]], at the [[University of Calcutta]]. Finding that the [[Maharaja]] of [[Kassimbazar]] sponsored [[Europe]]an scholars to study in India, Eliade applied and was granted an allowance for four years, which was later doubled by a Romanian [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"&gt;Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1928, he sailed for [[Calcutta]] to study [[Sanskrit]] and philosophy under [[Surendranath Dasgupta]], a [[Bengal]]i [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge alumnus]] and professor at Calcutta University, the author of a five volume ''History of Indian Philosophy''. Before reaching the [[Indian subcontinent]], Eliade also made a brief visit to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Once there, he visited large areas of the region, and spent a short period at a [[Himalaya]]n ''[[ashram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied the basics of [[Indian philosophy]], and, in parallel, learned Sanskrit, [[Pali]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] under Dasgupta's direction.&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"/&gt; At the time, he also became interested in the actions of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], whom he met personally,&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"&gt;Kelley L. Ross, [http://www.friesian.com/eliade.htm ''Mircea Eliade''], on [http://www.friesian.com/ friesian.com]; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Satyagraha]]'' as a phenomenon; later, Eliade adapted Gandhian ideas in his discourse on spirituality and Romania.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;

In 1930, while living with Dasgupta, Eliade fell in love with his host's daughter, [[Maitreyi Devi]], later writing a barely disguised autobiographical novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' (also known as "La Nuit Bengali" or "Bengal Nights"), in which he claimed that he carried on a physical relationship with her.&lt;ref name="kamani"&gt;Ginu Kamani, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/143651.html "A Terrible Hurt: The Untold Story behind the Publishing of Maitreyi Devi"], at the University of Chicago Press website; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade received his [[PhD]] in 1933, with a thesis on [[Yoga]] practices.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ribas"&gt;Albert Ribas, "Mircea Eliade, historiador de las religiones" ("Mircea Eliade, Historian of Religions"), in ''El Ciervo.

He later recalled that the book was an early step for understanding not just Indian religious practices, but also Romanian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Nastasă, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, Eliade began a correspondence with the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]]-born philosopher [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"&gt;McGuire, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936–1937, he functioned as honorary assistant for Ionescu's course, lecturing in [[Metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442; Ornea, p.452&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Mircea Eliade had a physical relationship with the actress Sorana Țopa, while falling in love with Nina Mareș, whom he ultimately married.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=16282&amp;print=true "Jurnalul unui om mare" ("The Diary of A Big Man")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 338, September 2006; retrieved January 23, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, introduced to him by his new friend [[Mihail Sebastian]], already had a daughter, Giza, from a man who had divorced her.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Eliade subsequently adopted Giza,&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"&gt;Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; and the three of them moved to an apartment at 141 [[Dacia Boulevard]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He left his residence in 1936, during a trip he made to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], when he first visited [[London]], [[Oxford]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===''Criterion'' and ''Cuvântul''===
[[File:Casa lui Eliade.jpg|thumb|250px|Eliade's home in [[Bucharest]] (1934–1940)]]
After contributing various and generally polemical pieces in university magazines, Eliade came to the attention of journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], who invited him to collaborate on the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] paper ''[[Cuvântul]]'', which was noted for its harsh tones.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, ''Cuvântul'' was also hosting articles by Ionescu.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

As one of the figures in the ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'' [[literary society]] (1933–1934), Eliade's initial encounter with the traditional [[far right]] was polemical: the group's conferences were stormed by members of [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[National-Christian Defense League]], who objected to what they viewed as [[pacifism]] and addressed [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] insults to several speakers, including Sebastian;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.150–151, 153&lt;/ref&gt; in 1933, he was among the signers of a manifesto opposing [[Nazi Germany]]'s state-enforced [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.174–175&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, at a time when Sebastian was publicly insulted by Nae Ionescu, who prefaced his book (''De două mii de ani...'') with thoughts on the "eternal damnation" of Jews, Mircea Eliade spoke out against this perspective, and commented that Ionescu's references to the verdict "[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Outside the Church there is no salvation]]" contradicted the notion of God's [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408; see also Ellwood, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contended that Ionescu's text was not evidence of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408–409&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, reflecting on the early history of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] and its [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]], he deplored the expulsion of Jewish savants from Romanian soil, making specific references to [[Moses Gaster]], [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] and [[Lazăr Șăineanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's views at the time focused on innovation—in the summer of 1933, he replied to an anti-[[Modernism|modernist]] critique written by [[George Călinescu]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All I wish for is a deep change, a complete transformation. But, for God's sake, in any direction other than [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He and friends [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] were by then under the influence of [[Trăirism]], a school of thought that was formed around the ideals expressed by Ionescu. A form of [[existentialism]], Trăirism was also the synthesis of traditional and newer [[right-wing]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, a public polemic was sparked between Eliade and [[Camil Petrescu]]: the two eventually reconciled and later became good friends.&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt;

Like Mihail Sebastian, who was himself becoming influenced by Ionescu, he maintained contacts with intellectuals from all sides of the political spectrum: their entourage included the right-wing [[Dan Botta]] and [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], the non-political Petrescu and [[Ionel Jianu]], and [[Belu Zilber]], who was a member of the illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=569&amp;nr=2003-08-18 "Belu Zilber", Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010402/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-18&amp;art=569 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 701, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also included [[Haig Acterian]], [[Mihail Polihroniade]], [[Petru Comarnescu]], [[Marietta Sadova]] and [[Floria Capsali]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"&gt;[[Andrei Oişteanu]], [https://archive.is/20071019121943/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-12-05&amp;art=4157 "Mihail Sebastian şi Mircea Eliade: cronica unei prietenii accidentate" ("Mihail Sebastian and Mircea Eliade: the Chronicle of an Abrupt Friendship)"], in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 926, December 2007; retrieved January 18, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also close to [[Mihail (Marcel) Avramescu|Marcel Avramescu]], a former [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] writer whom he introduced to the works of [[René Guénon]].&lt;ref name="pccheie"&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=8679&amp;print=true "Eliade în cheie ezoterică" ("Eliade in Esoterical Key")], review of Marcel Tolcea, ''Eliade, ezotericul'' ("Eliade, the Esoteric"), in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 175, July 2003; retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor in the [[Kabbalah]] and future [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] cleric, Avramescu joined Eliade in editing the short-lived [[Esotericism|esoteric]] magazine ''Memra'' (the only one of its kind in Romania).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14626 "Recuperarea lui Ionathan X.

Among the intellectuals who attended his lectures were [[Mihai Şora]] (whom he deemed his favorite student), [[Eugen Schileru]] and [[Miron Constantinescu]]—known later as, respectively, a philosopher, an art critic, and a sociologist and political figure of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; [[Mariana Şora|Mariana Klein]], who became Șora's wife, was one of Eliade's female students, and later authored works on his scholarship.&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt;

Eliade later recounted that he had himself enlisted Zilber as a ''Cuvântul'' contributor, in order for him to provide a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective on the issues discussed by the journal.&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt; Their relation soured in 1935, when the latter publicly accused Eliade of serving as an agent for the secret police, ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' (Sebastian answered to the statement by alleging that Zilber was himself a secret agent, and the latter eventually retracted his claim).&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt;

===1930s political transition===
Eliade's articles before and after his adherence to the principles of the [[Iron Guard]] (or, as it was usually known at the time, the ''Legionary Movement''), beginning with his ''Itinerar spiritual'' ("Spiritual Itinerary", serialized in ''Cuvântul'' in 1927), center on several political ideals advocated by the far right.

They displayed his rejection of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberalism]] and the [[Modernization|modernizing]] goals of the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]] (perceived as "an abstract apology of Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and "ape-like imitation of [Western] Europe"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[democracy]] itself (accusing it of "managing to crush all attempts at national renaissance",&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and later praising [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] on the grounds that, according to Eliade, "[in Italy,] he who thinks for himself is promoted to the highest office in the shortest of times").&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"/&gt; He approved of an [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] state centered on the Orthodox Church (in 1927, despite his still-vivid interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], he recommended young [[intellectual]]s "the return to the Church"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1927, in Ornea, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; which he opposed to, among others, the [[Secularism|secular]] nationalism of [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]];&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1935, in Ornea, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to this particular ideal as "Romanianism", Eliade was, in 1934, still viewing it as "neither fascism, nor [[chauvinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was especially dissatisfied with the incidence of unemployment among intellectuals, whose careers in state-financed institutions had been rendered uncertain by the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, pp. 178, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Eliade was the focus of a campaign in the far right press, being targeted for having authored "[[pornography]]" in his ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' and ''Isabel și apele diavolului''; similar accusations were aimed at other cultural figures, including [[Tudor Arghezi]] and [[Geo Bogza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 445–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessments of Eliade's work were in sharp contrast to one another: also in 1936, Eliade accepted an award from the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], of which he had been a member since 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, pp. 525–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 1937, through an official decision which came as a result of the accusations, and despite student protests, he was stripped of his position at the University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 86; Ornea, pp. 452–53; Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade decided to sue the [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], asking for a symbolic compensation of 1 [[Romanian leu|leu]].&lt;ref name= "Ornea, p.453"&gt;Ornea, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; He won the trial, and regained his position as Nae Ionescu's assistant.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.453" /&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1937, he gave his intellectual support to the Iron Guard, in which he saw "a [[Christianity|Christian]] revolution aimed at creating a new Romania",&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and a group able "to reconcile Romania with God".&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203" /&gt; His articles of the time, published in Iron Guard papers such as ''Sfarmă Piatră'' and ''[[Buna Vestire]]'', contain ample praises of the movement's leaders ([[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Ion Moţa]], [[Vasile Marin]], and [[Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202–206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"&gt;[[Ovidiu Şimonca]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 "Mircea Eliade şi 'căderea în lume'" ("Mircea Eliade and 'the Descent into the World'")] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222064543/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 |date=2012-12-22 }}, review of Florin Ţurcanu, ''Mircea Eliade.

Stahl]] and future dramatist [[Eugène Ionesco]], as well as Sebastian.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually enrolled in the ''Totul pentru Țară'' ("Everything for the Fatherland" Party), the political expression of the Iron Guard,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"&gt;Ornea, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to its [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 electoral campaign]] in [[Prahova County]]—as indicated by his inclusion on a list of party members with [[Counties of Romania|county]]-level responsibilities (published in ''Buna Vestire'').&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"/&gt;

===Internment and diplomatic service===
The stance taken by Eliade resulted in his arrest on July 14, 1938 after a crackdown on the Iron Guard authorized by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. At the time of his arrest, he had just interrupted a column on ''Provincia și legionarismul'' ("The Province and Legionary Ideology") in ''[[Vremea]]'', having been singled out by [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Armand Călinescu]] as an author of Iron Guard [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.208–209&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was kept for three weeks in a cell at the ''[[Siguranţa Statului]]'' Headquarters, in an attempt to have him sign a "declaration of dissociation" with the Iron Guard, but he refused to do so.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"&gt;Ornea, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of August he was transferred to a makeshift camp at [[Miercurea-Ciuc]]. When Eliade began coughing blood in October 1938, he was taken to a clinic in [[Moroeni]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt; Eliade was simply released on November 12, and subsequently spent his time writing his play ''Iphigenia'' (also known as ''Ifigenia'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In April 1940, with the help of [[Alexandru Rosetti]], became the Cultural Attaché to the [[United Kingdom]], a posting cut short when Romanian-British foreign relations were broken.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt;

After leaving London he was assigned the office of Counsel and [[Press secretary|Press Officer]] (later Cultural Attaché) to the Romanian Embassy in [[Portugal]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"&gt;[[Cătălin Avramescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=135&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=3508 "Citim una, înţelegem alta" ("We Read One Thing and Understand Another")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. III, August 2006; retrieved January 28, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"&gt;[[Michael Löwy]], [http://assr.revues.org/document3128.html Review of Daniel Dubuisson, ''Impostures et pseudo-science.

His office involved disseminating propaganda in favor of the Romanian state.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; In February 1941, weeks after the bloody [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] was crushed by Antonescu, ''Iphigenia'' was staged by the [[National Theater Bucharest]]—the play soon raised doubts that it owed inspiration to the Iron Guard's ideology, and even that its inclusion in the program was a Legionary attempt at subversion.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

In 1942, Eliade authored a volume in praise of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'', established in Portugal by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]],&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mesalaz"&gt;Eliade, ''Salazar'', in "Eliade despre Salazar" ("Eliade on Salazar"), ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', October 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "The Salazarian state, a Christian and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] one, is first and foremost based on love".&lt;ref name="mesalaz"/&gt; On July 7 of the same year, he was received by Salazar himself, who assigned Eliade the task of warning Antonescu to withdraw the [[Romanian Army]] from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ("[In his place], I would not be grinding it in [[Russia]]").&lt;ref name="in Handoca"&gt;Eliade, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade also claimed that such contacts with the leader of a neutral country had made him the target for [[Gestapo]] surveillance, but that he had managed to communicate Salazar's advice to [[Mihai Antonescu]], Romania's [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt;

In autumn 1943, he traveled to [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]], where he rejoined [[Emil Cioran]], also meeting with scholar [[Georges Dumézil]] and the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] writer [[Paul Morand]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; At the same time, he applied for a position of lecturer at the [[University of Bucharest]], but withdrew from the race, leaving [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Ion Zamfirescu]] to dispute the position, in front of a panel of academics comprising [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Dimitrie Gusti]] (Zamfirescu's eventual selection, going against Blaga's recommendation, was to be the topic of a controversy).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442–443&lt;/ref&gt; In his private notes, Eliade wrote that he took no further interest in the office, because his visits abroad had convinced him that he had "something great to say", and that he could not function within the confines of "a minor culture".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Also during the war, Eliade traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met and conversed with controversial political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and frequently visited [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]], where he notably attended the 1944 Lusitano-Spanish scientific congress in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jgspania"&gt;Joaquín Garrigós, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=191&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=6740 "Pasiunea lui Mircea Eliade pentru Spania" ("Mircea Eliade's Passion for Spain")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. IV, October 2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"&gt;[[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-05-11&amp;art=3719 "Mircea Eliade, de la opium la amfetamine" ("Mircea Eliade, from Opium to Amphetamines")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516220935/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3719&amp;nr=2007-05-11 |date=2007-05-16 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 896, May 2007; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his trips to Spain that Eliade met philosophers [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Eugeni d'Ors]].

Nina Eliade fell ill with [[uterine cancer]] and died during their stay in [[Lisbon]], in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, the disease was probably caused by an [[abortion]] procedure she had undergone at an early stage of their relationship.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; He came to suffer from [[clinical depression]], which increased as Romania and her [[Axis Powers|Axis]] allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a [[monk]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; he was on a continuous search for effective [[antidepressant]]s, medicating himself with [[passion flower]] extract, and, eventually, with [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking [[opium]] during his travels to [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Later, discussing the works of [[Aldous Huxley]], Eliade wrote that the British author's use of [[mescaline]] as a source of inspiration had something in common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was "needless to explain why that is".&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

===Early exile===
At signs that the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] was about to take hold, Eliade opted not to return to the country.

Together with [[Emil Cioran]] and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat [[Alexandru Busuioceanu]], helping him publicize [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] opinion to the [[Western Europe]]an public.&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"&gt;Dan Gulea, [https://archive.is/20130113115235/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=12070 "O perspectivă sintetică" ("A Syncretic Perspective")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 242, October 2004; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly involved in publishing a Romanian-language magazine, titled ''Luceafărul'' ("The Morning Star"),&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"/&gt; and was again in contact with [[Mihail Șora]], who had been granted a [[scholarship]] to study in France, and with Șora's wife [[Mariana Şora|Mariana]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] found him a job as a [[French language|French-language]] teacher in the [[United States]], at a school in [[Arizona]]; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September.&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt;

Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal ''Critique'', edited by French philosopher  [[Georges Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' (he visited the country a third time in 1952).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He collaborated with [[Carl Jung]] and the ''[[Eranos]]'' circle after [[Henry Corbin]] recommended him in 1949,&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt; and wrote for the ''Antaios'' magazine (edited by [[Ernst Jünger]]).&lt;ref name="ribas"/&gt; In 1950, Eliade began attending ''Eranos'' conferences, meeting Jung, [[Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn]], [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Paul Radin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150–151&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''Eranos'' as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world."&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"&gt;McGuire, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Mircea Eliade became a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He also worked as editor-in-chief of [[Macmillan Publishers]]' ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', and, in 1968, lectured in religious history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during that period that Mircea Eliade completed his voluminous and influential ''History of Religious Ideas'', which grouped together the overviews of his main original interpretations of religious history.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He occasionally traveled out of the United States, such as attending the Congress for the History of Religions in [[Marburg]] (1960) and visits to [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
Initially, Eliade was attacked with virulence by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] press, chiefly by ''[[România Liberă]]''—which described him as "the Iron Guard's ideologue, [[Enemy of the people|enemy of the working class]], apologist of Salazar's dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;''România Liberă'', ''passim'' September–October 1944, in Frunză, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regime also made secretive attempts to enlist his and Cioran's support: [[Haig Acterian]]'s widow, theater director [[Marietta Sadova]], was sent to Paris in order to re-establish contacts with the two.&lt;ref name="tismetern"&gt;[[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'' (Romanian translation of ''Stalinism for All Seasons''), [[Polirom]], Iaşi, 2005, p.187, 337. {{ISBN|973-681-899-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the move was planned by Romanian officials, her encounters were to be used as evidence incriminating her at a February 1960 trial for treason (where [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Dinu Pillat]] were the main defendants).&lt;ref name="tismetern"/&gt; Romania's secret police, the [[Securitate]], also portrayed Eliade as a spy for the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and a former agent of the Gestapo.&lt;ref name="zfscriit"&gt;Alexandru Popescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html "Scriitorii şi spionajul" ("Writers and Spying")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185224/http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html |date=2008-02-15 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', January 26, 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was slowly [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] at home beginning in the early 1960s, under the rule of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.448–449&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Eliade was approached by the [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime in several ways, in order to have him return.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; The move was prompted by the officially sanctioned nationalism and Romania's claim to independence from the [[Eastern Bloc]], as both phenomena came to see Eliade's prestige as an asset. An unprecedented event occurred with the interview that was granted by Mircea Eliade to poet [[Adrian Păunescu]], during the latter's 1970 visit to Chicago; Eliade complimented both Păunescu's activism and his support for official tenets, expressing a belief that
&lt;blockquote&gt;the youth of Eastern Europe is clearly superior to that of Western Europe. [...] I am convinced that, within ten years, the young revolutionary generation shan't be behaving as does today the noisy minority of [[New Left|Western contesters]]. [...] Eastern youth have seen the abolition of traditional institutions, have accepted it [...] and are not yet content with the structures enforced, but rather seek to improve them.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1970, in [[Paul Cernat]], "Îmblânzitorul României Socialiste. De la Bîrca la Chicago şi înapoi" ("The Tamer of Socialist Romania. From Bîrca to Chicago and Back"), part of Paul Cernat, Ion Manolescu, Angelo Mitchievici, Ioan Stanomir, ''Explorări în comunismul românesc'' ("Forays into Romanian Communism"), [[Polirom]], Iaşi, 2004, p.346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Păunescu's visit to Chicago was followed by those of the nationalist official writer [[Eugen Barbu]] and by Eliade's friend Constantin Noica (who had since been released from jail).&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; At the time, Eliade contemplated returning to Romania, but was eventually persuaded by fellow Romanian intellectuals in exile (including [[Radio Free Europe]]'s [[Virgil Ierunca]] and [[Monica Lovinescu]]) to reject Communist proposals.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In 1977, he joined other exiled Romanian intellectuals in signing a telegram protesting the repressive measures newly enforced by the Ceauşescu regime.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Writing in 2007, Romanian anthropologist [[Andrei Oișteanu]] recounted how, around 1984, the Securitate unsuccessfully pressured to become an [[agent of influence]] in Eliade's Chicago circle.&lt;ref name="teodoist"&gt;Cristian Teodorescu, [http://cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=11526&amp;art=30480&amp;cHash=19a3e7c987 "Eliade şi Culianu prin ocheanul lui Oişteanu" ("Eliade and Culianu through Oişteanu's Lens")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 14, 2007; retrieved November 7, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his later years, Eliade's fascist past was progressively exposed publicly, the stress of which probably contributed to the decline of his health.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, his writing career was hampered by severe [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; The last academic honors bestowed upon him were the [[Académie française|French Academy]]'s [[Bordin Prize]] (1977) and the title of ''[[Honorary degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]]'', granted by the [[University of Washington]] (1985).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

Mircea Eliade died at the [[Bernard Mitchell Hospital]] in April 1986. Eight days previously, he suffered a [[stroke]] while reading [[Emil Cioran]]'s ''Exercises of Admiration'', and had subsequently lost his speech function.&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; Four months before, a fire had destroyed part of his office at the [[Meadville Lombard Theological School]] (an event which he had interpreted as an [[omen]]).&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; Eliade's Romanian disciple [[Ioan Petru Culianu]], who recalled the scientific community's reaction to the news, described Eliade's death as "a ''[[Paranirvana|mahaparanirvana]]''", thus comparing it to the passing of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; His body was [[Cremation|cremated]] in Chicago, and the funeral ceremony was held on University grounds, at the [[Rockefeller Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; It was attended by 1,200 people, and included a public reading of Eliade's text in which he recalled the [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] of his childhood—the lecture was given by novelist [[Saul Bellow]], Eliade's colleague at the University.&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; His grave is located in [[Oak Woods Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/news/eveniment/mae-repatrierea-cioran-eliade-brancusi-romania-diminua-semnificativ-afluxul-turisti-1_50ad0f8d7c42d5a6638e1191/index.html "MAE: Repatrierea lui Cioran, Eliade şi Brâncuşi în România ar diminua semnificativ afluxul de turişti" ("Foreign Affairs Ministry: Repatriation to Romania of Cioran, Eliade and Brâncuşi Would Significantly Diminish Tourist Arrivals")], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', April 11, 2011; retrieved May 21, 2014 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===The general nature of religion===
In his work on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on [[Alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;'Eliade offers a theoretical background for understanding alchemy from the perspective of  the history of  religion. Alchemy is a spiritual technique and can be understood not as an important moment in the history of  science but rather as a kind of  religious phenomenon with its own particular rules.' {{Cite book|last = Calian |first = George Florin |title = Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy | url=https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up | publisher = Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU |location = Budapest|year = 2010 |page = 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shamanism]], [[Yoga]] and what he called the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that [[Religious behaviour|religious behavior]] is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by [[Rudolf Otto]], [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]], [[Nae Ionescu]] and the writings of the [[Traditionalist School]] ([[René Guénon]] and [[Julius Evola]]).&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; For instance, Eliade's ''The Sacred and the Profane'' partially builds on Otto's ''[[Numinous|The Idea of the Holy]]'' to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.

Eliade is known for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths. [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that "Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Doniger's foreword to Eliade's ''Shamanism'' (Princeton University Press edition, 1972, p.xii)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Treatise on the History of Religions'' was praised by French philologist [[Georges Dumézil]] for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, "Introducere", in Eliade, ''Tratat de istorie a religiilor: Introducere'' ("Religious History Treatise" – ''Patterns in Comparative Religion''), [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Ellwood describes Eliade's approach to religion as follows. Eliade approaches religion by imagining an ideally "religious" person, whom he calls ''homo religiosus'' in his writings. Eliade's theories basically describe how this ''homo religiosus'' would view the world.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"&gt;Ellwood, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all religious practitioners actually think and act like ''homo religiosus''. Instead, it means that religious behavior "says through its own language" that the world is as ''homo religiosus'' would see it, whether or not the real-life participants in religious behavior are aware of it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"&gt;Ellwood, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood writes that Eliade "tends to slide over that last qualification", implying that traditional societies actually thought like ''homo religiosus''.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"/&gt;

====Sacred and profane====
[[File:Mosesshoesspeculum.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Moses]] taking off his shoes in front of the [[burning bush]] (illustration from a 16th-century edition of the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'').]]
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the Indian and [[China|Chinese]] mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

Eliade's understanding of religion centers on his concept of [[hierophany]] (manifestation of the Sacred)—a concept that includes, but is not limited to, the older and more restrictive concept of [[theophany]] (manifestation of a god).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20–22; ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of religious thought, Eliade argues, hierophanies give structure and orientation to the world, establishing a sacred order. The "profane" space of nonreligious experience can only be divided up geometrically: it has no "qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation [is] given by virtue of its inherent structure".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, profane space gives man no pattern for his behavior. In contrast to profane space, the site of a hierophany has a sacred structure to which religious man conforms himself. A hierophany amounts to a "revelation of an absolute reality, opposed to the non-reality of the vast surrounding expanse".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "[[hierotopy|sacred space]]" demanding a certain response from man, Eliade gives the story of [[Moses]] halting before [[Yahweh]]'s manifestation as a [[burning bush]] (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' 3:5) and taking off his shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin myths and sacred time====
Eliade notes that, in traditional societies, myth represents the absolute truth about primordial time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt; According to the myths, this was the time when the Sacred first appeared, establishing the world's structure—myths claim to describe the primordial events that made society and the natural world be that which they are. Eliade argues that all myths are, in that sense, origin myths: "myth, then, is always an account of a ''creation''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believe that the power of a thing lies in its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; If origin is equivalent to power, then "it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt; (a thing's reality and value therefore lies only in its first appearance).

According to Eliade's theory, only the Sacred has value, only a thing's first appearance has value and, therefore, only the Sacred's first appearance has value. Myth describes the Sacred's first appearance; therefore, the mythical age is sacred time,&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt; the only time of value: "primitive man was interested only in the ''beginnings'' [...] to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade postulated this as the reason for the "[[nostalgia]] for origins" that appears in many religions, the desire to return to a primordial [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"/&gt;

====Eternal return and "Terror of history"====
{{Main|Eternal return (Eliade)}}
Eliade argues that traditional man attributes no value to the linear march of historical events: only the events of the mythical age have value. To give his own life value, traditional man performs myths and rituals. Because the Sacred's essence lies only in the mythical age, only in the Sacred's first appearance, any later appearance is actually the first appearance; by recounting or re-enacting mythical events, myths and rituals "re-actualize" those events.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade often uses the term "[[archetype]]s" to refer to the mythical models established by the Sacred, although Eliade's use of the term should be distinguished from the use of the term in [[Jungian psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, "Archetypes"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, argues Eliade, religious behavior does not only commemorate, but also participates in, sacred events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''imitating'' the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade called this concept the "[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]" (distinguished from the [[Eternal return|philosophical concept of "eternal return"]]). Wendy Doniger noted that Eliade's theory of the eternal return "has become a truism in the study of religions".&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

Eliade attributes the well-known "cyclic" vision of time in ancient thought to belief in the eternal return. For instance, the [[New Year]] ceremonies among the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and other [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] peoples re-enacted their [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] myths. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ceremony ''was'' the beginning of the world for these peoples. According to Eliade, these peoples felt a need to return to the Beginning at regular intervals, turning time into a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality, p.47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a "terror of history": traditional man desires to escape the linear succession of events (which, Eliade indicated, he viewed as empty of any inherent value or sacrality). Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its "terror", is one of the reasons for modern man's anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', Chapter 4; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.231–245&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time.

====''Coincidentia oppositorum''====
Eliade claims that many myths, rituals, and mystical experiences involve a "coincidence of opposites", or ''[[coincidentia oppositorum]]''. In fact, he calls the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' "the mythical pattern".&lt;ref&gt;In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'' (p.419), Eliade gives a section about the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' the title "Coincidentia Oppositorum—THE MYTHICAL PATTERN". Beane and Doty chose to retain this title when excerpting this section in ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'' (p. 449).&lt;/ref&gt; Many myths, Eliade notes, "present us with a twofold revelation":
&lt;blockquote&gt;they express on the one hand the diametrical opposition of two divine figures sprung from one and the same principle and destined, in many versions, to be reconciled at some ''illud tempus'' of eschatology, and on the other, the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' in the very nature of the divinity, which shows itself, by turns or even simultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar and serpentine, and so on (in other words, actual and potential).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt; He also thought that the Indian and Chinese mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

According to Eliade, the ''coincidentia oppositorum''’s appeal lies in "man's deep dissatisfaction with his actual situation, with what is called the human condition".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"/&gt; In many mythologies, the end of the mythical age involves a "fall", a fundamental "[[Ontology|ontological]] change in the structure of the World".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' is a contradiction, it represents a denial of the world's current logical structure, a reversal of the "fall".

Also, traditional man's dissatisfaction with the post-mythical age expresses itself as a feeling of being "torn and separate".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, "a paradoxical state in which the contraries exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt; The ''coincidentia oppositorum'' expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the level of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man's endeavor to reach a perspective in which the contraries are abolished, the Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Exceptions to the general nature===
[[File:Meister von Torcello 001.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Last Judgment]] (detail) in the 12th century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine mosaic]] at [[Torcello]].]]
Eliade acknowledges that not all religious behavior has all the attributes described in his theory of sacred time and the eternal return. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] traditions embrace linear, historical time as sacred or capable of sanctification, while some [[Eastern religions|Eastern traditions]] largely reject the notion of sacred time, seeking escape from the [[wheel of time|cycles of time]].

Because they contain rituals, Judaism and Christianity necessarily—Eliade argues—retain a sense of cyclic time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''by the very fact that it is a religion'', Christianity had to keep at least one mythical aspect—[[Liturgy|liturgical]] Time, that is, the periodic rediscovery of the ''illud tempus'' of the beginnings [and] an ''imitation'' of the [[Christ]] as ''exemplary pattern''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Judaism and Christianity do not see time as a circle endlessly turning on itself; nor do they see such a cycle as desirable, as a way to participate in the Sacred. Instead, these religions embrace the concept of linear history progressing toward the [[Messianic Age]] or the [[Last Judgment]], thus initiating the idea of "progress" (humans are to work for a Paradise in the future).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 64–65, 169&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade's understanding of Judaeo-Christian [[eschatology]] can also be understood as cyclical in that the "end of time" is a return to God: "The final catastrophe will put an end to history, hence will restore man to eternity and beatitude".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-[[Islam]]ic [[Persian Empire|Persian]] religion of Zoroastrianism, which made a notable "contribution to the religious formation of the West",&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; also has a linear sense of time. According to Eliade, the Hebrews had a linear sense of time before being influenced by Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt; In fact, Eliade identifies the Hebrews, not the Zoroastrians, as the first culture to truly "valorize" historical time, the first to see all major historical events as episodes in a continuous divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade argues, Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time by adding elements borrowed from Zoroastrianism—including [[Dualistic cosmology#Moral dualism|ethical dualism]], a savior figure, the future resurrection of the body, and the idea of cosmic progress toward "the final triumph of Good".&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt;

The [[Indian religions]] of the East generally retain a cyclic view of time—for instance, the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] doctrine of ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]''. According to Eliade, most religions that accept the cyclic view of time also embrace it: they see it as a way to return to the sacred time. However, in [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and some forms of Hinduism, the Sacred lies outside the flux of the material world (called ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'', or "illusion"), and one can only reach it by escaping from the cycles of time.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Sacred lies outside cyclic time, which conditions humans, people can only reach the Sacred by escaping the [[human condition]]. According to Eliade, [[Yoga]] techniques aim at escaping the limitations of the body, allowing the soul (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') to rise above ''maya'' and reach the Sacred (''[[nirvana]]'', ''[[moksha]]''). Imagery of "freedom", and of death to one's old body and rebirth with a new body, occur frequently in Yogic texts, representing escape from the bondage of the temporal human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', Volume 2, p.312–14&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade discusses these themes in detail in ''Yoga: Immortality and Freedom''.

===Symbolism of the Center===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
[[File:AM 738 4to Yggdrasill.png|thumb|150px|The [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] ''[[Yggdrasill]]'', as depicted in a 17th-century [[Iceland]]ic miniature.]]
A recurrent theme in Eliade's myth analysis is the ''[[axis mundi]]'', the Center of the World. According to Eliade, the Cosmic Center is a necessary corollary to the division of reality into the Sacred and the profane. The Sacred contains all value, and the world gains purpose and meaning only through hierophanies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the [[hierophany]] reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because profane space gives man no orientation for his life, the Sacred must manifest itself in a hierophany, thereby establishing a sacred site around which man can orient himself. The site of a hierophany establishes a "fixed point, a center".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Center abolishes the "homogeneity and relativity of profane space",&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; for it becomes "the central axis for all future orientation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;

A manifestation of the Sacred in profane space is, by definition, an example of something breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must be a point at which there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.259–260&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade noted that, when traditional societies found a new territory, they often perform consecrating rituals that reenact the hierophany that established the Center and founded the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.32–36&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the designs of traditional buildings, especially temples, usually imitate the mythical image of the ''axis mundi'' joining the different cosmic levels. For instance, the [[Babylon]]ian [[ziggurat]]s were built to resemble cosmic mountains passing through the heavenly spheres, and the rock of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was supposed to reach deep into the ''[[tehom]]'', or primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.40, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the logic of the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]], the site of each such symbolic Center will actually be the Center of the World:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be said, in general, that the majority of the sacred and ritual trees that we meet with in the history of religions are only replicas, imperfect copies of this exemplary archetype, the Cosmic Tree. Thus, all these sacred trees are thought of as situated at the Centre of the World, and all the ritual trees or posts [...] are, as it were, magically projected into the Centre of the World.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Eliade's interpretation, religious man apparently feels the need to live not only near, but ''at'', the mythical Center as much as possible, given that the Center is the point of communication with the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Eliade argues, many traditional societies share common outlines in their mythical [[geography|geographies]]. In the middle of the known world is the sacred Center, "a place that is sacred above all";&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt; this Center anchors the established order.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; Around the sacred Center lies the known world, the realm of established order; and beyond the known world is a chaotic and dangerous realm, "peopled by ghosts, demons, [and] 'foreigners' (who are [identified with] demons and the souls of the dead)".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, traditional societies place their known world at the Center because (from their perspective) their known world is the realm that obeys a recognizable order, and it therefore must be the realm in which the Sacred manifests itself; the regions beyond the known world, which seem strange and foreign, must lie far from the Center, outside the order established by the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 39–40; Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

===The High God===
{{See also|Sky father|Deus otiosus}}
According to some "evolutionistic" theories of religion, especially that of [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], cultures naturally progress from [[animism]] and [[polytheism]] to [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.157, 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, more advanced cultures should be more monotheistic, and more primitive cultures should be more polytheistic. However, many of the most "primitive", pre-agricultural societies believe in a supreme [[Sky father|sky-god]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93; ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38–40, 54–58&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Eliade, post-19th-century scholars have rejected Tylor's theory of evolution from [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the discovery of supreme sky-gods among "primitives", Eliade suspects that the earliest humans worshiped a heavenly Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38, 54; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.176&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', he writes, "The most popular prayer in the world is addressed to 'Our Father who art in heaven.' It is possible that man's earliest prayers were addressed to the same heavenly father."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eliade disagrees with [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], who thought the earliest form of religion was a strict monotheism. Eliade dismisses this theory of "primordial monotheism" (''Urmonotheismus'') as "rigid" and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.162; see also Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–58&lt;/ref&gt; "At most," he writes, "this schema [Schmidt's theory] renders an account of human [religious] evolution since the [[Paleolithic]] era".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; If an ''Urmonotheismus'' did exist, Eliade adds, it probably differed in many ways from the conceptions of God in many modern monotheistic faiths: for instance, the primordial High God could manifest himself as an animal without losing his status as a celestial Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, heavenly Supreme Beings are actually less common in more advanced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade speculates that the discovery of agriculture brought a host of [[Fertility god|fertility gods and goddesses]] into the forefront, causing the celestial Supreme Being to fade away and eventually vanish from many ancient religions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.138&lt;/ref&gt; Even in primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the High God is a vague, distant figure, dwelling high above the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–56&lt;/ref&gt; Often he has no [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] and receives [[prayer]] only as a last resort, when all else has failed.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134–36; ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade calls the distant High God a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' ("idle god").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In belief systems that involve a ''deus otiosus'', the distant High God is believed to have been closer to humans during the mythical age. After finishing his works of creation, the High God "forsook the earth and withdrew into the highest heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the Sacred's distance from "profane" life, life lived after the mythical age: by escaping from the profane condition through religious behavior, figures such as the [[shaman]] return to the conditions of the mythical age, which include nearness to the High God ("by his ''flight'' or ascension, the shaman [...] meets the God of Heaven face to face and speaks directly to him, as man sometimes did ''in illo tempore''").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The shamanistic behaviors surrounding the High God are a particularly clear example of the eternal return.

===Shamanism===

====Overview====
[[File:Schamanin während einer Kamlanie-Zeremonie am Feuer in Kysyl.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[shaman]] performing a ceremonial in [[Tuva]].]]
Eliade's scholarly work includes a study of shamanism, ''[[Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]'', a survey of shamanistic practices in different areas. His ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'' also addresses shamanism in some detail.

In ''Shamanism'', Eliade argues for a restrictive use of the word ''shaman'': it should not apply to just any [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] or [[medicine man]], as that would make the term redundant; at the same time, he argues against restricting the term to the practitioners of the sacred of [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]] (it is from one of the titles for this function, namely, ''šamán'', considered by Eliade to be of [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] origin, that the term itself was introduced into Western languages).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade defines a shaman as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;he is believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform miracles of the [[fakir]] type, like all magicians [...] But beyond this, he is a [[psychopomp]], and he may also be a priest, [[Mysticism|mystic]], and poet.&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we define shamanism this way, Eliade claims, we find that the term covers a collection of phenomena that share a common and unique "structure" and "history".&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt; (When thus defined, shamanism tends to occur in its purest forms in [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and [[Herding|pastoral]] societies like those of Siberia and Central Asia, which revere a celestial High God "on the way to becoming a ''deus otiosus''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.6, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade takes the shamanism of those regions as his most representative example.)

In his examinations of shamanism, Eliade emphasizes the shaman's attribute of regaining man's condition before the "Fall" out of sacred time: "The most representative mystical experience of the archaic societies, that of shamanism, betrays the ''Nostalgia for Paradise'', the desire to recover the state of freedom and beatitude before 'the Fall'."&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt; This concern—which, by itself, is the concern of almost all religious behavior, according to Eliade—manifests itself in specific ways in shamanism.

====Death, resurrection and secondary functions====
According to Eliade, one of the most common shamanistic themes is the shaman's supposed death and [[resurrection]]. This occurs in particular during his [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', pp.82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, this death and resurrection represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.

First, the shaman dies so that he can rise above human nature on a quite literal level. After he has been dismembered by the initiatory spirits, they often replace his old organs with new, magical ones (the shaman dies to his profane self so that he can rise again as a new, sanctified, being).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Second, by being reduced to his bones, the shaman experiences rebirth on a more symbolic level: in many hunting and herding societies, the bone represents the source of life, so reduction to a skeleton "is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life, that is, to a complete renewal, a mystical rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade considers this return to the source of life essentially equivalent to the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the shamanistic phenomenon of repeated death and resurrection also represents a transfiguration in other ways. The shaman dies not once but many times: having died during initiation and risen again with new powers, the shaman can send his spirit out of his body on errands; thus, his whole career consists of repeated deaths and resurrections. The shaman's new ability to die and return to life shows that he is no longer bound by the laws of profane time, particularly the law of death: "the ability to 'die' and come to life again [...] denotes that [the shaman] has surpassed the human condition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Having risen above the human condition, the shaman is not bound by the flow of history. Therefore, he enjoys the conditions of the mythical age. In many myths, humans can speak with animals; and, after their initiations, many shamans claim to be able to communicate with animals. According to Eliade, this is one manifestation of the shaman's return to "the ''illud tempus'' described to us by the paradisiac myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaman can descend to the underworld or ascend to heaven, often by climbing the [[World Tree]], the cosmic pillar, the sacred ladder, or some other form of the ''[[axis mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the shaman will ascend to heaven to speak with the High God. Because the gods (particularly the High God, according to Eliade's ''deus otiosus'' concept) were closer to humans during the mythical age, the shaman's easy communication with the High God represents an abolition of history and a return to the mythical age.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt;

Because of his ability to communicate with the gods and descend to the land of the dead, the shaman frequently functions as a [[psychopomp]] and a [[medicine man]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt;

==Eliade's philosophy==

===Early contributions===
In addition to his political essays, the young Mircea Eliade authored others, philosophical in content. Connected with the ideology of [[Trăirism]], they were often prophetic in tone, and saw Eliade being hailed as a herald by various representatives of his generation.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; When Eliade was 21 years old and publishing his ''Itinerar spiritual'', literary critic [[Şerban Cioculescu]] described him as "the column leader of the spiritually mystical and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] youth."&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu discussed his "impressive erudition", but argued that it was "occasionally plethoric, poetically inebriating itself through abuse".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu's colleague [[Perpessicius]] saw the young author and his generation as marked by "the specter of war", a notion he connected to various essays of the 1920s and 30s in which Eliade threatened the world with the verdict that a new conflict was looming (while asking that young people be allowed to manifest their will and fully experience freedom before perishing).&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

One of Eliade's noted contributions in this respect was the 1932 ''Soliloquii'' ("Soliloquies"), which explored [[Existentialism|existential philosophy]]. [[George Călinescu]] who saw in it "an echo of [[Nae Ionescu]]'s lectures",&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"&gt;Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt; traced a parallel with the essays of another of Ionescu's disciples, [[Emil Cioran]], while noting that Cioran's were "of a more exulted tone and written in the [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] form of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.955&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu recorded Eliade's rejection of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], citing the author's stated indifference towards any "naïveté" or "contradictions" that the reader could possibly reproach him, as well as his dismissive thoughts of "theoretical data" and mainstream philosophy in general (Eliade saw the latter as "inert, infertile and pathogenic").&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; Eliade thus argued, "a sincere brain is unassailable, for it denies itself to any relationship with outside truths."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt;

The young writer was however careful to clarify that the existence he took into consideration was not the life of "instincts and personal [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]]", which he believed determined the lives of many humans, but that of a distinct set comprising "personalities".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; He described "personalities" as characterized by both "purpose" and "a much more complicated and dangerous alchemy".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; This differentiation, George Călinescu believed, echoed Ionescu's metaphor of man, seen as "the only animal who can fail at living", and the duck, who "shall remain a duck no matter what it does".&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, in Călinescu, p.953, 954&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, the purpose of personalities is infinity: "consciously and gloriously bringing [existence] to waste, into as many skies as possible, continuously fulfilling and polishing oneself, seeking ascent and not circumference."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt;

In Eliade's view, two roads await man in this process. One is glory, determined by either work or procreation, and the other the [[asceticism]] of religion or magic—both, Călinescu believed, where aimed at reaching the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], even in those cases where Eliade described the latter as an "abyssal experience" into which man may take the plunge.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; The critic pointed out that the addition of "a magical solution" to the options taken into consideration seemed to be Eliade's own original contributions to his mentor's philosophy, and proposed that it may have owed inspiration to [[Julius Evola]] and his disciples.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; He also recorded that Eliade applied this concept to human creation, and specifically to artistic creation, citing him describing the latter as "a magical joy, the victorious break of the iron circle" (a reflection of ''[[imitatio dei]]'', having salvation for its ultimate goal).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt;

===Philosopher of religion===

====Anti-reductionism and the "transconscious"====
By profession, Eliade was a historian of religion. However, his scholarly works draw heavily on philosophical and psychological terminology. In addition, they contain a number of philosophical arguments about religion. In particular, Eliade often implies the existence of a universal psychological or spiritual "essence" behind all religious phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these arguments, some have accused Eliade of over-generalization and "[[essentialism]]", or even of promoting a theological agenda under the guise of historical scholarship. However, others argue that Eliade is better understood as a scholar who is willing to openly discuss sacred experience and its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, according to Wendy Doniger (Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xv), Eliade has been accused "of being a crypto-theologian"; however, Doniger argues that Eliade is better characterized as "an open hierogian". Likewise, Robert Ellwood (Ellwood, p.111) denies that Eliade practiced "covert theology".&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying religion, Eliade rejects certain "[[Reductionism|reductionist]]" approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, ''Myth and Religion in Mircea Eliade'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002, p.45–46; [[Adrian Marino]], ''L'Herméneutique de Mircea Eliade'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade thinks a religious phenomenon cannot be reduced to a product of culture and history. He insists that, although religion involves "the social man, the economic man, and so forth", nonetheless "all these conditioning factors together do not, of themselves, add up to the life of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this anti-reductionist position, Eliade argues against those who accuse him of overgeneralizing, of looking for [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] at the expense of [[particular]]s. Eliade admits that every religious phenomenon is shaped by the particular culture and history that produced it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Son of God incarnated and became the Christ, he had to speak [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; he could only conduct himself as a Hebrew of his times [...] His religious message, however universal it might be, was conditioned by the past and present history of the Hebrew people. If the Son of God had been born in India, his spoken language would have had to conform itself to the structure of the [[Languages of India|Indian languages]].&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues against those he calls "[[Historicism|historicist]] or [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers" who do not recognize "man in general" behind particular men produced by particular situations&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt; (Eliade cites [[Immanuel Kant]] as the likely forerunner of this kind of "historicism").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that human consciousness transcends (is not reducible to) its historical and cultural conditioning,&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.33&lt;/ref&gt; and even suggests the possibility of a "transconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Eliade does not necessarily mean anything supernatural or mystical: within the "transconscious", he places religious motifs, symbols, images, and nostalgias that are supposedly universal and whose causes therefore cannot be reduced to historical and cultural conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Platonism and "primitive ontology"====
According to Eliade, traditional man feels that things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.5"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; To traditional man, the profane world is "meaningless", and a thing rises out of the profane world only by conforming to an ideal, mythical model.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade describes this view of reality as a fundamental part of "primitive [[ontology]]" (the study of "existence" or "reality").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt; Here he sees a similarity with the philosophy of [[Plato]], who believed that physical phenomena are pale and transient imitations of eternal models or "Forms" (''see [[Theory of forms]]''). He argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Plato could be regarded as the outstanding philosopher of 'primitive mentality,' that is, as the thinker who succeeded in giving philosophic currency and validity to the modes of life and behavior of archaic humanity.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade thinks the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] ''Theory of forms'' is "primitive ontology" persisting in [[Greek philosophy]]. He claims that Platonism is the "most fully elaborated" version of this primitive ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Structure of Religious Knowing: Encountering the Sacred in Eliade and Lonergan'', [[John Daniel Dadosky]] argues that, by making this statement, Eliade was acknowledging "indebtedness to Greek philosophy in general, and to Plato's theory of forms specifically, for his own theory of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dadosky also states that "one should be cautious when trying to assess Eliade's indebtedness to Plato".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Dadosky quotes [[Robert Segal]], a professor of religion, who draws a distinction between Platonism and Eliade's "primitive ontology": for Eliade, the ideal models are patterns that a person or object may or may not imitate; for Plato, there is a Form for everything, and everything imitates a Form by the very fact that it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, in Dadosky, p.105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism and secularism====
Behind the diverse cultural forms of different religions, Eliade proposes a universal: traditional man, he claims, "always believes that there is an absolute reality, ''the sacred'', which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, traditional man's behavior gains purpose and meaning through the Sacred: "By imitating divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods—that is, in the real and the significant."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, "modern nonreligious man assumes a new existential situation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"/&gt; For traditional man, historical events gain significance by imitating sacred, transcendent events. In contrast, nonreligious man lacks sacred models for how history or human behavior should be, so he must decide on his own how history should proceed—he "regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and refuses all appeal to transcendence".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.203&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of religious thought, the world has an objective purpose established by mythical events, to which man should conform himself: "Myth teaches [religious man] the primordial 'stories' that have constituted him existentially."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.12; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.20, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of [[Secularism|secular]] thought, any purpose must be invented and imposed on the world by man. Because of this new "existential situation", Eliade argues, the Sacred becomes the primary obstacle to nonreligious man's "freedom". In viewing himself as the proper maker of history, nonreligious man resists all notions of an externally (for instance, divinely) imposed order or model he must obey: modern man "''makes himself'', and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world. [...] He will not truly be free until he has killed the last god".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"/&gt;

====Religious survivals in the secular world====
Eliade says that secular man cannot escape his bondage to religious thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for its sense of identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: "He [secular man] recognizes himself in proportion as he 'frees' and 'purifies' himself from the '[[superstition]]s' of his ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, modern man "still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional initiation rituals, and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; ''Myth and Reality'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, secular man still participates in something like the eternal return: by reading modern literature, "modern man succeeds in obtaining an 'escape from time' comparable to the 'emergence from time' effected by myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sees traces of religious thought even in secular academia. He thinks modern scientists are motivated by the religious desire to return to the sacred time of origins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One could say that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to penetrate and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal ''matrix''. Matter, Substance, represents the ''absolute origin'', the beginning of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade believes the rise of materialism in the 19th century forced the religious nostalgia for "origins" to express itself in science. He mentions his own field of History of Religions as one of the fields that was obsessed with origins during the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The new discipline of History of Religions developed rapidly in this cultural context. And, of course, it followed a like pattern: the [[Positivism|positivistic]] approach to the facts and the search for origins, for the very beginning of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All Western historiography was during that time obsessed with the quest of ''origins''. [...] This search for the origins of human institutions and cultural creations prolongs and completes the naturalist's quest for the origin of species, the biologist's dream of grasping the origin of life, the geologist's and the astronomer's endeavor to understand the origin of the Earth and the Universe. From a psychological point of view, one can decipher here the same nostalgia for the 'primordial' and the 'original'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some of his writings, Eliade describes modern political ideologies as secularized mythology. According to Eliade, [[Marxism]] "takes up and carries on one of the great [[eschatological]] myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the [[proletariat]]), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade sees the widespread myth of the [[Golden Age]], "which, according to a number of traditions, lies at the beginning and the end of History", as the "precedent" for [[Karl Marx]]'s vision of a [[classless society]].&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he sees Marx's belief in the final triumph of the good (the proletariat) over the evil (the [[bourgeoisie]]) as "a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology".&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt; Despite Marx's hostility toward religion, Eliade implies, his ideology works within a conceptual framework inherited from religious mythology.

Likewise, Eliade notes that Nazism involved a [[Nazi occultism|pseudo-pagan mysticism]] based on [[Germanic paganism|ancient Germanic religion]]. He suggests that the differences between the Nazis' pseudo-Germanic mythology and Marx's pseudo-Judaeo-Christian mythology explain their differing success:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In comparison with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists seems particularly inept; and this is not only because of the limitations of the racial myth (how could one imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the [[ragnarok]]—that is, a catastrophic end of the world.&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern man and the "terror of history"====
According to Eliade, modern man displays "traces" of "mythological behavior" because he intensely needs sacred time and the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Despite modern man's claims to be nonreligious, he ultimately cannot find value in the linear progression of historical events; even modern man feels the "terror of history": "Here too [...] there is always the struggle against Time, the hope to be freed from the weight of 'dead Time,' of the Time that crushes and kills."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, this "terror of history" becomes especially acute when violent and threatening historical events confront modern man—the mere fact that a terrible event has happened, that it is part of history, is of little comfort to those who suffer from it. Eliade asks rhetorically how modern man can "tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]]—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade indicates that, if repetitions of mythical events provided sacred value and meaning for history in the eyes of ancient man, modern man has denied the Sacred and must therefore invent value and purpose on his own. Without the Sacred to confer an absolute, objective value upon historical events, modern man is left with "a [[Relativism|relativistic]] or [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] view of history" and a resulting "spiritual aridity".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.152&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 4 ("The Terror of History") of ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'' and chapter 9 ("Religious Symbolism and the Modern Man's Anxiety") of ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade argues at length that the rejection of religious thought is a primary cause of modern man's anxieties.

====Inter-cultural dialogue and a "new humanism"====
Eliade argues that modern man may escape the "Terror of history" by learning from traditional cultures. For example, Eliade thinks [[Hinduism]] has advice for modern Westerners. According to many branches of Hinduism, the world of historical time is illusory, and the only absolute reality is the immortal soul or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' within man. According to Eliade, Hindus thus escape the terror of history by refusing to see historical time as the true reality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.240–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade notes that a [[Western philosophy|Western]] or [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosopher might feel suspicious toward this Hindu view of history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One can easily guess what a European historical and [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he ''cannot be'' anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, to give up my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the ''atman'': I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History in order to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues that the Hindu approach to history does not necessarily lead to a rejection of history. On the contrary, in Hinduism historical human existence is not the "absurdity" that many Continental philosophers see it as.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"/&gt; According to Hinduism, history is a divine creation, and one may live contentedly within it as long as one maintains a certain degree of detachment from it: "One is devoured by Time, by History, not because one lives in them, but because one thinks them ''real'' and, in consequence, one forgets or undervalues eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Eliade argues that Westerners can learn from non-Western cultures to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a [[rite of passage]]. In fact, their [[initiation]] rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into the next stage of one's existence.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade even suggests that traditional thought offers relief from the vague [[anxiety]] caused by "our obscure presentiment of the end of the world, or more exactly of the end of ''our'' world, our ''own'' civilization".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed "in paralysing either Life or Culture".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that a Western spiritual rebirth can happen within the framework of Western spiritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.244&lt;/ref&gt; However, he says, to start this rebirth, Westerners may need to be stimulated by ideas from non-Western cultures. In his ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade claims that a "genuine encounter" between cultures "might well constitute the point of departure for a new [[humanism]], upon a world scale".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and the "salvation" of History====
Mircea Eliade sees the [[Abrahamic religion]]s as a turning point between the ancient, cyclic view of time and the modern, linear view of time, noting that, in their case, sacred events are not limited to a far-off primordial age, but continue throughout history: "time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|Eternal Return]]; it has become linear and irreversible Time".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He thus sees in Christianity the ultimate example of a religion embracing linear, historical time. When God is born as a man, into the stream of history, "all history becomes a [[theophany]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.153&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, "Christianity strives to ''save'' history".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, the Sacred enters a human being (Christ) to save humans, but it also enters history to "save" history and turn otherwise ordinary, historical events into something "capable of transmitting a trans-historical message".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"/&gt;

From Eliade's perspective, Christianity's "trans-historical message" may be the most important help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book ''Mito'' ("Myth"), [[Italy|Italian]] researcher [[Furio Jesi]] argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience lies not in intellectually "making history", but in man's experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade's perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"&gt;Jesi, p.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"/&gt; Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion that can save man from the "Terror of history".&lt;ref&gt;Jesi, p.66–70&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eliade's view, traditional man sees time as an endless repetition of mythical archetypes. In contrast, modern man has abandoned mythical archetypes and entered linear, historical time—in this context, unlike many other religions, Christianity attributes value to historical time. Thus, Eliade concludes, "Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of 'fallen man'", of modern man who has lost "the paradise of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Modern gnosticism", Romanticism and Eliade's nostalgia====
In analyzing the similarities between the "mythologists" Eliade, [[Joseph Campbell]] and Carl Jung, Robert Ellwood concluded that the three modern mythologists, all of whom believed that myths reveal "timeless truth",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilled the role "[[Gnosticism|gnostics]]" had in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The diverse religious movements covered by the term "gnosticism" share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of our own, and that we can be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (''[[gnosis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Ellwood claimed that the three mythologists were "modern gnostics through and through",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; remarking,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether in [[Augustus|Augustan Rome]] or modern Europe, democracy all too easily gave way to [[totalitarianism]], technology was as readily used for battle as for comfort, and immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty. [...] Gnostics past and present sought answers not in the course of outward human events, but in knowledge of the world's beginning, of what lies above and beyond the world, and of the secret places of the human soul. To all this the mythologists spoke, and they acquired large and loyal followings.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ellwood, the mythologists believed in gnosticism's basic doctrines (even if in a secularized form). Ellwood also believes that [[Romanticism]], which stimulated the modern study of mythology,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"&gt;Ellwood, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; strongly influenced the mythologists. Because Romantics stress that emotion and imagination have the same dignity as reason, Ellwood argues, they tend to think political truth "is known less by rational considerations than by its capacity to fire the passions" and, therefore, that political truth is "very apt to be found [...] in the distant past".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"/&gt;

As modern gnostics, Ellwood argues, the three mythologists felt alienated from the surrounding modern world. As scholars, they knew of primordial societies that had operated differently from modern ones. And as people influenced by Romanticism, they saw myths as a saving ''gnosis'' that offered "avenues of eternal return to simpler primordial ages when the values that rule the world were forged".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ellwood identifies Eliade's personal sense of nostalgia as a source for his interest in, or even his theories about, traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.99, 117&lt;/ref&gt; He cites Eliade himself claiming to desire an "eternal return" like that by which traditional man returns to the mythical paradise: "My essential preoccupation is precisely the means of escaping History, of saving myself through symbol, myth, rite, archetypes".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, quoted by [[Virgil Ierunca]], ''The Literary Work of Mircea Eliade'', in Ellwood, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ellwood's view, Eliade's nostalgia was only enhanced by his exile from Romania: "In later years Eliade felt about his own Romanian past as did primal folk about mythic time. He was drawn back to it, yet he knew he could not live there, and that all was not well with it."&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"&gt;Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that this nostalgia, along with Eliade's sense that "exile is among the profoundest metaphors for all human life",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; influenced Eliade's theories. Ellwood sees evidence of this in Eliade's concept of the "Terror of history" from which modern man is no longer shielded.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; In this concept, Ellwood sees an "element of nostalgia" for earlier times "when the sacred was strong and the terror of history had barely raised its head".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Eliade's scholarship==

===Overgeneralization===
Eliade cites a wide variety of myths and rituals to support his theories. However, he has been accused of making over-generalizations: many scholars think he lacks sufficient evidence to put forth his ideas as universal, or even general, principles of religious thought. According to one scholar, "Eliade may have been the most popular and influential contemporary historian of religion", but "many, if not most, specialists in anthropology, sociology, and even history of religions have either ignored or quickly dismissed" Eliade's works.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, "Eliade and History", in ''Journal of Religion'', 52:2 (1988), p.545&lt;/ref&gt;

The classicist [[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] criticizes Eliade's insistence that [[Australian Aborigines]] and ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns had concepts of "being", "non-being", "real", and "becoming", although they lacked words for them. Kirk also believes that Eliade overextends his theories: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the "[[noble savage]]" results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"&gt;Kirk, ''Myth...'', footnote, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kirk, "such extravagances, together with a marked repetitiousness, have made Eliade unpopular with many anthropologists and sociologists".&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"/&gt; In Kirk's view, Eliade derived his theory of [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] from the functions of [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] and then proceeded to apply the theory to other mythologies to which it did not apply. For example, Kirk argues that the eternal return does not accurately describe the functions of [[Native American mythology|Native American]] or [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk concludes, "Eliade's idea is a valuable perception about certain myths, not a guide to the proper understanding of all of them".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in an introduction to Eliade's own ''Shamanism'') that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt; However, although Doniger agrees that Eliade made over-generalizations, she notes that his willingness to "argue boldly for universals" allowed him to see patterns "that spanned the entire globe and the whole of human history".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they were true or not, she argues, Eliade's theories are still useful "as starting points for the comparative study of religion". She also argues that Eliade's theories have been able to accommodate "new data to which Eliade did not have access".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of empirical support===
Several researchers have criticized Eliade's work as having no [[Empirical method|empirical]] support. Thus, he is said to have "failed to provide an adequate methodology for the history of religions and to establish this discipline as an empirical science",&lt;ref name="ricketts"&gt;Mac Linscott Ricketts, "Review of ''Religion on Trial: Mircea Eliade and His Critics'' by Guilford Dudley III", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 46, No. 3 (September 1978), p.400–402&lt;/ref&gt; though the same critics admit that "the history of religions should not aim at being an empirical science anyway".&lt;ref name="ricketts"/&gt; Specifically, his claim that the sacred is a structure of human consciousness is distrusted as not being empirically provable: "no one has yet turned up the basic category ''sacred''".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Alles, "Review of ''Changing Religious Worlds: The Meaning and End of Mircea Eliade'' by Brian Rennie", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 71, p.466–469 (Alles' italics)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there has been mention of his tendency to ignore the social aspects of religion.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; Anthropologist Alice Kehoe is highly critical of Eliade's work on Shamanism, namely because he was not an anthropologist but a historian. She contends that Eliade never did any field work or contacted any indigenous groups that practiced Shamanism, and that his work was synthesized from various sources without being supported by direct field research.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Kehoe, ''Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking'', Waveland Press, London, 2000, ''passim''. {{ISBN|1-57766-162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Professor Kees W. Bolle of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argues that "Professor Eliade's approach, in all his works, is empirical":&lt;ref name="bolle"&gt;Kees W. Bolle, ''The Freedom of Man in Myth'', [[Vanderbilt University Press]], Nashville, 1968, p.14. {{ISBN|0-8265-1248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolle sets Eliade apart for what he sees as Eliade's particularly close "attention to the various particular motifs" of different myths.&lt;ref name="bolle"/&gt; French researcher Daniel Dubuisson places doubt on Eliade's scholarship and its scientific character, citing the Romanian academic's alleged refusal to accept the treatment of religions in their historical and cultural context, and proposing that Eliade's notion of ''[[hierophany]]'' refers to the actual existence of a supernatural level.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

[[Ronald Inden]], a historian of [[India]] and University of Chicago professor, criticized Mircea Eliade, alongside other intellectual figures ([[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] among them), for encouraging a "romantic view" of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="indenmorny"&gt;Inden, in Morny Joy, "Irigaray's Eastern Expedition", Chapter 4 of Morny Joy, [[Kathleen O'Grady]], Judith L. Poxon, ''Religion in French Feminist Thought: Critical Perspectives'', [[Routledge]], London, 2003, p.63. {{ISBN|0-415-21536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that their approach to the subject relied mainly on an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach, and made Hinduism seem like "a private realm of the imagination and the religious which modern, Western man lacks but needs."&lt;ref name="indenmorny"/&gt;

===Far right and nationalist influences===
Although his scholarly work was never subordinated to his early political beliefs, the school of thought he was associated with in [[interwar]] Romania, namely [[Trăirism]], as well as the works of [[Julius Evola]] he continued to draw inspiration from, have thematic links to fascism.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and academic Marcel Tolcea has argued that, through Evola's particular interpretation of Guénon's works, Eliade kept a traceable connection with [[far right]] ideologies in his academic contributions.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; Daniel Dubuisson singled out Eliade's concept of ''homo religiosus'' as a reflection of fascist [[elitism]], and argued that the Romanian scholar's views of [[Judaism]] and the [[Old Testament]], which depicted Hebrews as the enemies of an ancient cosmic religion, were ultimately the preservation of an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] discourse.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

A piece authored in 1930 saw Eliade defining Julius Evola as a great thinker and offering praise to the controversial intellectuals [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt; Evola, who continued to defend the core principles of mystical fascism, once protested to Eliade about the latter's failure to cite him and Guénon. Eliade replied that his works were written for a contemporary public, and not to initiates of esoteric circles.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Fragments d'un Journal 11, 1970–1978'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1960s, he, together with Evola, [[Louis Rougier]], and other intellectuals, offered support to [[Alain de Benoist]]'s controversial ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'', part of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' intellectual trend.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.173; Douglas R. Holmes, ''Integral Europe: Fast-Capitalism, Multiculturalism, Neofascism'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2000, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Eliade was also preoccupied with the cult of [[Zalmoxis]] and its supposed [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Istorie şi mit în conştiinţa românească'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1997 (tr. ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2001), p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Zalmoxis, The Vanishing God", in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (December 1974), p.807–809&lt;/ref&gt; This, like his conclusion that [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] had been superficial inside [[Roman Dacia]], was a view celebrated by contemporary partisans of [[Protochronism|Protochronist]] nationalism.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boia"/&gt; According to historian [[Sorin Antohi]], Eliade may have actually encouraged Protochronists such as [[Edgar Papu]] to carry out research which resulted in the claim that medieval Romanians had anticipated the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also discusses the connection between academic theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists have been accused of [[reactionary]] political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the [[conservatism]] of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood argues that the explanation is more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often "apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade's case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia ("for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise"),&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"/&gt; influenced not only the scholar's academic interests, but also his political views.

Because Eliade stayed out of politics during his later life, Ellwood tries to extract an implicit political philosophy from Eliade's scholarly works. Ellwood argues that the later Eliade's nostalgia for ancient traditions did not make him a political reactionary, even a quiet one. He concludes that the later Eliade was, in fact, a "radical [[Modernism|modernist]]".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"&gt;Ellwood, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who see Eliade's fascination with the primordial as merely reactionary in the ordinary political or religious sense of the word do not understand the mature Eliade in a sufficiently radical way. [...] Tradition was not for him exactly [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] 'prescription' or sacred trust to be kept alive generation after generation, for Eliade was fully aware that tradition, like men and nations, lives only by changing and even occultation. The tack is not to try fruitlessly to keep it unchanging, but to discover where it is hiding.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, religious elements survive in secular culture, but in new, "camouflaged" forms.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ellwood believes that the later Eliade probably thought modern man should preserve elements of the past, but should not try to restore their original form through reactionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.119–20&lt;/ref&gt; He suspects that Eliade would have favored "a minimal rather than a maximalist state" that would allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"&gt;Ellwood, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have accused Eliade of "[[essentialism]]", a type of over-generalization in which one incorrectly attributes a common "essence" to a whole group—in this case, all "religious" or "traditional" societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"&gt;Ellwood, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; To Ellwood, this connection "seems rather tortured, in the end amounting to little more than an ''ad hominem'' argument which attempts to tar Eliade's entire [scholarly] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]] and the Iron Guard".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"/&gt; However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in "mythological thinking" may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an "essentialist" way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way."&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

===Generic traits===
Many of Mircea Eliade's literary works, in particular his earliest ones, are noted for their [[eroticism]] and their focus on subjective experience. Modernist in style, they have drawn comparisons to the contemporary writings of [[Mihail Sebastian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.963&lt;/ref&gt; [[I. Valerian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.843&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ion Biberi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.967&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Giovanni Papini]], his literary passions included [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]],&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; as well as [[André Gide]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also read with interest the prose of [[Romain Rolland]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Voltaire]] and [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; As a youth, he read the works of Romanian authors such as [[Liviu Rebreanu]] and [[Panait Istrati]]; initially, he was also interested in [[Ionel Teodoreanu]]'s prose works, but later rejected them and criticized their author.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Investigating the works' main characteristics, [[George Călinescu]] stressed that Eliade owed much of his style to the direct influence of French author André Gide, concluding that, alongside [[Camil Petrescu]] and a few others, Eliade was among Gide's leading disciples in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He commented that, like Gide, Eliade believed that the artist "does not take a stand, but experiences good and evil while setting himself free from both, maintaining an intact curiosity."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; A specific aspect of this focus on experience is sexual experimentation—Călinescu notes that Eliade's fiction works tend to depict a male figure "possessing all practicable women in [a given] family".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"&gt;Călinescu, p.959&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that, as a rule, Eliade depicts woman as "a basic means for a sexual experience and repudiated with harsh [[egotism]]."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

For Călinescu, such a perspective on life culminated in "banality", leaving authors gripped by the "cult of the self" and "a contempt for literature".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; Polemically, Călinescu proposed that Mircea Eliade's supposed focus on "aggressive youth" served to instill his [[Interwar period|interwar]] Romanian writers with the idea that they had a common destiny as a generation apart.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He also commented that, when set in Romania, Mircea Eliade's stories lacked the "perception of immediate reality", and, analyzing the non-traditional names the writer tended to ascribe to his Romanian characters, that they did not depict "specificity".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"&gt;Călinescu, p.958&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in Călinescu's view, Eliade's stories were often "[[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] compositions of the illustrated magazine kind."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"&gt;Călinescu, p.960&lt;/ref&gt; Mircea Eliade's assessment of his own pre-1940 literary contributions oscillated between expressions of pride&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and the bitter verdict that they were written for "an audience of little ladies and high school students".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

A secondary but unifying feature present in most of Eliade's stories is their setting, a magical and part-fictional [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In part, they also serve to illustrate or allude to Eliade's own research in the field of religion, as well as to the concepts he introduced.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Thus, commentators such as [[Matei Călinescu]] and [[Carmen Mușat]] have also argued that a main characteristic of Eliade's [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] prose is a substitution between the [[supernatural]] and the mundane: in this interpretation, Eliade turns the daily world into an incomprehensible place, while the intrusive supernatural aspect promises to offer the sense of life.&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"&gt;[[Carmen Muşat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=4693&amp;print=true "Despre fantastica alcătuire a realului" ("On the Fantastic Shape of Reality")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 131, August–September 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008{{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion was in turn linked to Eliade's own thoughts on [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], and in particular his idea that, once "camouflaged" in life or history, [[miracle]]s become "unrecognizable".&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"/&gt;

===Oriental themed novels===
One of Eliade's earliest fiction writings, the controversial [[first-person narrative]] ''Isabel şi apele diavolului'', focused on the figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of "being common".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's experience is recorded in "notebooks", which are compiled to form the actual narrative, and which serve to record his unusual, mostly sexual, experiences in [[British India]]—the narrator describes himself as dominated by "a devilish indifference" towards "all things having to do with art or [[metaphysics]]", focusing instead on eroticism.&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"/&gt; The guest of a [[pastor]], the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host's wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor's adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does not give in to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that she had thought of him all along.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"&gt;Călinescu, p.957&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Eliade's best-known works, the novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'', dwells on Eliade's own experience, comprising camouflaged details of his relationships with [[Surendranath Dasgupta]] and Dasgupta's daughter [[Maitreyi Devi]]. The main character, Allan, is an [[England|Englishman]] who visits the Indian engineer Narendra Sen and courts his daughter, herself known as Maitreyi. The narrative is again built on "notebooks" to which Allan adds his comments. This technique Călinescu describes as "boring", and its result "cynical".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt;

Allan himself stands alongside Eliade's male characters, whose focus is on action, sensation and experience—his chaste contacts with Maitreyi are encouraged by Sen, who hopes for a marriage which is nonetheless abhorred by his would-be European son-in-law.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; Instead, Allan is fascinated to discover Maitreyi's Oriental version of [[Platonic love]], marked by spiritual attachment more than by physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.957–958&lt;/ref&gt; However, their affair soon after turns physical, and she decides to attach herself to Allan as one would to a husband, in what is an informal and intimate wedding ceremony (which sees her vowing her love and invoking an [[Chthonic|earth goddess]] as the seal of union).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Upon discovering this, Narendra Sen becomes enraged, rejecting their guest and keeping Maitreyi in confinement. As a result, his daughter decides to have intercourse with a lowly stranger, becoming pregnant in the hope that her parents would consequently allow her to marry her lover. However, the story also casts doubt on her earlier actions, reflecting rumors that Maitreyi was not a virgin at the time she and Allan first met, which also seems to expose her father as a hypocrite.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

George Călinescu objected to the narrative, arguing that both the physical affair and the father's rage seemed artificial, while commenting that Eliade placing doubt on his Indian characters' honesty had turned the plot into a piece of "[[Ethnology|ethnological]] humor".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Noting that the work developed on a classical theme of [[miscegenation]], which recalled the prose of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and [[Pierre Loti]],&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; the critic proposed that its main merit was in introducing the [[Exoticism|exotic novel]] to local literature.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

Mircea Eliade's other early works include ''Șantier'' ("Building Site"), a part-novel, part-diary account of his Indian sojourn. George Călinescu objected to its "monotony", and, noting that it featured a set of "intelligent observations", criticized the "banality of its ideological conversations."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; ''Șantier'' was also noted for its portrayal of [[drug addiction]] and intoxication with [[opium]], both of which could have referred to Eliade's actual travel experience.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

===Portraits of a generation===
In his earliest novel, titled ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]'' and written in the first person, Eliade depicts his experience through high school.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; It is proof of the influence exercised on him by the literature of [[Giovanni Papini]], and in particular by Papini's story ''[[Un uomo finito]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Each of its chapters reads like an independent [[novella]], and, in all, the work experiments with the limits traced between novel and diary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Literary critic [[Eugen Simion]] called it "the most valuable" among Eliade's earliest literary attempts, but noted that, being "ambitious", the book had failed to achieve "an aesthetically satisfactory format".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; According to Simion, the innovative intent of the ''Novel...'' was provided by its technique, by its goal of providing authenticity in depicting experiences, and by its insight into [[adolescent psychology]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; The novel notably shows its narrator practicing self-[[flagellation]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's 1934 novel ''Întoarcerea din rai'' ("Return from Paradise") centers on Pavel Anicet, a young man who seeks knowledge through what Călinescu defined as "sexual excess".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; His search leaves him with a reduced sensitivity: right after being confronted with his father's death, Anicet breaks out in tears only after sitting through an entire dinner.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; The other characters, standing for Eliade's generation, all seek knowledge through violence or retreat from the world—nonetheless, unlike Anicet, they ultimately fail at imposing rigors upon themselves.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Pavel himself eventually abandons his belief in sex as a means for enlightenment, and commits suicide in hopes of reaching the level of primordial unity. The solution, George Călinescu noted, mirrored the strange murder in Gide's ''[[Lafcadio's Adventures]]''.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Eliade himself indicated that the book dealt with the "loss of the beatitude, illusions, and optimism that had dominated the first twenty years of '[[Greater Romania]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ellwood connected the work to Eliade's recurring sense of loss in respect to the "atmosphere of euphoria and faith" of his adolescence.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt; Călinescu criticizes ''Întoarcerea din rai'', describing its dialog sequences as "awkward", its narrative as "void", and its artistic interest as "non-existent", proposing that the reader could however find it relevant as the "document of a mentality".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

The lengthy novel ''Huliganii'' ("The Hooligans") is intended as the fresco of a family, and, through it, that of an entire generation. The book's main protagonist, Petru Anicet, is a composer who places value in experiments; other characters include Dragu, who considers "a hooligan's experience" as "the only fertile debut into life", and the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] Alexandru Pleşa, who is on the search for "the heroic life" by enlisting youth in "perfect regiments, equally intoxicated by a collective myth."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"&gt;[[Gabriela Adameşteanu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Cum-suporta-individul-socurile-Istoriei.-Dialog-cu-Norman-MANEA*articleID_14662-articles_details.html "Cum suportă individul şocurile Istoriei. Dialog cu Norman Manea" ("How the Individual Bears the Shocks of History. A Dialog with Norman Manea")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 304, January 2006; retrieved January 16, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.958–959&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu thought that the young male characters all owed inspiration to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]] (''see [[Crime and Punishment]]'').&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Anicet, who partly shares Pleșa's vision for a collective experiment, is also prone to sexual adventures, and seduces the women of the Lecca family (who have hired him as a piano teacher).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Romanian-born novelist [[Norman Manea]] called Anicet's experiment: "the paraded defiance of [[bourgeois]] conventions, in which venereal disease and lubricity dwell together."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In one episode of the book, Anicet convinces Anișoara Lecca to gratuitously steal from her parents—an outrage which leads her mother to moral decay and, eventually, to suicide.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; George Călinescu criticized the book for inconsistencies and "excesses in Dostoyevskianism", but noted that the Lecca family portrayal was "suggestive", and that the dramatic scenes were written with "a remarkable poetic calm."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

The novel ''[[Marriage in Heaven]]'' depicts the correspondence between two male friends, an artist and a common man, who complain to each other about their failures in love: the former complains about a lover who wanted his children when he did not, while the other recalls being abandoned by a woman who, despite his intentions, did not want to become pregnant by him. Eliade lets the reader understand that they are in fact talking about the same woman.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

===Fantastic and fantasy literature===
Mircea Eliade's earliest works, most of which were published at later stages, belong to the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'', showed its adolescent author's interest in themes that he was to explore throughout his career, in particular [[esotericism]] and [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the [[philosophers' stone]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; These early writings also include two sketches for novels: ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'' ("The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants") and ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' ("The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for [[Satire|satirical]] commentary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade himself explained that ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, [[abiogenesis]], [[human evolution]], and the entire world history.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's fantasy novel ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'', was, on its own, the topic of a scandal.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The novel deals with the fate of an eccentric family, the Moscus, who are haunted by the ghost of a murdered young woman, known as Christina. The apparition shares characteristics with [[vampire]]s and with ''[[strigoi]]'': she is believed to be drinking the blood of cattle and that of a young family member.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The young man Egor becomes the object of Christina's desire, and is shown to have intercourse with her.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Noting that the plot and setting reminded one of [[horror fiction]] works by the German author [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], and defending ''Domnişoara Christina'' in front of harsher criticism, Călinescu nonetheless argued that the "international environment" in which it took place was "upsetting".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He also depicted the plot as focused on "major impurity", summarizing the story's references to [[necrophilia]], [[menstruation|menstrual]] [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[ephebophilia]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

Eliade's short story ''Șarpele'' ("The Snake") was described by George Călinescu as "[[Hermeticism|hermetic]]".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; While on a trip to the forest, several persons witness a feat of magic performed by the male character Andronic, who summons a snake from the bottom of a river and places it on an island. At the end of the story, Andronic and the female character Dorina are found on the island, naked and locked in a sensual embrace.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Călinescu saw the piece as an allusion to [[Gnosticism]], to the [[Kabbalah]], and to [[Babylonian mythology]], while linking the snake to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure and major [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent symbol]] [[Ophion]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He was however dissatisfied with this introduction of iconic images, describing it as "languishing".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

The short story ''Un om mare'' ("A Big Man"), which Eliade authored during his stay in Portugal, shows a common person, the engineer Cucoanes, who grows steadily and uncontrollably, reaching immense proportions and ultimately disappearing into the wilderness of the [[Bucegi Mountains]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 "''L'Affaire'', după Matei" (''L'Affaire'', according to Matei"), Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010509/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 636, May 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade himself referenced the story and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiments in the same section of his private notes, a matter which allowed [[Matei Călinescu]] to propose that ''Un om mare'' was a direct product of its author's experience with drugs.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; The same commentator, who deemed ''Un om mare'' "perhaps Eliade's most memorable short story", connected it with the ''[[uriaș]]i'' characters present in [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

===Other writings===
Eliade reinterpreted the Greek mythological figure [[Iphigeneia]] in his eponymous 1941 play. Here, the maiden falls in love with [[Achilles]], and accepts to be sacrificed on the [[pyre]] as a means to ensure both her lover's happiness (as predicted by an [[oracle]]) and her father [[Agamemnon]]'s victory in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="raifigenia"&gt;[[Radu Albala]], "Teatrul Naţional din Bucureşti.

In addition to his fiction, the exiled Eliade authored several volumes of memoirs and diaries and travel writings. They were published sporadically, and covered various stages of his life. One of the earliest such pieces was ''India'', grouping accounts of the travels he made through the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; Writing for the [[Spain|Spanish]] journal ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', commentator [[Sergio Vila-Sanjuán]] described the first volume of Eliade's ''Autobiography'' (covering the years 1907 to 1937) as "a great book", while noting that the other main volume was "more conventional and insincere."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In Vila-Sanjuán's view, the texts reveal Mircea Eliade himself as "a Dostoyevskyian character", as well as "an accomplished person, a [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethian]] figure".&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

A work that drew particular interest was his ''Jurnal portughez'' ("Portuguese Diary"), completed during his stay in [[Lisbon]] and published only after its author's death. A portion of it dealing with his stay in Romania is believed to have been lost.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; The travels to Spain, partly recorded in ''Jurnal portughez'', also led to a separate volume, ''Jurnal cordobez'' ("Cordoban Diary"), which Eliade compiled from various independent notebooks.&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt;  ''Jurnal portughez'' shows Eliade coping with [[clinical depression]] and political crisis, and has been described by [[Andrei Oișteanu]] as "an overwhelming [read], through the immense suffering it exhales."&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argued that part of the volume is "a masterpiece of its time", while concluding that some 700 pages were passable for the "among others" section of [[Bibliography of Mircea Eliade|Eliade's bibliography]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Noting that the book featured parts where Eliade spoke of himself in eulogistic terms, notably comparing himself favorably to Goethe and Romania's national poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], Cernat accused the writer of "egolatry", and deduced that Eliade was "ready to step over dead bodies for the sake of his spiritual 'mission' ".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; The same passages led philosopher and journalist [[Cătălin Avramescu]] to argue that Eliade's behavior was evidence of "[[megalomania]]".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

Eliade also wrote various essays of literary criticism. In his youth, alongside his study on [[Julius Evola]], he published essays which introduced the Romanian public to representatives of modern [[Spanish literature]] and philosophy, among them [[Adolfo Bonilla San Martín]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; He also wrote an essay on the works of [[James Joyce]], connecting it with his own theories on the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] ("[Joyce's literature is] saturated with nostalgia for the myth of the eternal repetition"), and deeming Joyce himself an anti-[[Historicism|historicist]] "archaic" figure among the modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Robert Spoo, ''James Joyce and the Language of History: Dedalus's Nightmare'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, Oxford, 1994, p.158. {{ISBN|0-19-508749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Eliade edited the collected works of Romanian historian [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

M. L. Ricketts discovered and translated into English a previously unpublished play written by Mircea Eliade in Paris 1946 ''Aventura Spirituală'' (''A Spiritual Adventure''). It was published by for the first time in ''[[Theory in Action]]'' -the journal of the [[Transformative Studies Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/publications/theory-in-action-the-journal-of-tsi/past-issues/volume-5-number-1-january-2012/ Transformative Studies Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; vol. 5 (2012): 2–58.

==Controversy: antisemitism and links with the Iron Guard==

===Early statements===
The early years in Eliade's public career show him to have been highly tolerant of [[Jew]]s in general, and of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish minority in Romania]] in particular. His early condemnation of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies was accompanied by his caution and moderation in regard to [[Nae Ionescu]]'s various anti-Jewish attacks.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.408–409, 412&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 1930s, Mihail Sebastian was marginalized by Romania's antisemitic policies, and came to reflect on his Romanian friend's association with the far right. The subsequent ideological break between him and Eliade has been compared by writer [[Gabriela Adameşteanu]] with that between [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In his ''Journal'', published long after his 1945 death, Sebastian claimed that Eliade's actions during the 1930s show him to be an antisemite. According to Sebastian, Eliade had been friendly to him until the start of his political commitments, after which he severed all ties.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Before their friendship came apart, however, Sebastian claimed that he took notes on their conversations (which he later published) during which Eliade was supposed to have expressed antisemitic views. According to Sebastian, Eliade said in 1939:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Poles' resistance]] in [[Warsaw]] is a Jewish resistance. Only yids are capable of the blackmail of putting women and children in the front line, to take advantage of the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What is [[Bukovina#Preceding events and Second World War|happening on the frontier with Bukovina]] is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The friendship between Eliade and Sebastian drastically declined during the war: the latter writer, fearing for his security during the pro-Nazi [[Ion Antonescu]] regime (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), hoped that Eliade, by then a diplomat, could intervene in his favor; however, upon his brief return to Romania, Eliade did not see or approach Sebastian.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Later, Mircea Eliade expressed his regret at not having had the chance to redeem his friendship with Sebastian before the latter was killed in a car accident.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt; [[Paul Cernat]] notes that Eliade's statement includes an admission that he "counted on [Sebastian's] support, in order to get back into Romanian life and culture", and proposes that Eliade may have expected his friend to vouch for him in front of hostile authorities.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Some of Sebastian's late recordings in his diary show that their author was reflecting with nostalgia on his relationship with Eliade, and that he deplored the outcome.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Eliade provided two distinct explanations for not having met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the [[Gestapo]], and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the [[Israel]]i magazine ''Toladot'', who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the [[Final Solution]] in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could have contributed to the clash between the two literary figures.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Beyond his involvement with a movement known for its antisemitism, Eliade did not usually comment on Jewish issues. However, an article titled ''Piloţii orbi'' ("The Blind Pilots"), contributed to the journal ''Vremea'' in 1936, showed that he supported at least some Iron Guard accusations against the Jewish community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the war [that is, [[World War I]]], Jews have occupied the villages of [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and [[Bukovina]], and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;It was popular prejudice in the late 1930s to claim that [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]] in the [[Soviet Union]] had obtained Romanian citizenship illegally after crossing the border into [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and Bukovina. In 1938, this accusation served as an excuse for the [[Octavian Goga]]-[[A. C. Cuza]] government to suspend and review all Jewish citizenship guaranteed after 1923, rendering it very difficult to regain (Ornea, p.391). Eliade's mention of Bessarabia probably refers to an earlier period, being his interpretation of a pre-[[Greater Romania]] process.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves in order to become a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far as I am concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.412–413; partially in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One year later, a text, accompanied by his picture, was featured as answer to an inquiry by the Iron Guard's ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' about the reasons he had for supporting the movement. A short section of it summarizes an anti-Jewish attitude:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can the Romanian nation end its life in the saddest decay witnessed by history, undermined by misery and [[syphilis]], conquered by Jews and torn to pieces by foreigners, demoralized, betrayed, sold for a few million [[Romanian leu|lei]]?&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.413; in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the literary critic [[Z. Ornea]], in the 1980s Eliade denied authorship of the text. He explained the use of his signature, his picture, and the picture's caption, as having been applied by the magazine's editor, [[Mihail Polihroniade]], to a piece the latter had written after having failed to obtain Eliade's contribution; he also claimed that, given his respect for Polihroniade, he had not wished to publicize this matter previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.206; Ornea is skeptical of these explanations, given the long period of time spent before Eliade gave them, and especially the fact that the article itself, despite the haste in which it must have been written, has remarkably detailed references to many articles written by Eliade in various papers over a period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polemics and exile===
Dumitru G. Danielopol, a fellow diplomat present in [[London]] during Eliade's stay in the city, later stated that the latter had identified himself as "a guiding light of [the Iron Guard] movement" and victim of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s repression.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In October 1940, as the [[National Legionary State]] came into existence, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] [[blacklist]]ed Mircea Eliade, alongside five other  Romanians, due to his Iron Guard connections and suspicions that he was prepared to spy in favor of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="zfscriit"/&gt; According to various sources, while in [[Portugal]], the diplomat was also preparing to disseminate [[propaganda]] in favor of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In ''Jurnal portughez'', Eliade defines himself as "a Legionary",&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and speaks of his own "Legionary climax" as a stage he had gone through during the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

The depolitisation of Eliade after the start of his diplomatic career was also mistrusted by his former close friend [[Eugène Ionesco]], who indicated that, upon the close of [[World War II]], Eliade's personal beliefs as communicated to his friends amounted to "all is over now that Communism has won".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1945, in Ornea, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; This forms part of Ionesco's severe and succinct review of the careers of Legionary-inspired intellectuals, many of them his friends and former friends, in a letter he sent to [[Tudor Vianu]].&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.184–185&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Ionesco indicated to [[Petru Comarnescu]] that he did not want to see either Eliade or Cioran, and that he considered the two of them "Legionaries for ever"—adding "we are [[hyena]]s to one another".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1946, in Ornea, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's former friend, the communist [[Belu Zilber]], who was attending the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Conference]] in 1946, refused to see Eliade, arguing that, as an Iron Guard affiliate, the latter had "denounced left-wingers", and contrasting him with Cioran ("They are both Legionaries, but [Cioran] is honest").&lt;ref&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=575&amp;nr=2003-08-25 "Belu Zilber" (III)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011339/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-25&amp;art=575 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.702, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Eliade's political activities were brought into discussion as he was getting ready to publish a translation of his ''Techniques du Yoga'' with the left-leaning [[Italy|Italian]] company ''[[Giulio Einaudi Editore]]''—the denunciation was probably orchestrated by Romanian officials.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"&gt;Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, when [[Horia Sima]], who led the Iron Guard during its exile, was rejected by a faction inside the movement, Mircea Eliade's name was included on a list of persons who supported the latter—although this may have happened without his consent.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; According to exiled [[dissident]] and novelist [[Dumitru Ţepeneag]], around that date, Eliade expressed his sympathy for Iron Guard members in general, whom he viewed as "courageous".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Coroiu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115020500/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-roman-la-paris-0.html "Un român la Paris"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', August 31, 2006; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Robert Ellwood, the Eliade he met in the 1960s was entirely apolitical, remained aloof from "the passionate politics of that era in the United States", and "[r]eportedly [...] never read newspapers"&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"&gt;Ellwood, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; (an assessment shared by [[Sorin Alexandrescu]]).&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; Eliade's student [[Ioan Petru Culianu]] noted that journalists had come to refer to the Romanian scholar as "the great recluse".&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; Despite Eliade's withdrawal from radical politics, Ellwood indicates, he still remained concerned with Romania's welfare. He saw himself and other exiled Romanian intellectuals as members of a circle who worked to "maintain the culture of a free Romania and, above all, to publish texts that had become unpublishable in Romania itself".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Ordeal by Labyrinth'', in Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1969, Eliade's past became the subject of public debate in [[Israel]]. At the time, historian [[Gershom Scholem]] asked Eliade to explain his attitudes, which the latter did using vague terms.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this exchange, Scholem declared his dissatisfaction, and argued that Israel could not extend a welcome to the Romanian academic.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; During the final years of Eliade's life, his disciple Culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-Iron Guard activities; relations between the two soured as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sorin Antohi]], [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=478 "Exploring the Legacy of Ioan Petru Culianu"], in the [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=109&amp;Itemid=231 ''Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen Post''], Newsletter 72, Spring 2001; retrieved July 16, 2007; Ted Anton, [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9209/culianu.html "The Killing of Professor Culianu"], in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', Volume 2, No. 6, September/October 1992; retrieved July 29, 2007; Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's other Romanian disciple, [[Andrei Oişteanu]], noted that, in the years following Eliade's death, conversations with various people who had known the scholar had made Culianu less certain of his earlier stances, and had led him to declare: "Mr. Eliade was never antisemitic, a member of the Iron Guard, or pro-Nazi. But, in any case, I am led to believe that he was closer to the Iron Guard than I would have liked to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early stage of his polemic with Culianu, Eliade complained in writing that "it is not possible to write an objective history" of the Iron Guard and its leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"/&gt; Arguing that people "would only accept apologetics [...] or executions", he contended: "After [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], even honest people cannot afford being objective".&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91; in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posterity===
Alongside the arguments introduced by Daniel Dubuisson, criticism of Mircea Eliade's political involvement with antisemitism and fascism came from Adriana Berger, [[Leon Volovici]], Alexandra Lagniel-Lavastine, Florin Țurcanu and others, who have attempted to trace Eliade's antisemitism throughout his work and through his associations with contemporary antisemites, such as the Italian fascist [[occultist]] [[Julius Evola]]. Volovici, for example, is critical of Eliade not only because of his support for the Iron Guard, but also for spreading antisemitism and [[anti-Masonry]] in 1930s Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Volovici, ''Nationalist Ideology and Antisemitism: The Case of Romanian Intellectuals in the 1930s'', [[Pergamon Press]], Oxford, 1991, p.104–105, 110–111, 120–126, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, exiled novelist [[Norman Manea]] published an essay firmly condemning Eliade's attachment to the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Other scholars, like [[Bryan S. Rennie]], have claimed that there is, to date, no evidence of Eliade's membership, active services rendered, or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations, nor that there is any evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed. They further assert that there is no imprint of overt political beliefs in Eliade's scholarship, and also claim that Eliade's critics are following political agendas.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan S. Rennie]], ''Reconstructing Eliade: Making Sense of Religion'', [[State University of New York Press]], Albany, 1996, p.149–177. {{ISBN|0-7914-2763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian scholar Mircea Handoca, editor of Eliade's writings, argues that the controversy surrounding Eliade was encouraged by a group of exiled writers, of whom Manea was a main representative, and believes that Eliade's association with the Guard was a conjectural one, determined by the young author's Christian values and [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance, as well as by his belief that a Legionary Romania could mirror Portugal's ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Handoca opined that Eliade changed his stance after discovering that the Legionaries had turned violent, and argued that there was no evidence of Eliade's actual affiliation with the Iron Guard as a political movement.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Additionally, Joaquín Garrigós, who translated Eliade's works into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], claimed that none of Eliade's texts he ever encountered show him to be an antisemite.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Mircea Eliade's nephew and commentator [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] himself proposed that Eliade's politics were essentially conservative and [[Patriotism|patriotic]], in part motivated by a fear of the [[Soviet Union]] which he shared with many other young intellectuals.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Based on Mircea Eliade's admiration for [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], various other authors assess that Eliade remained committed to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Robert Ellwood also places Eliade's involvement with the Iron Guard in relation to scholar's conservatism, and connects this aspect of Eliade's life with both his nostalgia and his study of primal societies. According to Ellwood, the part of Eliade that felt attracted to the "freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths" is the same part that felt attracted to the Guard, with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a "national resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.100–101&lt;/ref&gt; On a more basic level, Ellwood describes Eliade as an "instinctively spiritual" person who saw the Iron Guard as a spiritual movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellwood's view, Eliade was aware that the "[[golden age]]" of antiquity was no longer accessible to secular man, that it could be recalled but not re-established. Thus, a "more accessible" object for nostalgia was a "secondary silver age within the last few hundred years"—the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s 19th century cultural renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; To the young Eliade, the Iron Guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of Romania's glory, being a movement "dedicated to the cultural and national renewal of the Romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"/&gt; Ellwood describes the young Eliade as someone "capable of being fired up by mythological archetypes and with no awareness of the evil that was to be unleashed".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Eliade's withdrawal from politics, and also because the later Eliade's religiosity was very personal and idiosyncratic,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; Ellwood believes the later Eliade probably would have rejected the "corporate sacred" of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; According to Ellwood, the later Eliade had the same desire for a Romanian "resurrection" that had motivated the early Eliade to support the Iron Guard, but he now channeled it apolitically through his efforts to "maintain the culture of a free Romania" abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, Eliade says, "Against the terror of History there are only two possibilities of defense: action or contemplation."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Forbidden Forest'', in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood, the young Eliade took the former option, trying to reform the world through action, whereas the older Eliade tried to resist the terror of history intellectually.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt;

Eliade's own version of events, presenting his involvement in far right politics as marginal, was judged to contain several inaccuracies and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 208–211, 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Eliade depicted his arrest as having been solely caused by his friendship with [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 209&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, answering Gershom Scholem's query, he is known to have explicitly denied ever having contributed to ''[[Buna Vestire]]''.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; According to [[Sorin Antohi]], "Eliade died without ever clearly expressing regret for his Iron Guard sympathies".&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Z. Ornea]] noted that, in a short section of his ''Autobiography'' where he discusses the ''Einaudi'' incident, Eliade speaks of "my imprudent acts and errors committed in youth", as "a series of malentendus that would follow me all my life."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea commented that this was the only instance where the Romanian academic spoke of his political involvement with a dose of self-criticism, and contrasted the statement with Eliade's usual refusal to discuss his stances "pertinently".&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; Reviewing the arguments brought in support of Eliade, Sergio Vila-Sanjuán concluded: "Nevertheless, Eliade's pro-Legionary columns endure in the newspaper libraries, he never showed his regret for this connection [with the Iron Guard] and always, right up to his final writings, he invoked the figure of his teacher Nae Ionescu."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

In his ''Felix Culpa'', Manea directly accused Eliade of having embellished his memoirs in order to minimize an embarrassing past.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; A secondary debate surrounding Eliade's alleged unwillingness to dissociate with the Guard took place after ''Jurnalul portughez'' saw print. Sorin Alexandrescu expressed a belief that notes in the diary show Eliade's "break with his far right past".&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; [[Cătălin Avramescu]] defined this conclusion as "whitewashing", and, answering to Alexandrescu's claim that his uncle's support for the Guard was always superficial, argued that ''Jurnal portughez'' and other writings of the time showed Eliade's disenchantment with the Legionaries' Christian stance in tandem with his growing sympathy for [[Nazism]] and its [[Nazi occultism|pagan messages]].&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt; Paul Cernat, who stressed that it was the only one of Eliade's autobiographical works not to have been reworked by its author, concluded that the book documented Eliade's own efforts to "camouflage" his political sympathies without rejecting them altogether.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;

Oișteanu argued that, in old age, Eliade moved away from his earlier stances and even came to sympathize with the non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] Left and the [[hippie]] [[youth movement]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teodoist"/&gt; He noted that Eliade initially felt apprehensive about the consequences of hippie activism, but that the interests they shared, as well as their advocacy of [[communalism]] and [[free love]] had made him argue that hippies were "a quasi-religious movement" that was "rediscovering the sacrality of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei Oișteanu, who proposed that Eliade's critics were divided into a "maximalist" and a "minimalist" camp (trying to, respectively, enhance or shadow the impact Legionary ideas had on Eliade), argued in favor of moderation, and indicated that Eliade's fascism needed to be correlated to the political choices of his generation.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Political symbolism in Eliade's fiction===
Various critics have traced links between Eliade's fiction works and his political views, or Romanian politics in general. Early on, [[George Călinescu]] argued that the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] model outlined in ''Huliganii'' was: "An allusion to certain bygone political movements [...], sublimated in the ever so abstruse philosophy of death as a path to knowledge."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; By contrast, ''Întoarcerea din rai'' partly focuses on a failed [[Communism|communist]] rebellion, which enlists the participation of its main characters.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

''Iphigenia''‍'s story of self-sacrifice, turned voluntary in Eliade's version, was taken by various commentators, beginning with [[Mihail Sebastian]], as a favorable allusion to the Iron Guard's beliefs on commitment and death, as well as to the bloody outcome of the 1941 [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Ten years after its premiere, the play was reprinted by Legionary refugees in Argentina: on the occasion, the text was reviewed for publishing by Eliade himself.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Reading ''Iphigenia'' was what partly sparked Culianu's investigation of his mentor's early political affiliations.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

A special debate was sparked by ''Un om mare''. Culianu viewed it as a direct reference to [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] and his rise in popularity, an interpretation partly based on the similarity between, on one hand, two monikers ascribed to the Legionary leader (by, respectively, his adversaries and his followers), and, on the other, the main character's name (''Cucoanes'').&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; [[Matei Călinescu]] did not reject Culianu's version, but argued that, on its own, the piece was beyond political interpretations.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; Commenting on this dialog, literary historian and essayist [[Mircea Iorgulescu]] objected to the original verdict, indicating his belief that there was no historical evidence to substantiate Culianu's point of view.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

Alongside Eliade's main works, his attempted novel of youth, ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'', which depicts a population of red ants living in a totalitarian society and forming bands to harass the beetles, was seen as a potential allusion to the [[Soviet Union]] and to communism.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite Eliade's ultimate reception in [[Communist Romania]], this writing could not be published during the period, after [[Censorship|censors]] singled out fragments which they saw as especially problematic.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

==Cultural legacy==

An endowed chair in the History of Religions at the [[University of Chicago]] Divinity School was named after Eliade in recognition of his wide contribution to the research on this subject; the current (and first incumbent) holder of this chair is [[Wendy Doniger]].

To evaluate the legacy of Eliade and [[Joachim Wach]] within the discipline of the history of religions, the University of Chicago chose 2006 (the intermediate year between the 50th anniversary of Wach's death and the 100th anniversary of Eliade's birth), to hold a two-day conference in order to reflect upon their academic contributions and their political lives in their social and historical contexts, as well as the relationship between their works and their lives.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics in History"/&gt;

In 1990, after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], Eliade was elected posthumously to the [[Romanian Academy]]. In Romania, Mircea Eliade's legacy in the field of the history of religions is mirrored by the journal ''Archaeus'' (founded 1997, and affiliated with the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of History). The 6th European Association for the Study of Religion and International Association for the History of Religions Special Conference on ''Religious History of Europe and Asia'' took place from September 20 to September 23, 2006, in [[Bucharest]]. An important section of the Congress was dedicated to the memory of Mircea Eliade, whose legacy in the field of history of religions was scrutinized by various scholars, some of whom were his direct students at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |title=''The Sixth EASR and IAHR Special Conference'' |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011070115/http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2006 |df= }}; retrieved July 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As Antohi noted, Eliade, [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] "represent in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] ultimate expressions of excellence, [Eliade and Cioran] being regarded as proof that Romania's [[Interwar period|interwar]] culture (and, by extension, Romanian culture as a whole) was able to reach the ultimate levels of depth, sophistication and creativity."&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"/&gt; A [[TVR 1|Romanian Television 1]] poll carried out in 2006 nominated Mircea Eliade as the 7th Greatest Romanian in history; his case was argued by the journalist [[Dragoş Bucurenci]] (''see [[100 greatest Romanians]]''). His name was given to a boulevard in the northern Bucharest area of [[Primăverii]], to a street in [[Cluj-Napoca]], and to high schools in Bucharest, [[Sighişoara]], and [[Reşiţa]]. The Eliades' house on Melodiei Street was torn down during the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and an apartment block was raised in its place; his second residence, on [[Dacia Boulevard]], features a memorial plaque in his honor.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Eliade's image in contemporary culture also has political implications. Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] proposed that the respect he enjoys in Romania is matched by that of other "nationalist thinkers and politicians" who "have reentered the contemporary scene largely as heroes of a pre- and anticommunist past", including Nae Ionescu and Cioran, but also [[Ion Antonescu]] and [[Nichifor Crainic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Livezeanu]], ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building and Ethnic Struggle, 1918–1930'', [[Cornell University Press]], [[New York City]], 1995, p.x. {{ISBN|0-8014-8688-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, according to Oişteanu (who relied his assessment on Eliade's own personal notes), Eliade's interest in the American hippie community was reciprocated by members of the latter, some of whom reportedly viewed Eliade as "a [[guru]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Eliade has also been hailed as an inspiration by [[Germany|German]] representatives of the ''[[Neue Rechte]]'', claiming legacy from the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] (among them is the controversial magazine ''[[Junge Freiheit]]'' and the essayist [[Karlheinz Weißmann]]).&lt;ref name="altitudini"&gt;[http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 "Biografia lui Mircea Eliade la o editură germană radicală de dreapta" ("Mircea Eliade's Biography at a Right-Wing Radical German Publishing House")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903051830/http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 |date=2007-09-03 }}, in [http://www.altitudini.ro/ ''Altitudini''], Nr. 17, July 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Florin Ţurcanu's biographical volume on Eliade was issued in a German translation by the Antaios publishing house, which is mouthpiece for the ''Neue Rechte''.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; The edition was not reviewed by the mainstream German press.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; Other sections of the European [[far right]] also claim Eliade as an inspiration, and consider his contacts with the Iron Guard to be a merit—among their representatives are the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Neo-fascism|neofascist]] [[Claudio Mutti]] and Romanian groups who trace their origin to the Legionary Movement.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Portrayals, filmography and dramatizations===
Early on, Mircea Eliade's novels were the subject of [[satire]]: before the two of them became friends, [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], using the pen name ''Antisthius'', authored and published [[Parody|parodies]] of them.&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"/&gt; [[Maitreyi Devi]], who strongly objected to Eliade's account of their encounter and relationship, wrote her own novel as a reply to his ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]''; written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], it was titled ''[[Na Hanyate]]'' (translated into English as "It Does Not Die").&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; Several authors, including [[Ioan Petru Culianu]], have drawn a parallel between [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s [[Theatre of the Absurd|Absurdist]] play of 1959, ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'', which depicts the population of a small town falling victim to a mass metamorphosis, and the impact fascism had on Ionesco's closest friends (Eliade included).&lt;ref&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."; Ornea, p.19, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Saul Bellow]] published his controversial ''[[Ravelstein]]'' novel. Having for its setting the [[University of Chicago]], it had among its characters Radu Grielescu, who was identified by several critics as Eliade. The latter's portrayal, accomplished through statements made by the eponymous character, is polemical: Grielescu, who is identified as a disciple of [[Nae Ionescu]], took part in the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]], and is in Chicago as a refugee scholar, searching for the friendship of a Jewish colleague as a means to rehabilitate himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 "Portretul artistului ca delincvent politic" ("The Portrait of the Artist as a Political Offender"), Part I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065648/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 |date=2007-10-08 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.637, May 2002; retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Romanian literary critic and translator Antoaneta Ralian, who was an acquaintance of Bellow's, argued that much of the negative portrayal was owed to a personal choice Bellow made (after having divorced from Alexandra Bagdasar, his Romanian wife and Eliade disciple).&lt;ref name="ralian"&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm Antoaneta Ralian, interviewed on the occasion of Saul Bellow's death] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110532/http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}, [[BBC|BBC Romania]], April 7, 2005 (hosted by hotnews.ro); retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentioned that, during a 1979 interview, Bellow had expressed admiration for Eliade.&lt;ref name="ralian"/&gt;

The 1988 film ''[[The Bengali Night]]'', directed by Nicolas Klotz and based upon the French translation of ''Maitreyi'', stars [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Hugh Grant]] as Allan, the European character based on Eliade, while [[Supriya Pathak]] is Gayatri, a character based on Maitreyi Devi (who had refused to be mentioned by name).&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; The film, considered "[[Pornography|pornographic]]" by [[Hinduism|Hindu]] activists, was only shown once in [[India]].&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; In addition to ''The Bengali Night'', films based on, or referring to, his works, include: ''Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du Sacré'' (1987), part of the television series ''Architecture et Géographie sacrées'', by [[Paul Barbă Neagră]]; ''[[Miss Christina (1992 film)|Domnişoara Christina]]'' (1992), by Viorel Sergovici; ''[[Eu Adam]]'' (1996), by [[Dan Pița]]; ''[[Youth Without Youth (film)|Youth Without Youth]]'' (2007), by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

Eliade's ''Iphigenia'' was again included in theater programs during the late years of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime: in January 1982, a new version, directed by [[Ion Cojar]], premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]], starring [[Mircea Albulescu]], [[Tania Filip]] and [[Adrian Pintea]] in some of the main roles.&lt;ref name="raifigenia"/&gt; Dramatizations based on his work include ''[[La Țigănci]]'', which has been the basis for two theater adaptations: ''Cazul Gavrilescu'' ("The Gavrilescu Case"), directed by [[Gelu Colceag]] and hosted by the [[Nottara Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Margareta Nistor]], [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/5148/Irina-Margareta-Nistor/Un-cuplu-creator-de-teatru---Gelu-si-Roxana-Colceag.html "Un cuplu creator de teatru – Gelu şi Roxana Colceag" ("A Theater Producing Couple – Gelu and Roxana Colceag")], September 2001, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved January 18, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an eponymous play by director Alexandru Hausvater, first staged by the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theater]] in 2003 (starring, among others, [[Adriana Trandafir]], [[Florin Zamfirescu]], and [[Carmen Tănase]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 "''La ţigănci''...&amp;nbsp;cu Popescu" (''To the Gypsy Girls''...&amp;nbsp;with Popescu")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327210015/http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 |date=2008-03-27 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 31, 2003; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, on Eliade's 100th birthday, the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] hosted the ''Mircea Eliade Week'', during which [[radio drama]] adaptations of several works were broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/3964/Comunicat-de-presa/Saptamana-Mircea-Eliade-la-Radio-Romania.html "Săptămâna ''Mircea Eliade'' la Radio România" ("The ''Mircea Eliade'' Week on Radio Romania")] (2007 press communique) {{ro icon}}, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, director and dramatist Cezarina Udrescu staged a [[multimedia]] performance based on a number of works Mircea Eliade wrote during his stay in [[Portugal]]; titled ''Apocalipsa după Mircea Eliade'' ("The Apocalypse According to Mircea Eliade"), and shown as part of a Romanian Radio cultural campaign, it starred [[Ion Caramitru]], [[Oana Pellea]] and [[Răzvan Vasilescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 "Scrieri de Eliade şi Vişniec, în cadrul festivalului Enescu" ("Texts by Eliade and Vişniec, as Part of the Enescu Festival")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922041749/http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 |date=2007-09-22 }}, in ''[[Gândul]]'', September 12, 2007; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Domnișoara Christina'' has been the subject of two [[opera]]s: the first, carrying the same Romanian title, was authored by Romanian composer [[Șerban Nichifor]] and premiered in 1981 at the Romanian Radio;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimec.ro/Muzica/evenimadd/simn2004/ZiuaIV.htm ''Săptămâna Internaţională a Muzicii Noi.

The '''Monument to Peter I''' ({{lang-ru|памятник Петру I}}) is a bronze [[equestrian statue|equestrian monument]] of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in front of the [[St. Michael's Castle]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. 

In 1716, emperor Peter the Great commissioned the Italian sculptor [[Carlo Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] to design an equestrian statue in commemoration of the Russian victories over [[Sweden]] in the [[Great Northern War]]. Rastrelli worked for eight years with a model of the monument before it was approved by the emperor in 1724. But as the emperor died the following year, work halted and the sculpture's casting was only completed after the sculptor's death, by 1747, only to remain in a local warehouse, and not to be erected until  53 years later. In the meantime, [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] had ordered another monument in memory of her predecessor Peter the Great - the ''[[Bronze Horseman]]'', the most famous statue of Peter the Great in St Petersburg. At the base of the ''Bronze Horseman'', Catherine even linked her name with Peter the Great, an expression of Catherine's attitude toward her predecessor and her view of her own place in the line of great Russian rulers. Catherine, who, having gained her position through a palace coup, had no legal claim to the throne, was anxious to appear as Peter's rightful heir.

Only in 1800, during the reign of emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], was the Monument to Peter I finally erected. It was placed on a pedestal faced with green, red and white-shaded Finnish [[marble]] that is decorated with bas-reliefs depicting scenes of two Russian victories over [[Sweden]] during the Great Northern War, the [[Battle of Poltava]] and the [[Battle of Gangut|Battle of Hangö]], and also an allegorical composition with trophies. The Russian victories at Poltava and near Hangö, Finland helped Russia become the dominant power in the north of the continent. Peter the Great led his troops to both victories. 

By order of emperor Paul I, the inscription "''To Great Grandfather from Great Grandson''" (''Прадеду - правнук'') was made on the pedestal, a subtle but obvious allusion to the [[Latin]] "''Petro Primo Catherina Secunda''", the dedication by Catherine the Great on the ''Bronze Horseman''. 

During [[World War II]], the equestrian statue of Peter I was removed from its pedestal and sheltered from the [[Siege of Leningrad|900-day German siege]] of the city. In 1945, the statue was restored and returned to its pedestal.

== History ==

Munshiram Manoharlal belongs to a family of publishers who were the pioneers in Indological publishing in India. The origins of the family business can be traced back to 1870 in Lahore where books were published under the name of the ancestral company which was founded by Mehar Chand Jain. He named it Meharchand Lachhmandas. Mehar Chand Jain, a widely respected literary figure, had translated the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs, into English. The British decorated him for his ground-breaking work. The company slowly expanded and its publications were being sold at premier bookstores all over the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tradition-specialist-publishers-innovate-export-and-thrive-on-a-niche-market/1/265225.html Making Money Down the Ages], [[India Today]], November 09, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrmlonline.com/home//india-today.jpg Making Money Down the Ages], [[India Today]], November 09, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrmlonline.com/home//india-today-(hindi).jpg Making Money Down the Ages (in Hindi)] [[India Today]], November 09, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meharchand Lachhmandas became the first to publish several classic, essential, and perennial texts in the field of Indology and became the premier Indological publisher with a long list of published titles. It had a vast collection of manuscripts and publications from around the world at its bookshops. Lahore was the centre of education at that time and the company's bookshops specialized in Indology. It flourished for three subsequent generations, i.e., Lachhman Das Jain, Munshi Ram Jain, and Manohar Lal Jain.

In 1947, just before the partition of India, the offices, press, bookstore, and residence were burned down by Muslim activists. Fortunately, the women and children of the family had been evacuated earlier to Amritsar. Soon afterwards, Manohar Lal Jain was forced to flee to Amritsar to take refuge, and was helped by kind Muslim neighbours, who helped him escape safely across the border. The family was once again united, but with no business or assets.

After the partition of India, there was a split in the family business. Manohar Lal Jain separated from the parent company Meharchand Lachhmandas to set up his own bookselling and publishing company. In 1948, he sold the jewelry his wife had brought with her from Lahore, and with that money, steps were taken to re-establish the business. Since Manohar Lal Jain was a well-known publisher with an excellent reputation, it was not difficult for him to restart the business. His services to the literary world were recognized and the business flourished once again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4583 Book Barons of Delhi] [[Hinduism Today]], May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Munshiram Manoharlal was founded as a bookselling and publishing company at Nai Sarak in Delhi. It soon gained popularity and respect and became a leading Indological publisher, bookseller, and library-supplier from India. Munshiram Manoharlal's publications, along with other publications from the Indian subcontinent, were now being marketed aggressively in the South Asian market and exported to countries all over the world.

Manohar Lal Jain died in 1988 due to cardiac arrest. Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. is now run by his son and his grandson, namely Ashok Jain and Vikram Jain respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurter-buchmesse.eu/en/magali/?p=2511 In his grandfather's footsteps] Frankfurt Book Fair Website, November 08, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nalsar was judged the best in India in mooting in the first two seasons of Mooting Premiere League in 2009-2010 and 2010-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legallyindia.com/wiki/Mooting_Premier_League_2009-10 |title=Mooting Premier League 2009-10 - Legallypedia |publisher=Legallyindia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debating===
NALSAR won India's oldest [[Parliamentary Debate]] at St. Stephens College, Delhi in December 2005. This was followed by victories at the  Annual Parliamentary Debate held at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in January 2007 and 2009, the debate conducted by the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad in February 2007, and that of the Young Orators Club of Secunderabad in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Hindu|title=NALSAR, Nasr school sweep YOCS competition|url=http://www.hindu.com/edu/2008/08/18/stories/2008081850360300.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NALSAR further cemented its reputation on the debating circuit by winning the inaugural IIM Bangalore Parliamentary Debating Championship 'Cicero' in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NALSAR University of Law|url=http://www.nalsar.ac.in/achivements.html|title=Student Achievements|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025153709/http://www.nalsar.ac.in/achivements.html|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolavenues.com/bschools/090101/iimb-nalsar-1.php |title=NALSAR, Hyderabad Wins IIM Bangalore's Parliamentary Debating Championship 2009 |publisher=Coolavenues.com |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NALSAR Intervarsity Debating Championship is the pioneer of the British Parliamentary Debating format in India. The idea for the NALSAR IV was born to introduce the British Parliamentary debate format to the national debating circuit and provide a preparatory ground for the WUDC (World Universities Debating Championship), the most prestigious debating championship in the world. Thus, the NALSAR IV is aimed at exposing debaters to the most competitive standards of adjudication. The NALSAR IV has now earned the name to be one of the most prestigious debating championships in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/edu/2011/04/11/stories/2011041150270100.htm |title=Education Plus : NLU Delhi wins Parliamentary debate |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quizzing===
Over the past many years, NALSAR has been very active in the Hyderabad and Indian quizzing circuit. Teams representing the university have won a number of inter-college quizzes in the twin cities, and across India.The college has a strong quizzing base and sees quizzes being hosted within the college regularly from time to time. Achievements by quizzers from NALSAR include finishing as runners-up in the K-Circle India Quiz 2010 and 2011, as well as winners in BITS Pilani-Hyderabad Campus' annual fest Pearl 2012, 2013 and 2015. A 4th year team won the Best College Team title at the Landmark Quiz held at Hyderabad on 6 October 2013, something which has also been won by NALSAR before. NALSAR also finished second in Manipal's Quiz on The Beach 2015 and Tata Crucible Hyderabad 2015. A team won the Economic Times in Campus Quiz for two years consecutively in 2014 and 2015. The university has also become host to one of India's largest college QuizFests, titled 'Interrobang', which will be in its third edition in March 2016.

'''Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder''' S.J. (January 29, 1906 &amp;ndash; July 8, 1995) was a Dutch expert in the [[Javanese language#Old Javanese|Old Javanese language]]. He came from [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and was associated with the [[Society of Jesus]] by 1925. He worked at [[Leiden University]] in the 1930s. His first work appeared in 1930 and he continued to write into the 1990s.  He lived in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]  and was interred in the Jesuit necropolis at [[Muntilan]], [[Java (island)|Java]].

His work was important in the understanding of linguistic studies of Java. He also did works on [[Monism]] and [[Muhammad]]. [[Merle Ricklefs]] translated his thesis in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zoetmulder, P. J.; Ricklefs, Merle C. (tr.) (1933; 1995) ''Pantheism and Monism in Javanese Suluk Literature: Islamic and Indian mysticism in an Indonesian setting''; translated from the Dutch. Leiden: KITLV Press {{ISBN|90-6718-082-3}} (Translation of "Pantheïsme en monisme in de Javaansche soeloek-litteratuur")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood ==
Zoetmulder was born in Utrecht, [[Netherlands]]. From his early childhood, "Piet"—as he was called—was able to read and write even before entering school. His mother Catharina née Noelege was a professional [[pianist]] and had been a patient teacher to Piet such that he was able to be admitted to [[primary school]] without having to attend [[kindergarten]] due to his reading and writing skills. At school he was known to be a conscientious, talented and smart student. His father was an [[engineer]].

Piet was raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family, and while attending the Canisius College Mater Dei ''gymnasium'' he became interested in becoming a [[priest]], specifically as a member of the ''Society of Jesus''. Two of his uncles were priests, and an aunt had been a nun in [[Africa]] and [[Suriname]]. His father had to move to the town of Heerlen for his work as a public health engineer, so Piet attended a gymnasium at [[Rolduc]] instead, which was also his father's alma mater. He graduated in the A and B academic tracks. In 1925 he was admitted to the Society of Jesus Novitiate School to begin his training as a priest.

== Departure to Java ==
Father J. Willekens, S.J., his mentor at the novitiate, advised Zoetmulder to consider working for the mission on the island of Java. Following his mentor's advise, Zoetmulder departed for the [[Dutch East Indies]] as a 19-year novice. He was placed at the Intermediate Seminary in Yogyakarta, [[Central Java]]. Surprisingly, three years later his former mentor Willekens himself joined him in Java as a ''Visiting Apostolic''. Upon meeting his former student, Willekens commented that, ''"In addition to studying [[philosophy]], you must also learn old Javanese."'' He was introduced to Prof. C. C. Berg, who was an instructor in [[Surakarta]], to help him study the language. In 1931 Zoetmulder graduated ''cum laude'' and was made a candidate priest in Girisonta, Ungaran, near [[Semarang]].

== Continuing education ==
Upon his graduation from his study with Berg, Zoetmulder went to the [[University of Leiden]] in the Netherlands. He graduated with an associate degree in one year, contrary to the usual three years. He earned his bachelor's degree also in one year, contrary again to the usual three years customarily taken, with a degree in the history of Java and [[archeology]].  In October 1935 he successfully defended his doctoral [[thesis]] ''"Pantheïsme en Monisme in de Javaansche Soeloek Literatuur,"'' with the help of Berg. He graduated ''cum laude.'' Father Zoet, as he is affectionately called, had to finish his studies in [[theology]] before he returned to Java. For four years he studied in [[Maastricht]]. Before returning to the East Indies, he had to first undergo intermediate study of religion for year in [[Belgium]]. Unfortunately for him, the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the occupation of Belgium by [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces forced him to seek refuge in [[France]] in June 1940.

He was finally able to obtain passage on a ship to the Dutch East Indies, but had to make a stop in [[UK|Britain]] to avoid [[Germany|German]] sea mines blocking the sea routes. After a month's wait he was finally able to arrive on Java via [[Hong Kong]]. One of his colleagues had died when the ship that he boarded was torpedoed by the German Navy. Upon arrival in Java, Zoet exclaimed that, ''"God had wished for me to be happy on Javanese soil."''

== Japanese Occupation and Post-World War II ==
[[File:Taal van het Adiparwa.jpg|thumb|''De Taal van het Adiparwa'', a reprint from 1983.]]
After his arrival in [[Jakarta]], Zoetmulder was offered a post in the Linguistics Department of the [[University of Indonesia]].  However, his strong desire to further his study of Javanese drove him to choose to reside in Yogyakarta.  He then taught at the AMS, and counted among his students Prof. Dr. Koentjaraningrat, Dr. Sukmono and Dr. S. Supomo.

When [[Japan]]ese forces entered Indonesia in 1942, Zoetmulder was interned as a citizen of the Netherlands.  He was fortunate to be allowed to bring his books and pens as a prisoner.  When he was transferred to the [[Cimahi]] prison he was able to smuggle the ''[[Adi Parva|Adiparwa]]'' edited by Dr. H. H. Juynboll (''Âdiparwa''; Hendrik Herman Juynboll, ed., 1906 Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, M. Nijhoff) and a Javanese dictionary written by Gericke-Roorda. Zoetmulder attempted to study the linguistics of old Javanese through this book.  His study of old Javanese [[grammar]] was eventually published in Dutch in 1954 (''"De Taal van het Adiparwa"'') and in Indonesian in 1950 (''"Bahasa Parwa"'') with the help of I. R. Pedjawijatna.  This book eventually was adopted as the basic textbook for the study of old Javanese.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] he was nearly killed by a [[Resistance movement#Freedom Fighter|freedom fighter]] due to his Dutch complexion while he was at the Kemetiran Residence, Yogyakarta.  Fortunately, a Javanese man defended him and claimed that he was a "holy man."

== Academic career ==
After escaping the Internment camp Baros-I in 1945, he began to teach at [[Gadjah Mada University]].  Five years later he was made a Distinguished Permanent Professor of Pedagogic Literature at the same university, by a mandate from the Minister of Education and Culture. At this time he relinquished his former citizenship. His daily work was increased by his role as a representative of the Dean of the Literature Department Prof. Dr. R. M. Ng. Poerbatjaraka, who was spending most of his time in Jakarta. In addition, he was teaching Old Javanese in the Yogyakarta area.

When he first started lecturing, Zoetmulder used Javanese. However, he then came to realize that many students came from outside of Java and hence did not speak Javanese fluently. In order to make the study easier, he wanted to write a dictionary of old Javanese, starting his work in 1950. In the beginning he was convinced that he would be able to do it in 10 years, but in reality he would take longer to finish the dictionary. He also wrote a compendium entitled ''"Sekar Sumawur: Bunga rampai bahasa Djawa Kuno"''.

His book ''"Kalangwan"'', containing an account of old Javanese ''belles lettres'' and writers, was published in 1974, to be followed by the ''"Old Javanese-English Dictionary"'' in 1982. He admitted difficulty in writing due to his having to collect his material from microfilm located at the University of Leiden.

== Death ==
Prof. Zoetmulder died on July 8, 1995 at the priest residence in Kemetiran, Yogyakarta.  He was buried at the church cemetery in [[Muntilan]], Magelang, Central Java.

== Personal life ==
Zoetmulder was an avid reader, and liked to play the [[violin]].  He considered himself Indonesian, or more specifically Javanese.  ''"God had placed my heart in Indonesia.  My residence has been decided to be here,"'' he said.  On March 3, 1951, he was naturalized as an Indonesian citizen.  He enjoyed his stay at Kemetiran, which is said to be compatible with his feeling of being Javanese.  He had resided there for nine years.

Father Zoet was a fan of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. In addition to his religious and scientific textbooks, he also devoured volumes of novels and poetry, and detective series. It was said that he owned more than 1,000 detective books in his room, including those written by [[Ngaio Marsh]]. He was friends with detective writer [[John le Carré]], and while staying in [[Bonn]], Germany, he received a gift directly from Le Carré himself: a popular book titled ''"[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]"''. Le Carré's other story ''"A Small Town in Germany,"'' was "inspected" by Father Zoet prior to publication.

== Quotes ==
* ''"I told them that I had come from the Netherlands myself, and yet I was able to learn it. What is most important is to have the will. Anything can be learned, nothing is difficult,"'' retelling his argument with foreign students who felt unable to learn old Javanese.
* ''"To me, being a citizen of the Netherlands or Indonesia is the same. I never missed the Netherlands... When God takes my life, I wish it to happen on Java"'', when asked whether he regretted giving up his former citizenship.

{{distinguish|Police}}
A '''policy''' is a [[Deliberation|deliberate]] [[system]] of [[principle]]s to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Policy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Impact==

===Intended effects===
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the 
organization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Corporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Unintended effects===
Policies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing [[capital flight]] or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed. (See the [[Laffer curve]].) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Policy cycle==
In [[political science]], the '''policy cycle''' is a tool used for the analyzing of the development of a policy item. It can also be referred to as a "stagist approach", "stages heuristic" or "stages approach". It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how [[political science|political scientists]] looked at policy in general.&lt;ref&gt;

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00034.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a theory from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s work.

One version by James E. Anderson, in his ''Public Policy-Making'' (1974) has the following stages:
# [[Political agenda|Agenda]] setting (Problem identification) - The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention. 
# Policy Formulation - Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem. (appraisal, dialogue, formulation, and consolidation)
# Decision-making - Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it. (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action') 
# [[Implementation]] - The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
# [[Evaluation]] - Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results. [[Actor (policy debate)|Policy actors]] attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.

An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in ''The Australian Policy Handbook'' by Peter Bridgman and [[Glyn Davis]]: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

# Issue identification
# [[Policy analysis]]
# [[Public consultation|Consultation]] (which permeates the entire process)
# Policy instrument development
# Building coordination and coalitions
# Program Design: [[Decision theory|Decision]] making
# Policy [[Implementation]]
# Policy [[Evaluation]]

The Althaus, Bridgman &amp; Davis model is [[heuristic]] and [[iterative]]. It is {{clarify|text=intentionally [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]]|date=February 2016}} and not meant to be {{clarify|text=[[Organizational diagnostics|diagnostic]]|date=February 2016}} or [[predictive]]. Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers. Accordingly, some [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [https://www.odi.org/publications/1127-become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes [[Voluntary sector|civil society organisations]], the [[Mass media|media]], [[intellectuals]], [[think tanks]] or policy [[research institutes]], corporations, [[Advocacy group|lobbyists]], etc.

==Content==
Policies are typically [[promulgation|promulgated]] through official written documents. Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force. Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including '''{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}''' :
* A '''purpose statement''', outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.
* An '''applicability and scope''' statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements.  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.
* An '''effective date''' which indicates when the policy comes into force.  [[Ex post facto law|Retroactive policies]] are rare, but can be found.
* A '''responsibilities''' section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements.  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions.  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant [[Regulation|oversight]] and/or [[governance]] structures.
* '''Policy statements''' indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating.  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.

Some policies may contain additional sections, including:
* '''Background''', indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as '''motivating factors'''.  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.
* '''Definitions''', providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.
 {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Typologies==
The American political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] proposed four types of policy, namely '''distributive''', '''redistributive''', '''regulatory''' and '''constituent''' in his article 'Four systems of Policy, Politics and Choice' and in 'American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory'.
Policy addresses the [[intent]] of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary. Policy is intended to affect the 'real' world, by guiding the decisions that are made. Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://perguntasaopo.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lowi_1972_four-systems-of-policy-politics-and-choice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies may be classified in many different ways. The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Distributive policies===
[[Distributive tendency|Distributive policies]] extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization. Examples include government policies that impact spending for [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[public education]], [[highways]], and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Regulatory policies===
Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior. These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions. An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Constituent policies===
Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws. Constituent policies also deal with Fiscal Policy in some circumstances.{{Citation needed|reason=As well as the governing board creates laws
Noman Dhakkn|date=February 2010}}

===Redistributive policies===
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws. Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results. Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

When the term policy is used, it may also refer to:{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}
* Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
* Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
* A company or organization's policy on a particular topic.  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.

The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by [[Horse trading|political compromise]] over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Types of [[policy analysis]] include: &lt;!-- explain them!--&gt;

* Causal (resp. non-causal)
* Deterministic (resp. stochastic, randomized and sometimes non-deterministic)
* Index
* Memoryless (''e.g.'', non-stationary)
* Opportunistic (resp. non-opportunistic)
* Stationary (resp. non-stationary)

These qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy.

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[enterprise architecture]] for systems design, [[policy appliances]] are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in [[information systems]].
* In [[insurance]], policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] (protect) against potential loss from specified perils. While these documents are referred to as policies, they are in actuality a form of [[contract]] - see [[insurance contract]].
* In [[gambling]], policy is a form of an unsanctioned lottery, where players purport to purchase ''[[insurance]]'' against a chosen number being picked by a legitimate [[lottery]]. Or can refer to an ordinary [[Numbers game]]
* In [[artificial intelligence]] planning &lt;!-- as in artificial intelligence? unclear--&gt; and ''reinforcement learning'', a policy prescribes a non-empty deliberation (sequence of actions) given a non-empty sequence of states.
* In [[debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate]], the term "policy" is slang for [[policy debate|policy or cross-examination]] debate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6520">[[File:Battle strike 1934.jpg|thumb|250px|Violent confrontation between working class union members and law enforcement, as in the [[Minneapolis general strike of 1934]] shown above, was commonly frowned upon by professional middle class.]]In the [[United States]] there has long been a conflict between the [[working class]] majority and the [[American middle class#The professional/managerial middle class|professional class]]. The conflict goes back to the workers revolution and age of [[labor unions in the United States|unionized labor]] in the late nineteenth century. Since the 1870s and the rise of professionalism, the daily routine of American workers has been largely designed by professionals instead of foremen.

Today, most American workers &amp;ndash;many of whom earn middle-range incomes and work in [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] occupations – are usually not resentful of the professionals, though a feeling of disconnect persists. Even nowadays there is a large visible discrepancy between professionals whose main job duties include visualizing and directing the day of other workers and those who carry out the orders. While the work of professionals and managers is usually largely self-directed and appeals to the interest of the individual, that of middle-range income white-collar and [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] workers is closely supervised and tends to greatly stray from the worker's actual interests.

Yet another reason for resentment toward the professional middle class on the part of the [[working class]] stems from the embedded feelings of [[anti-intellectualism]]. When combined working class workers seem to often be under the impression that their better paid, professional managers are not actually "doing anything" as most of their duties are to conceptualize and outline their ideas.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class| publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The student movement==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
In the 1960s, tensions between classes flared up again. The student protestors, many of whom had deferments and were therefore exempt from fighting in the [[Vietnam War]], were generally the youth of the professional middle class. Though the student protestors envisioned solidarity with the working class as a means of opposing "establishment" policies with regard to war, race, and other social issues, the student protestors' lack of support for the Vietnam War, as well as generalized antipathy toward youthful rebellion, alienated the working classes.

==Current disconnect==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
In modern-day America, a common view among some members of the working class or less privileged members of the [[American middle class#statistical middle class|statistical middle class]] is that while the [[American middle class#The professional/managerial middle class|professional middle class]] is paid better, they are less directly involved in the production of goods and services than those of the working class. This difference in pay coupled with the impression that professionals and managers are less hands-on in their work often evokes an image of unearned privilege in the minds of [[working class]] persons. Conversely, the fact that working class persons generally work with their hands may lead those of the middle-class to assume that those of the working class are incapable of abstract, intellectual reasoning. One must also consider that most professionals tend to work in their fields of interest; thus work may not be as perceived as dreadful and menial by them. For working class persons, however, the contrary may be true. This difference in job satisfaction tends to be perceived by working class persons as further proof of unearned privileged among their professional managers, further adding to class tension.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unearned privilege"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classism.org/home_definition.html|title=Unearned privilege|accessdate=2006-08-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619194421/http://www.classism.org/home_definition.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally middle-class persons may lack direct experience in relating to working-class persons outside of a formal workplace environment. Examples of interactions between both classes other than the common worker/manager interaction include that of consultations with physicians or therapists. Author Barbara Ehrenreich suggests that these relationships will often lead to the unconscious assumption of class privilege on the part of middle-class individuals in their dealings with members of the working class.

{{cquote|Relative to the working class, the holders of middle class occupations are in positions of command or, at the very least authority. Their job is to conceptualize, in broad terms, what others must do. The job of the worker... is to get it done. The fact that this is a relationship of domination-and grudging submission-is usually invisible to the [professional] middle class but painfully apparent to the working class. -Barbara Ehrenreich}}

Overall working class Americans are most likely to encounter a professional middle class persons in a situation where the latter either directs or advises the former. Meaning that working class persons usually do not converse with professionals unless they are receiving instructions or being given advice. Likewise, members of the contemporary middle class are increasingly unlikely to interact with working-class persons outside of a supervisor/employee setting, and will rarely attempt to know or relate to working-class individuals as individuals.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Unearned privilege"/&gt;

'''Radical evil''' ({{lang-de|das radikal Böse}}) is a phrase used by German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone]]'' (1793), one representing the Christian term, radix malorum.

There Kant writes:

{{quote|The depravity of human nature, then, is not so much to be called badness, if this word is taken in its strict sense, namely, as a disposition (subjective principle of maxims) to adopt the bad, as bad, into one’s maxims as a spring (for that is devilish); but rather perversity of heart, which, on account of the result, is also called a bad heart. This may co-exist with a Will [“Wille”] good in general, and arises from the frailty of human nature, which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles, combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs (even of well-intentioned actions) from one another by moral rule. So that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law, not to their derivation from it, that is, to the law itself as the only spring. Now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto, that is, to vice, yet the habit of regarding the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty (as virtue) must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart (since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all, but only the obedience to the letter of the law).

A variety of artists have provided the detailed artwork, including Kai Lange, Jørgen Nielsen, and Sven Vestergaard (1932-).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cornelius-hansen.com/Royal+Copenhagen+Plaquette+2004 |title=Royal Copenhagen Plaquette 2004 |publisher=cornelius-hansen.com |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dphtrading.com/nyheder.aspx?l=2 |title=News |publisher=dphtrading.com |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empiregiftsandantiques.com/index.cfm/Royal_Copenhagen_2006_centennial_plaquette.htm |title=2006 Royal Copenhagen Centennial Plaquette, 3rd.ed |publisher=empiregiftsandantiques.com |accessdate=2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back, each plaquette has two pierced holes so the plaquettes can be hung for display.  In addition to the number 2010, most (though not all) have an identification number, along with a description (usually in Danish, all capital letters) of the front scene.  Some have the words “ROYAL COPENHAGEN DENMARK FAJENCE”, or just ‘DENMARK”.  Some have the factory mark, three wavy lines one atop another.  Some have a monogram. Some have the Royal Copenhagen modified beehive mark:  a capital "A" representing the Aluminia factory with three wavy lines, representing Royal Copenhagen, as cross strokes.  All plates manufactured after 1969 have a crown and the words "Royal Copenhagen Denmark".&lt;ref name=jamiri/&gt;

Earl Nelson Newman wrote and privately printed a small hard-cover book in 1973 entitled "The Danish Royal Copenhagen Plaquettes: 2010 Series".  This book contains pictures and descriptions of plates #1-#85, and the special series featuring American Presidents, zoo animals, and antique autos.

Because there was nearly no information/literatur about the "2010" Series,Carsten Pedersen (a collector himself) wrote a collector's catalogue in 2010.
The catalogue describes about 448 miniplates (plaquettes) from the "2010" series and other series (old and new) from Royal
Copenhagen, Aluminia, Köbenhavns Fajancefabrik and Bing &amp; Gröndahl, Copenhagen.
The catalogue was privately printed and entitled "Royal Copenhagen, Aluminia, Bing &amp; Gröndahl - Plaquetten-Miniplates Series 2010 and special editions"

'''Second-language acquisition''' ('''SLA'''), '''second-language learning''', or '''L2''' ('''language 2''') '''acquisition''', is the process by which people learn a [[second language]]. Second-language acquisition is also the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process. The field of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]], but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines, such as [[psychology]] and [[education]].

A central theme in SLA research is that of ''[[interlanguage]]'', the idea that the language that learners use is not simply the result of differences between the languages that they already know and the language that they are learning, but that it is a complete language system in its own right, with its own systematic rules. This interlanguage gradually develops as learners are exposed to the targeted language. The order in which learners acquire features of their new language stays remarkably constant, even for learners with different native languages, and regardless of whether they have had language instruction. However, languages that learners already know can have a significant influence on the process of learning a new one. This influence is known as ''[[language transfer]]''.

The primary factor driving SLA appears to be the language input that learners receive. Learners become more advanced the longer they are immersed in the language they are learning, and the more time they spend doing free voluntary reading. The [[input hypothesis]] developed by linguist [[Stephen Krashen]] makes a distinction between language acquisition and language learning (acquisition–learning distinction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|title=Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition (Assimilação Natural - o Construtivismo no Ensino de Línguas)|author=|date=|website=www.sk.com.br|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122150432/http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|archivedate=22 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that acquisition is a subconscious process, whereas learning is a conscious one. According to this hypothesis, the acquisition process in L2 (Language 2) is the same as L1 (Language 1) acquisition. The learning process is consciously learning and inputting the language being learned.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=100}} However, this goes as far as to state that input is all that is required for acquisition. Subsequent work, such as the [[interaction hypothesis]] and the [[comprehensible output hypothesis]], has suggested that opportunities for output and for interaction may also be necessary for learners to reach more advanced levels.

Research on how exactly learners acquire a new language spans a number of different areas. Focus is directed toward providing proof of whether basic linguistic skills are innate (nature), acquired (nurture), or a combination of the two attributes. Cognitive approaches to SLA research deal with the processes in the brain that underpin language acquisition, for example how paying attention to language affects the ability to learn it, or how language acquisition is related to short-term and long-term memory. Sociocultural approaches reject the notion that SLA is a purely psychological phenomenon, and attempt to explain it in a social context. Some key social factors that influence SLA are the level of immersion, connection to the L2 community, and gender. Linguistic approaches consider language separately from other kinds of knowledge, and attempt to use findings from the wider study of linguistics to explain SLA. There is also a considerable body of research about how SLA can be affected by individual factors such as age and learning strategies. A commonly discussed topic regarding age in SLA is the [[critical period hypothesis]], which suggests that individuals lose the ability to fully learn a language after a particular age in childhood. Another topic of interest in SLA is the differences between adult and child learners. Learning strategies are commonly categorized as learning or communicative strategies, and are developed to improve their respective acquisition skills. Affective factors are emotional factors that influence an individual's ability to learn a new language. Common affective factors that influence acquisition are anxiety, personality, social attitudes, and motivation.

Individuals may also lose a language through a process called [[second-language attrition]]. This is often caused by lack of use or exposure to a language over time. The severity of attrition depends on a variety of factors including level of [[Language proficiency|proficiency]], age, social factors, and motivation at the time of acquisition. Finally, classroom research deals with the effect that language instruction has on acquisition.

== Definitions ==
''Second language'' refers to any language learned in addition to a person's [[first language]]; although the concept is named ''second''-language acquisition, it can also incorporate the learning of third, fourth, or subsequent languages.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=7}} Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do; it does not refer to practices in [[language teaching]], although teaching can affect acquisition. The term ''acquisition'' was originally used to emphasize the non-conscious nature of the learning process,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Krashen|1982}} made a sharp distinction between ''learning'' and ''acquisition'', using ''learning'' to refer to the conscious aspects of the language learning process and ''acquisition'' to refer to the subconscious aspects. This strict separation of learning and acquisition is widely regarded as an oversimplification by researchers today, but his hypotheses were very influential and the name has stuck.&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years ''learning'' and ''acquisition'' have become largely synonymous.

SLA can incorporate [[heritage language learning]],{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=21–24}} but it does not usually incorporate [[bilingualism]]. Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language, not the process itself, and see the term as referring to native-like fluency. Writers in fields such as education and psychology, however, often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of [[multilingualism]].{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=24–25}} SLA is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a [[foreign language]]; rather, the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=3}}

== Research background ==
The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]]. It is broad-based and relatively new. As well as the various branches of [[linguistics]], second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology, [[cognitive psychology]], and education. To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself, the terms ''second-language acquisition research'', ''second-language studies'', and ''second-language acquisition studies'' are also used.

SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field, and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} However, two papers in particular are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: Pit Corder's 1967 essay ''The Significance of Learners' Errors'', and Larry Selinker's 1972 article ''Interlanguage''.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}} The field saw a great deal of development in the following decades.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} Since the 1980s, SLA has been studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, and theoretical perspectives. In the early 2000s, some research suggested an equivalence between the acquisition of human languages and that of computer languages (e.g. Java) by children in the 5 to 11 year age window, though this has not been widely accepted among educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Readin', Writin' &amp; Ruby On Rails: Let's Teach Our Kids To Code|last = Koerner|first = Brendan I.|date = October 2013|journal = Wired|doi = |pmid = |page = 30|author-link = Brendan I. Koerner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant approaches in the field today are: systemic functional linguistics, sociocultural theory, cognitive linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[universal grammar]], [[Skill-based theories of second-language acquisition|skill acquisition theory]] and [[connectionism]].{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned, and many issues are still unresolved. There are many theories of second-language acquisition, but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of SLA, this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. Although attempts have been made to provide a more unified account that tries to bridge first language acquisition and second language learning research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janciauskas|first=Marius|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2017-07-26|title=Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12519|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=42|pages=519–554|doi=10.1111/cogs.12519|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Stages ==
Stephen Krashen divides the process of second-language acquisition into five stages: preproduction, early production, speech emergence, intermediate fluency, and advanced fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|title=The Stages of Second Language Acquisition|first=|last=ASCD|date=|website=www.ascd.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328231719/http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|archivedate=28 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} The first stage, preproduction, is also known as the [[silent period]]. Learners at this stage have a receptive vocabulary of up to 500 words, but they do not yet speak their second language.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} Not all learners go through a silent period. Some learners start speaking straight away, although their output may consist of imitation rather than creative language use. Others may be required to speak from the start as part of a language course. For learners that do go through a silent period, it may last around three to six months.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=73–75}}

The second of Krashen's stages of acquisition is early production, during which learners are able to speak in short phrases of one or two words. They can also memorize chunks of language, although they may make mistakes when using them. Learners typically have both an active and receptive vocabulary of around 1000 words. This stage normally lasts for around six months.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

The third stage is speech emergence. Learners' vocabularies increase to around 3000 words during this stage, and they can communicate using simple questions and phrases. They may often make grammatical errors.

The fourth stage is intermediate fluency. At this stage, learners have a vocabulary of around 6000 words, and can use more complicated sentence structures. They are also able to share their thoughts and opinions. Learners may make frequent errors with more complicated sentence structures.

The final stage is advanced fluency, which is typically reached somewhere between five and ten years of learning the language. Learners at this stage can function at a level close to native speakers.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

Krashen has also developed a number of hypotheses discussing the nature of second language learners' thought processes and the development of self-awareness during second language acquisition. The most prominent of these hypotheses are Monitor Theory and the Affective Filter hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307232341/http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The time taken to reach a high level of proficiency can vary depending on the language learned. In the case of native English speakers, some estimates were provided by the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the [[U.S. Department of State]], which compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages for their professional staff (native English speakers who generally already know other languages). Of the 63 languages analyzed, the five most difficult languages to reach proficiency in speaking and reading, requiring 88 weeks (2200 class hours), are [[Arabic]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]]. The Foreign Service Institute and the [[National Virtual Translation Center]] both note that Japanese is typically more difficult to learn than other languages in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|title=What's the Hardest Language to Learn?|work=Zidbits|accessdate=10 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611010429/http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|archivedate=11 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons with first-language acquisition ==
Adults who learn a second language differ from children [[Language acquisition|learning their first language]] in at least three ways: children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds, and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking. Although some adult second-language learners reach very high levels of proficiency, pronunciation tends to be non-native. This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the [[critical period hypothesis]]. When a learner's speech plateaus, it is known as [[Interlanguage fossilization|fossilization]].

Some errors that second-language learners make in their speech originate in their first language. For example, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers learning [[English language|English]] may say "Is raining" rather than "It is raining", leaving out the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence. This kind of influence of the first language on the second is known as ''negative'' [[language transfer]]. [[French language|French]] speakers learning English, however, do not usually make the same mistake of leaving out "it" in "It is raining." This is because [[Pronoun|pronominal]] and impersonal sentence subjects [[Pro-drop language|can be omitted]] (or as in this case, are not used in the first place) in Spanish but not in French.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=13}} The French speaker knowing to use a pronominal sentence subject when speaking English is an example of ''positive'' language transfer. It is important to note that not all errors occur in the same ways; even two individuals with the same native language learning the same second language still have the potential to utilize different parts of their native language. Likewise, these same two individuals may develop near-native fluency in different forms of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Monika S. Schmid (2014) The Debate on Maturational Constraints in Bilingual Development: A Perspective from First-Language Attrition, Language Acquisition, 21:4, 386-410, DOI: 10.1080/10489223.2014.892947&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to the gestures the learner makes and the language features they tend to notice.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=232}} For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers.{{sfn|Flege|1987}} This kind of change in pronunciation has been found even at the onset of second-language acquisition; for example, English speakers pronounced the English /p t k/ sounds, as well as English vowels, differently after they began to learn Korean.{{sfn|Chang|2012}} These effects of the second language on the first led [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]] to propose the idea of [[multi-competence]], which sees the different languages a person speaks not as separate systems, but as related systems in their mind.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=15}}

== Learner language ==
''Learner language'' is the written or spoken language produced by a learner. It is also the main type of data used in second-language acquisition research.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=4}} Much research in second-language acquisition is concerned with the internal representations of a language in the mind of the learner, and in how those representations change over time. It is not yet possible to inspect these representations directly with brain scans or similar techniques, so SLA researchers are forced to make inferences about these rules from learners' speech or writing.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=6}}

=== Interlanguage ===
{{main article|Interlanguage}}

Originally, attempts to describe learner language were based on [[Contrastive analysis|comparing different languages]] and on [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analyzing learners' errors]]. However, these approaches weren't able to predict all the errors that learners made when in the process of learning a second language. For example, Serbo-Croat speakers learning English may say "What does Pat doing now?", although this is not a valid sentence in either language.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | title=Didactics&amp;nbsp;– 7 : Critique of Krashen III. Natural Order Hypothesis (2) :Interlanguage | accessdate=2011-02-10 | author=Mason, Timothy | work=Lecture in the didactics of English, Université of Versailles St. Quentin, a course run from 1993 to 2002 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110125249/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | archivedate=2012-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain this kind of systematic error, the idea of the ''interlanguage'' was developed.{{sfn|Selinker|1972}} An interlanguage is an emerging language system in the mind of a second-language learner. A learner's interlanguage is not a deficient version of the language being learned filled with random errors, nor is it a language purely based on errors introduced from the learner's first language. Rather, it is a language in its own right, with its own systematic rules.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}} It is possible to view most aspects of language from an interlanguage perspective, including [[grammar]], [[phonology]], [[lexicon]], and [[pragmatics]].

There are three different processes that influence the creation of interlanguages:&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;
* ''[[Language transfer]]''. Learners fall back on their mother tongue to help create their language system. Transfer can be positive, i.e. promote learning, or negative, i.e. lead to mistakes. In the latter case, linguists also use the term interference error.
* ''Overgeneralization''. Learners use rules from the second language in roughly the same way that children overgeneralise in their first language. For example, a learner may say "I goed home", overgeneralizing the English rule of adding ''-ed'' to create past tense verb forms. English children also produce forms like goed, sticked, bringed. German children equally overextend regular past tense forms to irregular forms.
* ''Simplification''. Learners use a highly simplified form of language, similar to speech by children or in [[pidgin]]s. This may be related to [[linguistic universal]]s.

The concept of interlanguage has become very widespread in SLA research, and is often a basic assumption made by researchers.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}}

|}
{{main article|Order of acquisition}}
In the 1970s, several studies investigated the order in which learners acquired different grammatical structures.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These studies were based on work by {{Harvtxt|Brown|1973}} on child first-language acquisition. The first such studies on child second-language acquisition were carried out by {{Harvs|txt|last=Dulay|last2=Burt|year=1973|year2=1974a|year3=1974b|year4=1975}}. {{Harvtxt|Bailey|Madden|Krashen|1974}} investigated the order of acquisition among adult second-language learners. See {{Harvtxt|Krashen|1977}} for a review of these studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies showed that there was little change in this order among learners with different first languages. Furthermore, it showed that the order was the same for adults and children, and that it did not even change if the learner had language lessons. This supported the idea that there were factors other than language transfer involved in learning second languages, and was a strong confirmation of the concept of interlanguage.

However, the studies did not find that the orders were exactly the same. Although there were remarkable similarities in the order in which all learners learned second-language grammar, there were still some differences among individuals and among learners with different first languages. It is also difficult to tell when exactly a grammatical structure has been learned, as learners may use structures correctly in some situations but not in others. Thus it is more accurate to speak of ''sequences'' of acquisition, in which specific grammatical features in a language are acquired before or after certain others but the overall order of acquisition is less rigid.  For example, if neither feature B nor feature D can be acquired until feature A has been acquired and if feature C cannot be acquired until feature B has been acquired but if the acquisition of feature D does not require the possession of feature B (or, therefore, of feature C), then both acquisition order (A, B, C, D) and acquisition order (A, D, B, C) are possible.

=== Variability ===

Although second-language acquisition proceeds in discrete sequences, it does not progress from one step of a sequence to the next in an orderly fashion. There can be considerable variability in features of learners' interlanguage while progressing from one stage to the next.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} For example, in one study by Rod Ellis a learner used both "No look my card" and "Don't look my card" while playing a game of bingo.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}} A small fraction of variation in interlanguage is ''free variation'', when the learner uses two forms interchangeably. However, most variation is ''systemic variation'', variation that depends on the context of utterances the learner makes.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} Forms can vary depending on linguistic context, such as whether the subject of a sentence is a pronoun or a noun; they can vary depending on social context, such as using formal expressions with superiors and informal expressions with friends; and also, they can vary depending on psycholinguistic context, or in other words, on whether learners have the chance to plan what they are going to say.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} The causes of variability are a matter of great debate among SLA researchers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}}

== Language transfer ==
{{main article|Language transfer}}

One important difference between first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition is that the process of second-language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows. This influence is known as ''language transfer''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term ''language transfer'' is not without controversy, however. Sharwood Smith and Kellerman preferred the term ''[[crosslinguistic influence]]'' to ''language transfer''. They argued that ''cross-linguistic influence'' was neutral regarding different theories of language acquisition, whereas ''language transfer'' was not. {{harvnb|Sharwood Smith|Kellerman|1986}}, cited in {{harvnb|Ellis|2008|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Language transfer is a complex phenomenon resulting from interaction between learners’ prior linguistic knowledge, the target-language input they encounter, and their cognitive processes.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Language transfer is not always from the learner’s native language; it can also be from a second language, or a third.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Neither is it limited to any particular domain of language; language transfer can occur in grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, discourse, and reading.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=350}}

Language transfer often occurs when learners sense a similarity between a feature of a language they already know and a feature of the interlanguage they have developed. If this happens, the acquisition of more complicated language forms may be delayed in favor of simpler language forms that resemble those of the language the learner is familiar with.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Learners may also decline to use some language forms at all if they are perceived as being too distant from their first language.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}}

Language transfer has been the subject of several studies, and many aspects of it remain unexplained.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain language transfer, but there is no single widely accepted explanation of why it occurs.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=397}}

== Input and interaction ==

The primary factor affecting language acquisition appears to be the input that the learner receives. [[Stephen Krashen]] took a very strong position on the importance of input, asserting that [[comprehensible input]] is all that is necessary for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Krashen|1981a}}{{sfn|Krashen|1994}} Krashen pointed to studies showing that the length of time a person stays in a foreign country is closely linked with his level of language acquisition. Further evidence for input comes from studies on reading: large amounts of free voluntary reading have a significant positive effect on learners' vocabulary, grammar, and writing.{{sfn|Elley|1991}}{{sfn|Krashen|2004}} Input is also the mechanism by which people learn languages according to the [[universal grammar]] model.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=215}}

The type of input may also be important. One tenet of Krashen's theory is that input should not be grammatically sequenced. He claims that such sequencing, as found in language classrooms where lessons involve practicing a "structure of the day", is not necessary, and may even be harmful.{{sfn|Krashen|1981b|pp=54–55}}

While input is of vital importance, Krashen's assertion that ''only'' input matters in second-language acquisition has been contradicted by more recent research. For example, students enrolled in French-[[language immersion]] programs in Canada still produced non-native-like grammar when they spoke, even though they had years of meaning-focused lessons and their listening skills were statistically native-level.{{sfn|Swain|1991}} Output appears to play an important role, and among other things, can help provide learners with feedback, make them concentrate on the form of what they are saying, and help them to automatize their language knowledge.{{sfn|Skehan|1998}} These processes have been codified in the theory of [[comprehensible output]].{{sfn|Swain|1995}}

Researchers have also pointed to interaction in the second language as being important for acquisition. According to Long's [[interaction hypothesis]] the conditions for acquisition are especially good when interacting in the second language; specifically, conditions are good when a breakdown in communication occurs and learners must negotiate for meaning. The modifications to speech arising from interactions like this help make input more comprehensible, provide feedback to the learner, and push learners to modify their speech.{{sfn|Long|1996}}

== Cognitive factors ==

Much modern research in second-language acquisition has taken a cognitive approach.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Cognitive research is concerned with the mental processes involved in language acquisition, and how they can explain the nature of learners' language knowledge. This area of research is based in the more general area of [[cognitive science]], and uses many concepts and models used in more general cognitive theories of learning. As such, cognitive theories view second-language acquisition as a special case of more general learning mechanisms in the brain. This puts them in direct contrast with linguistic theories, which posit that language acquisition uses a unique process different from other types of learning.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}}

{{anchor|Computational models}}The dominant model in cognitive approaches to second-language acquisition, and indeed in all second-language acquisition research, is the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The computational model involves three stages. In the first stage, learners retain certain features of the language input in short-term memory. (This retained input is known as ''intake''.) Then, learners convert some of this intake into second-language knowledge, which is stored in long-term memory. Finally, learners use this second-language knowledge to produce spoken output.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=35}} Cognitive theories attempt to codify both the nature of the mental representations of intake and language knowledge, and the mental processes that underlie these stages.

In the early days of second-language acquisition research on [[interlanguage]] was seen as the basic representation of second-language knowledge; however, more recent research has taken a number of different approaches in characterizing the mental representation of language knowledge.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=408–410}} There are theories that hypothesize that learner language is inherently variable,{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=410–415}} and there is the functionalist perspective that sees acquisition of language as intimately tied to the function it provides.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=415–417}} Some researchers make the distinction between ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' language knowledge, and some between ''declarative'' and ''procedural'' language knowledge.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=242–243}} There have also been approaches that argue for a ''dual-mode system'' in which some language knowledge is stored as rules, and other language knowledge as items.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=431–433}}

The mental processes that underlie second-language acquisition can be broken down into micro-processes and macro-processes. Micro-processes include attention;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=248–249}} working memory;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=250–253}} integration and restructuring. Restructuring is the process by which learners change their interlanguage systems;{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=443–445}} and ''monitoring'' is the conscious attending of learners to their own language output.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=253–255}} Macro-processes include the distinction between intentional learning and incidental learning; and also the distinction between explicit and implicit learning.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–452}} Some of the notable cognitive theories of second-language acquisition include the [[nativization model]], the [[multidimensional model]] and [[processability]] theory, [[emergentist model]]s, the [[competition model]], and [[skill-acquisition theories]].{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–482}}

Other cognitive approaches have looked at learners' speech production, particularly learners' [[speech planning]] and [[communication strategies]]. Speech planning can have an effect on learners' spoken output, and research in this area has focused on how planning affects three aspects of speech: complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Of these three, planning effects on fluency has had the most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=488–492}} Communication strategies are conscious strategies that learners employ to get around any instances of communication breakdown they may experience. Their effect on second-language acquisition is unclear, with some researchers claiming they help it, and others claiming the opposite.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=511}}

== Sociocultural factors ==

From the early days of the discipline researchers have also acknowledged that social aspects play an important role.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=37}} There have been many different approaches to sociolinguistic study of second-language acquisition, and indeed, according to Rod Ellis, this plurality has meant that "sociolinguistic SLA is replete with a bewildering set of terms referring to the social aspects of L2 acquisition".{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=280–281}} Common to each of these approaches, however, is a rejection of language as a purely psychological phenomenon; instead, sociolinguistic research views the social context in which language is learned as essential for a proper understanding of the acquisition process.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=280–281}}

Ellis identifies three types of social structure that affect acquisition of second languages: sociolinguistic setting, specific social factors, and situational factors.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=281}} Sociolinguistic setting refers to the role of the second language in society, such as whether it is spoken by a majority or a minority of the population, whether its use is widespread or restricted to a few functional roles, or whether the society is predominantly bilingual or monolingual.{{sfn|Siegel|2003|p=178}} Ellis also includes the distinction of whether the second language is learned in a natural or an educational setting.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=288}} Specific social factors that can affect second-language acquisition include age, gender, social class, and ethnic identity, with ethnic identity being the one that has received most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=323}} Situational factors are those that vary between each social interaction. For example, a learner may use more polite language when talking to someone of higher social status, but more informal language when talking with friends.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=268–269}}

Immersion programs provide a sociolinguistic setting that facilitates second-language acquisition. Immersion programs are educational programs where children are instructed in an L2 language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Although the language of instruction is the L2 language, the curriculum parallels that of non-immersion programs and clear support exists in the L1 language, as the teachers are all bilingual. The goal of these programs is to develop a high level of proficiency in both the L1 and L2 languages. Students in immersion programs have been shown to have greater levels of proficiency in their second language than students who receive second language education only as a subject in school.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} This is especially true in terms of their receptive skills. Also, students who join immersion programs earlier generally have greater second-language proficiency than their peers who join later. However, students who join later have been shown to gain native-like proficiency. Although immersion students' receptive skills are especially strong, their productive skills may suffer if they spend the majority of their time listening to instruction only. Grammatical skills and the ability to have precise vocabulary are particular areas of struggle. It is argued that immersion is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of native-like proficiency in a second language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Opportunities to engage in sustained conversation, and assignments that encourage syntactical, as well as semantic development help develop the productive skills necessary for bilingual proficiency.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}}

A learner's sense of connection to their in-group, as well as to the community of the target language emphasize the influence of the sociolinguistic setting, as well as social factors within the second-language acquisition process. [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Theory]] argues that an important factor for second language acquisition is the learner's perceived identity in relation to the community of the language being learned, as well as how the community of the target language perceives the learner.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not a learner feels a sense of connection to the community or culture of the target language helps determine their social distance from the target culture. A smaller social distance is likely to encourage learners to acquire the second language, as their investment in the learning process is greater. Conversely, a greater social distance discourages attempts to acquire the target language. However, negative views not only come from the learner, but the community of the target language might feel greater social distance to the learner, limiting the learner's ability to learn the language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not bilingualism is valued by the culture or community of the learner is an important indicator for the motivation to learn a language.{{sfn|Vega|2008|pp=185–198}}

Gender, as a social factor, also influences SLA. Females have been found to have higher motivation and more positive attitudes than males for second-language acquisition. However, females are also more likely to present higher levels of anxiety, which may inhibit their ability to efficiently learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}}

There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition. Schumann's [[Acculturation Model]] proposes that learners' rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the "social distance" and the "psychological distance" between learners and the second-language community. In Schumann's model the social factors are most important, but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=326–327}} Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner's [[socio-educational model]], which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition. Gardner's model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA, arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individuals willingness to learn L2; furthermore, the goal of an individual to learn a L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture, in other words, part of a (the targeted language) mono-linguistic community. Factors, such as [[Motivation in second-language learning|''integrativeness'']] and ''attitudes towards the learning situation'' drive motivation. The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic, but non-linguistic, such that the learner has met the desired goal. Although there are many critics of Gardner's model, nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Critical Review on the Socio-educational Model of SLA|url = http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|journal = Theory and Practice in Language Studies|date = 2015-03-24|issn = 1799-2591|pages = 605–612|volume = 5|issue = 3|doi = 10.17507/tpls.0503.21|first = Masumeh|last = Taie|first2 = Asghar|last2 = Afshari|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120181053/http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|archivedate = 2015-11-20|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=330}} The [[inter-group model]] proposes "ethnolinguistic vitality" as a key construct for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=332}} [[Language socialization]] is an approach with the premise that "linguistic and cultural knowledge are ''constructed'' through each other",{{sfn|Watson-Gegeo|Nielsen|2003|p=157}} and saw increased attention after the year 2000.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=334}} Finally, Norton's theory of [[social identity (linguistics)|social identity]] is an attempt to codify the relationship between power, identity, and language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=336}}

=== Sociocultural approaches ===

A unique approach to SLA is Sociocultural theory. It was originally developed by [[Lev Vygotsky]] and his followers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=151–152}}  Central to Vygotsky's theory is the concept of a [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD). The ZPD notion states that social interaction with more advanced target language users allows one to learn language at a higher level than if they were to learn language independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Languages are Learned|last=Lightbown|first=Patsy|last2=Spada|first2=Nina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-442224-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocultural theory has a fundamentally different set of assumptions to approaches to second-language acquisition based on the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}} Furthermore, although it is closely affiliated with other social approaches, it is a theory of mind and not of general social explanations of language acquisition. According to Ellis, "It is important to recognize... that this paradigm, despite the label 'sociocultural' does not seek to explain how learners acquire the cultural values of the L2 but rather how knowledge of an L2 is internalized through experiences of a sociocultural nature."{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}}

== Linguistic factors ==

Linguistic approaches to explaining second-language acquisition spring from the wider study of linguistics. They differ from cognitive approaches and sociocultural approaches in that they consider language knowledge to be unique and distinct from any other type of knowledge.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The linguistic research tradition in second-language acquisition has developed in relative isolation from the cognitive and sociocultural research traditions, and as of 2010 the influence from the wider field of linguistics was still strong.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Two main strands of research can be identified in the linguistic tradition: approaches informed by [[universal grammar]], and typological approaches.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=557}}

[[Typological universals]] are principles that hold for all the world's languages. They are found empirically, by surveying different languages and deducing which aspects of them could be universal; these aspects are then checked against other languages to verify the findings. The [[interlanguage]]s of second-language learners have been shown to obey typological universals, and some researchers have suggested that typological universals may constrain interlanguage development.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}}

The theory of universal grammar was proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s, and has enjoyed considerable popularity in the field of linguistics. It focuses on describing the [[linguistic competence]] of an individual. He believed that children not only acquire language by learning descriptive rules of grammar; he claimed that children ''creatively'' play and form words as they learn language, creating meaning of these words, as opposed to the mechanism of memorizing language.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=99}} It consists of a set of ''principles'', which are universal and constant, and a set of ''parameters'', which can be set differently for different languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}} The "universals" in universal grammar differ from typological universals in that they are a mental construct derived by researchers, whereas typological universals are readily verifiable by data from world languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}} It is widely accepted among researchers in the universal grammar framework that all first-language learners have access to universal grammar; this is not the case for second-language learners, however, and much research in the context of second-language acquisition has focused on what level of access learners may have.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}}

Universal grammar theory can account for some of the observations of SLA research. For example, L2-users often display knowledge about their L2 that they have not been exposed to.{{sfn|VanPatten|Williams|2015|pp=36–37}} L2-users are often aware of ambiguous or ungrammatical L2 units that they have not learned from any external source, nor from their pre-existing L1 knowledge. This unsourced knowledge suggests the existence of a universal grammar.

== Individual variation ==
{{main article|Individual variation in second-language acquisition}}

There is considerable variation in the rate at which people learn second languages, and in the language level that they ultimately reach. Some learners learn quickly and reach a near-native level of competence, but others learn slowly and [[Interlanguage fossilization|get stuck]] at relatively early stages of acquisition, despite living in the country where the language is spoken for several years. The reason for this disparity was first addressed with the study of [[language learning aptitude]] in the 1950s, and later with the ''[[good language learner studies]]'' in the 1970s. More recently research has focused on a number of different factors that affect individuals' language learning, in particular strategy use, social and societal influences, personality, motivation, and anxiety. The relationship between age and the ability to learn languages has also been a subject of long-standing debate.

=== Age ===
The issue of age was first addressed with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The critical period hypothesis was formulated for first-language acquisition by {{Harvtxt|Penfield|Roberts|1959}} and popularized by {{Harvtxt|Lenneberg|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The strict version of this hypothesis states that there is a cut-off age at about 12, after which learners lose the ability to fully learn a language. However, the exact age marking the end of the critical period is debated, and ranges from age 6 to 13, with many arguing that it is around the onset of puberty.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} This strict version has since been rejected for second-language acquisition, as some adult learners have been observed who reach native-like levels of pronunciation and general fluency. However, in general, adult learners of a second-language rarely achieve the native-like fluency that children display, despite often progressing faster in the initial stages. This has led to speculation that age is indirectly related to other, more central factors that affect language learning.

Children who acquire two languages from birth are called simultaneous bilinguals. In these cases, both languages are spoken to the children by their parents or caregivers and they grow up knowing the two languages. These children generally reach linguistic milestones at the same time as their monolingual peers.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} Children who do not learn two languages from infancy, but learn one language from birth, and another at some point during childhood, are referred to as sequential bilinguals. People often assume that a sequential bilingual's first language is their most proficient language, but this is not always the case. Over time and experience, a child's second language may become his or her strongest.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} This is especially likely to happen if a child's first language is a minority language spoken at home, and the child's second language is the majority language learned at school or in the community before the age of five. Proficiency for both simultaneous and sequential bilinguals is dependent upon the child's opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations in a variety of contexts.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}}

Often simultaneous bilinguals are more proficient in their languages than sequential bilinguals. One argument for this is that simultaneous bilinguals develop more distinct representations of their languages, especially with regards to [[phonological]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] levels of processing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lexical Processing and Second Language Acquisition|last = Tokowicz|first = Natasha|publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-87755-8|location = New York, NY|pages = 57–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would cause learners to have more differentiation between the languages, leading them to be able to recognize the subtle differences between the languages that less proficient learners would struggle to recognize. Learning a language earlier in life would help develop these distinct representations of language, as the learner's first language would be less established. Conversely, learning a language later in life would lead to more similar semantic representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although child learners more often acquire native-like proficiency, older child and adult learners often progress faster in the initial stages of learning.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Older child and adult learners are quicker at acquiring the initial grammar knowledge than child learners, however, with enough time and exposure to the language, children surpass their older peers. Once surpassed, older learners often display clear language deficiencies compared to child learners. This has been attributed to having a solid grasp on the first language or mother tongue they were first immersed into. Having this cognitive ability already developed can aid the process of learning a second language since there is a better understanding of how language works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning difficulties or learning English difficulties? Additional language acquisition: An update for paediatricians.|last = Clifford, Rhodes, &amp; Paxton|first = |date = 2014|journal = Journal of Paediatricians &amp; Child Health Vol. 50 Issue 3|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this same reason interaction with family and further development of the first language is encouraged along with positive reinforcement. The exact language deficiencies that occur past a certain age are not unanimously agreed upon. Some believe that only pronunciation is affected, while others believe other abilities are affected as well. However, some differences that are generally agreed upon include older learners having a noticeable accent, a smaller vocabulary, and making several linguistic errors.

One explanation for this difference in proficiency between older learners and younger learners involves [[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]. Universal Grammar is a debated theory that suggests that people have innate knowledge of universal linguistic principles that is present from birth.{{sfn|Long|2007}} These principles guide children as they learn a language, but its parameters vary from language to language.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}} The theory assumes that, while Universal Grammar remains into adulthood, the ability to reset the parameters set for each language is lost, making it more difficult to learn a new language proficiently.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Since adults have an already established native language, the language acquisition process is much different for them, than young learners. The rules and principles that guide the use of the learners' native language plays a role in the way the second language is developed.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}}

Some nonbiological explanations for second-language acquisition age differences include variations in social and psychological factors, such as motivation; the learner's linguistic environment; and the level of exposure. Even with less advantageous nonbiological influences, many child learners attain a greater level of proficiency than adult learners with more advantageous nonbiological influences.{{sfn|Long|2007}}

=== Strategies ===
Considerable attention has been paid to the strategies learners use to learn a second language. Strategies have been found to be of critical importance, so much so that ''strategic competence'' has been suggested as a major component of [[communicative competence]].{{sfn|Canale|Swain|1980}} Strategies are commonly divided into ''[[learning strategies]]'' and ''[[communicative strategies]]'', although there are other ways of categorizing them. Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning, such as [[mnemonic]]s or using a [[dictionary]]. Communicative strategies are strategies a learner uses to convey meaning even when he or she doesn't have access to the correct form, such as using [[pro-form]]s like ''thing'', or using non-verbal means such as [[gesture]]s. If learning strategies and communicative strategies are used properly language acquisition is successful. Some points to keep in mind while learning an additional language are: providing information that is of interest to the student, offering opportunities for the student to share their knowledge and teaching appropriate techniques for the uses of the learning resources available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Good practice for pupils learning English as an additional language: Lessons from effective literacy teachers in inner-city primary schools|last = Flynn|first = Naomi|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Early Childhood Literacy Vol.7 Issue2 p.184|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy may include intentional ways to acquire or improve official their second language skills. Adult immigrants and/or second language learners seeking to acquire a second language can engage in different activities to receive and share knowledge as well improve their learning; some of these include:

*incidental or informal learning (''media resources, family/friend interactions, work interactions'')
*purposeful learning (''self-study, taking language classes'')
*pursuing formal education  &lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affective factors ===
The learner's attitude to the learning process has also been identified as being critically important to second-language acquisition. [[Anxiety]] in language-learning situations has been almost unanimously shown to be detrimental to successful learning. Anxiety interferes with the mental processing of language because the demands of anxiety-related thoughts create competition for mental resources. This results in less available storage and energy for tasks required for language processing.{{sfn|Ashcraft|Kirk|2001}} Not only this, but anxiety is also usually accompanied by self-deprecating thoughts and fear of failure, which can be detrimental to an individual's ability to learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} Learning a new language provides a unique situation that may even produce a specific type of anxiety, called language anxiety, that affects the quality of acquisition.{{sfn|MacIntyre|Gardner|1991}} Also, anxiety may be detrimental for SLA because it can influence a learner's ability to attend to, concentrate on, and encode language information.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} It may affect speed and accuracy of learning. Further, the apprehension created as a result of anxiety inhibits the learner's ability to retrieve and produce the correct information.

A related factor, personality, has also received attention. There has been discussion about the effects of [[Extraversion and introversion|extravert]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|introvert]] personalities. Extraverted qualities may help learners seek out opportunities and people to assist with L2 learning, whereas introverts may find it more difficult to seek out such opportunities for interaction.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} However, it has also been suggested that, while extraverts might experience greater fluency, introverts are likely to make fewer linguistic errors. Further, while extraversion might be beneficial through its encouragement of learning autonomously, it may also present challenges as learners may find reflective and time-management skills to be difficult.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} However, one study has found that there were no significant differences between extraverts and introverts on the way they achieve success in a second language.{{sfn|Erton|2010}}

Other personality factors, such as [[conscientiousness]], [[agreeableness]], and [[Openness to experience|openness]] influence self-regulation, which helps L2 learners engage, process meaning, and adapt their thoughts, feelings, and actions to benefit the acquisition process.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} SLA research has shown conscientiousness to be associated with time-management skills, metacognition, analytic learning, and persistence; agreeableness to effort; and openness to elaborative learning, intelligence, and metacognition. Both genetics and the learner's environment impact the personality of the learner, either facilitating or hindering an individual's ability to learn.

Social attitudes such as gender roles and community views toward language learning have also proven critical. Language learning can be severely hampered by cultural attitudes, with a frequently cited example being the difficulty of [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] children in learning English{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Also, the [[Motivation in second-language learning|motivation]] of the individual learner is of vital importance to the success of language learning. Motivation is influenced by goal [[salience (language)|salience]], [[wikt:valence|valence]], and [[self-efficacy]].{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} In this context, goal salience is the importance of the L2 learner's goal, as well as how often the goal is pursued; valence is the value the L2 learner places on SLA, determined by desire to learn and attitudes about learning the L2; and self-efficacy is the learner's own belief that he or she is capable of achieving the linguistic goal.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Studies have consistently shown that ''intrinsic motivation'', or a genuine interest in the language itself, is more effective over the long term than ''extrinsic motivation'', as in learning a language for a reward such as high grades or praise. However, motivation is dynamic and, as a L2 learner's fluency develops, their extrinsic motivation may evolve to become more intrinsic.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learner motivation can develop through contact with the L2 community and culture, as learners often desire to communicate and identify with individuals in the L2 community. Further, a supportive learning environment facilitates motivation through the increase in self-confidence and autonomy.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learners in a supportive environment are more often willing to take on challenging tasks, thus encouraging L2 development.

== Attrition ==
{{main article|Second-language attrition}}

Attrition is the loss of proficiency in a language caused by a lack of exposure to or use of a language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} It is a natural part of the language experience as it exists within a dynamic environment.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} As the environment changes, the language adapts. One way it does this is by using L1 as a tool to navigate the periods of change associated with acquisition and attrition. A learner's L2 is not suddenly lost with disuse, but its communicative functions are slowly replaced by those of the L1.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Similar to second-language acquisition, second-language attrition occurs in stages. However, according to the regression hypothesis, the stages of attrition occur in reverse order of acquisition. With acquisition, receptive skills develop first, and then productive skills, and with attrition, productive skills are lost first, and then receptive skills.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Age, proficiency level, and social factors play a role in the way attrition occurs.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Most often younger children are quicker than adults to lose their L2 when it is left unused. However, if a child has established a high level of proficiency, it may take him or her several years to lose the language. Proficiency level seems to play the largest role in the extent of attrition. For very proficient individuals, there is a period of time where very little, if any, attrition is observed. For some, residual learning might even occur, which is the apparent improvement within the L2.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Within the first five years of language disuse, the total percentage of language knowledge lost is less for a proficient individual than for someone less proficient. A cognitive psychological explanation for this suggests that a higher level of proficiency involves the use of [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s, or mental representations for linguistic structures. Schemas involve deeper mental processes for mental retrieval that are resistant to attrition. As a result, information that is tied to this system is less likely to experience less extreme attrition than information that is not.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Finally, social factors may play an indirect role in attrition. In particular, motivation and attitude influence the process. Higher levels of motivation, and a positive attitude toward the language and the corresponding community may lessen attrition. This is likely due to the higher level of competence achieved in L2 when the learner is motivated and has a positive attitude.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

== Classroom second-language acquisition ==
{{main article|Second-language acquisition classroom research}}

While considerable SLA research has been devoted to language learning in a natural setting, there have also been efforts made to investigate second-language acquisition in the classroom. This kind of research has a significant overlap with [[language education]], and it is mainly concerned with the effect that instruction has on the learner. It also explores what teachers do, the classroom context, the dynamics of classroom communication. It is both qualitative and quantitative research.

The research has been wide-ranging. There have been attempts made to systematically measure the effectiveness of language teaching practices for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. This research has indicated that many traditional language-teaching techniques are extremely inefficient.{{sfn|Lightbown|1990}} cited in {{Harvnb|Ellis|1994}} It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency.  Rather, to become proficient in the second language, the learner must be given opportunities to use it for communicative purposes.{{sfn|Doughty|Williams|1998}}{{sfn|Ellis|2002}}

Another area of research has been on the effects of corrective feedback in assisting learners. This has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction, and the overall focus of the classroom, whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|1990}}{{sfn|Lyster|Ranta|1997}}{{sfn|Lyster|Mori|2006}} There is also considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms.{{sfn|Allwright|Hanks|2009}} As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students, they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development.{{sfn|Tarone|Swierzbin|2009}}

The '''Shuswap language''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ʃ|uː|ʃ|w|ɑː|p}}; Shuswap: ''Secwepemctsín'' {{IPA|[ʃəxwəpəmxˈtʃin]}}) is the traditional language of the [[Shuswap people]] (Shuswap: ''Secwépemc'' {{IPA|[ʃəˈxwɛpəmx]}}) of [[British Columbia]]. An endangered language, Shuswap is spoken mainly in the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior of British Columbia]] between the [[Fraser River]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. According to the [[First Peoples' Cultural Council]], 200 people speak Shuswap as a mother tongue, and there are 1,190 semi-speakers.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

Shuswap is the northernmost of the [[Interior Salish|Interior Salish languages]], which are spoken in Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. There are two [[dialect]]s of Shuswap:
*Eastern: Kinbasket (Kenpesq’t) and Shuswap Lake (Qw7ewt/Quaaout)
*Western: Canim Lake (Tsq’escen), Chu Chua (Simpcw), Deadman's Creek (Skitsestn/Skeetchestn)–Kamloops (Tk'emlups), Fraser River (Splatsin, Esk’et), and Pavilion (Tsk’weylecw)–Bonaparte (St’uxtews) 
The other Northern Interior Salish languages are [[Lillooet language|Lillooet]] and [[Thompson language|Thompson]].

==Phonology==

The Shuswap language has many consonants which the Roman alphabet is typically not used to represent.  Two systems of representing Shuswap sounds are in use.  One is the system used in Kuipers’ 298 page monograph on the language.  It uses some letters which are not part of the Roman alphabet.  The other system is based on one devised by Randy Bouchard of the British Columbia Language Project.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, David W. and Luke Swan. 1981.  Teachings of the tides : uses of marine invertebrates by the Manhousat people. Nanaimo, B.C. : Theytus Books&lt;/ref&gt;  It is based entirely on the Roman alphabet.  The one exception is the symbol 7, which is used to represent a consonant.

The Bouchard style system appears to be the one in use among Shuswap people themselves.  Aside from the different symbols used, other differences exist between the two systems.  The Kuipers’ system makes extensive use of automatic alternations.  For example, the letter n is sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[n]}}, sometimes {{IPA|[ən]}}, and sometimes {{IPA|[nə]}}.  The choice of pronunciation is based on automatically applied rules.  The reader is expected to know these rules.

The rules cover three classes of changes: (1) [[#Automatic vowel darkening|automatic darkening]] of vowels (Non-automatic darkening of vowels is covered under [[#Phonological processes|Phonological Processes]].), (2) [[#Consonantal/vocalic variation of sonorants|automatic alternation of sonorants]] between consonantal and vocalic pronunciation, and (3) alternation of plain velars, uvulars, and laryngeals with the corresponding rounded sounds.  The Bouchard style system does not appear to require the reader to know so many alternation rules.  Examples of words written in the Bouchard style can be seen on two websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landoftheshuswap.com/msite/alphabet.php  Land of the Shuswap, Secwepemcúl’ecx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://secwepemc.sd73.bc.ca/  Connecting Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt;  These websites do not contain enough examples to show how all the automatic alternations are handled in the Bouchard style system.  Therefore the Kuipers’ system of spelling is used in this article.

===Vowels===
The Shuswap language has five full vowels, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and one reduced vowel, {{IPA|/ə/}}.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Main phonetic values of the Shuswap vowels
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]][[rounded vowel|(Rounded)]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| i {{IPA|[i ~ e]}}
|
| u {{IPA|[u ~ o]}}
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| e {{IPA|[ɛ]}}
| ə {{IPA|[ə]}}
| o {{IPA|[ɔ]}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|
| a {{IPA|[a]}}
|
|}

An additional vowel, {{IPA|/ʌ/}}, is rare and often replaced by {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/a/}}.  Its description is ambiguous.  Kuipers gave its phonetic value as {{IPA|[ʌ]}}, indicating a mid unrounded back vowel, but described it in words as a mid central vowel.

There are restrictions on the distribution of vowels.  The vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} is restricted to unstressed syllables.  The vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} also occur in unstressed syllables, but only in a few words.  Vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are restricted to stressed syllables.

====Automatic vowel darkening====

The previous table shows the normal pronunciation of the vowels.  Three of the full vowels, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}, are subject to an automatic process called darkening, which changes how these vowels are pronounced.  Automatic darkening is predictable; it occurs before uvular obstruents and before or after uvularized sonorants.  It is not reflected in the Kuipers spelling system.
::Example: ''e'' {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in ‘he shoots it’ ''qemns'' {{IPA|[ˈqɛmənʃ]}}, but ''e'' {{IPA|[a]}} in ‘I shoot it’ ''qeqmn'' {{IPA|[ˈqaqmən]}}

===Consonants===
Consonants are divided into two classes, [[obstruent]]s and [[sonorant]]s.  In the tables which follow, pronunciations are given in square brackets in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription.  The notation is the same as that of Kuipers (1974).

:* The sonorants are voiced. Since they can be consonantal or vocalic, a pair of pronunciations is given for each in the table.  Vocalic variants occur only in unstressed syllables.
::* Consonantal forms of glottalized sonorants occur only after vowels.
::* The plain sonorants when vocalic have a different pronunciation at the beginning of a word: {{IPA|[mə]}}, {{IPA|[nə]}}, {{IPA|[lə]}}, {{IPA|[jə]}}, {{IPA|[ɰə]}}, {{IPA|[ʕə]}}, {{IPA|[ʕʷə]}}, and  {{IPA|[wə]}}.
::* The long vowels representing plain vocalic sonorants are variable in length and may be short.
::* There is no glottalized plain uvular sonorant {{IPA|*ʕˀ}}.  Where this ought to occur due to phonological processes, what occurs instead is {{IPA|ʔ}} when a consonantal form is required, and (unstressed) {{IPA|aʔ}} when a vocalic form is required.

=====Consonantal-vocalic variation of sonorants=====
The variation of sonorants between consonantal and vocalic pronunciations is automatic, and is not indicated in the Kuipers’ spelling system.  The rule for determining this as follows:
:*To start, all sonorants in a word are to be considered vocalic.
:*Then, beginning from the right hand side of the word, a sonorant in any one of the following situations is changed to consonantal:
::*a vowel on its right side;
::*a vocalic sonorant on its right side; or
::*a vowel on its left side.

::Example 1: l {{IPA|[l]}}, m {{IPA|[m]}} and m {{IPA|[əm]}} in variants of ‘go ahead!’ x̌ílme {{IPA|[ˈχilmɛ]}} and x̌ílmxe {{IPA|[ˈχiləmxɛ]}}
::Example 2: w {{IPA|[wə]}} in ‘downstream’ wtemtk {{IPA|[wəˈtɛmtk]}}
::Example 3: l {{IPA|[l]}} and ɣ {{IPA|[əː]}} in ‘waterfall’ k’°əλlɣʔép {{IPA|[kʷʼəɬləːˈʔɛp]}}
::Example 4: l {{IPA|[l]}}, w {{IPA|[u]}}, y {{IPA|[j]}} and n {{IPA|[ən]}} in ‘I catch something in a trap’ lélwyn-kn {{IPA|[ˈlɛlujəŋkən]}}

===Syllable structure===

A Shuswap word consists of a stem, to which can be added various affixes. Very few words contain two roots. Any stressed root can have an unstressed alternative, where the vowel is replaced by [ə].

Most roots have the form CVC or CC (the latter only if unstressed). Other roots are CVCC or CCVC.

Suffixes begin either with a stressed vowel (dropped in forms where the root is stressed) or a consonant. Prefixes generally have the form C- or CC-.

===Stress===

Stress in Shuswap is not very prominent, and occurs only in longer words. Since {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} are always stressed and {{IPA|[ə]}} never is, stress is usually fairly simple to predict.

===Phonological processes===

Although Kuipers (1974) does not specify, in many cases the glottalized or rounded version of a consonant seems to represent an allophonic variation. For example, consonants which have a rounded form are rounded before and after {{IPA|[u]}}. However, glottalization can be contrastive (the root q’e'''y'''-, "set up a structure," versus q’e'''y’'''-, "write") or allophonic (the root q’e'''y'''- appears with a glottalized final consonant in s-t-q‘e'''y’'''-qn, "shed"). Consonant reduplication can also have an effect on glottalization.

There are a number of ways in which sounds are affected by their environments. Resonants in the vocalic position are preceded by an automatic schwa, for example the word {{IPA|/stʼmkelt/}} ("daughter"), pronounced {{IPA|[stɬʼ'''ə'''mkelt]}}. The darkening of vowels, as described below, is another case.

The distribution of vowels is quite complex. The vowels have the following main variants:
* i = {{IPA|[i~e]}}
* u = {{IPA|[u~o]}}
* o = {{IPA|[ɔ]}}
* e = {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.
{{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ʌ/}} are unchanged. The environment around uvulars and velars produces a different set of variants, including occasional slight diphthongs. Additionally, some roots cause darkened vowels to appear in suffixes; one example is the prefix -'''e'''kst ("hand, arm"), which is darkened in x°əl’-'''a'''kst. The darkened vowels are as follows:
* e = {{IPA|[a]}}
* u = {{IPA|[o]}}
* i = {{IPA|[e]}}.

==Morphology==
===Affixes===
Shuswap's affixation system is robust. A nominalizing [[prefix]] s- is used to derive nouns from verbs, and prefixes to indicate a resulting state are added to verbs. A sample of Shuswap's small number of prefixes is below:
* /t’l’-/: during a period in the past
* /c-/ or /s-/: hither
* /t-/ or /tk-/: on top of, on the outside
* /wλ-/: group of people
* /ʔ-/: second person singular possessive

Most nouns contain [[suffix]]es. Suffixes are also used to indicate transitive, intransitive, and imperative verbs. Below are a few examples taken from the extensive collection of Shuswap suffixes:
* /-eps/: back of neck
* /-tem’/: bottom, canyon, lowland
* /-itʃeʔ/: surface, hide
* /-esq’t/: day
* /-eq/: berries
* /-el’txʷ/: a sheet-like object, skin, bark

===Morphological processes===
Shuswap makes extensive use of [[reduplication]]. Some examples of simple reduplication are:
* Initial reduplication: [s-tíq’m] (bitterroot) to [tətíq’m] (prepare bitterroots)
* Final reduplication: [puxʷ-m] (blow) to [pəxʷ'úxʷ] (swell up)
* Total reduplication: [piq] (white) to [pəq-'piq] (flour)
* Consonant reduplication

In addition, there are several types of complex reduplication, involving patterns such as 11V12, 112V23, and 1123V34 (where 1 represents C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.).

Not all types of reduplication are productive and functional. Total reduplication indicates plurality and consonant reduplication is diminutive, but most other reduplications are difficult to explain.

In addition to reduplication, root morphemes can be modified by interior glottalization, such that a root CVC appears as CʔVC. Although the process is not productive, many recorded forms refer to a state, for example [pʔeɣ] (cooled off) from [peɣns] (he cools it off). Consonant reduplication can proceed as usual with interior glottalization.

==Syntax==
===Word order===
Word order in Shuswap is relatively free; syntactical relationships are easily conveyed by the [[case marking]] system. However, it is common but not necessary for the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] to head the sentence.

Sentences with predicate first:
* wist ɣ-citx ''the house is high''
* cut l-nx̌peʔe ''my grandfather said''

Sentences with subject first (rare):
* ɣ-sq°yic m-cunsəs ɣx̌°ʕ°elmx ''Rabbit was told by fox''

===Case marking===
Shuswap uses two cases: the absolutive, for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb]], the subject of a [[transitive verb]], and the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb; and the relative, for all other cases (for example, the actor of a passive verb, or an adverb).

Absolutive Case:
* wist ɣ-citx ''the house is high''
* m-tʔeyns ɣ-x̌°ʕ°elmx ɣ-sk’lep ''Fox met Coyote''

Relative Case:
* wist t-citx° ''a high house''
* m-cuntməs ɣ-sq°yic t-x̌°ʕ°elmx ''Rabbit was told by Fox'' (the subject is in the Absolutive)

===Other forms===
Nouns and verbs appear in for different forms, depending on their syntactic surroundings.

* The plain form: nouns and intransitive verbs, conjugated for person. Additionally, a distinction is made between object-centered and subject-centered words; compare [l-m-wiwk'''tn'''] "the one I saw" with [l-m-wiwk'''cms'''] "the one that saw me."
* The suffixal form: for intransitive verbs, and also transitive verbs and nouns (third person singular only). This form is sometimes optional and sometimes obligatory. Examples of use include as an imperative substitute ([xwislxəx° wl meʔ kicx-k], "run till you get there") and in "if" and "when" sentences ([l-twiwtwn], "when I grew up").
* The nominalized form: for nouns and intransitive verbs. A nominalized intransitive verb refers to the goal object of the action, as in [yʔen t’-sq°iʔq°e l-nstix°C’e l-pəxyewtəs] "this is the groundhog I shot yesterday." Nominalization is also used in questions, either yes-or-no or introduced with "what".
* The ʔs- form: refers to a fact, with overtones of goal-directedness. For example: [cuct-kn ʔnsʔiʔλn] "I want to eat."

Matthew Feeney concluded his review by saying: {{Quote|Kordić provides much new information about the selected forms.

Peter Herrity emphasised that:{{Quote|In all the chapters of this book the author has thoroughly researched the existing literature on the points covered and provided a conclusion on modern usage which will be invaluable for grammarians and lexicographers who often treat these subjects in a cursory fashion.

[[File:Frequency of relativizers.jpg|thumb|240px|upright|[[Frequency (statistics)|Frequency]] of [[Relative clause|relativizer]]s (Kordić)]]Wayles Browne, an American expert on relative clauses, commented both of the books.

In his review of the monograph on language and nationalism (''[[:sh:Jezik i nacionalizam|Jezik i nacionalizam]]''), Zoran Milutinović commented:
{{Quote|''Jezik i nacionalizam'' is a thorough, well-argued and passionately written critique of linguistic nationalism, rooted in the fear that the nation will disappear unless it has a language of its own, and of its main features: the celebration of purism, the obsession with etymologies, the equation of nation with language, the falsification of history, revisionism, and political disqualification of one’s opponents. Having been for years politically disqualified and professionally defamed herself, with this book Kordić offers an exemplary gesture of how linguistics can maintain its independence, dignity and high academic standards against political manipulation.|&lt;small&gt;''[[The Slavonic and East European Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milutinović, Zoran|location=London, UK|title=Review of the Book ''Jezik i nacionalizam''|journal=[[The Slavonic and East European Review]]|volume=89|issue=3|pages=520–24|year=2011|oclc=744233642|issn=0037-6795|doi=10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.89.3.0520|url=http://www.snjezana-kordic.de/Rec_SEER.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yTd2jaR|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

Reviewer Goran Miljan wrote:{{Quote|Kordić elaborates the ideas of language, linguistics, politics, history, culture, etc. in a well-structured and academically highly laudable manner. [...] The fierce reactions to the book cannot surprise: Whilst some intellectuals praised the book, more deemed it necessary to engage into battle against such heresy. [...] Such statements exactly demonstrate the prevailing discourse against which Kordić critically engages in her book, namely that Croatian identity, language, culture, and nation are viewed and explained as inseparable. If one tries to scientifically question one of these ‘core elements’ of nationhood, and tries to deconstruct them, she/he risks the possibility of becoming ostracized.|&lt;small&gt;''[[H-Soz-u-Kult]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Goran|last=Miljan|title=Review of the Book ''Jezik i nacionalizam''|url=http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2012-2-022.pdf|publisher=''[[H-Soz-u-Kult]]''|location=Berlin|issn=2196-5307|id={{ZDB|2627296-9}}|date=6 April 2012|archivedate=7 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68yTlIoWu|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;}}

A '''spoiled child''' or '''spoiled brat''' is a derogatory term aimed at children who exhibit behavioral problems from being overindulged by their parents. Children and teens who are perceived as spoiled may be described as "overindulged", "[[grandiosity|grandiose]]", "[[narcissistic]]" or "[[Egocentrism|egocentric-regressed]]". Perception is important to take into account, because when the child has a neurological condition such as [[autism]], [[ADHD]] or [[intellectual disability]], observers may judge them as "spoiled" without understanding the whole picture. There is no accepted scientific definition of what "spoiled" means, and professionals are often unwilling to use the label because it is considered vague and derogatory.&lt;ref name=McIntosh /&gt; Being spoiled is not recognized as a [[mental disorder]] in any of the medical manuals, such as the [[ICD-10]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm|title=ICD 10|publisher=Priory.com|accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[DSM-IV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm|title=APA Diagnostic Classification DSM-IV-TR|publisher=BehaveNet|accessdate=2013-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026155340/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/dsm4TRclassification.htm|archivedate=2011-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or its successor, the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/InfancyChildhoodAdolescence.aspx |title=DSM-5 |publisher=DSM-5 |date=2016-10-01 |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As syndrome==
Richard Weaver, in his work ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'', introduced the term “spoiled child psychology” in 1948. In 1989, Bruce McIntosh coined the term the "spoiled child syndrome".&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|volume=83|issue=1|date=January 1989|pages=108–115|title=Spoiled Child Syndrome|author=Bruce J. McIntosh|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org./cgi/content/abstract/83/1/108|pmid=2642617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndrome is characterized by "excessive, self-centered, and immature behavior". It includes lack of consideration for other people, recurrent [[temper tantrums]], an inability to handle the [[delayed gratification|delay of gratification]], demands for having one's own way, [[Obstructionism|obstructiveness]], and [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] to get their way.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual of Developmental and Behavioral Problems in Children|author=Vidya Bhushan Gupta|pages=198–199|chapter=Spoiled Child Syndrome|publisher=Inform Health Care|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8247-1938-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; McIntosh attributed the syndrome to "the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits", but others, such as Aylward, note that temperament is probably a contributory factor.&lt;ref name=Aylward&gt;{{cite book|title=Practitioner's Guide to Behavioral Problems in Children|author=Glen P. Aylward|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=978-0-306-47740-9|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that the temper tantrums are ''recurrent''. McIntosh observes that "many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood". Children may have occasional temper tantrums without them falling under the umbrella of "spoiled". Extreme cases of spoiled child syndrome, in contrast, will involve ''frequent'' temper tantrums, physical aggression, defiance, destructive behavior, and refusal to comply with even the simple demands of daily tasks.&lt;ref name=Aylward /&gt;  This can be similar to the profile of children diagnosed with [[Pathological Demand Avoidance]], which is part of the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/pda.aspx|title=What is pathological demand avoidance? - NAS|website=Autism.org.uk|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential causes===
* Failure of [[parent]]s to enforce consistent, age-appropriate [[Setting limits|limits]].&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;
* Parents shielding the child from normal everyday [[frustration]]s.&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;
* Provision of excessive material gifts, even when the child has not behaved appropriately.&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;
* Improper [[role model]]s provided by parents.&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;
* However, social disabilities, such as autism, ODD, [[ADHD]], and [[Pathological demand avoidance|PDA]], are not evidence of a child being spoiled.

===Differential diagnosis===
Children with underlying medical or mental health problems may exhibit some of the symptoms.  Indeed, where the difficulties are not predicated in the parental-child nexus, many loving parents may be judged as "spoiling" instead of affirmed.  Speech or hearing disorders, and [[attention deficit disorder]], may lead to children's failing to understand the limits set by parents. Children who have recently experienced a stressful event, such as the separation of the parents (divorce) or the birth or death of a close family relative, may also exhibit some or all of the symptoms. Children of parents who themselves have psychiatric disorders may manifest some of the symptoms, because the parents behave erratically, sometimes failing to perceive their children's behavior correctly, and thus fail to properly or consistently define limits of normal behavior for them.&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;

===Prevention===
Parents can seek advice, support, and encouragement to empower them in parenthood from diverse sources.

===Treatment===
Treatment by a physician involves assessing parental competence, and whether the parents set limits correctly and consistently. Physicians should rule out dysfunction in the family, referring [[dysfunctional families]] for family therapy and dysfunctional parents for parenting skills training, and counsel parents in methods for modifying their child's behavior.&lt;ref name=Gupta /&gt;

==Infants==
In early infancy, a baby wants food, contact, and comfort by crying. This behavior should be viewed as a distress signal indicating that some biological need is not being met. Although parents sometimes worry about spoiling their children by giving them too much attention, specialists in child development maintain that babies cannot be spoiled in the first six months of life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,3976,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225092900/http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,3976,00.html |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first year, children are developing a sense of [[Eight stages of man|basic trust]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. In general, the more attention and care they receive from their parents, the better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Only children==
{{Main article|Only child}}
[[Alfred Adler]] (1870–1937) believed that "only children" were likely to experience a variety of problems from their situation. Adler theorized that because only children have no rivals for their parents' affection, they will become pampered and spoiled, particularly by their mother. He suggested that this could later cause interpersonal difficulties if the person is not universally liked and admired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adler|first=A.|year=1964|title=Problems of neurosis|location=New York|publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 [[meta-analysis|quantitative review]] of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits contradicted Adler's theory. This research found no evidence of any "spoilage" or other pattern of maladjustment in only children. The major finding was that only children are not very different from children with siblings. The main exception to this was the finding that only children are generally higher in achievement motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polit|first=D. F.|lastauthoramp=yes|last2=Falbo|first2=T.|year=1987|title=Only children and personality development: A quantitative review|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|volume=49|issue=2|pages=309–325|doi=10.2307/352302|jstor=352302}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second analysis revealed that only children, first-borns, and children with only one sibling score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polit|first=D. F.|lastauthoramp=yes|last2=Falbo|first2=T.|year=1988|title=The intellectual achievement of only children|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=20|pmid=3063715|issue=3|pages=275–285|doi=10.1017/S0021932000006611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Spoiling in early childhood tends to create characteristic reactions that persist, fixed, into later life. These can cause significant social problems. Spoiled children may have difficulty coping with situations such as teachers scolding them or refusing to grant extensions on homework assignments, playmates refusing to allow them to play with their toys and playmates refusing playdates with them, a loss in friends, failure in employment, and failure with personal relationships. As adults, spoiled children may experience problems with [[anger management]], professionalism, and personal relationships; a link with adult [[psychopathy]] has been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Religion and Healing|author=Leslie D.

The '''stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany''' are a [[megalith]]ic tradition of monuments consisting of standing stones arranged in rings. These were constructed from 3300 to 900 BCE in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} It has been estimated that around 4,000 of these monuments were originally constructed in this part of north-western Europe during this period.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Around 1,300 of them are recorded, the others having been destroyed.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Although [[stone circles]] have been erected throughout history by a variety of societies and for a variety of reasons, in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Late Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age Britain|Early Bronze Ages]], this particular tradition was limited to the [[British Isles]] and the neighbouring area of continental Europe now known as [[Brittany]]. The rings were not distributed equally across this area, but were concentrated in several highland regions: north-eastern and central Scotland, the [[Lake District]], the south-west peninsula of England, and the north and south-west of Ireland. Sparser groupings can also be found in [[Caithness]], the [[Outer Hebrides]], the [[Peak District]], the [[Wicklow Mountains]], [[Wales]] and [[Wessex]].{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=9}}

Their original purpose is not fully known, but archaeological investigation has shed some light on it. It is widely thought that they served a ritual or ceremonial purpose, particularly in relation to solar and/or lunar alignments. In a minority of cases, some were also used as cemeteries, with burials being made in and around the circle.

Antiquarian investigation into the circles began in the Early Modern period, intensifying after the publications of notable English antiquarian [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century. At the time, scholars understood little of prehistoric Britain, with the megalithic circles typically being ascribed either to the [[druid]]s of the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or to the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish settlers]] of [[Early Medieval]] times. 

In the 20th century, with the development of [[archaeology]], archaeologists could investigate the circles in more detail. They dated them to the Late Neolithic and Bronze ages. Since the late 20th century, many of these monuments were adopted as "sacred sites" by adherents of [[Paganism (contemporary religious movements)|contemporary pagan]] religions such as [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Goddess movement]], and they had used the sites as places to conduct their magico-religious rites.

==Background==

===Early Neolithic===
[[File:WKLB Mittelgang DB.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[West Kennet Long Barrow]]. Long barrows such as this one were the dominant form of megalithic architecture before the development of the stone circle tradition.]]

During the Neolithic, or 'New Stone Age', there were extensive cultural changes across north-western Europe. The introduction of [[agriculture]] ended the [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle which had dominated in the preceding Palaeolithic ('Old Stone Age') and Mesolithic ('Middle Stone Age') periods.

During the Early Neolithic in Brittany and the British Isles, the megalithic tradition of building [[chambered tomb]]s for the dead had waxed and waned. The chambered tomb tradition lasted between about 4000 and 3500 BCE, although an earlier example, at [[Carrowmore]] in County Sligo, has been disputably dated to 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005. p. 34"&gt;[[#Par05|Parker Pearson 2005]]. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 24"&gt;[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of this tradition led prehistorian [[Mike Parker Pearson]] to note that it was "a relatively short-lived fashion in archaeological terms."&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005. p. 34"/&gt; In southern England, 84% of chambered tombs were built in a north-east to south-east orientation, which probably had some special significance for their builders.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=23}}

In some parts of the British Isles, architectural changes were made to the style of chambered tomb, which may have been a forerunner of the later circular design of the stone rings.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 26-27"&gt;[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Clyde tombs of south-western Scotland and the court-cairns of northern Ireland, crescent-shaped forecourts were constructed inside the tombs. This would have enabled more people to enter the tomb and take part in any rites there in sunlight.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 26-27"/&gt;

During the Early Neolithic another form of monument was also constructed in the British Isles, now known by archaeologists as [[causewayed enclosure]]s.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 25"&gt;[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; These  consisted of massive circular ditch-and-bank earthworks. Construction of causewayed enclosures in the lowland regions of Southern England flourished around 3800 BCE, but by 3200 BCE almost all of them had been abandoned by their users.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 25"/&gt; No equivalents have been found in the highland areas of northern Britain.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 25"/&gt; Despite having excavated a number of these sites across southern Britain, archaeologists do not know their exact purpose. It has been suggested that they were camps, markets, cattle kraals or occasional settlements, or perhaps ritual centres for the celebration of seasonal festivals or cemeteries.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 25"/&gt;

===Late Neolithic===

As the transition from the [[Neolithic|Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic]] took place in around 3000 BCE, there was much economic and technological continuity. But there was considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} By that date, the [[long barrow]]s, [[causewayed enclosure]]s, and [[cursus]]es which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased to be built. They were replaced by circular monuments of various kinds.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=81}} These include not only stone circles, but also earthen [[henge]]s and [[timber circles]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|pp=91–94}} This transition toward circular monuments had symbolic associations. As the archaeologist [[Aubrey Burl]] stated, "There was a change from the cramped, gloomy chamber of a tomb to the unroofed, wide ring, a change from darkness to light, from the dead to the living, from the grave to the sky."{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=38}} Similar observations were made by the historian Ronald Hutton, who commented that the circular shape of the rings "mirrors the sun, the full moon and the bounds of the horizon" and that such a shape can also be "profoundly egalitarian".{{sfn|Hutton|1991|p=52}}

[[File:Maumbury Rings center.jpg|thumb|left|Alongside the stone circles, earthen henges (such as [[Maumbury Rings]] in Dorset) were erected in Late Neolithic Britain]]

This transition was, according to historian [[Ronald Hutton]], "as fundamental as that from the Mesolithic had been."&lt;ref name="Hutton 1991 52"&gt;[[#Hut91|Hutton 1991]]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological pollen analysis has shown that it was a period when scrub and weeds were spreading over what had formerly been cultivated fields, and forests that had previously been cleared began to grow back.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 29"&gt;[[#Bur00|Burl 2000]]. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Chambered tombs were blocked up and abandoned, implying that people were ceasing to use them as cultic sites.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 29"/&gt; Several former causewayed enclosures were converted into defensive structures with gateways and walls, and in some cases they were attacked. Evidence for conflict has been found at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] in Cornwall, [[Hambledon Hill]] in Dorset, and Crickley Hill in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 29"/&gt; Various archaeologists have suggested that this was a period of particular turmoil within the British Isles, perhaps caused by an overuse of land, the failure of crops, famine, plague, climatic change, or an increase in population that was not supported by the food supply.&lt;ref name="Burl 2000 29"/&gt;

===Early Bronze Age===
The start of the Bronze Age in Britain was signalled by the introduction of [[bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and usually [[tin]]. Ideologically, there is no evidence for a change in Brittany and the British Isles at this time, with communities continuing to construct megalithic stone circles. The archaeologists J.M. Coles and A.F. Harding noted that across western Europe, the Bronze Age was "closely and logically connected" with the Late Neolithic which preceded it, and that the marker that is applied between the two by contemporary archaeologists is "arbitrary".{{sfn|Coles|Harding|1979|p=213}}

==Description==

The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that, along with the [[chambered long barrow]]s of the Early Neolithic, stone circles are one of the most prominent forms of monument produced in prehistoric Britain.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} Despite the commonly used term "stone circles", many of these monuments are not true circles, but are instead ellipses or ovals.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=91}} The stone circles are not always found in isolation from other forms of monument and often intersect with timber and earth structures.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}} For this reason, the archaeologist [[Richard Bradley (archaeologist)|Richard Bradley]] cautioned against understanding stone circles, timber circles, and earthen henges as distinct "types" of monument.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=132}}

The archaeologist Alexander Thom suggested that the stone circles fell into four broad classes: circles, flattened circles, egg-shaped rings, and ellipses.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

Some stone circles, such as that at [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in [[Somerset]], are approached by a short alignment of paired stones.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=123}} There are also stone avenues that link different monuments in the landscape, such as the [[West Kennet Avenue]] which links the Avebury henge to [[The Sanctuary]].{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}} In some cases, the stone circles survive in such a damaged state that it is not possible to know what they originally looked like.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

In some examples, timber posts were replaced with stone ones, perhaps with the intention of making the monument more durable and protecting it from decay.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=125}} In others, it is possible that both wooden and stone features of the circle were contemporary with each other.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=124}}

Like henges, the stone circles are almost exclusively found in the British Isles. The distribution of the stone circles is distinctive as it is broader than that of the henges.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} They are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, except the island's south-eastern corner.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}}
They are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and near [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=94}} There is much diversity in the design of these circles, both between different regions and within them.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} According to Mike Parker Pearson, this is "perhaps unsurprising for a thousand-year fashion".{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}

==Construction==
[[File:LongMegAndHerDaughters(SimonLedingham)May2005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Long Meg and Her Daughters]], the largest example of Alexander Thom's Type B Flattened Circle]]
The archaeologist and stone circle specialist Aubrey Burl noted that the stone circle builders would have had to undertake "careful planning" before they erected these monuments. There was much that they had to take into consideration: the choice of location, the size of the ring, the transport of the heavy stones, the laying out of the circle or ellipse, and the preparation of stone holes. They may have also had to plot astronomical alignments, making the task more difficult.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Most stone circles were constructed upon flat ground, although some were instead built on a slope. At some sites, such as [[Kiltierney]] in [[County Fermanagh]], the land was flattened especially for this purpose, although in other cases it is clear that the land had been flattened by earlier communities, who had used the land for settlement or agriculture.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=43}}

Aaron Watson has argued that various circles were located in a particular position to give the appearance of occupying the centre of the world, representing a microcosm of the surrounding area.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|pp=136–137}}

In some instances it appears that the choice of material used was important.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} For instance, at the [[Ring of Brodgar]] the stones used in the circle were produced from a variety of different sources.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}}

Very little is known about the process of quarrying the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One exception is at [[Vestra Fiold]] in [[Orkney]], where [[Colin Richards]] led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and a sled were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|pp=59–60}}

===Dating, number and size===
Burl noted that archaeologists assumed that for every stone circle that survived to the late 20th century,  there would have been two lost. From the 1300 surviving examples, Burl calculated that there might have originally been around 4000 stone circles across Britain, Ireland and Brittany.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

Since the 1950s, archaeologists have been able to use [[radiocarbon dating]] of the material around the stones in order to accurately date their original construction.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} As of 2000, the earliest known radiocarbon dating of a stone circle was from the [[Lochmaben Stone]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], which was dated to 2525 ± 85 BCE, whilst the latest examples came from Sandy Road in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (1200 ± 150 BCE), from [[Dromberg]] in [[County Cork]] (790 ± 80 BCE), and from the Five-Stone ring of [[Cashelkeety]] in [[County Kerry]] (715 ± 50 BCE).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}} Burl said that, the calibration of these dates indicated that the stone circle tradition existed between 3300 and 900 BCE.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=13}}

[[File:Avebury Stone Circles.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Avebury in Wiltshire is the largest example of a stone circle from the British Isles, and is physically situated within an earlier henge.]]
The size of the megalithic rings varied, perhaps according to the number of people who would be using it during ceremonies.{{sfn|Burl|2000|pp=44–45}} Burl calculated that the largest stone circle in terms of both diameter and area was [[Stanton Drew stone circles|Stanton Drew]] in Somerset, with a diameter of {{convert|112.2|m|ft}} and an area of 9,887 m² (2.44 acres). Second came the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney at {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} in diameter and 8,430 m² (2.08 acres) in area, whilst third was [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire, which had a diameter of {{convert|102.4|m|ft}} and an area of 8,236m² (2.04 acres).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}} However, Burl did not count the outer stone circle at Avebury, which has a diameter of {{convert|331.6|m|ft}}, making it Britain's largest stone circle. All of the largest circles were found in or near earlier henge monuments.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=45}} Such gargantuan monuments were rare. Burl calculated that most of the megalithic rings (92%) had an average diameter of {{convert|13.7|m|ft}}, with an average area of 150 m² (1615&amp;nbsp;ft²).{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=46}}

===Megalithic yard===
The archaeologist [[Alexander Thom]] proposed that the stone circles were built using a unit of measurement which he called the "[[megalithic yard]]",{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} about {{convert|2.72|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}} He came to this conclusion following more than forty years of surveying the monuments, aided by his son Archibald Stevenson Thom.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}
Parker Pearson stated that "the idea of a standard unit of measurement is very plausible" but perhaps not as regular as Thom and others have argued.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} In 1980, Burl noted that the idea of Thom's Megalithic Yard "remain[ed] contentious".{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

===Astronomical alignments===

Thom also argued that the builders of these circles were accomplished astronomers and deliberately included astronomical alignments in the rings.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}
According to Parker Pearson, however, many of the circles do not appear to be based on any astronomical alignment.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} Pearson cautioned that Late Neolithic/Bronze Age conceptions of cosmology were likely very different from modern understandings of astronomy.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}}

==Purposes==
[[File:Rollrights King's Men.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The largest stone in the King's Men, a stone circle that is the dominant part of the [[Rollright Stones]] complex in the [[Cotswolds]].]]

There has been much analysis and debate about these monuments.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} No simple explanations have emerged.{{sfn|Parker Pearson|2005|p=59}} The original purposes of the stone ring monuments has been widely debated by antiquarians and archaeologists for several centuries.

These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=97}} This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence. They may have been deliberately left as "silent and empty monuments".{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}} The archaeologists [[Mike Parker Pearson]] and Ramilsonina suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living.{{sfnm|1a1=Bradley|1y=2007|1p=126|2a1=Hutton|2y=2013|2pp=97–98}} Bradley noted that this interpretation was "consistent with the archaeological evidence from Britain",{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} where evidence for feasting and other human activities have been found at a range of timber sites but not at their stone counterparts. At the latter sites, there has been evidence of human remains.{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Bradley suggested that the stone circles may have been spaces "devoted to the dead".{{sfn|Bradley|2007|p=126}} Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities.{{sfn|Hutton|2013|p=98}}

==Regional distribution==
Aubrey Burl's gazetteer lists 1,303 stone circles in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. The largest number of these are found in Scotland, with 508 sites recorded. There are 316 in England; 187 in Ireland; 156 in Northern Ireland; 81 in Wales; 49 in Brittany; and 6 in the Channel Isles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=395}}

===South-west Britain===

There are two known stone circles on [[Exmoor]]: [[Porlock Stone Circle]] and [[Withypool Stone Circle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=150|2a1=Riley|2a2=Wilson-North|2y=2001|2p=24|3a1=Gillings|3y=2015a|3p=1}}

===Wessex===
Wessex contains the two best known, though most atypical stone circles, [[Avebury]] and [[Stonehenge]].

[[File:Nine Stones, Dorset.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Stones near Winterbourne Abbas, Dorset]]

The area of modern Dorset has a "thin scatter" of stone circles,{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=307}} with nine possible examples known within its boundaries: [[Hampton Down Stone Circle]], [[Kingston Russell Stone Circle]], [[Nine Stones, Winterbourne Abbas|Nine Stones]], and [[Rempstone Stone Circle]] remain visible.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} The archaeologist John Gale described these as "a small but significant group" of such monuments.{{sfn|Gale|2003|p=72}} All are located within five miles of the sea.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}} All but Rempstone—which is on the [[Isle of Purbeck]]—are located on the chalk hills west of [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]].{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres in diameter.{{sfnm|1a1=Piggott|1a2=Piggott|1y=1939|1p=139|2a1=Burl|2y=2000|2p=308|3a1=Gale|3y=2003|3p=72}} All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2p=72}} 

With the exception of the sandstone Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen boulders.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=138}} Much of this may have been obtained from the "Valley of Stones", a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to [[Littlebredy]], which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles.{{sfnm|1a1=Burl|1y=2000|1p=308|2a1=Gale|2y=2003|2pp=182–183}} With the exception of the circle at [[Litton Cheney]], none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=139}} The archaeologists [[Stuart Piggott|Stuart]] and [[Margaret Guido|Cecily Piggott]] believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin,{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=310}} It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=141}} The Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that "their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age".{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}}
Their nearest analogies are the circles found on [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] to the west, and the [[Stanton Drew stone circles]] to the north.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=140}} It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period.{{sfn|Piggott|Piggott|1939|p=142}} On average Dorset's earthen henges are four times larger than the stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=308}}

===Northern England===
In what is now northern England, there was a particularly rich stone circle tradition in Cumbria. Several large megalithic rings were constructed here, such as [[Castlerigg stone circle]], [[Swinside]], and [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].

===Scotland===
[[Image:Ring of Brodgar 3.jpg|thumb|The Ring of Brodgar, a Neolithic stone circle on [[Orkney]], Scotland.]]
Stone circles exist throughout Scotland, from [[Ninestane Rig]] in the far south to more famous examples in the far north and particularly in the islands (where several form part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]]). The [[Callanish Stones]] are one of the best-known examples in the [[Outer Hebrides]], while [[Orkney]] is known for its [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Neolithic monuments]], including the [[Ring of Brodgar]] and the [[Standing Stones of Stenness]].

==Later history==

In some cases, the stones were removed from the rings for use as a building material.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}} In others, the site has been disrupted by natural courses such as trees, the roots of which have shifted the location of the megaliths.{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=3}}

===Late Bronze and Iron Ages===
Evidence for the destruction of stone circles first comes from the Late Bronze Age.

===Medieval period===

Following the Christianisation of Britain in the Early Medieval period, various Christian clergyman denounced those pagans who continued to venerate at stones in the landscape, which in some cases perhaps implied stone circles.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=14}}

By the Late Mediaeval period, references to prehistoric monuments in the British Isles were rare, and were usually only to note down practical matters, such as that a judicial court would be held near to one or that a farmer's land lay near to one.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}
A rare exception is found in the fictionalised ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (c.1136), in which the chronicle's author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] claimed that Stonehenge had once been the Giants' Ring, and that it had originally been located on [[Mount Killaraus]] in Ireland, until the wizard [[Merlin]] moved it to Salisbury Plain.{{sfn|Burl|2000|p=15}}

===Antiquarian and archaeological investigation===

Many 19th century antiquarians produced plans of the circles which were "inaccurate and slipshod."{{sfn|Thom|Thom|Burl|1980|p=1}}

==Folklore==
In the Mediaeval and Early Modern period onward, much folklore developed around the subject of the stone circles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18758">'''The North Wind and the Sun''' is one of [[Aesop's Fables]] ([[Perry Index]] 46). It is type 298 (Wind and Sun) in the [[Aarne-Thompson classification system#Other Animals and Objects 220–299|Aarne-Thompson]] folktale classification.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0298.html Wind and Sun: fables of Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 298 in which the wind and the sun dispute about which of them is more powerful plus a related African-American tale]''&lt;/ref&gt; The moral it teaches about the superiority of [[persuasion]] over force has made the story widely known. It has also become a chosen text for phonetic transcriptions.

==Story and application==
[[File:The North Wind and the Sun - Wind - Project Gutenberg etext 19994.jpg|thumb|The wind attempts to strip the traveler of his cloak, illustrated by [[Milo Winter]] in a 1919 [[Aesop]] [[anthology]].]]
[[File:The North Wind and the Sun - Sun - Project Gutenberg etext 19994.jpg|thumb|The sun persuades the traveler to take off his cloak]]
The story concerns a competition between the [[North Wind]] and the [[Sun]] to decide which is the stronger of the two. The challenge was to make a passing traveler remove his cloak. However hard the North Wind blew, the traveler only wrapped his cloak tighter to keep warm, but when the Sun shone, the traveler was overcome with heat and soon took his cloak off.

The fable was well known in [[Ancient Greece]]; [[Athenaeus]] records that [[Hieronymus of Rhodes]], in his ''Historical Notes'', quoted an epigram of [[Sophocles]] against [[Euripides]] that parodied the story of [[Helios]] and [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Lyco and Traos and Hieronymus of Rhodes: Text, Translation, and Discussion | editor1-last=Fortenbaugh | editor1-first=William Wall | editor2-last=White | editor2-first=Stephen Augustus | series=Rutgers University Studies in Classical Humanities | volume=XII | publisher=Transaction Publishers | date=2004 | page=161 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdesXRC6ba8C&amp;pg=PA161 | accessdate=2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It related how Sophocles had his cloak stolen by a boy to whom he had made love. Euripides joked that he had had that boy too, and it did not cost him anything. Sophocles' reply satirises the adulteries of Euripides:
"It was the Sun, and not a boy, whose heat stripped me naked;
as for you, Euripides, when you were kissing someone else's wife
the North Wind screwed ''you''. You are unwise, you who sow
in another's field, to accuse Eros of being a snatch-thief."

The Latin version of the fable first appeared centuries later in [[Avianus]], as ''De Vento et Sole'' (Of the wind and the sun, Fable 4);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/avianus/4.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; early versions in English and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]'s poetic version in German (''Wind und Sonne'') also gave it as such. It was only in mid-Victorian times that the title "The North Wind and the Sun" began to be used. In fact, the Avianus poem refers to the characters as [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] and [[Apollo#Greco-Roman epithets|Phoebus]], the divinities of the north wind and the sun, and it was under the title ''Phébus et Borée'' that it appeared in [[La Fontaine's Fables]].

[[Gilles Corrozet]], who had compiled a fable collection in French verse earlier than La Fontaine, twice featured the contest between the sun and the wind in his [[emblem book]]s. In ''Hecatomgraphie'' (1540), the first of these, the story is told in a quatrain, accompanied by a woodcut in which a man holds close a fur cloak under the wintry blast while on the other side he strips naked beneath the sun’s rays. It is titled with the moral “More by gentleness than strength” (''Plus par doulceur que par force'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/facsimile.php?id=sm385-e2v Glasgow University]&lt;/ref&gt; The same illustration was used to accompany another poem in Corrozet’s later ''Emblemes'' (1543), which counsels taking enjoyment and being careful as necessity demands, wisely adapting oneself to circumstances in the same way as one dresses differently for winter than for summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/facsimile.php?id=sm384-63r Emblem 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian versions of the fable give the moral as "Persuasion is better than force", but it had been put in different ways at other times. In the Barlow edition of 1667, [[Aphra Behn]] taught the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] lesson that there should be moderation in everything: "In every passion moderation choose,/For all extremes do bad effects produce",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/barlow/34.htm |title=Mythfolklore.net |publisher=Mythfolklore.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 18th century, Herder came to the theological conclusion that, while superior force leaves us cold, the warmth of Christ's love dispels it,&lt;ref&gt;''Gedichte V, Geschichte und Fabel 4'', quoted in the [[:de:Die Sonne und der Wind|German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter Crane's limerick version of 1887 gives a psychological interpretation, "True strength is not bluster". But for [[Guy Wetmore Carryl]] in his humorous rewriting of the fable, "The Impetuous Breeze and the Diplomatic Sun", tact is the lesson to be learned. There the competition is between the man and the wind; the sun only demonstrates the right way of achieving one's end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Impetuous_Breeze_and_the_Diplomatic_Sun Fables for the Frivolous (1898)]&lt;/ref&gt;

While most examples draw a moral lesson, La Fontaine's "Mildness more than violence achieves" (''Fables'' VI.3) hints at the political application that was present also in Avianus' conclusion: "They cannot win who start with threats". There is evidence that this reading has had an explicit influence on the diplomacy of modern times: in South Korea's [[Sunshine Policy]], for instance, or Japanese relations with the [[State Peace and Development Council|military regime in Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs/NorthWind&amp;Sun.htm |title=Burmalibrary.org |publisher=Burmalibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fable in the arts==

[[File:Phébus&amp;Borée.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]]'s cosmic interpretation of La Fontaine's fable, 1729/34]]
The fable was the third of five in [[Anthony Plog]]'s "Aesop’s Fables" for narrator, piano and horn (1989/93);&lt;ref&gt;A performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxqCfvmPYVo You Tube]&lt;/ref&gt; it is also one of the five pieces in [[Bob Chilcott]]'s "Aesop's Fables" for piano and choir (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN_fOMt-IVE |title=There is a performance on YouTube |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, under the title "The Wind and the Sun", the English composer Philip Godfrey (b.1964) has made a setting for children's choir and piano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipgodfrey.co.uk/upper-voices.htm Compser’s website with sample score]&lt;/ref&gt;

La Fontaine's ''Phébus et Borée'' was choreographed in 2006 by [[:fr:Karine Ponties|Karine Ponties]] as part of Annie Sellem's composite ballet production of La Fontaine's fables as a 25-minute performance for a male and female dancer.&lt;ref&gt;The last four minutes can be seen on [http://vimeo.com/5838460 Vimeo]&lt;/ref&gt; Its creator has commented on the fable's theme that 'it demonstrates people's vulnerability to cosmic forces and the inner links there are between natural events and our life as humans.'&lt;ref&gt;''Il y montre aussi la vulnérabilité de l’homme face aux jeux cosmiques et les liens profonds qu’il y a entre les grandes forces physiques de notre monde et la vie humaine'', [http://www.damedepic.be/Public/Projet.php?ID=3451 Dame de Pic]&lt;/ref&gt; But for the Scottish artist Jane Topping (b. 1972), who referenced "The North Wind and the Sun" in her 2009 installation, the fable is to be interpreted in the context of subliminal persuasion via images.&lt;ref&gt;A photo on the [http://www.janetopping.co.uk/exhibitions/persuasion/index.php artist's website]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Anat Pollack used solo ballet as part of her video installation "The North Wind and the Sun", addressing much the same themes as Karine Ponties and Jane Topping. Her artistic statement points out that 'Advanced communication and information systems are altering how information is interpreted and perceived. Interactions within our environments are increasingly information based, ephemeral, and less concrete. To understand how these changes are impacting our personal and social spaces, I have focused on a study of information processing, and the way that memory functions to locate the individual within their world.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anatpollack.net/artist%20statement.php The artist's website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821031824/http://www.anatpollack.net/artist%20statement.php |date=2013-08-21 }} also has a copy of the video&lt;/ref&gt; All are concerned with the subtle means by which individuals can be manipulated. From this wary point of view, the sun's way of communication may differ in kind but has the same end in view.

==Use in phonetic demonstrations==
[[File:Recording of speaker of British English (Received Pronunciation).ogg|thumb|right|''The North Wind and the Sun'' read with [[Received Pronunciation]]]] The fable is made famous by its use in [[phonetic]] descriptions of [[language]]s as an illustration of spoken language. In the ''Handbook of the [[International Phonetic Association]]'' and the ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association]]'', a translation of the fable into each language described is transcribed into the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. It is recommended by the IPA for the purpose of eliciting all phonemic contrasts that occur in English when conducting tests by foreign users or of regional usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:NB0H9qpVsA4J:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.149.5276%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+north+wind+and+the+sun+comparative+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgo6QPL2r_ZZI9HW-rXekr2Gtm8TDtAgG6uQnpuMOLg9FsqrwrZjYBplXyh_EaGwKrvHCIUH3gC3vtVLlQyb52yGJFxtLI_uQtAMHu4A2lnhYBDS_o958tbtFqRGqhyZE74mUrv&amp;sig=AHIEtbQoxfTT0nfEThll3PRUC7uXjD4NGQ |title=See for example this investigation |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the description of [[American English]] in the ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association'' includes the following as a sample text:&lt;ref&gt;International Phonetic Association (1999), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author ==
Mary De Morgan&lt;ref&gt;Gear, Rachel S. "The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography." ''Morgan, (Mary) Augusta De (1850-1907).'' Oxford University Press, May 2006. Web. 15 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1850 in London, UK.  De Morgan was a successful Victorian Era children's short story writer. In her writing career, De Morgan developed three individual collections which started with ''On a Pincushion'' (1877), then ''The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde'' (1880), and finally, ''The Windfairies'' (1900). The first two collections were successfully published by 1800 and her career as a Victorian Era writer continued to flourish. De Morgan aimed to create stories that recreated her brother's illustrations. Her focus was reading to young children her written works of short stories in the Victorian fairy-tale genres. Tragically, De Morgan died in Egypt in 1907.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, James. "'The Golden Harp': Mary de Morgan's Centrality in Victorian Fairy-Tale Literature ."

'''Aldovrand:''' One of the main round characters who is the oldest of the three nephews to King Roland. His character traits are lazy, self-centered, and ignorant.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''Aldebert:''' One of the main characters who is the middle aged nephew to King Roland. As a static character he holds compliant, relaxed, and positive characteristics throughout the short story.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''Alderete:''' One of the main characters; the youngest of the three nephews to King Roland. His characteristic traits that carried through the short story are optimistic, happy, and peaceful.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''The Political Council:''' These one-dimensional, stock characters consist of [[Prime Minister]], [[Chancellor]], Commander-in-Chief, and Lord High Admiral.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''The Tinker:''' An old man who travels from house to house mending wares. The tinker's flat character consists of confidence and politeness.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

'''The Sweeper:''' A man who cleans the chimneys around town as a hobby and job. The Sweeper's crude characteristics include enthusiastic, comfortable, and obedient.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

==Summary==
The story tells the cycle of three young men, the king's nephews, who attempt to rule the kingdom after the death of their uncle, King Ronald. The eldest nephew, Aldovrand, is first in line to test his abilities as king. Aldovrand proves to be selfish in nature and demands extreme independence from all. The Prime Minister and [[Chancellor]] turns to Aldovrand, asking questions regarding the kingdom. Aldovrand does not like being disturbed by them and decides to run away. While leaving the kingdom Aldovrand runs into a farmer who offers him a job watching his geese. Next in line to test his abilities as king is the second nephew, Aldebert. Aldebert is confronted with conflicts such as increasing the army's wages, repairing the kingdom's city, and also saving money for the kingdom. He grants everyone's wishes but it resulted in great disagreement. Aldebert can not deal with the conflicting decisions and runs away. While leaving the kingdom, Aldebert runs into a tinker, who offeres him a job. Alderete, the last nephew is next to test his abilities as king. Excited to reign, Alderete explores the kingdom and commands that drastic lifestyle changes need to be made. The people in the city starts an uproar and protest against Alderete's demands. The pressure is too much, and Alderete runs away in fear. While he is leaving the kingdom, he runs into a chimney sweeper and becomes his apprentice. In panic, The Prime Minister and Chancellor return  to the three nephews pleading for them to become King. All three nephews decline and proceed happily with their new jobs leaving behind any luxuries and power that could have been theirs as King.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

==Moral==
Wealth, power, and luxuries are not key to one's happiness. Instead, pursue a career that fits one's interests, and happiness will follow.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt;

The '''Thebes tablets''' have inscriptions in the [[Mycenaean Greek language]] of the [[Linear B]] script, were discovered in [[Thebes, Greece]]. They belong to the [[Helladic period|Late Helladic IIIB]] context, contemporary with the finds at [[Pylos]]. A first group of 21 fragments was found in the 1963–64 campaign;&lt;ref&gt;They were published by [[John Chadwick]] in ''Minos'' '''10''' 1970:115-37.&lt;/ref&gt; A further 19 tablets were found in 1970 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Theodoros G. Spyropoulos and John Chadwick. ''The Thebes Tablets II'' (Salamanca: Universitad de Salamanca) 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Near Eastern cylinder seals associated with the finds, the editors of the published corpus of the whole archive now date the destruction of the ''Kadmeion'', the Mycenaean palace complex at Thebes, and thus the writing of the tablets, some of which were still damp when they were unintentionally fired, to shortly after 1225 BC. Chadwick identified three recognizable Hellenic divinities, [[Hera]], [[Hermes]] and [[Potnia]] "the mistress", among the recipients of wool. He made out a case for ''ko-ma-we-te-ja'', also attested at Pylos, as the name of a goddess.

Quite early, before the more recent discoveries, [[Frederick M. Ahl|Frederick Ahl]] made the provocative suggestion concerning the ''phoinikeia grammata'', the "Phoenician" or the "palm-leaf" (''phoinix'') letters: "[[Cadmus]] did bring writing to Thebes, but this writing was not the Phoenician alphabet, but Linear B".&lt;ref&gt;Ahl, Frederick M. "Cadmus and the Palm-Leaf Tablets", ''The American Journal of Philology'', '''88'''.2 (April 1967, pp. 188–194) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
A substantial additional portion, some 250 tablets, amounting roughly to 5% of the entire Mycenaean corpus from all sites, was discovered in Pelopidou Street and the "Arsenal" by Vassilis L. Aravantinos, the current archaeological superintendent of Thebes, from 1993 to 1995, in a rescue excavation. In 1996, a few more tablets were identified in a museum among finds from the 1963–1964 dig in Thebes.

The number of "tablets" given by the editors is actually misleading. For example, as Tom Palaima and Sarah James have independently demonstrated, the "123 tablets" of the Fq series actually are many fragments of texts that originally made up between 15 and 18 tablets.

== Publication ==
The French and Italian linguists [[Louis Godart]] and Anna Sacconi were charged with the publication of these tablets. During the following years, their preliminary glimpses of the contents, which suggested that the new tablets would reveal a dramatically new view of Mycenaean religion, gave rise to accusations that the project was moving too slowly; when the tablets were finally published in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;V. Aravantinos, L. Godart and A. Sacconi. ''Thèbes: Fouilles de la Cadmée I''. Pisa/Rome, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of their overall content was perceived by some reviewers &lt;ref&gt;T. Palaima in ''AJA'' 107, pp. 113–115; C. J. Ruijgh in ''Mnemosyne'', Fourth Series, Vol. 56, Fasc. 2 (2003), pp. 219-228; and Cynthia W. Shelmerdine, ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', Vol. 128 (2008), pp. 266-268. Subsequently, objections were also registered by García Ramon, Killen, Meier-Brügge, Palaima, and other contributors to 'Die Neuen Linear B-Tabletten aus Theben' (2006; see note 7 below for full reference)&lt;/ref&gt; to be rather less than expected.

== Findings ==
Many of the Thebes tablets can be read as containing information on divinities and religious rites; others mention quantities of various commodities. By the sites mentioned, the boundaries of the region controlled by the Theban palace can be estimated: the Theban palace controlled the island of [[Euboea]] and had a harbour in [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]]. The tablets contain a number of important terms previously unattested in Linear B, such as ''ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo /Lakedaimnijos/'' "a man from Lacedaemonia ([[Sparta]])", or ''ma-ka /Mā Gā/'' "Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]" (a goddess still revered in Thebes in the 5th century BC, as reported, for example, in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]''). Also ''ku-na-ki-si /gunaiksi/'' "for women", exhibits the peculiar oblique stem of [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|γυνή}} "woman".

Godart and Sacconi read the tablets to indicate cult activity dedicated to [[Demeter]], [[Zeus]] protector of crops, and to [[Persephone|Kore]], and they speculate that the roots of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] can be traced back to Mycenaean Thebes. Palaima, however, has criticized their suggestions as "subject to very dubious interpretations" and "highly suspect on linguistic and exegetical grounds".&lt;ref&gt;Palaima, "Sacrificial Feasting" p. 218, citing his own reviews "Rev. of Aravantinos, Godart, and Sacconi 2001", in ''Minos'' 35–36, pp. 475–486; review of Aravantinos, Godart, and Sacconi 2001, in ''AJA'' 107, pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other arguments against the identification of cult activity in the texts have been advanced by Sarah James and Yves Duhoux.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Palaima attaches importance to one tablet (Uo 121) as evidence of linking sacrificial animals with foodstuffs at the end of LHIIIB. The same phenomenon, part of ritual Mycenaean feasting, occurs in the contemporary [[Pylos]] tablets.

== Vienna symposium ==
The results of a specialist symposium held in Vienna December 5–6, 2002 have been published.&lt;ref&gt;S. Deger-Jalkotzy and O. Panagl, ''Die Neuen Linear B-Texte aus Theben'' (Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 2006); [http://www.austriaca.at/?arp=0x00118cf7 Online abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; The papers further dismantle the "house of cards" &lt;ref&gt; T. Palaima's term in ''AJA'', Vol. 107, No. 1 (Jan. 2003), p.115 &lt;/ref&gt; constructed by the editors of the tablets on the religious references in the Thebes tablets.

Günter Neumann (pp.&amp;nbsp;125–138) states that the animals in the Thebes tablets are not in any way sacred or "divine" but animals that would naturally be part of everyday life for both Mycenaean and later Greeks. He gathers explicit historical evidence, including references to the animals being fed grains.

Michael Meier-Brügger (pp.&amp;nbsp;111–118) clearly demonstrates that ''de-qo-no'' as "master of banqueting" is linguistically impossible. It must be ''deipnon'' "main dinner", as in Homer; that ''di-wi-ja-me-ro'' cannot equal "the part for the goddess Diwia" but has to be "two-day period" (as also argued earlier by Melena and in this volume by Killen). Also, ''si-to'' is not an otherwise unattested god Sito (Grain) but plain ''siton'' "grain".

José Luis Garcia Ramón (pp.&amp;nbsp;37–69) demonstrates that linguistically, ''a-ko-ro-da-mo'' cannot be ''agorodamos'' "mystic assembler of the people". He proposes simply the Greek male name Akrodamos. He also considers that ''o-po-re-i'' is a personal name, parallel to another in the Thebes tablets ''me-to-re-i''. They mean respectively "on the mountain" and "beyond the mountain" so ''o-po-re-i'' does not mean "Zeus of the Fall Harvest", which is impossible according to Mycenaean usage for god's names and epithets.

John T. Killen (pp.&amp;nbsp;79–110) specifically concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;103) that "the fact that ma-ka, o-po-re-i, and ko-wa never all occur together, and that it requires a special hypothesis to explain this fact, combined with what I believe are the continuing difficulties with explaining o-po-re-i as a theonym /Opo:rehi/, make me reluctant for the present to accept the ma-ka = Ma:i Ga:i [i.e., Mother Earth] equation".

'''Thracology''' is the scientific study of [[Thrace|Ancient Thrace]] and [[Thracian]] antiquities and is a regional and thematic branch of the larger disciplines of [[ancient history]] and [[archaeology]]. A practitioner of the discipline is a '''Thracologist'''. Thracology investigates the range of ancient Thracian culture (language, literature, history, religion, art, economics and ethics) from 1000 BC up to the end of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in the 4th–7th centuries AD. Modern Thracology (as opposed to an [[antiquarian]] interest in the land of Thrace) started with the work of [[Wilhelm Tomaschek]] in the late 19th century.

== Thracology in Bulgaria ==
In the second part of the 20th century, Bulgarian historian [[Alexander Fol]] founded the Institute of Thracology in the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences|Bulgarian Academy of Science]]. With subsequently ever-increasing Thracian tombs unearthing, the study of the Ancient Thracian civilization was able to proceed with greater academic rigor.

== Thracology in Romania ==
Since [[Dacians]] are considered a branch of the [[Thracian]]s by most mainstream research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149413/Dacia#ref=ref24738&amp;tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Dacia%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia "Dacia"] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online&lt;/ref&gt; and historical sources,&lt;ref&gt;Strabo VII.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romanians|Romanian]] historians and archaeologists have also been heavily involved in Thracology since at least the 19th century. The related term '''Thraco-Dacology''' also exists, alluding to [[Thraco-Dacian]], and one of the first uses is from around 1980, in the Romanian government archive.{{sfn|RA42|1980|p=181}}

But since other theories sustain that Daco-Thracian relation is not as strong as originally thought,{{sfn|Olteanu}}&lt;ref&gt;Georgiev (1960) 39-58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dacology]]{{sfn|Vulpe|1980|p=95}} may evolve as an independent discipline from Thracology.
Unfortunately, the terms ''Dacology/Dacologist'' have been negatively affected by the association with [[Protochronism]] and risk to be severely compromised, prompting some reputable Romanian researchers to call themselves Thracologists instead of Dacologists, even in the context of their research being focused more on Dacians than on Thracians, and even without necessarily promoting a strong connection between the two peoples.{{sfn|Olteanu}}

The ''Romanian Thracology Institute I.G Bibicescu'', part of [[Romanian Academy]] and based in [[Bucharest]], was founded in 1976, after the 2nd ''International Congress of Thracology'' held in September of same year in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Archäologien Europas: Geschichte, Methoden und Theorien By Peter F. Biehl, Alexander Gramsch, Arkadiusz Marciniak&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first directors was the thracologist [[Dumitru Berciu]] (1907–1998).

==Thracologists==
Researchers who have been noted in the field of Thracology include:
*[[Vladimir I. Georgiev]] - Bulgarian linguist
*[[Georgi Kitov]] - Bulgarian archaeologist
*[[Alexander Fol]] - Bulgarian Thracologist
*[[Ion Niculiţă]] - Moldavian archaeologist
*Sorin Olteanu - Romanian Thracologist, focused on Thraco-Daco-Moesian languages{{sfn|Olteanu}}
* Engin Beksac - Turkish archaeologist and art historian
* [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] - Romanian Daco-Thracologist and historian{{sfn|SCL|1983|p=267}}
* [[Ion I. Russu]]- Romanian Daco-Thracologist and historian{{sfn|SCL|1983|p=267}}
* [[Dumitru Berciu]] - Director of the Romanian Thracology Institute
* [[Margarita Tacheva]] - Bulgarian Thracologist

==International Congress of Thracology==
The ''International Congress of Thracology'' was organised by the Institute of Thracology at the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]. It has been held regularly since 1972 when it was founded by Alexander Fol. Fol himself became the chairman of the congress, and emphasized an international approach to the study of Thracology.

===Thracians and Myceneans===
On September 21–26, 1984, the Fourth International Congress of Thracology was held in the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands. The Congress was organized by the Henri Frankfort Foundation, which is a private institution whose main purpose is to augment the study of Mediterranean pre-history and proto-history. The opening of the symposium began on September 24 and was addressed by the Minister of Education and Science Dr. W. J. Deetman. "Thracians and Mycenaeans" was the theme name for the symposium, which held discussions pertaining to the potential ethnic, cultural, religious, and linguistic interrelations between proto-Thracians and proto-Greeks (i.e. [[Myceneans]]). It was believed that such interrelations had to exist since both groups have lived in the same geographic area in the past. According to [[Alexander Fol]], the concept of "Mycenean Thrace" was first developed in 1973 in order to explain the relative cultural unity between the Thracians and the Myceneans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Best|De Vries|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Time Enough at Last'''" is the eighth episode of the American [[television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The episode was adapted from a short story written by [[Lynn Venable (writer)|Lynn Venable]] (pen name of Marilyn Venable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hill, Angela (''Oakland Tribune'')|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22263716/give-em-hill-twilight-zone-el-cerrito-author|title=Give 'Em Hill: El Cerrito woman lends 'Twilight Zone' inspiration|work= San Jose Mercury News|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short story appeared in the January 1953 edition of the [[science fiction]] [[magazine]] ''[[If (magazine)|If: Worlds of Science Fiction]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|url=https://archive.org/details/If_Worlds_Of_Science_Fiction_v01n06_Quinn_Jan_1953_Gorgon776 |date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32633 |title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  about seven years before the television episode first aired. "Time Enough at Last" became one of the most famous episodes of the original ''Twilight Zone'' and has been frequently parodied since. It is "the story of a man who seeks salvation in the rubble of a ruined world"&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;[[Rod Serling|Serling, Rod]]. Promotional spot for "Time Enough at Last". Original airdate: 13 November 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of Henry Bemis {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|m|ɪ|s}}, played by [[Burgess Meredith]], who loves [[book]]s, yet is surrounded by those who would prevent him from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through the [[post-apocalyptic]] [[world]], touching on such social issues as [[anti-intellectualism]], the dangers of reliance upon [[technology]], and the difference between aloneness (solitude) and loneliness.

==Opening narration==
{{quote|Witness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of dreamers. A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page, but who is conspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of tongue-cluckers and the unrelenting hands of a clock. But in just a moment, Mr. Bemis will enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything else. He'll have a world all to himself... without anyone.}}

==Plot==
Henpecked, [[Far sightedness|far sighted]] [[bank teller]] and avid [[Bibliophile|bookworm]] Henry Bemis (Meredith) works at his window in a [[bank]], while reading ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', which causes him to shortchange an annoyed customer. Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading "[[wiktionary:doggerel|doggerel]]." As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read [[poetry]] from one of his books to her; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay.

The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's [[bank vault|vault]], where his reading will not be disturbed. Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads "[[Teller-Ulam design|H-Bomb]] Capable of Total Destruction," an enormous explosion outside the bank violently shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that a nuclear war has devastated Earth, but that his being in the vault has saved him.

{{quote|Seconds, minutes, hours. They crawl by on hands and knees for Mr. Henry Bemis, who looks for a spark in the ashes of a dead world. A telephone connected to nothingness. A neighborhood bar, a movie, a baseball diamond, a hardware store, the mailbox of what was once his house and is now a rubble. They lie at his feet as battered monuments to what was, but is no more.  Mr. Henry Bemis on an eight-hour tour of a graveyard.}}

Finding himself totally alone in a shattered world with food to last him a lifetime (but no one to share it with) and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a [[revolver]] he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public [[library]] in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) realizes that he has all the time in the world to read them without interruption.

His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is virtually [[blindness|blind]] without, and says, "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair!  It's not fair!" and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.

==Closing narration==
{{quote|The best laid plans of mice and men... and Henry Bemis... the small man in the glasses who wanted nothing but time. Henry Bemis, now just a part of a smashed landscape, just a piece of the rubble, just a fragment of what man has deeded to himself. Mr. Henry Bemis... in the Twilight Zone.}}

The closing narration was a sort of nod to Burgess Meredith's acting credits, as he was the lead in the 1939 movie ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]''.

==Production==
[[File:Burgess Meredith The Twilight Zone.jpg|thumb|Burgess Meredith as Henry Bemis]]
"Time Enough at Last" was one of the first episodes written for ''The Twilight Zone''.&lt;ref name="mp3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |title=Time Enough At Last: Twilight Zone Story read by Bill Mills |publisher=Fictionwise eBooks |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203030/http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced [[Burgess Meredith]] to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as "no stranger to ''The Twilight Zone''" in promotional spots for season two's "[[The Obsolete Man]]". He also narrated for the 1983 film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', which made reference to "Time Enough at Last" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.

Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed. These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an [[Eloi]] public building in [[MGM]]'s 1960 version of ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]''.&lt;ref name="zicree"&gt;Zicree, Marc Scott. ''The Twilight Zone Companion''. Sillman-James Press, 1982 (second edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brahm]] was nominated for a [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] award for his work on the episode.&lt;ref name="Directors Guild of AmeriCa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dga.org/Awards/Explore.aspx|title=Directors Guild of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'' by [[Washington Irving]].

==Themes==
[[Image:Time Enough themes.jpg|thumb|left|Humanity's propensity for destruction and [[suicide]] are among the episode's themes.]]
Although the overriding message may seem to "be careful what you wish for, you just might get it", there are other themes throughout the episode as well.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt; Paramount among these is the question of solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis' moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes towards books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past.&lt;ref name="ochse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506100624/http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-06 |author=Weston Ochse |title=The End of Books: The Bemis Condition |work=Storytellers Unplugged |accessdate=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarris"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarris, Andrew|title=Rod Serling: Viewed from Beyond the Twilight Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the ending "punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted".&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanyard, Stewart T.  |author2=Gaiman, Neil |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dimensions Behind the Twilight Zone: A Backstage Tribute to Television's Groundbreaking Series|publisher= Ecw Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rod Serling]]'s concluding statement in the episode alludes to [[Robert Burns]]' [[Scots language]] poem "[[To a Mouse]]." The poem concludes: "The best-laid schemes o' mice an men / ''Gang aft agley''" (translation: "Often go awry").

Although "Time Enough at Last" implies that [[nuclear warfare]] has destroyed humanity, [[film criticism|film critic]] [[Andrew Sarris]] notes that the episode's necessarily unrealistic format may have been what allowed its production to commence:&lt;ref name="sarris" /&gt;

{{quote|Much of the implacable seriousness of ''The Twilight Zone'' is seemingly keyed by the clipped, dour delivery of Serling himself and the interlocutor. He never encourages us to laugh, or even smile, even when the plot twist is at least darkly funny. For example, in 'Time Enough at Last' ... The [[Nuclear weapon|H-bomb]] is still lurking in the background of the bookworm's 'accident.' The point is that the bomb could never have gone off on network television were the plot couched in a more realistic format.}}

In the era of the [[Internet]] and [[eBook]]s, the irony depicted in "Time Enough at Last" has an [[information age]] counterpart, according to [[Weston Ochse]] of ''Storytellers Unplugged''. As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be "only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis at the end of the world"—that is, a [[power outage]] has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the [[computer]].&lt;ref name="ochse" /&gt;

===Similar episodes===
''The Twilight Zone'' often explored similar themes throughout its run.&lt;ref name="nostalgia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/drama/twilightzone.htm |title=The Twilight Zone |work=Nostalgia Central }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Time Enough at Last" has strong thematic ties to a number of other episodes in the series, starting with that of isolation, first explored in the series [[Television pilot|pilot]], "[[Where Is Everybody?]]".  It is also a prominent theme in the previous episode "[[The Lonely (The Twilight Zone)|The Lonely]]". Additionally, in a plot very similar to that of "Time Enough at Last", "[[The Mind and the Matter]]" tells of a man who uses his mind to erase humanity, only to find that  existence without other people is unbearable. The notion of being an outsider, lost in a sea of [[conformity]], was one of the most common themes of the series.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt;

Other thematic elements in this episode can be found throughout the series, as well. "[[The Obsolete Man]]" takes the episode's literary subtext—the notion that reading may eventually be considered "obsolete"—to an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own [[obsolescence]]. This notion, akin to [[Ray Bradbury]]'s short story "[[The Pedestrian]]" (1951), is also alluded to in the episode "[[Number 12 Looks Just Like You]]", in which a perfect and equal world contradictorily considers works like those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] "smut".&lt;ref name="backstage" /&gt;

===Amusement park attractions===
*[[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror]], a theme park ride at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] and formerly [[Disney California Adventure Park]], displays a replica of Henry Bemis' broken glasses in the lobby. It is noted that, while they are indeed reading glasses, Burgess Meredith wears them the entire episode to make Bemis look more bookish.&lt;ref name="ride"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emuck.com/aotw/tower.htm |author1=Bruce A Metcalf |author2=Ronnie O'Rourke |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Twilight Zone Tower of Terror or, Iago &amp; Zazu Learn the Ups &amp; Downs of the Hotel Business |work=Iago &amp; Zazu's Attraction of the Week |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928212510/http://www.emuck.com/aotw/tower.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
The comic book version of ''The Simpsons'', ''Simpsons Comics'', published a story called "The Last Fat Man", based partially on "Time Enough at Last", and includes a short scene where [[Homer Simpson]] shoos a bespectacled man who is reading a book out of a nuclear bunker so he can eat in it, unintentionally taking shelter in it.

===Film===
*In ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' (1983), [[Albert Brooks]] recounts the episode to [[Dan Aykroyd]] as they drive along an empty stretch of highway. "This thing freaked me out when I was 7 years old," says Brooks' character, adding: "I bought another pair of glasses just in case that would happen." 
*The episode's title was borrowed by a 2004 [[independent film]] about a man who tries to escape an office building. The film's official website listed the [[webmaster]]'s e-mail alias as "&lt;tt&gt;rodserling&lt;/tt&gt;".&lt;ref name="2004film"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time-enough.com/home.html |title=Time Enough at Last |publisher=Clock's Ticking Films |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games===
*The [[personal computer|PC]] game ''[[Fallout Tactics]]'' (2001) includes a librarian in a desolate world who wants the player to find his missing glasses so he can read his books.&lt;ref name="fallout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/fallouttactics/walkthrough/macomb.php |title=Fallout Tactics |work=Game Banshee |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
*The episode's title was borrowed by a song on [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]'s 1992 album ''[[Code: Selfish]]'' (1992)

===Television===
[[Image:Scary Door Time Enough.jpg|thumb|upright=1.136|alt=A man yelling as his hands and eyes have fallen off.|An episode of ''The Scary Door'' in ''[[Futurama]]'' parodies "Time Enough at Last".]]
*The ''[[Modern Family]]'' episode "Airport 2010" references "Time Enough at Last" when the screen on Jay's electronic reader gets broken. Jay pours the broken glass to the floor while saying "Not fair. It's not fair".
*Episode 12 of [[Revolution (TV series)|''Revolution'']], titled "Ghosts", has Jim Hudson's character who goes by the name of Henry Bemis. Henry (Jim) has become the town librarian, until Miles convinces him to help the rebels and go back to his real name.
*The line, "Seconds, minutes, hours, they crawl by on hands and knees" was referenced to in ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' Season 2 episode, "Speed Demon", where the villain, HIM, torments the Powerpuff Girls before revealing that they have unknowingly arrived 50 years into the future, landing in a Townsville that HIM now controls.
*In the season 14 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Strong Arms of the Ma]]", a postman is accidentally trapped under a car in front of the Simpson house. He intends to read ''The Twilight Zone Magazine'' but discovers that his glasses were broken in the accident while the ''Twilight Zone'' main-theme music is heard in the background.
*''The Scary Door'', a [[show-within-a-show]] on ''[[Futurama]]'' parodying ''The Twilight Zone'', pokes fun at the final twist in "Time Enough at Last". When the man in the episode loses his glasses, he realizes he can still read large print since his eyesight is not as bad as he perceived; his eyes fall out, but he declares he can read [[Braille]]; his hands fall off, and as he screams, his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] comments, "Cursed by his own [[hubris]]."
*The ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Wasted Talent]]" features an end scene similar to the ending of "Time Enough At Last". In the ''Family Guy'' version, a lone brain cell discovers it is the last of its kind (as Peter drank so much alcohol throughout the episode that Brian worries that Peter may have killed his brain cells), and with a book in hand and stacks of other books surrounding him, prepares to begin reading, but looks down and his glasses shatter, after which, dismayed, he picks them up and says " No! It's not fair! There was finally going to be TIME!...", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis.
*The closing credits of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', season 5, episode 1, "Y2K, You're OK", include a parody of the final scene, where Drew is left alone in his bomb shelter with his "literature", in this case pornographic magazines, after the nuclear explosion, only to have his glasses break in the same manner, whereupon he repeated the final lines from Burgess Meredith.
*In the ''[[Fear the Walking Dead]]'' episode "Buried" (Season 4, Episode 4), Nick and Luciana are scavenging in an abandoned library when they see, amid a trail of bloodied books on the floor, a pair of broken spectacles that resemble those belonging to Henry Bemis in "Time Enough At Last." Nearby, they see a zombie who, as a human, had slashed his own wrists, presumably because he could no longer read once his glasses broke.

==Adaptations==
"Time Enough at Last" has been released in numerous formats over the years. 
*In 1988 it was available on [[VHS]] as part of a ''Twilight Zone'' collector's edition.&lt;ref name="1988vhs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BUICWC/ |title=The Twilight Zone |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16289">'''Unbundled legal services''', also known as '''limited scope representation''' and '''discrete task representation''', is a method of [[legal representation]] in the [[United States]] in which an [[lawyer|attorney]] and client agree to limit the scope of the attorney’s involvement in a [[lawsuit]] or other legal action, leaving responsibility for those other aspects of the case to the client in order to save the client money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/civil/definitions.shtml#u New York City Civil Court: Definitions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directlaw.com/UnBundlinglegalservices.asp What are "Unbundled" Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zorza.net/resources/Ethics/mosten-borden.htm Unbundled Legal Services - mosten and borden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

Unbundled legal services are employed as an attempt to lower costs for the client by reducing the amount of time an attorney spends – and therefore the amount the attorney bills –  on a legal matter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqEfql2bKcM YouTube video]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[American Bar Association]] study estimates that "fewer than three in ten of the legal problems of low-income households are brought to the justice system and only four in ten for moderate income households."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reese, American Bar Ass’n, (1994).|first=Roy W.|author2=Carolyn A. Eldred |title=Legal Needs Among Low-Income and Moderate-Income Households: Summary of Findings from the Comprehensive Legal Needs Study 22|journal=American Bar Association|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[New York State Bar Association]], "[u]nbundling is seen as a way to increase legal access for middle income consumers..." "Clients find [[unbundling]] attractive because it saves money and gives them more control over the process and strategy decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New York State|first=Bar Association|title=Report and Recommendations on "Unbundled" Legal Services|url=http://www.nysba.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Substantive_Reports&amp;ContentID=2736&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm|work=Commission on Providing Access to Legal Services for Middle Income Consumers|accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unbundled attorneys are more likely to offer flat fee pricing to complete tasks, as opposed to the more common practice of hourly billing by full-service attorneys. Depending on the [[jurisdiction]], they may provide [[legal ghostwriting]] services, that is, drafting legal documents on behalf of the client without formally appearing before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solopracticeuniversity.com/2010/02/08/the-future-middle-class-of-the-legal-profession-unbundled-legal-services-2/ The Future 'Middle Class' of the Legal Profession – Unbundled Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
They may offer legal coaching to clients who plan to represent themselves [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|''pro se'']] in the courtroom. Or they might do the opposite, agreeing that clients handle their lawsuits up until the trial phase, at which point the attorney takes over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.martindale.com/an-a-ha-moment-the-emergence-of-unbundled-legal-services An A-Ha Moment: The Emergence of Unbundled Legal Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution ==

The phrase “unbundled legal services” has been attributed to [[UCLA]] law professor [[Forrest S. Mosten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.ucla.edu/faculty/all-faculty-profiles/adjunctslecturers/Pages/forrest-s-mosten.aspx Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, “Woody” Mosten wrote “Unbundling Legal Services: A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte,” which was published by the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostenmediation.com/books/unbundlinglegal.html Unbundling Legal Services | A Guide to Delivering Legal Services a la Carte | Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosten, a California attorney, specializes in family law and divorce mediation. Throughout his career he has emphasized the importance of access to justice, which likely contributed to his involvement in promoting unbundled legal services. Mosten has received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Innovations in Legal Access from the ABA Section of Delivery of Legal Services, and the Lawyer as Problem Solver Award from the ABA Section on Dispute Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostenmediation.com/bio.html Mediation Expert | High Conflict Mediations | Beverly Hills Mediator | Forrest S. Mosten&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2017, Mosten's "Unbundled Legal Services: A Family Lawyer's Guide" (co-written with Elizabeth Potter Scully), reflecting years of changes and development in the unbundling field, was also published by the American Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/store/productdetails.aspx?productid=277398039|title=Unbundled Legal Services: A Family Lawyer's Guide|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also recently a guest on the [https://www.unbundledattorney.com/podcast/episodes/93998 Unbundled Attorney Mastermind Podcast] discussing the history and future of unbundled legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unbundledattorney.com/podcast/episodes/93998|title=Episode: A Discussion with Forrest “Woody” Mosten, the Founder of Unbundled Legal Services: Exploring the History and Exciting Future of Unbundling|work=Unbundled Attorney|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Divorce in the United States|Divorce]] is an area of law that can lend itself to unbundling particularly well, and the development of unbundled legal services has grown largely out of the family law field. Another California family law attorney, M. Sue Talia, helped popularize unbundled legal services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pli.edu/Content.aspx?dsNav=Rpp:1,N:4294933685-168&amp;ID=PE674962 Faculty Profile - M. Sue Talia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Building upon Mosten’s work, Talia wrote several publications designed to help clients get the most out of unbundling.

Largely because of the advocacy by Mosten and Talia, among others, for the adoption of unbundled legal services by mainstream lawyers, which also emphasized new ethical guidelines for unbundling while maintaining the established rules, the California State Bar formally recognized unbundled legal services as a legitimate and important practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=California|first=State Bar of|title=Limited Scope Legal Assistance (Unbundling) Resolution|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1264452611.64/Limited%20Scope%20Legal%20Assistance%20Resolution.pdf|work=Board of Governors of the State Bar of California May 15, 2009 Meeting|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states soon followed [[California]]’s lead in officially permitting unbundled legal services. With its growing acceptance in the legal profession, unbundled legal services began to evolve into other areas of law. Unbundled attorneys also began combining this new representation technique with emerging technologies such as teleconferencing and cloud computing. One of the early adopters of [[e-lawyering]] has been North Carolina lawyer Stephanie Kimbro, who implemented a “[[virtual law firm|virtual law office]]” in 2006 when she focused her practice on estate planning and business law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Solo Practice|title=Syllabus|url=http://solopracticeuniversity.com/faculty/kimbro/|work=Virtual Law Office Online Course|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimbro has since expanded her practice but continues to deliver her services solely by virtual office. She received an ABA Award for Excellence in eLawyering in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Bar|first=Association|title=The Business of Practicing Law|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/law_practice_home/law_practice_archive/lpm_magazine_articles_v37_is1_pg28.html|work=So You Want to Start a Virtual Practice?|publisher=ABA|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last areas of unbundled legal services to be embraced by state bar associations has been legal ghostwriting. Legal ghostwriting usually entails an attorney drafting a legal document –  such as a summons and complaint, an answer or an appellate brief – on behalf of a client. The client maintains responsibility for the other aspects of the lawsuit, such as filing, corresponding with the court and opposing counsel and generally prosecuting their case. Under this agreement, the attorney [[ghostwriter]] is not the attorney of record. Instead, the client appears in the action ''pro se'', meaning they represent themselves. The unbundled attorney might in this case inform the court of their assistance drafting the document.

In 2007 the ABA relaxed its professional ethical rules to expressly permit unbundled legal services and legal ghostwriting in Rule 1.2(c).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, the New York County Law Association echoed the ABA opinion by formally giving its blessing to the practice of legal ghostwriting as consistent with the state bar’s ethical rules.  The NYCLA Ethics Committee on Professional Ethics in its Opinion 742 stated that “…it is now ethically permissible for an attorney, with the informed consent of his or her client, to play a limited role and prepare pleadings and other submissions for a ''[[pro se]]'' litigant without disclosing the lawyer’s participation to the tribunal and adverse counsel. Disclosure of the fact that a pleading or submission was prepared by counsel need only be made ‘where necessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Professional Ethics|first=NYCLA Committee on|title=Opinion 742|url=http://www.nycla.org/siteFiles/Publications/Publications1348_0.pdf|work=NYCLA Publications|publisher=New York City Lawyers' Association|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain jurisdictions have called for the implementation of clinics in law schools to teach unbundling legal services to students in a practical setting, and to encourage future lawyers to use the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klempner|first=Rochelle|title=Unbundled Legal Services in Litigated Matters in New York State|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ip/partnersinjustice/Unbundled.pdf|work=A Proposal To Test the Efficacy through Law School Clinics|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Opponents of unbundled legal services often cite ethical concerns about the [[professional responsibility]] of a lawyer for his or her client. For one, an attorney owes the court a "[[duty of candor]]" in his or her dealings with the court. By working on a lawsuit on behalf of a client but failing to appear, some courts have held this duty is violated.&lt;ref&gt;Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268, 1271-73 (10th Cir. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, full-service attorneys handle all aspects of a case and can be [[liable]] for [[legal malpractice]] should they be [[negligent]] in their representation of clients. Critics claim that, should an attorney limit the scope of his or her representation of a client, they might escape a malpractice claim despite having committed malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis v. Maine, 448 F.2d 1325 (1st Cir. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Some fear that a lack of communication between lawyer and client can lead to confusion about who is responsible for what, and that important issues of a client's case can fall through the cracks.

State bar associations and courts have split on the ethics of unbundling when it comes to legal ghostwriting. Some jurisdictions have ruled that ghostwriting by attorneys is prohibited, claiming that failing to disclose their assistance to a self-represented client would be misleading to the court and their adversary in the lawsuits. Others oppose legal ghostwriting because they believe it would allow an attorney to evade responsibility for a [[frivolous lawsuit]] filed by their client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ethics and Professional Responsibility|first=Standing Committee on|title=Formal Opinion 07-446|url=http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|work=Undisclosed Legal Assistance to Pro Se Litigant|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=15 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211554/http://www.nlada.org/DMS/Documents/1185213796.98/ABA%20ghostwriting%20opinion%206-07.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain critics have argued that legal ghostwriting actually gives the self-represented litigant an unfair advantage over his or her adversary, even when that adversary has an attorney. The reason for this is that judges have had a history of giving pro se litigants more leeway in the courtroom to make up for their lack of experience. For example, a person appearing pro se might be allowed to fix a procedural error but had a lawyer had made the same mistake, their error would have led to some adverse consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 2.2, Comment [4] (adopted February 2007) (“It is not a violation of this Rule [requiring impartiality and fairness] for a judge to make reasonable accommodations to ensure pro se litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard.”)&lt;/ref&gt; When a self-represented litigant uses an attorney as a ghostwriter, critics argue he or she should not be entitled to any special treatment. However, proponents of legal ghostwriting point out that while judges might grant certain flexibility to ''pro se'' clients on procedural matters, no judge would rule in favor of a party simply because they lacked an attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt|first=Jona|title=In Defense of Ghostwriting|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=2002|pages=1145, 1157–1158|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6562/is_3_29/ai_n28916491/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid the potential for this unfair advantage, some jurisdictions, like New York, require an attorney to disclose in papers submitted to the court that they were prepared by an attorney, but attorneys are not required to disclose their name or firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unified Court System|first=New York State|title=Rule 1.2(c)|url=http://www.nysba.org/Content/NavigationMenu/ForAttorneys/ProfessionalStandardsforAttorneys/NYRulesofProfessionalConduct4109.pdf|work=Rules of Professional Conduct|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many jurisdictions look at the intent of the attorney for his legal ghostwriting. Where an attorney used the ghostwriting technique to avoid disclosing that he was not admitted in the state where the case was filed, it may be ruled [[legal ethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;Warner v. Reiter, 2010 WL 3987434 (N.D. Cal.)&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] have been amended to allow for legal ghostwriting where the attorney merely intends to offer unbundled legal services to a client.

Another ethical concern concerning unbundled legal services is that it leads to the [[commoditization]] of law. Rather than treating the law as a profession, critics believe unbundling might lead to a factory-like approach, where cases are treated with a "one-size-fits-all" approach.

However, [[Richard Susskind]] in his 2008 book "The End of Lawyers: Rethinking the Nature of Legal Services," argues that, as technology progresses, lawyers might have no choice but to move toward commoditization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.susskind.com/endoflawyers.html Richard Susskind&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of do-it-yourself companies that sell blank legal documents like [[LegalZoom]], lawyers must compete with new low-cost options. Further driving down attorney fees has been [[outsourcing]], where attorneys educated in American law but not necessarily licensed in any state provide services to law firms at reduced rates.

'''Virtual Reference Station''' (VRS) networks use [[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic]] (RTK) solutions to provide high-accuracy, RTK [[Global navigation satellite system|Global Navigation Satellite Systems]].

To reach centimeter-level — or even better — accuracy of positioning typically requires use of precise dual-frequency carrier phase observations. Furthermore, these observations are usually processed using a differential GNSS (DGNSS) algorithm, such as real time kinematic (RTK) or post-processing (PP). Regardless of the specific differential algorithm, however, implicit in the process is an assumption that the quality of the reference station data is consistent with the desired level of positioning accuracy.

The virtual reference station (VRS) concept can help to satisfy this requirement using a network of reference stations. As a quick review, a typical DGNSS setup consists of a single reference station from which the raw data (or corrections) are sent to the rover receiver (i.e., the user). The user then forms the carrier phase differences (or corrects their raw data) and performs the data processing using the differential corrections.

In contrast, GNSS network architectures often make use of multiple reference stations. This approach allows a more precise modeling of distance-dependent systematic errors principally caused by ionospheric and tropospheric refractions, and satellite orbit errors. More specifically, a GNSS network decreases the dependence of the error budget on the distance of nearest antenna.

'''Voice''' is a term used in [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] to characterize [[speech sound]]s (usually [[consonants]]). It is also called "voicing". Speech sounds can be described as either [[voicelessness|voiceless]] (also called unvoiced) or voiced.

The term, however, is used to refer to two separate concepts:
*Voicing can refer to the ''articulatory process'' in which the vocal folds vibrate, its primary use in [[phonetics]] to describe phones, which are particular speech sounds. 
*It can also refer to a classification of speech sounds that tend to be associated with vocal cord vibration but may not actually be voiced at the articulatory level. That is the term's primary use in [[phonology]]: to describe [[phoneme]]s; while in phonetics its primary use is to describe phones.

At the articulatory level, a '''voiced''' sound is one in which the [[vocal folds]] vibrate, and a voiceless sound is one in which they do not.

For example, voicing accounts for the difference between the pair of sounds associated with the English letters "s" and "z". The two sounds are transcribed as {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[z]}} to distinguish them from the English letters, which have several possible pronunciations, depending on the context. If one places the fingers on the voice box (i.e. the location of the [[Adam's apple]] in the upper throat), one can feel a [[oscillation|vibration]] while ''zzzz'' is pronounced but not with ''ssss''. (For a more detailed, technical explanation, see [[modal voice]] and [[phonation]].) In most [[European languages]], with a notable exception being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[vowel]]s and other [[sonorant]]s (consonants such as ''m, n, l,'' and ''r)'' are [[modal voice|modally voiced]].

When used to classify speech sounds, '''voiced''' and '''unvoiced''' are merely labels used to group [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] and [[phoneme]]s together for the purposes of classification.

==Notation==

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] has distinct letters for many voiceless and voiced pairs of consonants (the [[obstruent]]s), such as {{IPA|[p b], [t d], [k ɡ], [q ɢ]}}. In addition, there is a diacritic for voicedness: ⟨{{IPA|&amp;#x25cc;&amp;#x032C;}}⟩. Diacritics are typically used with letters for prototypically voiceless sounds.

In [[Unicode]], the symbols are encoded {{unichar|032C|COMBINING CARON BELOW|html=|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}} and {{unichar|0325|COMBINING RING BELOW|html=|cwith=&amp;#x25cc;}}.

The [[extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet]] have a notation for partial voicing and devoicing as well as for [[prevoicing]]:

{| class="wikitable"

! colspan=4|Partial (de)voicing&lt;ref&gt;The parentheses should appear under the letter, but that is not fully supported by Unicode. As of version 8.0, only central voicing and devoicing, {{IPA|[s̬&amp;#x1ABD;]}} and {{IPA|[z̥&amp;#x1ABD;]}}, is encoded.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-

Partial voicing can mean light but continuous voicing, discontinuous voicing, or discontinuities in the degree of voicing. For the example, {{IPA|₍s̬₎}} could be an [s] with (some) voicing in the middle and {{IPA|₍z̥₎}} could be [z] with (some) devoicing in the middle.

Partial voicing can also be indicated in the normal IPA with transcriptions like {{IPA|[ᵇb̥iˑ]}} and {{IPA|[ædᵈ̥]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Kretzschmar (1993) ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/415977 Handbook of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States]'', University of Chicago Press, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English==
The distinction between the articulatory use of voice and the phonological use rests on the distinction between [[phone (phonetics)|phone]] (represented between square brackets) and [[phoneme]] (represented between slashes). The difference is best illustrated by a rough example.

The English word ''nods'' is made up of a sequence of phonemes, represented symbolically as {{IPA|/nɒdz/}}, or the sequence of {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/z/}}. Each symbol is an abstract representation of a phoneme. That awareness is an inherent part of speakers' mental grammar that allows them to recognise words.

However, phonemes are not sounds in themselves. Rather, phonemes are, in a sense, converted to phones before being spoken. The {{IPA|/z/}} phoneme, for instance, can actually be pronounced as either the {{IPA|[s]}} phone or the {{IPA|[z]}} phone since {{IPA|/z/}} is frequently devoiced, even in fluent speech, especially at the end of an utterance. The sequence of phones for ''nods'' might be transcribed as {{IPA|[nɒts]}} or {{IPA|[nɒdz]}}, depending on the presence or strength of this devoicing. While the {{IPA|[z]}} phone has articulatory voicing, the {{IPA|[s]}} phone does not have it.

What complicates the matter is that for English, consonant phonemes are classified as either voiced or voiceless even though it is not the primary distinctive feature between them. Still, the classification is used as a stand-in for phonological processes, such as vowel lengthening that occurs before voiced consonants but not before unvoiced consonants or vowel quality changes (the sound of the vowel) in some dialects of English that occur before unvoiced but not voiced consonants. Such processes allow English speakers to continue to perceive difference between voiced and voiceless consonants when the devoicing of the former would otherwise make them sound identical to the latter.

English has four pairs of [[fricative]] phonemes that can be divided into a table by [[place of articulation]] and voicing. The voiced fricatives can readily be felt to have voicing throughout the duration of the phone especially when they occur between vowels.

{|class="wikitable"

|-
|Pronounced with the tongue bunched up:
|{{IPA|[ʃ]}} ''(Confu'''ci'''an)''
|{{IPA|[ʒ]}} ''(confu'''si'''on)''
|}

However, in the class of consonants called [[stop consonant|stop]]s, such as {{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, ɡ/}}, the contrast is more complicated for English. The "voiced" sounds do not typically feature articulatory voicing throughout the sound. The difference between the unvoiced stop phonemes and the voiced stop phonemes is not just a matter of whether articulatory voicing is present or not. Rather, it includes [[voice onset time|when voicing starts]] (if at all), the presence of [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] (airflow burst following the release of the closure) and the duration of the closure and aspiration.

English voiceless stops are generally aspirated at the beginning of a stressed syllable, and in the same context, their voiced counterparts are voiced only partway through.  In more narrow phonetic transcription, the voiced symbols are maybe used only to represent the presence of articulatory voicing, and aspiration is represented with a superscript ''h''.

|-
|Pronounced with the back of the tongue against the palate:
|{{IPA|[k]}} ('''''c'''oat'')
|{{IPA|[ɡ]}} ('''''g'''oat'')
|}

When the consonants come at the end of a syllable, however, what distinguishes them is quite different. Voiceless phonemes are typically unaspirated, [[glottalization|glottalized]] and the closure itself may not even be released, making it sometimes difficult to hear the difference between, for example, ''light'' and ''like''. However, auditory cues remain to distinguish between voiced and voiceless sounds, such as what has been described above, like the length of the preceding vowel.

Other English sounds, the vowels and sonorants, are normally fully voiced. However, they may be devoiced in certain positions, especially after aspirated consonants, as in ''c'''o'''ffee'', ''t'''r'''ee'', and ''p'''l'''ay'' in which the voicing is delayed to the extent of missing the sonorant or vowel altogether.

==Degrees of voicing==
{{sidebar| navbar = off

| content2 = 0 [[Tenuis consonant|Tenuis]]
| content3 = − Voiced
}}

There are two variables to degrees of voicing: intensity (discussed under [[phonation]]), and duration (discussed under [[voice onset time]]). When a sound is described as "half voiced" or "partially voiced", it is not always clear whether that means that the voicing is weak (low intensity) or if the voicing occurs during only part of the sound (short duration). In the case of English, it is the latter.

[[Juǀʼhoansi]] and some of the neighboring languages are typologically unusual in having contrastive partially voiced consonants. They have aspirate and [[ejective]] consonants, which are normally incompatible with voicing, in voiceless and voiced pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Consonants that are called "voiced aspirate" normally have [[breathy voice]], not voiceless aspiration, as in Juǀʼhoansi, [[Taa language|Taa]] and similar languages.&lt;/ref&gt; The consonants start out voiced but become voiceless partway through, allow normal aspiration or ejection. They are {{IPA|[b͡pʰ, d͡tʰ, d͡tsʰ, d͡tʃʰ, ɡ͡kʰ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡tsʼ, d͡tʃʼ]}} and a similar series of clicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|63, 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice and tenseness==
There are languages with two sets of contrasting [[obstruent]]s that are labelled {{IPA|/p t k f s x …/}} vs. {{IPA|/b d ɡ v z ɣ …/}} even though there is no involvement of voice (or voice onset time) in that contrast. That happens, for instance, in several [[Alemannic German]] dialects. Because voice is not involved, this is explained as a contrast in [[tenseness]], called a [[fortis and lenis]] contrast.

There is a hypothesis that the contrast between fortis and lenis consonants is related to the contrast between voiceless and voiced consonants. That relation is based on sound perception as well as on sound production, where consonant voice, tenseness and [[gemination|length]] are only different manifestations of a common sound feature.

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.
The [[anthropologist]] and writer on religion and [[post-colonial studies]] [[Talal Asad]] has said ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' is a modern classic and a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talal Asad]] (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697 ''Reading a Modern Classic: W.
