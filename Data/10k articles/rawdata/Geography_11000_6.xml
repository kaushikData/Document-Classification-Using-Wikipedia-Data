      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4797">The '''Bibliography of Aeolian Research''' (BAR) is a comprehensive bibliography focused on the study of the detachment, transport, and deposition of sediments by wind.&lt;ref name=BAR&gt;{{Citation | last =Warren | first = A. | last2 = Gill | first2 = T.E. | last3 = Stout | first3 = J.E. | title = Bibliography of Aeolian Research |publisher = USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Lubbock, Texas | url = https://www.lbk.ars.usda.gov/wewc/biblio/bar.htm | accessdate = 2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeolian research is a sub-discipline of the physical sciences that focuses on the activity of the winds, with an emphasis on the winds' ability to interact with and shape the surface of the Earth and other planets.&lt;ref name=Stout&gt;{{Citation| last = Stout| first = J.E.| last2 = Warren| first2 = A.| last3 = Gill| first3 = T.E.| title =Publication trends in aeolian research: an analysis of the Bibliography of Aeolian Research| journal =Geomorphology| volume =105| issue =1-2| pages =6–17| year =2009| doi =10.1016/j.geomorph.2008.02.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeolian research spans a broad array of disciplines and may include the study of [[aeolian processes]] and associated [[aeolian landform]]s, aeolian deposits, and sedimentary features; the study of [[wind erosion]] and its control by [[tillage]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Windbreak|shelterbelts]], and other management practices; and the study of [[mineral dust]], [[dust storm]]s and the effects of [[Particulates|fine particulate matter]] on [[climate]] and [[air quality]].

An extensive Bibliography of Aeolian Research (BAR) was constructed that contains references to every known scientific manuscript published in the field of aeolian research from 1646 to 2015.&lt;ref name=BAR/&gt; The BAR contains over 43,000 bibliographic citations.

As with most bibliographies, the Bibliography of Aeolian Research has benefited from past bibliographies.  The BAR lists more than forty-five bibliographies that focus on at least one aspect of aeolian research and parts of these have been incorporated into the BAR.  Older bibliographies are especially important because they provide a record of early publications.  The oldest bibliography incorporated into the BAR is the ''Bibliography of Meteorology'' compiled by [[Oliver Lanard Fassig|Oliver Fassig]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Fassig | first =O.L. | title =Bibliography of Meteorology | publisher =United States of America War Department, Signal Office, Washington DC | year = 1889 | pages =475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citations have also been extracted from the Bibliography of Eolian Geology prepared for the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] by Conrad Stuntz and Edward Free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Stuntz | first =S.C. | last2 =Free | first2 =E.E. | title =Bibliography of Eolian Geology. In: Free, E.E. (ed), The movement of soil material by wind | publisher =United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Soils, Washington DC | volume =Bulletin 68 | year = 1911 | pages =174–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important bibliographies that have been incorporated into the BAR include two online bibliographies that were maintained by Andrew Warren of [[University College London]] titled ''A Bibliography of Wind Erosion and Related Phenomena'' and ''A Bibliography of Desert Dunes and Associated Phenomena''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Warren | first =A. | title = A Bibliography of Desert Dunes and Associated Phenomena. In: McGinnies, W.G. and Goldman, B.J. (eds), Arid Lands in Perspective | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington D.C. and Tucson: University of Arizona Press | year = 1969 | pages =75–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bibliography of Aeolian Research contains more citations extracted from these two bibliographies than from any other source.  Citations were also obtained from a monthly internet posting called ''Aeolian Papers of the Month'', a list of published papers compiled each month from 1996-2001 by Thomas Gill at the [[Texas Tech University]].

Editors Andrew Warren, John Stout and Thomas Gill collected bibliographic citations by searching databases and extracting citations from recent publications.&lt;ref name=BAR/&gt; New entries included citations to scholarly articles, books, theses, dissertations, and reports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">The '''Blue River Provincial Park''' (French: ''Parc provincial de la Rivière Bleue'') is a [[nature reserve]] in [[Yaté]] Commune, [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]], [[New Caledonia]].

== Geography ==
[[Image:Lac de Yaté 04.jpg|thumb|left|View of Yaté Lake]]

The Blue River Provincial Park is part of the larger (15,900ha) Upper Yaté fauna reserve.  The Park covers the basins of the Blue, White, and Month of May Rivers, the latter two of which have drained into Yaté Lake since the construction of the Yaté Dam in 1958.  Part of the banks and the length of the lake are in the park, including a large drowned forest.  The altitude varies from 160 to 1,250 metres.

The hydrography and the nature of the terrain lead to the presence of several waterfalls, water holes, and [[potholes|giant's kettle]] in the Blue River valley.

== Biodiversity ==
[[Image:Cagou.jpg|thumb|right|A [[kagu]] in the park]]

The park includes two [[biome]]s typical of New Caledonia: [[maquis shrubland]] overlying [[peridotite]] rock and [[tropical rainforest]].  There is a very high rate of [[endemism|biodiversity of New Caledonia]].  In particular, the park is known for being one of the last areas where the [[kagu]], an endangered bird which has become a symbol of the country, can be seen in its natural habitat, with a population of about 700; this is the largest single population of the species in the wild.  Other endemic and rare animals in the park include the [[crow honeyeater]], [[Goliath imperial pigeon|notou]], [[New Caledonian crow]], and [[crested gecko]].

The park contains a thousand-year-old, forty-metre-tall giant [[Agathis lanceolata]] tree, one of the largest known in New Caledonia.  There are also wild [[carnivorous plants]] (''[[Drosera neocaledonica]]'' and ''[[Nepenths vieillardii]]'') and [[orchid]]s.

== History ==

Human settlement in the park is prehistoric; [[petroglyph]]s can be found in the Blue River valley.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, forestry and chrome mining led to the development of modern transport infrastructure, much of which is still in place; there are still 36km of railways for transporting logs and ore, a [[traction engine]] winch and the Pérignon bridge, made of local wood, which crosses the branch of the lake created in the White River in 1958.  The construction of the [[Yaté Dam]] the same year made major changes to the terrain.  The park was founded in 1980 and came under the responsibility of the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] when the [[provinces of New Caledonia]] were created in 1989.

== Recreation and tourist infrastructure ==

The [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] initiated the development of the park in 1998 in response to increasing visitor numbers with the goals of protecting nature, educating visitors about the environment and of further attracting tourists.  A "Maison du Parc" was thus inaugurated in 2002 at the main entrance, with an exhibition hall (containing a permanent display about the park since June 2003), a library, a conference room, a shop, archives, and storage rooms.  Areas set up for camping and picnics were set up along the rivers, as well as a network of walking and cycling trails.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 037.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]: ''[[The Land of Cockaigne (Bruegel)|Luilekkerland]]'' ("The Land of Cockaigne "), oil on panel (1567; [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]])]]

'''Cockaigne''' or '''Cockayne''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ˈ|k|eɪ|n}} is a [[Mythical place|land of plenty]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] myth, an [[Imagination|imaginary]] place of extreme luxury and ease where physical comforts and pleasures are always immediately at hand and where the harshness of medieval [[peasant]] life does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cockaigne, Land of|volume=6|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in poems like [[Land of Cockayne (poem)|''The Land of Cockaigne'']], it is a land of contraries, where all the restrictions of society are defied (abbots beaten by their monks), sexual liberty is open (nuns flipped over to show their bottoms), and food is plentiful (skies that rain cheeses). Writing about Cockaigne was a commonplace of [[Goliard]] verse.  It represented both wish fulfillment and resentment at the strictures of [[asceticism]] and death.

==Etymology==
While the first recorded uses of the word are the Latin ''Cucaniensis'', and the Middle English ''Cokaygne'', one line of reasoning has the name tracing to [[Middle French]] ''(pays de) cocaigne'' "(land of) plenty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lautrec.fr/tourisme/pastel.php?menu=3 |title=Le Pastel et le Pays de Cocagne |publisher=Lautrec.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505134056/http://www.lautrec.fr/tourisme/pastel.php?menu=3 |archivedate=2008-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately adapted or derived from a word for a small sweet cake sold to children at a fair (''[[OED]]''). In [[Ireland]] it was mentioned in the ''[[Kildare Poems]]'' composed c. 1350. In [[Italian language|Italian]], the same place is called ''Paese della Cuccagna''; the Flemish-Belgian equivalent is ''Luilekkerland'' ("relaxed luscious, delicious land"), translated from the Middle-Belgian word ''Cockaengen'', and the German equivalent is ''Schlaraffenland''. In Spanish an equivalent place is named ''[[Jauja]]'', after a rich mining region of the Andes, and ''País de Cucaña'' ("fools' paradise") may also signify such a place. From Swedish dialect ''lubber'' ("fat lazy fellow") comes ''Lubberland'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630212437/http://home.comcast.net/~wwftd/archives.html Today's wwftd is...], at ''Worthless words for the day'', by Michael A. Fischer.&lt;/ref&gt; popularized in the ballad ''[[An Invitation to Lubberland]]''. 

In the 1820s, the name ''Cockaigne'' came to be applied jocularly to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' notes a first usage in 1824.&lt;/ref&gt; as the land of [[Cockney]]s ("Cockney" from a "cock's egg", an implausible creature; see also [[basilisk]]), though the two are not linguistically connected otherwise. The composer [[Edward Elgar]] used the word "Cockaigne" for his [[symphonic poem|concert overture]] and suite evoking the people of London, ''[[Cockaigne (In London Town)]]'', Op. 40 (1901).

The Dutch villages of [[Kockengen]] and [[Koekange]] were named after Cockaigne. The surname Cockayne also derives from the mythical land, and was originally a nickname for an idle dreamer.&lt;ref name=Oxon&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, A. D.|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
[[Image:Schlaraffenland - no-nb krt 00932.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Accurata Utopiae Tabula'', an "accurate map of [[Utopia]]", [[Johann Baptist Homann]]'s map of Schlaraffenland published by [[Matthäus Seutter]], Augsburg 1730]]

Like [[Atlantis]] and [[El Dorado (myth)|El Dorado]], the land of Cockaigne was a utopia. It was a fictional place where, in a parody of paradise, idleness and gluttony were the principal occupations. In ''Specimens of Early English Poets'' (1790), [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis]] printed a 13th-century French poem called "The Land of Cockaigne" where "the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Wordsworth Editions | isbn = 9781840223101 | last = Brewer | first = Ebenezer Cobham | title = The Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | date = 2001-05-01 | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Pleij]], ''Dreaming of Cockaigne: Medieval Fantasies of the Perfect Life'' (2001):

{{quote|roasted pigs wander about with knives in their backs to make carving easy, where grilled geese fly directly into one's mouth, where cooked fish jump out of the water and land at one's feet.

==Traditions==
[[File:La cucaña.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]]: ''[[La cucaña]]'' ("The Greasy Pole", c. 1786)]]

A [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tradition, extended to other Latin-culture countries, is the [[Greasy pole|Cockaigne pole]] (Italian: cuccagna; Spanish: cucaña), a horizontal or vertical pole with a prize (like a [[ham]]) at one end. The pole is covered with grease or soap and planted during a festival. Then, daring people try to climb the slippery pole to get the prize. The crowd laughs at the often failed attempts to hold on to the pole.

'''Daylight saving time in the United States''' is the practice of setting the clock forward by one hour during the warmer part of the year, so that evenings have more daylight and mornings have less. Most areas of the [[United States]] observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST), the exceptions being [[Arizona]] (except for the [[Navajo]], who do observe daylight saving time on tribal lands),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/time/us/arizona-no-dst.html "Most of Exempt from Daylight Saving Time"], timeanddate.com. Retrieved February 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref name=USNO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/daylight_time.php|title=Daylight Time|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory]]|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|overseas territories]] of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. The [[Uniform Time Act|Uniform Time Act of 1966]] established the system of uniform Daylight Saving Time throughout the US.

In the U.S., daylight saving time starts on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November, with the time changes taking place at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time. With a [[mnemonic]] word play referring to seasons, clocks "spring forward, fall back"—that is, in springtime the clocks are moved forward from 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and in fall they are moved back from 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year.

The following table lists recent past and near future starting and ending dates of daylight saving time in the United States:

== History of DST in the United States ==

[[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed a form of daylight time in 1784. His essay, “An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost of Light”, written to the editor of ''The Journal of Paris'', observed that Parisians could save on candles by getting out of bed earlier in the morning, making use of the natural morning light instead.  Franklin's suggestion seems to have been more of a joke than a real proposal, and nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/history.html History of Daylight Saving Time], timeanddate.com; accesses 2017.03.05.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1916–1966: Early, inconsistent use ===
During [[World War I]], in an effort to conserve fuel, [[Germany]] began observing DST on May 1, 1916. The rest of Europe soon followed. The plan was not adopted in the United States until the [[1918 Standard Time Act|Standard Time Act of March 19, 1918]], which confirmed the existing [[Time in the United States|standard time zone]] system and set summer DST to begin on March 31, 1918 (reverting October 27).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editors|title=Clocks Change Tomorrow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/mobile/daylight-savings-1918.pdf?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur|accessdate=1 November 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=25 October 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war, overriding President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHAP. 51. An Act For the repeal of the daylight-saving law |url=http://www.legisworks.org/congress/66/publaw-40.pdf |format=pdf |author=66th U.S. Congress |website=Legis Works |accessdate=November 3, 2013}} ({{USStatute|66|40|41|280|1919|08|20}})&lt;/ref&gt; DST became a local option and was observed in some states until [[World War II]], when President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] instituted year-round DST, called "War Time", on February 9, 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AN ACT To promote the national security and defense by establishing daylight saving time |url=http://www.legisworks.org/congress/77/publaw-403.pdf |format=pdf |author=77th U.S. Congress |website=Legis Works |accessdate=November 3, 2013}} ({{USStatute|77|403|56|9|1942|01|20}})&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted until the last Sunday (the 30th) in September 1945. After 1945 many states and cities east of the [[Mississippi River]] (and mostly north of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Potomac River|Potomac]] rivers) adopted summer DST.&lt;ref name="crswikileak"&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS22284.txt Source: CRS Report to Congress] [[s:Congressional Research Service Report RS22284 Daylight Saving Time]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1945 to 1966 there was no federal law on daylight saving time, so localities could choose when it began and ended or drop it entirely. As of 1954, only [[California]] and [[Nevada]] had statewide DST west of the Mississippi, and only a few cities between Nevada and [[St. Louis]]. In the 1964 Official Railway Guide, 21 of the 48 contiguous states had no DST anywhere.

=== 1966–1972: Federal standard established ===
By 1962, the transportation industry found the lack of consistency confusing enough to push for federal regulation. The result was the [[Uniform Time Act]] of 1966 (P.L. 89-387). Beginning in 1967, the act mandated standard time within the established time zones and provided for advanced time: clocks would be advanced one hour beginning at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the last Sunday in April and turned back one hour at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the last Sunday in October. States were allowed to exempt themselves from DST as long as the entire state did so. If a state chose to observe DST, the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates. In 1967, [[Arizona]] and [[Michigan]] became the first states to exempt themselves from DST (Michigan would begin observing DST in 1972). In 1972, the act was amended (P.L. 92-267), allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within a different time zone. The newly created [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation (DOT)]] was given power to enforce the law. {{as of|2014}}, the following states and territories are not observing DST: Arizona, [[Hawaii]], [[American Samoa]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[American Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

=== 1973–1975: Year-round experiment ===
During the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] by the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OAPEC), in an effort to conserve fuel, Congress enacted a trial period of year-round DST (P.L. 93-182), beginning January 6, 1974, and ending April 27, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AN ACT To provide for daylight saving time on a year-round basis for a two-year trial period, ... |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg707.pdf |format=pdf |author=93rd U.S. Congress |website=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=2 November 2013}} ({{USStatute|93|182|87|707|1973|12|15}})&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was hotly debated. Those in favor pointed to increased daylight hours in the summer evening: more time for recreation, reduced lighting and heating demands, reduced crime, and reduced automobile accidents. The opposition was concerned about children leaving for school in the dark. The act was amended in October 1974 (P.L. 93-434) to return to standard time for the period beginning October 27, 1974, and ending February 23, 1975, when DST resumed. When the trial ended in 1975, the country returned to observing summer DST (with the aforementioned exceptions).&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

=== 1975–1986: Extension of daylight saving time ===
The DOT, evaluating the plan of extending DST into March, reported in 1975 that "modest overall benefits might be realized by a shift from the historic six-month DST (May through October) in areas of energy conservation, overall traffic safety and reduced violent crime." However, DOT also reported that these benefits were minimal and difficult to distinguish from seasonal variations and fluctuations in energy prices.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

Congress then asked the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] (NBS, today NIST) to evaluate the DOT report. Its report, "Review and Technical Evaluation of the DOT Daylight Saving Time Study" (April 1976), found no significant energy savings or differences in traffic fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4172|number=172|title=Daylight Saving Time Myths |accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did find statistically significant evidence of increased fatalities among school-age children in the mornings during the four-month period January–April 1974 as compared with the same period (non-DST) of 1973. NBS stated that it was impossible to determine, what, if any, of this increase was due to DST. When this data was compared between 1973 and 1974 for the months of March and April, no significant difference was found in fatalities among school-age children in the mornings.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

In 1986 Congress enacted P.L. 99-359, amending the [[Uniform Time Act]] by changing the beginning of DST to the first Sunday in April and having the end remain the last Sunday in October.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt; These start and end dates were in effect from 1987 to 2006. The time was adjusted at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. local time.

=== 2005–2009: Second extension ===
By the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], daylight saving time (DST) was extended in the United States beginning in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Act To ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and reliable energy |chapter=Sec. 110. Daylight Savings |chapter-url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-119/pdf/STATUTE-119-Pg594.pdf#page=22 |author=109th U.S. Congress |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=November 3, 2013}} ({{USStatute|109|58|119|594|2005|08|08}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; As from that year, DST begins on the second Sunday of March and ends on the first Sunday of November. In years when April 1 falls on Monday through Wednesday, these changes result in a DST period that is five weeks longer; in all other years the DST period is instead four weeks longer.&lt;ref name="dstt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Douma |first=Michael |url=http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/b.html |title=Daylight Saving Time&amp;nbsp;— When do we change our clocks? |year=2008 |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 daylight saving time ended at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. DST (0200) (1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ST) on Sunday, November 2, and in 2009 it began at 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. (3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. DST) on Sunday, March 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/physlab/div847/faq.cfm |title=Time and Frequency Division FAQ |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Section 110 of the Act, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] was required to study the impact of the 2007 DST extension no later than nine months after the change took effect. The report, released in October 2008, reported a nationwide electricity savings of 0.03% for the year of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Belzer |first=David B. |title=Impact of Extended Daylight Saving Time on National Energy Consumption |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=October 2008 |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/analysis/pdfs/epact_sec_110_edst_report_to_congress_2008.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518104926/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/analysis/pdfs/epact_sec_110_edst_report_to_congress_2008.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2008 study conducted by the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] for the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] found that the 2006 DST adoption in [[Indiana]] increased energy consumption in Indiana by an average of 1%. Although consumption for lighting dropped as a result of the DST adoption, consumption for heating and cooling increased by 2% to 4%. The cost to the average Indiana household of the DST adoption was determined to be $3.29 per year, for an aggregate cost of $1.7 million to $5.5 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lotchen |first=Matthew |title=Does Daylight Saving Time Save Energy? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in Indiana |publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]] |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w14429.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] has praised the extension of daylight saving under the 2005 law, which increased the amount of shopping and commerce from after work in evenings. In the golf industry, the group has noted exceptional increase in revenue of "$200 million in additional sales of golf clubs and greens fees".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The extension of daylight saving has also had a notable impact on [[Halloween]] and [[candy]] sales.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7779869|title=The Reasoning Behind Changing Daylight-Saving |work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=NPR |access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyoming Senator [[Michael Enzi]] and Michigan Representative [[Fred Upton]] advocated the extension from October into November especially to allow children to go [[trick-or-treating]] in more daylight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/time-shifts-backward-early-sunday-morning/article_3fe65d4c-82ca-599a-8a7e-e2585fa082f0.html|title=Time shifts backward early Sunday morning|last=Ast|first=William F., III|date=October 30, 2009|newspaper=[[The Herald-Palladium]] |location=St. Joseph, Michigan |access-date=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, the extension of daylight saving time in March and November has pushed back sunrise to as late as 8:30 am.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Procedure for modifications ==

=== Changing an area's time zone ===
Under the Standard Time Act of 1918, as amended by the [[Uniform Time Act]] of 1966, moving a state or an area within a state from one time zone to another requires a regulation issued by DOT. The governor or state legislature may initiate a request for the state or any part of the state; the highest elected officials in the county may make a request for that county. The standard in the statute for such decisions is the convenience of commerce in that area. The convenience of commerce is defined broadly to consider such circumstances as the shipment of goods within the community; the origin of television and radio broadcasts; the areas where most residents work, attend school, worship, or receive health care; the location of airports, railway, and bus stations; and the major elements of the community's economy.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

After receiving a request for altering a time zone, DOT determines whether it meets the requirement of minimum statutory criteria before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, soliciting public comment and scheduling a public hearing. Usually the hearing is held in the area requesting the change so that all affected parties can be represented. After the close of the comment period, the comments are reviewed and appropriate final action taken. If the Secretary agrees that the statutory requirement has been met, the change is instituted, usually at the next changeover to or from DST.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

=== Moving an area on or off DST ===
Under the [[Uniform Time Act]], moving an area on or off DST is accomplished through legal action at the state level. Some states require legislation while others require executive action such as a governor's executive order. Information on procedures required in a specific state may be obtained from that state's legislature or governor's office. Although it may exempt itself, if a state decides to observe DST, the dates of observance must comply with federal legislation.&lt;ref name="crswikileak" /&gt;

== Local DST observance ==

=== Alaska ===
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
[[Alaska]] observes DST. Due to its high latitude, Alaska has nearly round-the-clock daylight during summer, and DST is seen by some Alaskans as unnecessary and a nuisance. Another issue is that the Alaskan mainland's single [[time zone]], which approximates solar time in the capital, Juneau, leads to a large disparity between [[civil time]] and [[solar time]] for much of the state, with [[solar noon]] occurring as late as 2:10&amp;nbsp;p.m. in the population centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and as late as 3:23&amp;nbsp;p.m. in places such as [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]. In Fairbanks, for example, sunset occurs well after [[civil time|civil]] midnight in the summer. Others argue that ending daylight saving time will place Alaska as much as five hours from Eastern Daylight Time, making coordination of travel and phone conversations more difficult.

In March 2015 the Alaska Senate passed a bill, introduced by state senator [[Anna MacKinnon]], to end daylight saving time. The Alaska House formed a sub-committee that was due to look into the issue during the 2016 legislative session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moritz |first=Katie |date=April 10, 2015 |url=http://juneauempire.com/state/2015-04-09/clock-stopped-daylight-saving-time-repeal-now |title=Clock Stopped on Daylight Saving Time Repeal – For Now |newspaper=Juneau Empire |accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arizona ===
[[Arizona]] observed DST in 1967 under the [[Uniform Time Act]] because the [[Arizona Legislature|state legislature]] did not enact an exemption [[statute]] that year. In March 1968 the DST exemption [[statute]] was enacted and the state of Arizona has not observed DST since 1967. This is in large part due to an effort to [[conserve energy]]. [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are among the hottest U.S. metropolitan areas during the summer, resulting in more power usage from air conditioning units and [[evaporative cooler]]s in homes and businesses. An extra hour of sunlight while people are active would cause people to run their cooling systems longer, thereby using more energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2007.01.007|title=Evaluation of city-scale impact of residential energy conservation measures using the detailed end-use simulation model|year=2007|last1=Shimoda|first1=Yoshiyuki|last2=Asahi|first2=Takahiro|last3=Taniguchi|first3=Ayako|last4=Mizuno|first4=Minoru|journal=Energy|volume=32|issue=9|page=1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reservations in Arizona ====
The [[Navajo Nation|Navajo Indian Reservation]] extends into [[Utah]] and [[New Mexico]] and does observe daylight saving time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/arizona/navajo-nation/|title=Navajo Nation|publisher=Wwp.greenwichmeantime.com|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hopi Reservation]] is entirely within the state of Arizona and is an [[enclave]] within the Navajo Indian Reservation, but does not observe DST.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/03/daylight-savings-time-arizona-florida-spring-forward-science/|title=The Strange 100-Year History of Daylight Saving Time|date=2018-03-09|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== California ===
California voters passed Proposition 12&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposition 12: Daylight Saving Time |url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/ca_ballot_props/502/ |website=UC Hastings Scholarship Repository|publisher=University of California Hastings |accessdate=March 23, 2017 |language=en |year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949, approving DST in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-ban-daylight-saving-time_us_56e2fa37e4b0860f99d8d1a4|title=California Wants To Ban Daylight Saving Time|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[California Assembly]] member [[Kansen Chu]] introduced A.B. 807,&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB807 A.B. 807], 2017–2018 Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2017). ''An act to add Section 6808 to the Government Code, and to repeal Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Daylight Saving Time Act, an initiative measure approved at the November 8, 1949, special election, relating to daylight saving time.''&lt;/ref&gt; proposing to enable the legislature to eliminate DST in the state, or, if federal law allows, to adopt DST for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Katy |title=California debates daylight saving time — again |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/10/california-debates-daylight-saving-time-again/ |accessdate=March 23, 2017 |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chu then shelved his bill in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alexei |first1=Koseff |title=Daylight saving time survives another year in the California Legislature |url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article173127001.html |accessdate=March 4, 2018 |work=Sacramento Bee |date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then reintroduced A.B. 807 in 2018; it was approved by the California State Legislature, signed by Governor [[Jerry Brown]], placed on the November 2018 state ballot and passed. If approved by Congress, California would be allowed to remain on DST all year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Myers |first1=Amanda |title=California voters OK plan for year-round daylight saving time |url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article221194275.html  |work=Sacramento Bee |date=Nov 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Florida ===
Daylight saving time is less useful in Florida compared to other states because its southern location leads to less variations in day length between winter and summer. Without DST, Miami, for instance, would experience similar sunrise and sunset times throughout the year to cities including Honolulu or Hong Kong, which have both abandoned DST for decades. There is opposition to DST in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=51788 |title=HB 701 – Daylight Saving Time |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; State senator [[Bill Posey]] introduced a bill in March 2008 to abolish daylight time in the state and keep Florida on year-round [[standard time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/poseys-daylight-savings-bill-moves |title=Posey's daylight savings bill moves |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |first=Shannon |last=Colavecchio-Van Sickler |date=March 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Florida straddles two time zones, the Florida legislature has the option of returning all or part of the state to standard time along time zone boundaries (i.e. placing the portion of the state in the Eastern time zone on standard time, while leaving the portion in the Central time zone on DST, so that the whole state had a common time). There are currently no states that keep daylight saving time year round.

On March 6, 2018, the [[Florida Senate]] approved the “Sunshine Protection Act” which would put Florida on permanent Daylight Saving Time year round, and Governor [[Rick Scott]] signed it March 23. Congress would need to amend the existing 1966 federal law to allow the change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/03/09/npr-florida-bill-would-make-daylight-saving-time-year-round|title=Sunshine daydream: Florida bill would make daylight saving time year-round|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article206632969.html|title=Florida Gov. says yes to daylight saving time year-round|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2018-03-23|accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hawaii ===
Hawaii has never observed daylight saving time under the [[Uniform Time Act]], having opted out of the Act's provisions in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/hrscurrent/Vol01_Ch0001-0042F/HRS0001/HRS_0001-0031.HTM |title=Hawaii Revised Statutes, §&amp;nbsp;1-31 |publisher=Capitol.hawaii.gov |accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[Hawaii]]'s [[tropics|tropical]] latitude, there is not a large variation in daylight length between winter and summer. Advancing the clock to UTC−9 (DST) in Hawaii would make sunrise times close to 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. even in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/ |title=Astronomical Data Applications |publisher=U.S. Naval Meteorology &amp; Oceanography Command |accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inhabited islands are located close to the west end of the [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone]], but [[Oahu]], [[Kauai]], and [[Niihau]] are located more than 7 degrees west of the Hawaii-Aleutian time zone's [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] and should, theoretically, be located in the next [[time zone]] to the west. (Until about 1946 Hawaiian standard time was based on longitude 157.5 degrees west rather than 150 degrees.)

On April 26, 1933, the Territorial Legislature enacted a bill placing Hawaii on daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April (April 30 in that year) to the last Sunday in September, but the law was repealed three weeks later on May 21, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Session Laws of Hawaii, 933, enacted by Act 90 (approved April 26, 1933) and repealed by Act 163 (approved May 21, 1933). Cited in {{cite journal |last1=Schmitt |first1=Robert |first2=Doak |last2=Cox |title=Hawaiian Time |journal=The Hawaiian Journal of History |year=1992 |volume=26 |page=220 |url=http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/239/;jsessionid=6B80B9C87CEAED7646F2DB1B27495037?sequence=2 |accessdate=November 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105071530/http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/239/%3Bjsessionid%3D6B80B9C87CEAED7646F2DB1B27495037?sequence=2 |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II between February 9, 1942 and September 30, 1945, Hawaiian Standard Time was advanced one hour to so-called "Hawaiian War Time," effectively placing the territory on year-round daylight saving time.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt and Cox, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases where DST was used, Hawaii used UTC−9:30 during DST as standard time was 30 minutes behind.

=== Indiana ===
{{See also|Time in Indiana}}
From 1970 until 2006, most of [[Indiana]] in the Eastern Time Zone did not observe daylight saving time, but the entire state started to do so in April 2006 after eight counties in western Indiana were shifted from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf95/382609_web.pdf Standard Time Zone Boundary in the State of Indiana] (a 139&amp;nbsp;KB PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; One goal for observing DST was to get more Indiana counties observing the same time zone; formerly, 77 counties observed EST, 5 observed EST/EDT (the EDT usage being unofficial only), and 10 observed CST/CDT. {{As of|2016}}, Indiana has 12 counties observing Central Daylight Time while the remaining 80 counties observe Eastern Daylight Time. Those counties observing CST are in two groups: one near or in the Chicago metropolitan area, and the other around Evansville in the southwest corner of the state.

=== Michigan ===
In 1967, the [[Michigan Legislature]] adopted a statute, Act 6 of the Public Acts of 1967, exempting the state from the observance of DST. The exemption statute was suspended on June 14, 1967, however, when the [[referendum]] was invoked. From June 14, 1967 until the last Sunday in October 1967, [[Michigan]] observed DST, and did so in 1968 as well. The exemption statute was submitted to the voters at the General Election held in November 1968, and, in a close vote, the exemption statute was sustained. As a result, Michigan did not observe DST in 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972. (Radio station [[CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]], just across the river from [[Detroit]], was popular on both sides of the border and would often give both times on the air, ''e.g.'' "It's 4:30 in Detroit and 5:30 in Windsor!") In November 1972, an initiative measure, repealing the exemption statute, was approved by the voters. Michigan again observed DST in 1973, and has continued to do so since then.

The vast majority of Michigan is in the Eastern Time Zone. Only the Upper Peninsula counties that border Wisconsin ([[Gogebic County, Michigan|Gogebic]], [[Iron County, Michigan|Iron]], [[Dickinson County, Michigan|Dickinson]], and [[Menominee County, Michigan|Menominee]]) are in the Central Time Zone.

=== Nevada ===
In 2015, the [[Nevada Senate]] passed [[Nevada Assembly]] Joint Resolution 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2015-05-25 |title=Assembly Joint Resolution No. 4 |url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Bills/AJR/AJR4_EN.pdf |publisher=Nevada Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt; which urged Congress to enact legislation allowing individual states to establish daylight saving time as the standard time in their respective states throughout the calendar year.  This would mean that Nevada is on the same time as Arizona all year, but would be an hour ahead of California in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |first=Sandra |last=Chereb |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/nevada-lawmakers-urge-congress-to-allow-state-to-stay-on-daylight-savings-time/ |title=Nevada lawmakers urge Congress to allow state to stay on daylight savings time |date=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Congress]] has not yet enacted any enabling legislation in this regard.

=== Washington ===
In 2015, Rep. [[Elizabeth Scott (politician)|Elizabeth Scott]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Monroe, Washington|Monroe]]) filed a House bill to end DST in Washington, and a companion bill was filed in the Senate.&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt; She told a House committee that the semiannual time switches are not only inconvenient but lead to health problems and accidents due to lost sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nunnally |first=Derrick|title=Lawmakers want to end Daylight Saving Time in Washington |url=http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/2015/02/03/bill-end-daylight-saving-time-washington/22810529/ |agency=AP |date=February 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that the bill to drop daylight saving time would reduce heart attacks, car wrecks, and work accidents found to increase with the sleep-schedule disruptions.&lt;ref name="Oregonian"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill would end daylight saving time in Washington state|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/02/bill_would_end_daylight_saving.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |agency=AP |date=February 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different Senate Bill would petition the federal government for year-round DST.&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt;  The bills were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate bill to end Daylight Saving Time in Washington dies|url=https://www.tvw.org/blog/2015/02/senate-bill-to-end-daylight-saving-time-in-washington-dies/|accessdate=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other U.S. locations ===
All U.S. insular territories with civilian government ([[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]]) lie in the tropics and do not observe DST.

While neighboring [[Samoa]] began observing DST in September 2010, the smaller [[American Samoa]] cannot legally follow because of the DST observation period mandated by the [[Uniform Time Act]]. This period is actually wintertime in this Southern Hemisphere territory.

== Time zones ==
Many computer operating systems (such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]], and [[macOS]]) and programming languages (such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[perl]], and most [[shell (computing)|shell languages]]) allow a local time zone setting in the format of ''(standard time zone abbreviation)(UTC hour difference)(daylight saving time zone abbreviation)''. This allows programs and programming languages that must do calculations based on local time to more easily calculate differences between local time and UTC, as well as knowing whether calculations should be changed during daylight saving time. For example, a time zone setting of '''EST5EDT''' indicates that local time on the computer is 5 hours behind UTC and should be adjusted for daylight saving time.

'''Dobruja''' or '''Dobrudja''' ({{lang-bg|Добруджа}}, transliterated: ''Dobrudzha'' or ''Dobrudža''; {{lang-ro|Dobrogea}} {{IPA-ro|ˈdobrod͡ʒe̯a|pron|Ro-Dobrogea.ogg}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ro|doˈbrod͡ʒe̯a|}}; {{lang-tr|Dobruca}}) is a historical region in [[Eastern Europe]] that has been divided since the 19th century between the territories of [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. It is situated between the lower [[Danube]] River and the [[Black Sea]], and includes the [[Danube Delta]], [[Romania]]n coast, and the northernmost part of the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Bulgarian coast]]. The territory of Dobruja is made up of [[Northern Dobruja]], which is part of Romania, and [[Southern Dobruja]], which belongs to Bulgaria.

The territory of the Romanian region '''Dobrogea''' is organised as the counties of [[Constanța County|Constanța]] and [[Tulcea County|Tulcea]], with a combined area of 15,500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6,011 sq. miles) and a population of slightly less than 900 thousand. Its main cities are [[Constanța]], [[Tulcea]], [[Medgidia]] and [[Mangalia]]. Dobrogea is represented by [[dolphin]]s in the [[coat of arms of Romania]]. 

The Bulgarian region '''Dobrudzha''' is divided among the administrative regions of [[Dobrich Province|Dobrich]] and [[Silistra Province|Silistra]]; the following villages of [[Razgrad Province]]: Konevo, Rainino, Terter and Madrevo; and the village General Kantardzhievo ([[Varna Province|Varna]]). This section has a total area of 7,565&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a combined population of some 310,000 people, the main towns being [[Dobrich]] and [[Silistra]] (regional seats).

== Geography ==
[[File:Dobrudja topographic map-en.svg|thumb|Geographical map of Dobruja]]
[[File:On The Way Back.jpg|thumb|Woods and agricultural land in the Northern Dobruja Plateau]]
[[File:DobrujaLandscape.jpg|thumb|Steppe and agricultural land in the Central Dobruja Plateau]]
[[File:Yaylata.jpg|thumb|Rocky shores characteristic for the Southern Dobrujan coast]]
With the exception of the [[Danube Delta]], a marshy region located in its northeastern corner, Dobruja is hilly, with an average altitude of about 200–300&amp;nbsp;metres. The highest point is the Țuțuiatu (Greci) Peak in the [[Măcin Mountains]], having a height of 467&amp;nbsp;m. The [[Dobrogea Plateau]] covers most of the Romanian part of Dobruja. The [[Ludogorie Plateau]] is found in Bulgaria. [[Lake Razelm]] is one of the most important lakes in Northern Dobruja.

Dobruja lies in the temperate [[continental climate|continental]] climatic area; the local [[climate]] is determined by the influx of oceanic air from the northwest and northeast and continental air from the [[East European Plain]]. Dobruja's relatively level terrain and its bare location&lt;!-- meaning unforested? --&gt; facilitate the influx of humid, warm air in the spring, summer and autumn from the northwest, as well as that of northern and northeastern polar air in the winter. The Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate, particularly within 40–60&amp;nbsp;kilometres from the coast. The average annual temperatures range from 11&amp;nbsp;°C inland and along the Danube, to 11.8&amp;nbsp;°C on the coast and less than 10&amp;nbsp;°C in the higher parts of the plateau. The coastal region of Southern Dobruja is the most arid part of Bulgaria, with an annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of 450&amp;nbsp;millimetres.

Dobruja is a windy region once known for its [[windmill]]s. There is wind during about 85–90% of all days; it  usually comes from the north or northeast. The average wind speed is about twice higher than the average in Bulgaria. Due to the limited precipitation and the proximity to the sea, rivers in Dobruja are usually short and with low discharge. The region has a number of shallow seaside lakes with [[brackish water]].&lt;ref name=fol&gt;{{cite book|last=Фол|first=Александър|title=История на Добруджа (History of Dobruja)|publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]|location=[[Sofia]]|year=1984|oclc=165781151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The most widespread opinion among scholars is that the origin of the term ''Dobruja'' is to be found in the Turkish rendition of the name of a 14th‑century Bulgarian ruler, [[Despot (court title)|despot]] [[Dobrotitsa]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ischirkoff, ''Les Bulgares en Dobroudja'', p. 4, attributes this opinion, among others, to [[Johann Christian von Engel]], [[Felix Philipp Kanitz]], [[Marin Drinov]], [[Josef Jireček]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]] &lt;!--to be identified: Sassi, Syrcou, A.T. Ilieff--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wittek]], ''Yazijioghlu 'Ali on the Christian Turks of the Dobruja'', p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidova|first=R.|title=История на Добруджа|editor1-first=Aleksander|editor1-last=Fol|editor2-first=Strashimir|editor2-last=Dimitrov|publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences|year=1984|volume=1|page=9|chapter=Приподно-географски условия в Добруджа|oclc=11916334|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for the Turks to name countries after one of their early rulers (for example, nearby [[Moldavia]] was known as ''Bogdan [[Vlachs#Wallachia|Iflak]]'' by the Turks, named after [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]]). Other etymologies have been considered, but never gained widespread acceptance. 

[[Abdolonyme Ubicini]] believed the name meant "good lands", derived from [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''dobro'' ("good"), an opinion that was adopted by several 19th‑century scholars. This derivation appears to contrast with the usual 19th‑century description of Dobruja as a dry barren land; it has been explained as expressing the point of view of [[Ruthenes]], who considered the Danube delta in the northern Dobruja as a significant improvement over the [[steppes]] to the North.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ischirkoff, ''Les Bulgares en Dobroudja'', p. 4, attributes this opinion to [[Camille Allard]], [[Ami Boué]], [[Heinrich Brunn]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[I. A. Nazarettean]] combines the Slavic word with the [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]] ''budjak'' ("corner"), thus proposing the etymology "good corner". 

A version matching contemporaneous descriptions was suggested by [[Felix Philipp Kanitz|Kanitz]], who associated the name with the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''dobrice'' ("rocky and unproductive terrain").&lt;ref&gt;G. Dănescu, ''Dobrogea (La Dobroudja). Étude de Géographie physique et ethnographique'', pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gheorghe I. Brătianu]], the name is a Slavic derivation from the Turkic word ''Bordjan'' or ''Brudjars'', which referred to the Turkic [[Proto-Bulgarians]]; this term was also used by Arabic writers.

One of the earliest documented uses of the name can be found in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Oghuz-name'' narrative, dated to the 15th century, where it appears as ''Dobruja-éli''. The [[possessive suffix]]  ''el-i'' indicated that the land was considered as belonging to Dobrotitsa ("{{lang|ota|دوبرجه}}" in the original Ottoman Turkish).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wittek, ''Yazijioghlu 'Ali on the Christian Turks of the Dobruja'', p. 653&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the final particle is not unusual in the Turkish world, a similar evolution being observed in the name of [[Aydın]], originally ''Aydın-éli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = İnalcık | first = Halil | authorlink = Halil İnalcık | title = Dobru&lt;u&gt;dj&lt;/u&gt;a | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] | volume = II | page = 610 a | publisher = [[Brill Publishers|E.

Ischirkoff, ''Les Bulgares en Dobroudja'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, the region was referred to in more accounts, with renditions such as ''Dobrucia'', ''Dobrutcha'', ''Dobrus'', ''Dobruccia'', ''Dobroudja'', ''Dobrudscha'', and others being used by foreign authors.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ischirkoff, ''Les Bulgares en Dobroudja'', pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the name meant just the steppe of the southern region, between the forests around [[Babadag]] in the north and the [[Silistra]]–[[Dobrich]]–[[Balchik]] line in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Camille |last=Allard |title=Mission médicale dans la Tatarie-Dobroutscha|location=Paris|year=1857|pages= 7–8|oclc=36764237|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the term was extended to include the northern part and the [[Danube Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last= Stănciugel |author2=Bălaşa, Liliana Monica |title=Dobrogea în Secolele VII–XIX.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The territory of Dobruja has been inhabited by humans since [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Palaeolithic]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; as the remains at Babadag, [[Slava Rusă]] and [[Enisala]] demonstrate. In the [[Neolithic]], the territory was occupied by members of the [[Hamangia culture]] (named after a village on the Dobrujan coast), [[Boian culture]] and [[Karanovo culture|Karanovo V]] culture. At the end of the fifth millennium BC, under the influence of some Aegeo-Mediterranean tribes and cultures, the [[Gumelniţa culture]] appeared in the region. In the [[Eneolithic]], populations migrating from the north of the Black Sea, of the [[Kurgan]] culture, mixed with the previous population, creating the [[Cernavodă culture|Cernavodă I]] culture. Under Kurgan II influence, the Cernavodă II culture emerged. Through the combination of the Cernavodă I and [[Ezero culture]]s, the Cernavodă III culture developed. The region had commercial contacts with the Mediterranean world since the 14th century BC, as proven by a [[Mycenae]]an sword discovered at [[Medgidia]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Cetatea Histria Constanta.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of the first Greek colony in the region, [[Histria (Sinoe)|Istros]]]]

During the early [[Iron Age]] (8th–6th centuries BC), there was increased differentiation of the local [[Getic]] tribes from the [[Thracians|Thracian]] mass. In the second part of the 8th century BC, the first signs of commercial relations between the indigenous population and the Greeks appeared on the shore of the Halmyris Gulf (now the [[Sinoe Lake]]).

In 657/656&amp;nbsp;BC [[Ancient Greek]] colonists from [[Miletus]] founded a colony in the region: [[Histria (Sinoe)|Histria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Eusebios–Hieronymos|authorlink=Jerome|editor=Ibarez, Josh Miguel Blasco |title=Hieronymi Chronicon |page=167 |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_05_latin_part1.htm |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-04-27|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, more [[Greek colonies]] were founded on the Dobrujan coast ([[Callatis]], [[Constanța|Tomis]], [[Nesebar|Mesembria]], [[Dionysopolis]], Parthenopolis, Aphrodisias, Eumenia etc.). In the 5th century BC these colonies were under the influence of the [[Delian League]], passing in this period from [[oligarchy]] to [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |title=Aristotle's Politics |editor=Jowett, Benjamin |chapter="Politics", Book V, 6 |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/ |chapterurl=http://ebooks.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/book5.html |year=2000 |location=Adelaide |publisher=University of Adelaide |accessdate=2007-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222064513/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/ |archivedate=February 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century BC, the first [[Scythians|Scythian groups]] began to enter the region. Two [[Getae]] tribes, the ''Crobyzi'' and ''Terizi'', and the town of Orgame ([[Argamum]]) were mentioned on the territory of present Dobruja by [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hekataios of Miletus]] (540–470&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller|C.

[[File:Scythia Minor map-en.svg|left|thumb|Ancient towns and colonies in [[Scythia Minor]].]]
In 313&amp;nbsp;BC and again in 310–309&amp;nbsp;BC, the Greek colonies led by Callatis, supported by [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]], revolted against Macedonian rule. The revolts were suppressed by [[Lysimachus]], the [[diadochi|diadochus]] of [[Thrace#Ancient_and_Roman_history|Thrace]], who also began a military expedition against [[Dromichaetes]], the ruler of the Getae north of the Danube, in 300&amp;nbsp;BC. In the 3rd century BC, colonies on the Dobrujan coast paid tribute to the [[basileus|basilei]] [[Zalmodegikos]] and [[Moskon]], who probably also ruled northern Dobruja. In the same century, [[Celts]] settled in the north of the region. In 260&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Byzantion]] lost the war with Callatis and Histria for the control of Tomis. At the end of the 3rd century BC and the beginning of the 2nd century BC, the [[Bastarnae]] settled in the area of the Danube Delta. Around 200&amp;nbsp;BC, the Thracian king [[Zoltes]] invaded the province several times, but was defeated by [[Rhemaxos]], who became the protector of the Greek colonies.

Early Greek scholars such as [[Herodotus]] appear to have regarded the region as the a south-western extension of [[Scythia]] – a practice also followed in a 2nd Century BC inscription, recording a decree made in Histria, which refers to the region surrounding the Greek city as ''Scythia''. However, the [[toponym]] Μικρά Σκυθία ''Mikrá Skythia'', usually translated as [[Scythia Minor]] or Lesser Scythia, appears to have become the name for the specific region later known as Dobruja. The earliest known usage of the name "Scythia Minor" (''Mikrá Skythia'') is found in [[Strabo]]'s early ''Geography'' (1st century AD). The Greeks thus apparently distinguished it from ''Scythia Major'', which lay north of the Danube delta. 

Around 100&amp;nbsp;BC King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] extended his authority over the Greek cities in Dobruja. However, in 72–71&amp;nbsp;BC, during the [[Third Mithridatic War]], these cities were occupied by the forces of [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus]], the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[proconsul]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. A [[foedus]] was signed between the Greek colonies and the [[Roman Empire]], but in 62–61&amp;nbsp;BC the colonies revolted{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]] intervened, but was defeated by Getae and Bastarnae near Histria. After 55&amp;nbsp;BC the [[Dacians]] under King [[Burebista]] conquered Dobruja and all the Greek colonies on the coast. Their rule ended in 44&amp;nbsp;BC{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

=== Roman rule ===
In 28/29&amp;nbsp;BC [[Rholes]], a [[Getae|Getic]] ruler from southern Dobruja, supported the proconsul of Macedonia, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]], in his action against the Bastarnae.

In 12&amp;nbsp;AD and 15&amp;nbsp;AD, Getic armies succeeded in conquering the cities of [[Tulcea|Aegyssus]] and [[Troesmis]] for a short time, but Odrysian king [[Rhoemetalces I]] defeated them with the help of the Roman army.
[[File:Cetatea Tropaeum Traiani - vedere laterală.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Tropaeum Traiani]] monument in [[Adamclisi]] commemorating Roman victory over Dacians (Modern reconstruction)]]
In 15&amp;nbsp;AD the Roman province of [[Moesia]] was created, but Dobruja, under the name ''Ripa Thraciae'' remained part of the [[Odrysian]] kingdom. The Greek cities on the coast formed a ''[[Prefect#Ancient_Rome|praefectura orae maritimae]]''. In 46&amp;nbsp;AD [[Thracia]] became a Roman province and the territories of present Dobruja were absorbed into the province of Moesia. The [[Geto–Dacians]] invaded the region several times in the 1st century AD, especially between 62 and 70. In the same period, the base of the [[Roman navy|Roman Danube fleet]] (''classis Flavia Moesica'') was moved to [[Isaccea|Noviodunum]]. The ''praefectura'' was annexed to Moesia in 86&amp;nbsp;AD. In the same year [[Domitian]] divided Moesia, Dobruja being included in the eastern part, ''[[Moesia Inferior]]''.

In the winter of 101–102 the Dacian king [[Decebalus]] led a coalition of Dacians, [[Carpians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Burs (Dacia)|Burs]] in an attack against Moesia Inferior. The invading army was defeated by the Roman legions under Emperor [[Trajan]] on the [[Yantra River|Yantra]] river. (Later [[Nicopolis ad Istrum]] was founded there to commemorate the victory.) The invaders were also defeated near the modern village of [[Adamclisi]], in the southern part of Dobruja. The latter victory was commemorated by the [[Tropaeum Traiani|a monument]], built in 109 at the site, and the founding of the city of Tropaeum. After 105, [[Legio XI Claudia]] and [[Legio V Macedonica]] were moved to Dobruja, at [[Durostorum]] and Troesmis, respectively.

In 118 [[Hadrian]] intervened in the region to calm a Sarmatian rebellion. In 170 [[Costoboci]] invaded Dobruja, attacking [[Libida]], [[Ulmetum]] and [[Tropaeum Traiani|Tropaeum]]. The province was generally stable and prosperous until the [[crisis of the Third Century]], which led to the weakening of defences and numerous barbarian invasions. In 248 a coalition of [[Goths]], Carpians, [[Taifali]], Bastarnae and [[Hasdingi]], led by Argaithus and Guntheric, devastated Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Iordanes |authorlink=Jordanes|editor=[[Charles Christopher Mierow]]|title=The origin and deeds of the Goths in English version|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html|chapter=Ch.

The same emperor put an end to the crisis in the Roman Empire, thus helping the reconstruction of the province.

During the reign of [[Diocletian]], Dobruja was organized administratively as a separate province, called [[Scythia Minor|Scythia]], part of the [[Diocese]] of Thracia. Its capital city was Tomis. Diocletian transferred [[Legio II Herculia]] to Troesmis and [[Legio I Iovia]] to Noviodunum. In 331–332 [[Constantine the Great]] defeated the Goths who attacked the province. But Dobruja was devastated again by [[Ostrogoths]] in 384–386. Under the Roman emperors [[Licinius]], [[Julian the Apostate]], and [[Valens]], the cities of the region were repaired or rebuilt.

=== Byzantine rule ===
After the division of the [[Roman Empire]], Dobruja was absorbed into the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Between 513 and 520, the region participated in a revolt against [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]]. Its leader, [[Vitalian (general)|Vitalian]], native of [[Zaldapa]] in Southern Dobruja, defeated the Byzantine general [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]] near [[Kaliakra]]. During [[Justin I]]'s rule, [[Antes (people)|Antes]] and [[Early Slavs|Slavs]] invaded the region, but [[Germanus Justinus]] defeated them. In 529, the [[Gepid]] commander [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]] repelled a new invasion by [[Bulgars]] and Antes. [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] invaded the region several times, until 561–562, when the Avars under [[Bayan I]] were settled south of the Danube as [[foederati]]. During the rule of [[Maurice (emperor)|Mauricius Tiberius]], the Slavs devastated Dobruja, destroying the cities of [[Dorostolon]], Zaldapa and Tropaeum. In 591/593, Byzantine general [[Priscus (general)|Priscus]] tried to stop invasions, attacking and defeating the Slavs under [[Ardagast]] in the north of the province. In 602 during the mutiny of the Byzantine army in the Balkans under [[Phocas]], a large mass of Slavs crossed the Danube, settling south of the Danube. Dobruja remained under loose Byzantine control, and was reorganised during the reign of [[Constantine IV]] as ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|Thema]] Scythia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Constantine Porphyrogennetos |authorlink=Constantine VII |script-title=el:Του σοφωτάτου δεσπότου και αυτοκράτορος Κωνσταντίνου, του Πορφυρογεννήτου, τα ευρισκόμενα πάντα.

=== First Bulgarian Empire rule ===
[[File:Мемориален комплекс "Хан Аспарух" (2), гр. Добрич.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Monument to [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], the founder of the First Bulgarian State, in [[Dobrich]]; Dobruja was part of Asparukh's conquest in the 7th century]]
The results of archaeological researches indicate that the Byzantine presence in Dobruja's mainland and on the banks of Danube was reduced in the end of the 6th century, under the pressure of the [[Migration Period]]. In the coastal fortifications on the southern bank of Danube, the latest Byzantine coin found dates from the time of the emperors [[Tiberius II Constantine]] (574–582) and [[Heraclius]] (610–641). After that period, all inland Byzantine cities were demolished by the invaders and abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;S. Vaklinov, "Формиране на старобългарската култура VI–XI век", p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the earliest [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements to the south of Danube have been discovered in Dobruja, near the villages of [[Popina, Silistra|Popina]], [[Garvăn]] and [[Nova Cherna]]. They have been dated to the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;S. Vaklinov, "Формиране на старобългарската култура VI–XI век", pp. 48-50&lt;/ref&gt; These lands became the main zone of compact [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] settlement in the end of the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;S. Vaklinov, "Формиране на старобългарската култура VI–XI век", p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the peace treaty of 681, signed after the Bulgarian victory over Byzantines in the [[Battle of Ongala]], Dobruja became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Barnea, Şt.Ştefănescu, ''Bizantini, romani și bulgari la Dunărea de Jos'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the Bulgar founded the city of [[Pliska]], which became the first Bulgarian capital, near the southern border of Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;Petar Mutafchiev, ''Добруджа.

According to Bulgarian historians, during the 7th–10th centuries, the region was fortified by construction of a large network of earthen and wooden strongholds and ramparts.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuzev, V. Gyuzelev (eds.) ''Градове и крепости но Дунава и Черно море'', pp. 16–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 8th century, widespread building of new stone fortresses and defensive walls began.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuzev, V. Gyuzelev (eds.), ''Градове и крепости но Дунава и Черно море'', pp. 45-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian historians dispute attributing these walls to the Bulgarians, based on their interpretation of the construction system and archaeological evidence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The Bulgarians also reconstructed some of the ruined Byzantine fortresses (Kaliakra and Silistra in the 8th century, Madara and [[Varna]] in the 9th).&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuzev, V. Gyuzelev (eds.), ''Градове и крепости но Дунава и Черно море'', pp. 179, 257, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barnea, among other historians, during the following three centuries of Bulgarian domination, Byzantines still controlled the Black Sea coast and the mouths of Danube, and for short periods, even some cities.&lt;ref&gt;I. Barnea, Şt.Ştefănescu, ''Bizantini, romani și bulgari la Dunărea de Jos'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; But Bulgarian archaeologists note that the last Byzantine coins found, which are considered a proof of Byzantine presence, date in [[Kaliakra]] from the time of Emperor [[Justin II]] (565–578),&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuzev, V. Gyuzelev (eds.), ''Градове и крепости но Дунава и Черно море'', p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Varna]] from the time of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610–641),&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuzev, V. Gyuzelev (eds.), ''Градове и крепости но Дунава и Черно море'',  p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Tomis from [[Constantine IV]]'s rule (668–685).&lt;ref&gt;S. Vaklinov, "Формиране на старобългарската култура VI-XI век", p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 8th century, [[Justinian II]] visited Dobruja to ask Bulgarian Khan [[Tervel]] for military help.

=== Return of Byzantine rule and late migrations, Second Bulgarian Empire and Mongol domination ===
With financial encouragement from the Byzantine emperor, [[Nicephorus II|Nikephoros II Phocas]], [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] agreed to assist the Byzantines in their war with the Bulgarians. Sviatoslav defeated the Bulgarians (led by [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris II]]) and proceeded to occupy the whole of northern Bulgaria. He occupied Dobruja in 968 and moved the capital of [[Kievan Rus']] to [[Pereyaslavets]], in the north of the region. Sviatoslav refused to turn his Balkan conquests over to the Byzantines, and the parties fell out as a result.  So the Byzantines under [[John I Tzimisces]] reconquered Dobruja in 971 and included it in the theme 'Mesopotamia of the West' (Μεσοποταμια της Δυσεον).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Diaconus|authorlink=Leo the Deacon|script-title=ru:Лев Диакон.

Between 1352 and 1359, with the collapse of Golden Horde rule in Northern Dobruja, a new state appeared. It was controlled by [[Tatar]] prince [[Demetrius, Prince of the Tatars|Demetrius]], who claimed to be the protector of the river mouths of the Danube.&lt;ref name="DID 351"&gt;I.

On his return, he was captured at Vidin by [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]], [[Tsar]] of [[Tarnovo]], who believed that the new alliances were directed against his realm. An anti-Ottoman crusade under [[Amadeus VI of Savoy]], supported by the republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], was diverted to free the Byzantine emperor. Dobrotitsa collaborated with the crusaders, and after the allies conquered several Bulgarian forts on the Black Sea, Ivan Alexander freed John and negotiated a peace agreement. Dobrotitsa's role in this conflict brought him numerous political advantages:  his daughter married one of John V's sons, Michael, and his principality extended its control over some of the forts lost by the Bulgarians ([[Pomorie|Anchialos]] and [[Nesebar|Mesembria]]).

In 1368, after the death of prince Demetrius, Dobrotitsa was recognised as ruler by [[Mangalia|Pangalia]] and other cities on the right bank of the Danube. In 1369, together with [[Vladislav I of Wallachia]], Dobrotitsa helped Prince [[Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria|Stratsimir]] to win back the throne of [[Tsardom of Vidin|Vidin]].

Between 1370 and 1375, allied with Venice, Dobritsia challenged Genoese power in the Black Sea. In 1376, he tried to impose his son-in law, Michael, as Emperor of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], but was unsuccessful. Dobrotitsa supported John V Palaeologus against his son [[Andronicus IV Palaeologus]]. In 1379, the Dobrujan fleet participated in the blockade of [[Constantinople]], fighting with the Genoese fleet.

In 1386, Dobrotitsa died and was succeeded by [[Ivanko (despot)|Ivanko/Ioankos]]. That same year he accepted a peace agreement with [[Murad I]] and in 1387 signed a commercial treaty with Genoa. Ivanko was killed in 1388 during the expedition of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|Grand Vizier]] [[Çandarli Ali Pasha]] against [[Tarnovo]] and [[Silistra|Dristra]]. The expedition brought most of the Dobrujan forts under Turkish rule.

=== Wallachian rule ===

In 1388/1389 Dobruja (''Terrae Dobrodicii''—as mentioned in a document from 1390) and Dristra (''Dârstor'') came under the control of [[Mircea cel Bătrân of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]], ruler of [[Wallachia]], who defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Grand Vizier]].
[[File:Tara Rumaneasca map.png|thumb|350px|Dobruja (''Terra Dobrotici'') as part of Wallachia under Mircea the Elder]]
Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid I]] conquered the southern part of the territory in 1393, attacking Mircea one year later, but without success. In the spring of 1395 [[Mircea cel Bătrân of Wallachia|Mircea]] regained the lost Dobrujan territories, with the help of his [[Hungary|Hungarian]] allies.

The Ottomans recaptured Dobruja in 1397 and ruled it to 1404, although in 1401 Mircea strongly defeated an Ottoman army.

The defeat of Sultan Beyezid I by [[Tamerlane]] at [[Battle of Ankara|Ankara]] in 1402 opened a period of anarchy in the Ottoman Empire. Mircea took advantage of it to organise a new anti-Ottoman campaign: in 1403, he occupied the Genoese fort of [[Chilia Veche|Kilia]] at the mouths of the Danube. Thus in 1404, he could impose his authority on Dobruja. In 1416, Mircea supported the revolt against [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mehmed I]], led by [[Sheikh Bedreddin]] in the area of Deliorman, in Southern Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = İnalcık | first = Halil | authorlink = Halil İnalcık | title = Dobru&lt;u&gt;dj&lt;/u&gt;a | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] | volume = II | page = 611 b | publisher = [[Brill Publishers|E.

After Mircea's death in 1418, his son [[Michael I of Wallachia|Mihail I]] fought against the amplified Ottoman attacks, eventually being killed in a battle in 1420. That year, the Sultan Mehmed I personally conducted the definitive conquest of Dobruja by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. [[Wallachia]] kept only the mouths of the Danube, but not for a long duration.

In the late 14th century, German traveller [[Johann Schiltberger]] described these lands as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Istorija i civilizacija za 11. klas | last = Delev | first = Petǎr |author2=Valeri Kacunov|author3=Plamen Mitev|author4=Evgenija Kalinova|author5=Iskra Baeva|author6=Bojan Dobrev | chapter = 19.

Occupied by the Turks in 1420, the region remained under Ottoman control until the late 19th century. Initially, it was organised as an ''u&lt;u&gt;dj&lt;/u&gt;'' (border province), included in the [[sanjak]] of Silistra, part of the [[Rumelia|Vilayet of Rumelia]]. Later, under [[Murad II]] or [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], the sanjak of Silistra and surrounding territories were organised as [[Silistra Province, Ottoman Empire|a separate Vilayet]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, a revolt led by the "false" (''düzme'') Mustafa, a pretender to the Turkish throne, broke out against Ottoman administration in [[Rumelia]] and rapidly spread to Dobruja, but was repressed by the [[beylerbey]] of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nigbolu]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|last=Shaw|first=Stanford Jay|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1977|page=109|volume=1|isbn=978-0-521-29163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1603 and 1612, the region suffered from the forays of [[Cossack]]s, who burnt down [[Isaccea|Isaķči]] and plundered [[Constanţa|Küstendje]]. The Russian Empire occupied Dobruja several times during the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] — in 1771–1774, 1790–1791, 1809–1810, 1829 and 1853. The most violent invasion was that of 1829, which resulted in the depopulation of numerous villages and towns. The [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] of 1829 ceded the [[Danube Delta]] to the [[Russian Empire]]. However, Russia was forced to return it to the Ottomans in 1856, after the [[Crimean War]]. In 1864 Dobruja was included in the [[Danube Province, Ottoman Empire|vilayet of Tuna]].
[[File:Le port de Kustendje.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The port of [[Constanța|Kustendje]] in 1856. Drawing by Camille Allard]]
During Ottoman rule, groups of [[Turkish people|Turk]], [[Arab]] and Tatar peoples settled in the region, the latter especially between 1512 and 1514. During the reign of [[Peter I of Russia]] and [[Catherine the Great]], [[Lipovans]] immigrated to the region of the Danube Delta. After the destruction of [[Zaporozhian Sich]] in 1775, [[Cossacks]] were settled in the area north of Lake Razim by the Turkish authorities (where they founded the [[Danubian Sich]]). They were forced to leave Dobruja in 1828. 

In the second part of the nineteenth‑century, [[Ruthenians]] from the [[Austrian Empire]] also settled in the Danube Delta. After the [[Crimean War]], a large number of [[Crimean Tatars|Tatars]] were forcibly driven away from [[Crimea]], immigrating to then-Ottoman Dobruja and settling mainly in the Karasu Valley in the centre of the region and around Bābā Dāgh. In 1864, [[Circassians]] fleeing from the Russian invasion of the [[Caucasus]] were settled in the wooded region near Bābā Dāgh. [[Dobrujan Germans|Germans]] from [[Bessarabia]] also founded colonies in Dobruja between 1840 and 1892.

According to Bulgarian historian [[Liubomir Miletich]], most Bulgarians living in Dobruja in 1900 were nineteenth-century settlers or their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Liubomir|last=Miletich|title=Старото българско население в северо-източна България|year=1902|location=Sofia|publisher=Книжовно Дружество|page=6|language=Bulgarian|oclc=67304814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Liubomir|last=Miletich|title=Südslavische Dialektstudien: das Ostbulgarische|location=Vienna|year=1903|publisher=1903|language=German|oclc=65828513|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, the scholar [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], wrote in a study on Dobruja, ordered by the Ottoman government, that Bulgarians came to the region "in the last twenty years or so".&lt;ref&gt;"Les Bulgares sont venus dans la Dobrodja depuis une vingtaine d'années, abandonnant des terres ingrates pour celles bien plus fertiles qu'ils ont trouvée dans ce pays" in {{cite book|title=Excursion agricole dans la plaine de la Dobrodja|last=Jonesco|first=J.|authorlink=Ion Ionescu de la Brad|location=Constantinopole|publisher=Imprimerie du Journal de Constantinopole|year=1850|oclc=251025693|language=French|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his study, there were 2,285 Bulgarian families (out of 8,194 Christian families) in the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annali universali di statistica, economia, pubblica, geografia, storia, viaggi e commercio|author=Lampato, Francesco (ed.)|location=Milano|publisher=Presso la Societa' degli Editori degli Annali Universali delle Scienze e dell'Industria|year=1851|language=Italian|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,194 of them in Northern Dobruja.&lt;ref name="Dmono 177"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dobrogea.

===After 1878===
[[File:Trecerea dunarii 1878.jpeg|thumb|left|Romanian troops triumphantly cross the Danube into Northern Dobruja, in a colourful patriotic lithograph, 1878]]
[[File:Histdob.png|220px|right|thumb|Dobruja after 1878.]]
After the 1878 war, the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] awarded Dobruja to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the newly established [[Principality of Bulgaria]]. The northern portion, held by Russia, was ceded to Romania in exchange for Russia obtaining territories in [[Southern Bessarabia]], thereby securing a direct access to the mouths of the [[Danube]]. In Northern Dobruja, Romanians were the plurality. The population included a Bulgarian ethnic enclave in the northeast (around [[Babadag]]), as well as an important Muslim community (mostly Turks and Tatars) scattered around the region.

The southern portion, held by Bulgaria, was reduced the same year by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. At the advice of the French envoy, a strip of land extended inland from the port of [[Mangalia]] (shown orange on the map) was ceded to Romania, since its southwestern corner contained a compact area of ethnic Romanians. The town of [[Silistra]], located at the areas' most southwestern point, remained Bulgarian due to its large Bulgarian population. Romania subsequently tried to occupy the town as well, but in 1879 a new international commission allowed Romania to occupy only the fort ''Arab Tabia'', which overlooked Silistra, but not the town itself.

[[File:Dobroudja_(carte_ethnographique).JPG|thumb|200px|Ethnic groups in Dobruja around 1918]]
At the beginning of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]], most of Dobruja's population was composed of ethnic Turks, Bulgarians and Tatars. During the war, a large part of the Muslim population was evacuated to Bulgaria and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; After 1878, the Romanian government encouraged Romanians from other regions to settle in Northern Dobruja and accepted the return of some Muslim population displaced by the war.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', pp. 358–360&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Bulgarian historians, after 1878 the Romanian church authorities took control over all local churches, with the exception of two in the towns of Tulcea and Constanţa, which managed to retain use of their Bulgarian Slavonic liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Kosev et al., ''Възстановяване и утвърждаване на българската държава'' p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1879 and 1900, Bulgarians built 15 new churches in Northern Dobruja.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, [[Italians]] from [[Friuli]] and [[Veneto]] settled in Greci, Cataloi and [[Măcin]] in Northern Dobruja. Most of them worked in the granite quarries in the [[Măcin Mountains]], while some became farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=[[România Liberă]]|first=Alexandru |last=Mihalcea |title=150 de ani de istorie comuna.

Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', pp. 363-364, 381&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1913, the [[Great Powers]] awarded Silistra and the area in a 3&amp;nbsp;km radius around it to Romania, at the [[Saint Petersburg]] Conference. In August 1913, after the [[Second Balkan War]], Bulgaria lost [[Southern Dobruja]] (''Cadrilater'') to Romania (See [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913]]). With Romania's entry in [[World War I]] on the side of France and Russia, the [[Central Powers]] occupied all of Dobruja and gave the Cadrilater, as well as the southern portion of Northern Dobruja, to Bulgaria in the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] of 1918. This situation lasted for a short period. As the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] emerged victorious at the end of the war, Romania regained the lost territories in the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] of 1919. Between 1926 and 1938, about 30,000 [[Aromanians]] from Bulgaria, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and Greece, were resettled in Southern Dobruja.

In 1923 the [[Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation]] (IDRO), a Bulgarian nationalist organisation, was established. Active in Southern Dobruja under different forms until 1940, the IDRO detachments fought against the widespread brigandage in the region,{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as well as the Romanian administration. Thus, while considered "a terrorist organisation" by the Romanian authorities, the IDRO was regarded by ethnic Bulgarians as a liberation movement. In 1925, part of the Bulgarian revolutionary committees formed the Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation (DRO), which later became subordinated to the [[Communist Party of Romania]]. In contrast with the IDRO, which fought for the inclusion of the region in the Bulgarian state, the DRO requested the independence of Dobruja and its inclusion in a projected [[Balkan federalism|Federative Republic of the Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Rădulescu, I. Bitoleanu, ''Istoria Dobrogei'', p. 430&lt;/ref&gt; The means used by DRO to attain its goals were also more peaceful.

During [[World War II]], Bulgaria regained Southern Dobruja in the September 1940 [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-sponsored [[Treaty of Craiova]], despite Romanian negotiators' insistence that [[Balchik]] and other towns should remain in Romania. As part of the treaty, the [[Romanians|Romanian]] inhabitants (Aromanian [[refugee]]-[[settler]]s, settlers from other regions of Romania and the Romanians indigenous to the region) were forced to leave the regained territory, while the Bulgarian minority in the north was expelled to go to Bulgaria in a [[population exchange]]. The post-war [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] of 1947 reaffirmed the 1940 border.

In 1948 and again in 1961–1962, Bulgaria proposed a border rectification in the area of Silistra, consisting mainly in the transfer of a Romanian territory containing the water source of that city. Romania made an alternative proposal that did not involve a territorial change and, ultimately, no rectification took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=[[Ziua]] de Constanţa|first=Mariana |last=Cojoc|author2=Tiță, Magdalena |title=Proiecții teritoriale bulgare|date=2006-09-06|url=http://www.ziuaconstanta.ro/rubrici/documentar/proiectii-teritoriale-bulgare-la-dunare-si-marea-neagra.html|accessdate=2007-02-15|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EMIS and emergencies==
Four phases of an emergency are Preparedness, Risk Mitigation, Response and Recovery. An EMIS shall enable emergency managers or any emergency stakeholder (affected civilians, police, fireman, Non Government Organizations (NGO), etc.)  make their required activities in any phase of an emergency in an easy and speedy way. 

===EMIS for Preparedness===
*Preparation of contingency plans for different types of emergencies
*Creating checklists that can be easily reached by any related emergency management stakeholder 
*Resource management

===EMIS for Risk Mitigation===
*Determine possible risk areas and/or risk types. Often supported by a [[geographical information system]] (GIS).
===EMIS for Response===
*Executing and tracking the contingency plan 
===EMIS for Recovery===
*Cost calculation of the emergency
*Various kind of reports (supported by tables, graphs, etc.) 

An EMIS interacts with many other early alert systems and communicates with many legacy systems.

==Terminology==
[[Image:Developing countries.png|thumb|right|{{legend|#007DCC| [[Developing countries]] that are neither part of the [[least developed countries]], nor of the [[newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]]}}]]

In the 1970s, "less developed countries" (LDCs) was the common term for markets that were less "developed" (by objective or subjective measures) than the developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and those in Western Europe. These markets were supposed to provide greater potential for profit but also more risk from various factors like patent infringement. This term was replaced by ''emerging market''. The term is misleading{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} in that there is no guarantee that a country will move from "less developed" to "more developed"; although that is the general trend in the world, countries can also move from "more developed" to "less developed".

Originally coined in 1981 by then [[World Bank]] economist [[Antoine Van Agtmael]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/be77e600-605f-11db-a716-0000779e2340.html|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Cox|title=Defining emerging markets|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21729866-self-fulfilling-prophecy-defining-emerging-markets|work=[[The Economist]]|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the term is sometimes loosely used as a replacement for ''emerging economies'', but really signifies a business phenomenon that is not fully described by or constrained Sherzodbek Safarov; such [[countries]] are considered to be in a transitional phase between [[developing country|developing]] and [[developed country|developed]] status. Examples of emerging markets include many countries in [[Africa]], most countries in [[Eastern Europe]], some countries of [[Latin America]], some countries in the [[Middle East]], [[Russia]] and some countries in [[Southeast Asia]]. Emphasizing the fluid nature of the category, political scientist [[Ian Bremmer]] defines an emerging market as "a country where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets".&lt;ref&gt;[http://custom.hbsp.com/b01/en/implicit/product.jhtml?login=BREM060105&amp;password=BREM060105&amp;pid=1126]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research on emerging markets is diffused within [[management]] literature. While researchers including, [[George Haley]], [[Vladimir Kvint]], [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]], [[Usha Haley]], and several professors from [[Harvard Business School]] and [[Yale School of Management]] have described activity in countries such as India and China, how a market emerges is little understood.

In 2009, Dr. Kvint published this definition: "Emerging market country is a society transitioning from a dictatorship to a free-market-oriented-economy, with increasing economic freedom, gradual integration with the Global Marketplace and with other members of the GEM (Global Emerging Market), an expanding middle class, improving standards of living, social stability and tolerance, as well as an increase in cooperation with multilateral institutions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kvint|first=Vladimir|title=The Global Emerging Market: Strategic Management and Economics|year=2009|publisher=Routledge |location=New York, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 Emerging Economy Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergingeconomyreport.com|title=emergingeconomyreport.com|website=www.emergingeconomyreport.com|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Center for Knowledge Societies]] defines Emerging Economies as those "regions of the world that are experiencing rapid informationalization under conditions of limited or partial industrialization." It appears that emerging markets lie at the intersection of non-traditional user behavior, the rise of new user groups and community adoption of products and services, and innovations in product technologies and platforms.

More critical scholars have also studied key emerging markets like Mexico and Turkey. Thomas Marois (2012, 2) argues that financial imperatives have become much more significant and has developed the idea of 'emerging finance capitalism' - an era wherein the collective interests of financial capital principally shape the logical options and choices of government and state elites over and above those of labor and popular classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marois|first=Thomas|title=States, Banks and Crisis: Emerging Finance Capitalism in Mexico and Turkey|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julien Vercueil recently proposed an pragmatic definition of the "emerging economies", as distinguished from "emerging markets" coined by an approach heavily influenced by financial criteria. According to his definition, an emerging economy displays the following characteristics:&lt;ref name="Vercueil"&gt;Vercueil, Julien: "Les pays émergents. Brésil - Russie - Inde - Chine... Mutations économiques et nouveaux défis " (Emerging Countries. Brazil - Russia - India - China.. Economic change and new challenges", in French). Paris: Bréal, 3rd Edition, 2012, 232 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Intermediate income: its PPP per capita income is comprised between 10% and 75% of the average EU per capita income.
# Catching-up growth: during at least the last decade, it has experienced a brisk economic growth that has narrowed the income gap with advanced economies.
# Institutional transformations and economic opening: during the same period, it has undertaken profound institutional transformations which contributed to integrate it more deeply into the world economy. Hence, emerging economies appears to be a by-product of the current globalization.

At the beginning of the 2010s, more than 50 countries, representing 60% of the world's population and 45% of its GDP, matched these criteria.&lt;ref name="Vercueil"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Among them, the BRICs.

[[File:Newly industrialized countries 2013.svg|thumb|[[Newly industrialized country|Newly industrialized countries]] [[Effective date|as of]] 2013. This is an intermediate category between fully developed and developing.]]
The term "rapidly developing economies" is being used to denote emerging markets such as The [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Chile]] and [[Malaysia]] that are undergoing rapid growth.

In recent years, new terms have emerged to describe the largest [[Developing country|developing countries]] such as [[BRIC]] that stands for [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[India]], and [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=916768|title=Five Years of China WTO Membership: EU and US Perspectives About China's Compliance With Transparency Commitments and the Transitional Review Mechanism|first=Farah, Paolo|last=Davide|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with ''BRICET'' (BRIC + Eastern Europe and Turkey), ''BRICS'' (BRIC + South Africa), ''BRICM'' (BRIC + Mexico), [[MINT (economics)|MINT]] (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey), [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|Next Eleven]] (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam) and [[CIVETS]] (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE63Q26Q20100427|title=After BRICs, look to CIVETS for growth - HSBC CEO|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|publisher=|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries do not share any common agenda, but some experts believe that they are enjoying an increasing role in the world economy and on political platforms.

Lists of emerging (or developed) markets vary; guides may be found in such investment information sources as ''[[EMIS (company)|EMIS]]'' (a Euromoney Institutional Investor Company), ''[[The Economist]]'', or market index makers (such as [[MSCI]]).

In an [[Opalesque.TV]] video, [[hedge fund]] manager Jonathan Binder discusses the current and future relevance of the term "emerging markets" in the financial world. Binder says that in the future investors will not necessarily think of the traditional classifications of "G10" (or G7) versus "emerging markets". Instead, people should look at the world as countries that are fiscally responsible and countries that are not. Whether that country is in Europe or in South America should make no difference, making the traditional "blocs" of categorization irrelevant. Guégan ''et al.'' (2014) also discuss the relevance of the terminology "emerging country" comparing the credit worthiness of so-called emerging countries to so-called developed countries. According to their analysis, depending on the criteria used, the term may not always be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Guégan |first1 = D. |last2 = Hassani |first2 = B.K. |last3 = Zhao |first3 = X. |editor1-last = El Hedi Arouri | editor1-first = M. |editor2-last = Boubaker | editor2-first = S. |editor3-last = Khuong Nguyen | editor3-first = D. |title = Emerging Markets and the Global Economy: A Handbook |chapter = Emerging Countries Sovereign Rating Adjustment using Market Information: Impact on Financial Institutions Investment Decisions |year = 2014 |pages = 17–49 |publisher = Academic Press |location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newly industrialized country|Newly industrialized countries]] are emerging markets whose economies have not yet reached developed status but have, in a macroeconomic sense, outpaced their developing counterparts.

Individual investors can invest in emerging markets by buying into emerging markets or global funds. If they want to pick single stocks or make their own bets they can do it either through ADRs (American depositor Receipts - stocks of foreign companies that trade on US stock exchanges) or through exchange traded funds (exchange traded funds or ETFs hold basket of stocks). The exchange traded funds can be focused on a particular country (e.g., China, India) or region (e.g., Asia-Pacific, Latin America).

==Commonly listed==
Various sources list countries as "emerging economies" as indicated by the table below.

A few countries appear in every list (BRICS, Mexico, Turkey). Indonesia and Turkey are categorized with Mexico and Nigeria as part of the [[MINT (economics)|MINT]] economies. While there are no commonly agreed upon parameters on which the countries can be classified as "Emerging Economies", several firms have developed detailed methodologies to identify the top performing emerging economies every year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Analytics - Pathways to identifying top performing Emerging Markets|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KimberleeLuce/emerging-markets-pathways-to-selection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBVA Research==
In November 2010, [[BBVA]] Research introduced a new economic concept, to identify key emerging markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbvaresearch.com/KETD/fbin/mult/2014_EAGLEs_Economic_Outllok-Annual_tcm348-437158.pdf?ts=3132014&lt;/ref&gt;
This classification is divided into two sets of developing economies.

As of March 2014, the groupings are as follows:

'''EAGLEs''' ([[emerging and growth-leading economies]]): Expected Incremental GDP in the next 10 years to be larger than the average of the G7 economies, excluding the US.

'''NEST''': Expected Incremental GDP in the next decade to be lower than the average of the G6 economies (G7 excluding the US) but higher than Italy’s.

==Emerging Market Bond Index Global==
The [[JPMorgan EMBI|Emerging Market Bond Index Global]] (EMBI Global) by J.P. Morgan was the first comprehensive EM sovereign index in the market, after the EMBI+. It provides full coverage of the EM asset class with representative countries, investable instruments (sovereign and quasi-sovereign), and transparent rules.
The EMBI Global includes only USD-denominated emerging markets sovereign bonds and uses a traditional, market capitalization weighted method for country allocation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=EMBI Global and EMBI Global Diversified Rules and Methodology|last=J.P. Morgan|first=|publisher=J.P. Morgan|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=10 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March end 2016, the EMBI Global's market capitalization was $692.3bn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For country inclusion, a country’s GNI per capita must be below the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) for three consecutive years to be eligible for inclusion to the EMBI Global. J.P. Morgan defines the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) as the GNI per capita level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the World GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$), provided by the World Bank annually. An existing country may be considered for removal from the index if its GNI per capita is above the Index Income Ceiling (IIC) for three consecutive years as well as the country’s long term foreign currency sovereign credit rating (the available ratings from all three agencies: S&amp;P, Moody’s &amp; Fitch) is A-/A3/A- (inclusive) or above for three consecutive years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

J.P. Morgan has introduced what is called an “Index Income Ceiling” (IIC), defined as the income level that is adjusted every year by the growth rate of the World GNI per capita, provided by the World Bank as “GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$) annually.” Once a country has GNI per capita below or above the IIC level for three consecutive years, the country eligibility will be determined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* J.P. Morgan has established the base IIC level in 1987 to match the World Bank High Income threshold at US$6,000 GNI per capita.
* Every year, growth in the World GNI per capita figure is applied to the IIC, establishing a new IIC that is dynamic over time.
* This approach ensures that J.P. Morgan's cutoff for index removal is adjusted by the World income growth rate, and not by the inflation rate of a smaller sample of Developed economies.
* This metric essentially incorporates real global growth, global inflation, and currency exchange rate (current USD-denominated) changes.
* Essentially, the introduction of the IIC establishes a higher, more appropriate threshold for country eligibility in the EMBI Global/Diversified.

==Emerging Markets Index==

==Global Growth Generators==
"Global Growth Generators", or [[3G (countries)]], is an alternative classification determined by [[Citigroup]] analysts as being countries with the most promising growth prospects for 2010-2050. These consist of Indonesia, Egypt, seven other emerging countries, and two countries not previously listed before, specifically [[Iraq]] and [[Mongolia]]. There has been disagreement about the reclassification of these countries, among others, for the purpose of acronym creation as was seen with the BRICS.

== Estimating Demand in Emerging Markets ==
Estimating the demand for products or services in emerging markets and developing economies can be complex and challenging for managers. These countries have unique commercial environments and may be limited in terms of reliable data, market research firms, and trained interviewers. Consumers in some of these countries may consider surveys an invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International business: strategy, management, and the new realities|last = Cavusgil, Tamer|first = |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall|year = 2008|isbn = 0-13-173860-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Survey respondents may try to please researchers by telling them what they want to hear rather than providing honest answers to their questions. However some companies have dedicated their entire business units for understanding the dynamics of emerging markets owing to their peculiarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Analytics - Doing Business in Emerging Markets Framework|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KimberleeLuce/emerging-markets-pathways-to-selection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''epicormic shoot''' is a [[shoot]] growing from an '''epicormic bud''', which lies underneath the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of a [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]], [[plant stem|stem]], or [[branch]] of a [[plant]].

==Epicormic buds==
Epicormic buds lie [[Dormancy|dormant]] beneath the bark, their growth [[Apical dominance|suppressed]] by hormones from active shoots higher up the plant. Under certain conditions, they develop into active shoots, such as when damage occurs to higher parts of the plant,&lt;ref name="euclid-glos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary: epicormic buds|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/euclid3/euclidsample/html/glossary.htm#E|work=EUCLID - Eucalypts of Australia |publisher=Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or light levels are increased following removal of nearby plants.&lt;ref name="eb-ref"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science &amp; Technology : : epicormic bud - Assorted references: tree growth|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/189719/epicormic-bud|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epicormic buds and shoots occur in many woody species, but are absent from many others, such as most [[conifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burrows | first1 = G.E. | year = 1990 | title = The role of axillary meristems in coppice and epicormic bud initiation in ''Araucaria cunninghamii'' | url = http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19910650300.html# | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 151 | issue = 3| pages = 293–301 | doi=10.1086/337829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Human [[Horticulture|horticultural]] practices that exploit epicormic growth rely on plants that have epicormic budding capabilities for [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] function in response to [[Crown (botany)|crown]] damage, such as through [[wind]] or [[fire]].&lt;ref name=euclid-glos /&gt;

Epicormic shoots are the means by which trees regrow after [[coppicing]] or [[pollarding]], where the tree's trunk or branches are cut back on a regular cycle. These [[forestry]] techniques cannot be used on species which do not possess strong epicormic growth abilities.

[[Pruning]] leads to growth of suppressed shoots below the cut &amp;ndash; these may be from epicormic buds, but they may also be other growth, such as normal [[bud]]s or small shoots which are only partly suppressed.

==Examples==
[[File:Epicormic Shoots from an Epicormic Bud on Eucalyptus following Bushfire 1, near Anglers Rest, Vic, Aust, jjron 27.3.2005.jpg|thumb|An epicormic shoot sprouts from a ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' tree approximately two years after the extensive [[2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires]]]]
As one of their responses to frequent [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]] which would destroy most other plants, many [[Eucalypt]] [[tree]]s found widely throughout [[Australia]] have extensive epicormic buds which sprout following a fire, allowing the [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of branches from their trunks.&lt;ref name="crc-fire"&gt;{{cite web |title=Effects of fire on plants and animals: individual level |url=http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/units/sbi263/ecology/individual.html |work=Fire ecology and management in northern Australia |publisher=Tropical Savannas CRC &amp; Bushfire CRC |accessdate=27 December 2010 |date=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130175624/http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/units/sbi263/ecology/individual.html |archivedate=30 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="euclid-about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about eucalypts|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/euclid3/euclidsample/html/learn.htm#history|work=EUCLID - Eucalypts of Australia|publisher=Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These epicormic buds are highly protected, set deeper beneath the thick bark than in other tree species, allowing both the buds and [[vascular cambium]] to be [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] from the intense heat.&lt;ref name="crc-fire" /&gt; It should however be noted that not all eucalypt trees possess this means of vegetative recovery,&lt;ref name="euclid-about" /&gt; and the ability of a tree to survive and re-sprout depends on many factors, such as fire intensity, scorch height, and tree height, species, age, and size.&lt;ref name="crc-fire" /&gt; [[Eucalyptus marginata|Jarrah]] trees, found in the south-west of [[Western Australia]], have epicormic buds which are activated after a bushfire or other extreme conditions.

The mediterranean ''[[Quercus suber]]'' (cork oak) resprouts from epicormic buds after fire.&lt;ref&gt;Pausas, J.G. 1997. Resprouting of Quercus suber in NE Spain after fire. J. Veg. Sci. 8: 703-706. [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3237375]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dogwood]] trees {{endash}} which are susceptible to a [[Fungus|fungal]] infection known as dogwood [[anthracnose]] (''[[Discula destructiva]]'') {{endash}} will sometimes send out epicormic shoots when they are dying from the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-0551/ Dogwood Diseases in Alabama]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[ash trees]] may develop epicormic shoots when infested by the [[emerald ash borer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/26856.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicormic shoots can be used in mass [[Plant propagation|propagation]] of [[oak]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harmer | first = R. | title = Production and Use of Epicormic Shoots for the Vegetative Propagation of Mature Oak | journal = Forestry | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–316 | year = 1988 | url = http://forestry.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/4/305-a |doi=10.1093/forestry/61.4.305-a| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-lived ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' forms epicormic shoots not in response to damage but as a means of forming growth on existing branches. The epicormic branching pattern has been observed to six iterations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/edford/long_lived.html ''Crown development of long-lived trees''] [[University of Washington]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irene Kaminka Fischer''' (born July 27, 1907 in [[Vienna]], died October 22, 2009 in [[Boston]]) was a mathematician, [[Geodesy|geodesist]], [[National Academy of Engineering]] Member; Fellow [[International Geophysical Union]], Inductee of the [[National Imagery and Mapping Agency]] Hall of Fame. Fischer became one of two internationally known women scientists in the field of geodesy during the golden age of the Mercury and [[Apollo moon mission]]s. Her Mercury Datum, or [[Fischer Ellipsoid]] 1960 and 1968, as well as her work on the [[lunar parallax]], were instrumental in conducting these missions. "In his preface to the ACSM publication, Fischer's former colleague, [[Bernard Chovitz]], referred to her as one of the most renowned geodesists of the third quarter of the twentieth century. Yet this fact alone makes her one of the most renowned geodesists of all times, because, according to Chovitz, the third quarter of the twentieth century witnessed "the transition of geodesy from a regional to a global enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fig.net/pub/underrep_news/200502/newsletter200502.htm "Irene K. Fischer, Geodesist]." By Wendy J. W. Straight. NEWSLETTER NO. 2/05, JOINT COMMISSION WORKING GROUP ON UNDER-REPRESENTED GROUPS IN SURVEYING.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born and educated in Vienna, Austria, she studied [[descriptive geometry|descriptive]] and [[projective geometry]] at the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and mathematics at the University of Vienna. Her teachers [[Moritz Schlick]] and [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] were among the luminaries of the [[Vienna Circle]]; and her fellow students included physicist [[Victor Weisskopf]], sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], and social psychologist [[Marie Jahoda]]. Her father, Rabbi {{ill|Aharon Kaminka|lt=Armand Aharon Kaminka|de|Armand Kaminka}}, was head of the [[Maimonides Institute]], and regularly led high holiday services at the famed Vienna [[Musikverein]]. He worked for the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] investigating [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe and raised money in the U.S. and Western Europe to help victims.

In 1931 she married historian and geographer [[Eric Fischer]], who helped introduce American, as distinct from British, history to Vienna. The Fischer family established and ran the 1843-founded Vienna [[Israelitische Kinderbewahranstalt (Vienna)|Israelitische Kinderbewahranstalt]], the first professional kindergarten and kindergarten teacher training school in Vienna, a place that also became a refuge for immigrants to Vienna from Eastern Europe.

==Career in Mathematics==
In 1939, the Fischers, with their young daughter, Gay, fled Nazi Austria, traveling by rail to Italy, by boat to Palestine and in 1941 by boat around [[East Africa]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Boston, where they lived with Eric Fischer's sister, mother, and brother in law, the physician [[Otto Ehrentheil]] and their two daughters. Looking for jobs, Irene Fischer first worked as a seamstress’ assistant, then she graded blue books for [[Wassily Leontief]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and for [[Norbert Wiener]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). She also worked on stereoscopic projective geometry trajectories for John Rule at MIT. She taught mathematics at [[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols|Brown and Nichols Preparatory School]] in Cambridge, and then at [[Sidwell Friends School|Sidwell Friends]] in Washington, D.C.

After World War II, and after her son, Michael, born in 1946, had reached school age, she found a job at the then [[Army Map Service]], now the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Army Geospatial Center]] in Potomac, Md., working under [[John A. O'Keefe (astronomer)|John A. O'Keefe]] in the Geodesy Branch and rising through the ranks to become the chief. Her twenty-five-year career at AMS, working on what became the [[World Geodetic System]], produced over 120 scientific publications. On the side, she published a high school geometry textbook in 1965 one of her many endeavors as an educator. After retiring in 1975, she wrote a memoir of her scientific career that was first serialized in the ACSM Bulletin (an official publication of five surveying and mapping professional organizations, 2004 – 06) covering the field of geodesy in the years 1951–1975, and discussing doing science in a man’s world in a government bureaucracy. It was published as a book in 2005.

At the very beginning of her career in mathematics and geodesy, Dr. Fischer had quickly taught herself the basics of geodetic tables, [[Datum (geodesy)|datums]], transformations, gravity studies, astronomy, long lines, flare triangulation, and guided missile ballistics. Her updates to geodetic science helped determine the [[parallax]] of the moon. Irene Fischer was also intrigued by research into post glacial uplift, and her geoid studies went hand in hand with investigations of the lingering effects of the last ice age.

Dr. Fischer disagreed with the established figure for the oblateness of the earth (the fraction by which the polar axis is foreshortened by the equatorial radius), which had remained unchallenged since 1924. She was forbidden to use her updated figures in her own work because that result was in disagreement with the accepted literature. However, after the flight of the first satellites, she was vindicated by the data and observations from the instruments, and she was allowed to amend her previous works with her newly derived figures. In commenting on the lack of faith others put on her research, Dr. Fischer goodheartedly quipped that the satellites had not accepted the accepted literature, either.

==Legacy==
A pioneer during a time when there were few women in surveying, in 1967, Dr. Fischer was the first Army Map Service employee, and only the third woman ever, to receive the [[Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service|Distinguished Civilian Service Award]]. Dr. Fischer was internationally known for her many publications and presentations on the size and shape of the earth, including the Department of Defense manual, “Latitude Functions Fischer 1960 Ellipsoid.”

Dr. Fischer wrote an autobiography (published 2005), entitled, “Geodesy? What’s That? My Personal Involvement in the Age-Old Quest for the Size and Shape of the Earth, With a Running Commentary on Life in a Government Research Office.” In addition, Dr. Fischer has written more than 120 other technical reports, articles and books in her fields of expertise, and many of her significant government reports are still classified today.

Winner of many Federal Government service awards, Fischer was awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of Karlsruhe]], elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]], elected Fellow of the [[International Geophysical Union]], and inducted into the [[National Imagery and Mapping Agency]] (NIMA) Hall of Fame, and the Learning Center at the new campus of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency has been named in her honor.

==Family==
She and her family were active for many years at Temple Israel in Silver Spring, Md., where she also taught an adult class in basic Hebrew, and was an active member of a forty-year-long [[chavura]] (discussion group). When she moved to Rockville, Md., she joined Congregation Beth Israel and endowed a Biblical archeology lecture series in her husband’s memory at the Rockville Jewish Community Center. In Israel, where many family members live, she and her husband endowed fellowships to a technical college. In 2001 she moved back to Brighton, Mass., three blocks from where she had first lived as an immigrant in 1941. In 2007 she celebrated her 100th birthday, and her children told the packed and rapt audience of her retirement community about her career. She is survived by her daughter Gay Fischer of Oberlin, Ohio, her son [[Michael M.J. Fischer]] and daughter-in-law Susann L. Wilkinson of Somerville, Mass., and many nephews and nieces, the children and grandchildren of her two brothers in Israel, and of her husband’s sister in New England.

* Fischer, Irene K. 1981. "At the dawn of geodesy." Bulletin Géodésique, 1981, Volume 55, Number 2, Page 132. Abstract: The first land surveyors were rope stretchers and rope knotters, remembered in ancient documents and tomb paintings and also in some terminology. The L-shaped carpenter’s square, one of the earliest and most versatile basic tools, represents the observed direction of the plumb line versus the water level and appears as the shadow-casting gnomon and also as the geometrical gnomon in magically-restricted enlargements of altars. The related “Pythagorean” theorem was known in antiquity centuries before Pythagoras, with algebraic proofs in Babylonia and China. The spherical shape of the earth, deduced from the observation of circumpolar stars, was part of a complete equatorial astronomical system in ancient China. But although shadow measurements were generally used to establish north-south distances, only the Greeks derived from them the size of the earth. The striking difference between the abstract, geometric approach of Greece and the concrete, algebraic approach of Babylonia and China represents not a difference in talents but a difference in culture-bound interests.&lt;!--

'''Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center''' ('''JSLC'''; {{zh|c=酒泉卫星发射中心|p=Jiǔquán Wèixīng Fāshè Zhōngxīn}}) is a Chinese [[space vehicle]] launch facility ([[spaceport]]) located in the [[Gobi desert]], [[Inner Mongolia]]. It is part of the '''Dongfeng Aerospace City''' (Base 10).  Although the facility is geographically located within [[Ejin Banner]] of [[Inner Mongolia]]'s [[Alxa League]], it is named after the nearest city, [[Jiuquan]] in [[Gansu Province]].

== History ==
It was founded in 1958, the first of China's four spaceports. More Chinese launches have occurred at Jiuquan than anywhere else. As with all Chinese launch facilities it is remote and generally closed to foreigners.

The Satellite Launch Center is a part of Dongfeng space city ({{lang|zh|东风航天城}}), also known as ''Base 10'' (十号基地) or ''Dongfeng base'' (东风基地), which also includes [[PLAAF]] test flight facilities, a space museum and a martyr's cemetery (东风烈士陵园).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmg.xinhuanet.com/nmgdcy/lvyou/2007-12/05/content_11855918.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724233031/http://www.nmg.xinhuanet.com/nmgdcy/lvyou/2007-12/05/content_11855918.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 24, 2009|title=航天科技游圣地——东风航天城 (The Jerusalem of the space tech journey-Dongfeng space city)|publisher=新华网内蒙古频道 (Xinhua network inner-Mongol channel)|date=December 5, 2007|accessdate=May 7, 2008|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JSLC is usually used to launch vehicles into lower and medium orbits with large orbital inclination angles, as well as testing medium to long-range [[missiles]]. Its facilities are state of the art and provide support to every phase of a satellite launch campaign. The site includes the Technical Center, the Launch Complex, the Launch Control Center, the Mission Command and Control Center and various other logistical support systems.

The center covers 2800&amp;nbsp;km² and may have housing for as many as 20,000 people. The facilities and launch support equipment were likely modelled on Soviet counterparts and the [[Soviet Union]] has likely provided technical support to Jiuquan.

The launch center has been the focus of many of China's ventures into space, including their first [[satellite]] [[Dong Fang Hong]] 1 in 1970, and their first [[manned space mission]] ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' on 15 October 2003.

[[Shenzhou 6]], the second human spaceflight of China, launched on 12 October 2005 on a [[Long March rocket]] from JSLC.

[[Shenzhou 7]], the third human spaceflight mission of the Chinese space program, was launched from JSLC on 25 September 2008 by a [[Long March 2F]] (CZ-2F) rocket. The mission, which included an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) carried out by crewmembers [[Zhai Zhigang]] and [[Liu Boming (astronaut)|Liu Boming]], marked the commencement of the second phase of the Chinese government's [[Project 921]].

China's fourth crewed spaceflight, [[Shenzhou 9]], launched from JSLC on 16 June 2012 at 18:37 local time (10:37 GMT). The 13-day mission included China's first female astronaut and docked with the country's Tiangong-1 space station module on Monday, 18 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Long March 2F/G launches Shenzhou-9 on historic mission, NASASpaceflight.com, June 16, 2012 [http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/06/chinese-long-march-2fg-launch-historic-shenzhou-9-mission/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, China launched the first quantum communication satellite, the "[[Quantum Experiments at Space Scale]]", from the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/33760-china-launches-quantum-communications-satellite.html |title=China Launches Pioneering 'Hack-Proof' Quantum-Communications Satellite |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 16, 2016 |website=space.com |publisher=[[Space.com]] |access-date=August 16, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Chinese private rocket manufacturing startups [[I-Space (Chinese company)|i-Space]] and [[OneSpace]] launched [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|sub-orbital]] rockets from the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/chinese-startups-onespace-ispace-succeed-with-suborbital-launches/|title=Chinese startups OneSpace, iSpace succeed with suborbital launches|last=Jones|first=Andrew|date=2018-09-07|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|ShortSummary=Will has to confront a demon from his past when his former schoolmaster comes to stay uninvited, much to the disgust of his wife [[Anne Hathaway (wife of Shakespeare)|Anne]].

|DirectedBy=Richard Boden
|WrittenBy=Ben Elton
|OriginalAirDate={{start date|2017|10|2|df=y}}
|ShortSummary=Will takes it badly when everybody tells him his new play about two sets of identical twins separated at birth and given the same names is rather far-fetched until he hits on a sure fire way to stop any audience minding when the plot gets really ridiculous – make it a musical. In fact, he's going to make it the first ever musical. And to really guarantee a hit he wants to use the songs of [[Thomas Morley]] ([[Noel Fielding]]), a rocking, rolling, madrigal-composing, tax-avoiding Tudor music legend.

|Title=Beware My Sting!
|Aux1=''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''
|DirectedBy=Richard Boden
|WrittenBy=Ben Elton
|OriginalAirDate={{start date|2017|10|9|df=y}}
|ShortSummary=Will is thrilled with his new play, ''The Taming of the Shrew'', in which a bright and strong-minded young woman is crushed and humiliated into submission by the man in her life. For some reason, Kate is less than impressed, and back in Stratford his wife Anne isn’t convinced either. Will thinks the solution is to try out a bit of 'taming' on his very stroppy teenage daughter [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]]. But it turns out what works in a play doesn’t always work out quite so well when it comes to real life.

|ShortSummary=''Romeo and Juliet'' is finally finished, and the only problem is now who will play the young lovers. [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and [[Henry Condell|Condell]] see themselves in the title roles of course, but is there a polite way for Will to tell them they may no longer look like young teenage lovers? Kate would give anything to take to the stage, but she can't possibly be Juliet as she's a girl, and lady-acting is illegal in Tudor England.

|ShortSummary=As Will attempts to convince everyone that his upcoming ''[[Hamlet]]'' is not, in fact, a comedy, he has to get to work on creating an actual [[Love's Labour's Lost|new comedy]].

Will's newest play, ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', is also about an oppressed outsider. However, Will has trouble deciding what kind of outsider he should be, and even more trouble in getting his acting troupe to accept it with a straight face - especially when played by "the actor, Wolf Hall" ([[Ben Miller]]).

|ShortSummary=It is a time of betrayal at the Red Lion Theatre, as Will plots to remove Condell from all his female roles, while Condell turns on Burbage for hogging the limelight.

This list includes all [[List of impact craters on Earth#All craters listed alphabetically|31 confirmed impact craters]] in [[Asia]] and [[Russia]] as listed in the [[Earth Impact Database]]. These features were caused by the collision of large [[meteorites]] or [[comets]] with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to an estimate of original [[rim (craters)|rim]] diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features.

For additional geographic grouping, non-[[Siberia]]n Russian craters include the region's [[Federal districts of Russia|federal district]].

== Unconfirmed impact craters ==
{{main|List of unconfirmed impact craters on Earth}}
The following craters are officially considered "unconfirmed" because they are not listed in the Earth Impact Database.  Due to stringent requirements regarding evidence and peer-reviewed publication, newly discovered craters or those with difficulty collecting evidence generally are known for some time before becoming listed.  However, entries on the unconfirmed list could still have an impact origin disproven.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9296">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines'''. These are the mammal species in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], of which 0 are critically endangered, 1 is endangered, 2 are vulnerable, and 0 are near-threatened. One species is classified as extinct.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

'''Mérida Province''' was a [[province]] of the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 17th century (1622–1676), with [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] as its capital. It was part of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], and was formed initially in 1607 with a merger with the [[La Grita Province]], forming an administrative unit below province status (''Corregimiento de Mérida y La Grita''), which it attained in 1622. In 1676 it merged with [[Maracaibo]] to form what became known as [[Maracaibo Province (Spanish Empire)|Maracaibo Province]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">'''"Not A Cornfield"''' was a 2005 art project that transformed a {{convert|32|acre|m2|sing=on}} industrial [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] (today part of [[Los Angeles State Historic Park]] in the historic center of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) into a [[Maize|cornfield]] for one agricultural cycle.  The project took place north of [[Chinatown, Los Angeles, California|Chinatown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{"'}}Not a Cornfield' Idea Is Food for Thought; It's fresh, but is it art?" (12 Sep 2005) ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Bon created this work with funds from the [[Annenberg Foundation]] and considered the piece to be a [[sculpture]].  The installation cost $3 million and took place at the proposed site of Los Angeles State Historic Park, which had been referred to as "The Cornfield", because of the crops growing there prior to its industrial development.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;"L.A. THEN AND NOW; Pasadena's Gold Line Will Travel a History-Laden Route" (13 July 2008) ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Fifteen hundred truck loads of [[soil]] were transported to the site and one million seeds were planted.

Some people complained that the project delayed the construction of the public park at that site, that the project was approved too quickly, and that it was a waste of money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/publicart01bk.htm 'Not a Cornfield' idea is food for thought] by Daniel Hernandez&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_25682.shtml 32 Acre Living Sculpture, Not a Cornfield, Rises in Los Angeles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308174258/http://yubanet.com/artman/publish/article_25682.shtml |date=2006-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a small edible garden in the cornfield, and the site was used for film screenings and [[drum circle]]s.  Group and school tours were available.

The corn was harvested in November and December 2005, allowed to dry and put on display in the nearby empty Capital Milling Co. building for six months.  It was then used for the production of [[biodegradable]] containers.  The project left behind fertile soil.

"Not A Cornfield" was located at 1201 North Spring Street, Los Angeles, California, 90012.

Parc de la Villette is served by [[Paris Métro]] stations [[Corentin Cariou (Paris Métro)|Corentin Cariou]] on [[Paris Métro Line 7|Line 7]] and [[Porte de Pantin (Paris Métro)|Porte de Pantin]] on [[Paris Métro Line 5|Line 5]].

==History==
[[File:Les abattoirs de la Villette en 1867.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The abattoir at La Villette at its opening in 1867.]]
The park was designed by [[Bernard Tschumi]], a French architect of Swiss origin, who built it from 1984 to 1987 in partnership with [[Colin Fournier]], on the site of the huge Parisian ''abattoirs'' (slaughterhouses) and the national wholesale meat market, as part of an urban redevelopment project. The slaughterhouses, built in 1867 on the instructions of [[Napoléon III]], had been cleared away and relocated in 1974. Tschumi won a major design competition in 1982–83 for the park, and he sought the opinions of the deconstructionist philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in the preparation of his design proposal.

Since the creation of the park, museums, concert halls, and theatres have been designed by several noted contemporary architects, including [[Christian de Portzamparc]], Adrien Fainsilber, Philippe Chaix, Jean-Paul Morel, Gérard Chamayou,on to Mr. Tschumi.

Since its completion in 1987, the Parc de la Villette has become a popular attraction for [[Paris]] residents and international travelers alike. An estimated 10 million people visit the park each year to take part in an array of cultural activities. With its collection of museums, theatres, architectural follies, themed gardens, and open spaces for exploration and activity, the park has created an area that relates to both adults and children.

Designed by [[Bernard Tschumi]], the park is meant to be a place inspired by the post-modernist architectural ideas of [[deconstructivism]]. Tschumi’s design was in partial response to the philosophies of [[Jacques Derrida]], acting as an architectural experiment in space (through a reflection on Plato's [[Khôra]]), form, and how those relate a person’s ability to recognize and interact.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida Limited Inc (Northwestern University Press, 2000) p. 21-22, 140-142.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Tschumi, the intention of the park was to create space for activity and interaction, rather than adopt the conventional park mantra of ordered relaxation and self-indulgence. The vast expanse of the park allows for visitors to walk about the site with a sense of freedom and opportunity for exploration and discovery.

The design of the park is organized into a series of points, lines, and surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Berman “Le Parc de la Villette, Paris” Galinsky.com/buildings/villette/. 1999 Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  These categories of spatial relation and formulation are used in Tschumi’s design to act as means of deconstructing the traditional views of how a park is conventionally meant to exist.

==Activities==

The Parc de la Villette boasts activities that engage all people of all ages and cultural backgrounds. The park is a contemporary melting pot of cultural expression where local artists and musicians produce exhibits and performances. On the periphery of the park lies the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]], the largest science museum in Europe. There is a convention center and an I-MAX theatre. The park acts as a connection between these exterior functions. Concerts are scheduled year round, hosting local and mainstream musicians. Dividing the park is the [[Canal de l'Ourcq]], which has boat tours that transport visitors around the park and to other sites in Paris. Festivals are common in the park along with artist conventions and shows by performers.

The Parc de la Villette hosts an annual open-air film festival. In 2010 the festival's theme was "To Be 20" ("Avoir 20 ans") and featured films about youth and self-discovery around the age of 20. In 2010 films were shown by American filmmakers [[Woody Allen]] and [[Sofia Coppola]] as well as French and international filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyhabitat.com/blog/2010/07/06/paris-annual-open-air-film-festival New York Habitat Blog "Paris’ Annual Open Air Film Festival"] 2010-07-06 Retrieved 2010-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardens==
[[File:Jardin Treille Villette Mai 2016 033.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The ''Jardin de la Treille''.]]

The Parc de la Villette has a collection of ten themed gardens that attract a large amount of the park’s visitors. Each garden is created with a different representation of architectural deconstructionism and tries to create space through playfully sculptural and clever means. While some of the gardens are minimalist in design, others are clearly constructed with children in mind.

Le "Jardin du Dragon" (The Garden of the Dragon) is home to a large sculptural steel dragon that has an 80&amp;nbsp;ft slide for children to play on.&lt;ref&gt;“Parc de la Villette: Modern Park in Paris” Paris-Walking-Tours.com. Retrieved 2010-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Jardin de Bambou" (Bamboo Garden) at the Parc de la Villette was designed by [[Alexandre Chemetoff]],&lt;ref name="Chemetoff2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chemetoff|first=Alexandre|title=Visits: Town and Territory : Architecture in Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKBjPgAACAAJ|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=3 August 2009|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-0346-0112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; winner of the [[Grand Prix de l'urbanisme]] (2000).

The "Jardin de la Treille" (Trellis Garden) designed by Gilles Vexlard and Laurence Vacherot. Vines and creepers are going along a roof trellis and 90 small fountains designed so that you only really hear the murmur of them in between the grape vines. 
7 ''Sculptures de visées'' ([[Sculptures Bachelard]]) by [[Jean-Max Albert]]&lt;ref&gt;''Jean-Max Albert's observation sculptures'' Sarah Mc Fadden, The Bulletin N° 24, Bruxelles, June 16th 1994&lt;/ref&gt; are installed all around and an anamorphosis refection is displayed in a small pool.&lt;ref&gt;François Lamarre, ''Jean-Max Albert illusioniste éclectique'', L’empreinte N° 27, décembre 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The gardens range in function; where some gardens are meant for active engagement, others exist to play off of curiosity and investigation or merely allow for relaxation.

==Follies==
Probably the most iconic pieces of the park, the [[folly|follies]] act as architectural representations of deconstruction. In architecture, a folly is a building constructed primarily for decoration, but either suggesting by its appearance some other purpose, or merely so extravagant that it transcends the normal range of garden ornaments or other class of building to which it belongs. Thirty-five follies are placed on a grid and offer a distinct organization to the park. Architecturally, the follies are meant to act as points of reference that help visitors gain a sense of direction and navigate throughout the space.&lt;ref&gt;J. Daniel Pugh “Parc de la Villette, Paris” 2004-09-30 Retrieved 2010-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the follies are meant to exist in a deconstructive vacuum without historical relation, many have found connections between the steel structures and the previous buildings that were part of the old industrial fabric of the area.&lt;ref&gt;John Hill “Parc de la Villette” Archidose.org. Retrieved 2010-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the follies remain as cues to organization and direction for park visitors. Some of them house restaurants, information centers, and other functions associated with the park’s needs.

==Architectural deconstructivism and the park==
[[File:Parc-de-la-villette.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Footbridges and "follies" along the Canal de l'Ourcq with [[Le Zénith]] then the Grands Moulins de [[Pantin]] in the background]]
[[File:Parc de La Villette @ Paris (28672614270).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Opposite view with the junction of Canal de l'Ourcq and Canal Saint-Denis.]]
There have been many criticisms of the innovative design of the park since its original completion. To some, the park has little concern with the human scale of park functions and the vast open space seem to challenge the expectation that visitors may have of an urban park. Bernard Tschumi designed the Parc de la Villette with the intention of creating a space that exists in a vacuum, something without historical precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Tschumi, Cinégramme folie: le Parc de la Villette (Princeton Architectural Press, 1987) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  The park strives to strip down the signage and conventional representations that have infiltrated architectural design and allow for the existence of a “non-place.” This non-place, envisioned by Tschumi, is the most appropriate example of space and provides a truly honest relationship between the subject and the object.&lt;ref&gt;A. Papadakēs Deconstruction in Architecture (Academy Editions, 1988) p. 20-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors view and react to the plan, landscaping, and sculptural pieces without the ability to cross-reference them with previous works of historical architecture. The design of the park capitalizes on the innate qualities that are illustrated within architectural deconstructivism. By allowing visitors to experience the architecture of the park within this constructed vacuum, the time, recognitions, and activities that take place in that space begin to acquire a more vivid and authentic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Tschumi Disjunctions (MIT Press, 1987.) p. 108-119.&lt;/ref&gt;  The park is not acting as a spectacle; it is not an example of traditional park design such as New York City’s [[Central Park]]. The Parc de la Villette strives to act as merely a frame for other cultural interaction.

The park embodies anti-tourism, not allowing visitors to breeze through the site and pick and choose the sites they want to see. Upon arrival in the park, visitors are thrust into a world that is not defined by conventional architectural relationships. The frame of the park, due to its roots in deconstructivism, tries to change and react to the functions that it holds within.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Tschumi and Yokio Futagawa Bernard Tschumi “Parc de la Villette” (A.D.A. Edita, 1997) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary [[cartography]]''', or cartography of extraterrestrial objects (CEO), is the cartography of solid objects outside of the [[Earth]]. Planetary maps can show any spatially mapped characteristic (such as [[topography]], geology, and geophysical properties) for extraterrestrial surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/ceps/ica/glossary.htm#2 |title=ICA Multilingual Glossary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304044513/http://www.nasm.si.edu/ceps/ica/glossary.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products of planetary cartography==

*'''[[Albedo map]]''' shows the measured difference in surface reflectivity from the surface of celestial body.
*'''[[Atlas]]''' is a special collection of images of a celestial body surface. The images may be from either ground-based or spacecraft sources. Usually a single scale or set of scales is used throughout the atlas. Atlases can have specific themes (e.g., photographic, specialized to certain problems, thematic, etc.).
*'''[[Complex (integrated) atlas]]''' of groups of celestial bodies is a systematic collection of maps of a group of celestial bodies (e.g., the terrestrial planets, satellites of the gas-giant planets, etc.), giving a capability for the analysis of the collected information through comparative planetology.
*'''[[Geochemical map]]''' shows the distribution of chemical elements or minerals on the surface of a celestial body.
*'''[[Geologic map]]''' is a graphic representation generalizing the geological history of the area covered by the map. It includes information on the structure, distribution, age, and genetic type of rocks on the surface of the celestial body.
*'''[[Geologic/morphologic map]]''' shows the spatial distribution of geologic, geomorphologic, and tectonic features on a celestial body.
*'''[[Geomorphic map]]''' is a graphic representation of the distribution of surface morphological types portrayed in the landforms on a planetary body. Geomorphic maps do not attempt to infer the geologic history of the rocks themselves, but rather the processes that have generated the present surface features.
*'''[[Geophysical map]]''' shows a variety of geophysical information in a spatial representation (such as gravimetric, seismic, and magnetic anomaly maps).
*'''[[Globe]]''' is cartographic representation of the surface of a planetary body on a three-dimensional shape (which can be spherical or non-spherical, such as a tri-axial ellipsoid), preserving the geometric similarity of both locations and outlines features. Globes of spherical planets and irregular objects (e.g., the Martian moon Phobos, the asteroid Eros) have been produced from imaging and remote sensing data obtained from a variety of sources.
*'''[[Hypsometric map]]''' shows the macro-relief features on a planetary surface (for maps produced in Russia). The relief is represented by means of contours or isolines (to show areas at the same relative elevation), and color-coded contour intervals. In other countries, this term can also describe the distribution of elevations on the extraterrestrial object.
*'''[[Landing site map]]''' in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of the region surrounding the site where a spacecraft came to rest on a planetary surface (generally shown at large scale).
*'''Map in planetary cartography''' is a generalized image of the surface of an extraterrestrial solid body (excluding the Earth), that indicates the location of objects projected mathematically according to the adopted coordinate system used for the projection. Symbols can represent any subject, phenomena or process chosen by the cartographer to be illustrated on the map (a legend defining all symbols should be included to aid the map user). Maps of extraterrestrial territories represent all solar system bodies, with the exception of the Earth; they can be portrayed in a variety of forms, such as electronic (e.g., digital), conventional (printed), multilingual, orthophoto, drawing (e.g., shaded relief), outline, topographic (contoured), and thematic. &lt;!-- Should this item be moved into the lead section? --&gt;
*'''[[Outline map]]''' in planetary cartography is a map representing relief with the help of outlines and special symbols. These maps are used as base-maps for thematic and schematic mapping, which allows the user to link visually a represented attribute with a relief feature on the surface.
*'''[[Physical properties map]]''' is a maps of various measured attributes of the extraterrestrial surface, such as albedo (see albedo, in this section), thermal anomalies (e.g., the distribution of hotspots on the Earth-facing hemisphere of the Moon), and polarimetric measurements.
*'''[[Synoptic map]]''' in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of attributes (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.) that describe the weather above a planetary surface (e.g., a map of weather on Mars).
*'''[[Tectonic map]]''' in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of structural elements related to the tectonic history of the upper crust of a planetary body. The different structural areas and their separate elements (e.g., faults and folds) are shown by various symbols; when combined with a geologic map, data regarding the age and type of rocks comprising the structural elements are given, along with their development in time.
*'''[[Thematic map]]''' in planetary cartography is a map showing the spatial representation of physical properties for a planetary surface (e.g., hypsometric, geophysical, geologic-morphologic, and geochemical maps).
*'''[[Terrain map]]''' in planetary cartography is a graphic representation of the distribution of boundaries between mapped regions on the planetary body, showing the presence or absence of characteristic details of a surface (e.g., impact craters, hills, faults, lava flows, aeolian cover, etc.). Such maps are usually produced by data obtained by remote sensing. See also geologic/morphologic map, photogeologic map.

'''Robert Bell''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|ISO|FRSC}} (June 3, 1841 &amp;ndash; June 18, 1917) was a Canadian [[Geology|geologist]], [[professor]] and [[civil servant]]. He is considered one of Canada’s greatest exploring scientists, having named over 3,000 geographical features.&lt;ref name=DoDAM&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hafner, Arthur Wayne |date= |title=Directory of Deceased American Physicians, 1804-1929: a genealogical guide to over 149,000 medical practitioners providing brief biographical sketches drawn from the American Medical Association's Deceased Physician Masterfile |location=Chicago |publisher=American Medical Association |year=1993 |isbn=9780899705279 |oclc=27715765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Robert Bell was born in [[Toronto]], [[Upper Canada]] to [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[clergy]] and amateur geologist, Reverend [[Andrew Bell (minister)|Andrew Bell]] and Elizabeth Notman.&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Bell, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, Bell married Agnes Smith. They had a son and three daughters. He spent his retirement at his home in [[Ottawa]] and his farm in [[Rathwell, Manitoba]]. Bell died after a brief illness at the age of 76 at his farm.

==Early beginnings==
In 1856, at the age of 15 years old, Bell worked as a summer assistant to [[William Edmond Logan]] with the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC). Even as he started postsecondary education, he continued to work summers with the GSC, heading his own survey party in 1859.

Bell attended [[McGill University]], [[Montreal]], and studied under [[John William Dawson]]. In 1861, Bell earned a civil engineering degree with the Governor General’s Medal. He went on to study for two years at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1878, he earned a medical degree from McGill University.

==Career==
In 1863, Bell became a chemistry and natural sciences professor at [[Queen’s University|Queen’s College]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He continued to do fieldwork for the GSC over the summers. In 1867, he left Queen’s to join the GSC full-time.

In 1869, the GSC made Bell a permanent officer, and he spent the rest of his career there. He was promoted to Assistant Director (1877), Chief Geologist (1890), then Acting Director (1901-1906). He was saddened that he was never appointed Director of the Survey. In November 1908, Bell retired.

During his 52-year career at the GSC, Bell led many extensive explorations in northern Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, the eastern [[Arctic]], Saskatchewan prairies and the [[Athabasca oil sands]]. He is credited with mapping the rivers between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Lake Superior]].

As was the case with all GSC geologists of the time, Bell collected specimens and made notes on geology, flora and fauna, indigenous populations, climate and soil and exploitable resources. His GSC colleagues dubbed him the father of Canadian place-names because he is credited with naming over 3,000 geographical features in Canada. Bell wrote over 200 reports and papers, mostly on geology, biology, geography and ethnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=BELL, Robert|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, he saw his extensive body of fieldwork put to a significant purpose. The planners of the third trans-continental railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific, were able to use the vast compendium of information in Bell's reports as the preliminary reconnaissance work required to plan the track route from Quebec to Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Stone Unturned: The First 150 Years of the Geological Survey of Canada|last=Vodden|first=Christy|publisher=Minister of Supply and Services|year=1992|isbn=|location=Ottawa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private library==
Bell assembled a private library estimated to contain 26 tons of books and artifacts to support his life’s work. The collection contained rock specimens and hundreds of books on various subjects ranging from natural history texts, medical texts, geological reports, native language and culture texts and books on the exploration of North America. It also contained research and professional periodicals, several Canadian newspapers and several hundred reprints of scientific and professional reports from other researchers.

On October 28, 1962, some of this collection was damaged or destroyed in a fire in Ottawa. Subsequently, the surviving collection was dispersed to family, private collectors and institutions. The majority went to the [[Library and Archives Canada|National Archives of Canada]].

'''SailTimer''' is a technology for sailboat navigation, which calculates optimal [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] angles, distances and times.

Seafarers have had a dilemma for as long as sailboats could use [[lift (force)|lift]] to sail upwind.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5:  The Wind and How It Makes a Sailboat Go.  From: O'Day, George D. (1967).  '''Sail in a Day!''', Grosset &amp; Dunlap Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolofsailing.net/pointsofsail.html Points of Sail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104023609/http://www.schoolofsailing.net/pointsofsail.html |date=2012-01-04 }} , SchoolofSailing.net, Burlington, VT USA.  Viewed Dec. 27 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Should you head off the wind more, to get more speed (but at a longer distance)?  Or should you sail upwind more, to lessen the distance (but at slower speed)?

Different sailboats have varying capabilities for sailing upwind&lt;ref&gt;[http://jtmsailing.com/article.php?id=22&amp;titleAdd=Sailing_Upwind Sailing Upwind (Tutorial)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061013/http://jtmsailing.com/article.php?id=22&amp;titleAdd=Sailing_Upwind |date=2012-04-26 }} , Leo Robbins Community Sailing Center, Ventura CA, USA.  Viewed Dec. 18 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the condition of their sails, the type of rigging, and the ability to track in the water based on their keel or centerboard design.  That means there is not a single rule for everyone;  each vessel has its own individual [[polar plot]] of boat speed for all of the possible wind angles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.najad.se/pages/najad-505-polar-plot Polar plot for Najad 505] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061209/http://www.najad.se/pages/najad-505-polar-plot |date=2012-04-26 }}.

Morris Yachts, Maine, USA. Viewed Dec. 18 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical calculations for determining the tacking angles and times with polar plots would not be practical to do mentally.

==Rationale==
Civilian access to [[GPS]] navigation became available circa 1989.  [[Estimated time of arrival]] (ETA) is a standard GPS [[chartplotter]] parameter, based on the assumption that the route will be a straight line to the destination.  However, sailboats typically tack back and forth, creating a longer distance than a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesailinggps.com/VMGarticle.pdf Bad News for "Velocity Made Good"]: '''GAM on Yachting''' magazine, Toronto, Canada, May–June 2009, pp. 26-30. (836k PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

SailTimer evaluates tacking distances and boat speeds on different [[points of sail]] to determine optimal tacking headings.  During the original development of the SailTimer software in 2005-2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MotionParallax.com/TCDVDs/4versions/Media.html 2006 Press Releases].  History of product announcements for SailTimer Inc. at SailTimerInc.com, Viewed Dec. 18 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the term TTD (tm) was coined for "Tacking Time to Destination".

==Safe Navigation==
Sailboats can be pushed downwind by the wind, or can use lift to move across or into the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4:  Sail Theory.  From: Jeffrey, T. (1987).  '''Practical Sailing: The Modern Cruising Yacht''', Gallery Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for most sailboats the boat speed drops if sailing closer than 45 degrees to the wind.&lt;ref&gt;Techniques: Basic Sailing Maneuvers.  From: Bond, B. (1967).  '''The Complete Book of Sailing: A Guide to Boats, Equipment, Tides &amp; Weather, Basic, Advanced &amp; Competition Sailing''', The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, London England.&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest speed for most sailboats is [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] with the wind from the side or the aft quarter (a beam reach or a broad reach).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolofsailing.net/pointsofsail.html Points of Sail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104023609/http://www.schoolofsailing.net/pointsofsail.html |date=2012-01-04 }} , SchoolofSailing.net, Burlington, VT USA.  Viewed Dec. 27 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the destination is upwind but the sailboat goes fastest heading away from this direction, this poses a significant problem:  how to choose tack headings with the best tradeoff between maximimizing speed and minimizing distance.  The ability to define an efficient tacking route is an important issue in sailboat racing, and for recreational sailing.  It is also an important issue of navigational safety, so that the sailboat is able to arrive before dark.  Being able to accurately calculate the Tacking Time to Destination also allows a skipper to select a course that avoids bad weather or shipping traffic.

==Versions==
Given the widespread growth of [[smartphones]], a version of SailTimer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.SailTimerApp.com SailTimer software].  www.SailTimerApp.com Viewed Dec. 18 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is available from the [[App Store (iOS)]] for iPhone, iPod and [[iPad]] tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/app/sailtimer/id326309851?mt=8 iTunes Preview].

Viewed Dec. 18 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[artificial intelligence]] algorithm allows it to learn the polar plots for an individual sailboat, which it then uses for making decisions on the optimal tacking route and Tacking Time to Destination.

Sandy Island is an island in the [[Caribbean Sea]] which belongs to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and is part of the British overseas territories . It lies west of [[Anguilla]].

Sandy Island is a small island on which a local restaurant is located. From Sandy Ground Anguilla can be reached in 15 minutes, and the owner of the restaurant takes care of the free boat crossing. The island is small (ca. 250x75 meters), consisting of round white sands with in the middle a little vegetation with shrubs and palm trees.

The island is popular with tourists for the richness of its seabed , the beach of fine sand and coral for the presence of a business (bar / restaurant) famous in the area.

In 1995, the island was submerged by [[Hurricane Luis]] for some days while the facilities were severely damaged by the passage of the next several tropical cyclones and, during one of these storms, vessel went aground on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoceanadventure.com/2001SO/Day17.html 2001: A Sea Odyssey – Sandy Island&lt;!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings were rebuilt later.

Even the flora was damaged by tropical storms, the palm trees and shrubs were uprooted by strong winds giving the island an aspect even more barren, almost without vegetation.

The restaurant was re-built in 2007, however in 2017, [[Hurricane Irma]] destroyed the buildings and vegetation, leaving a bare sand bar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gettingstamped.com/sandy-island-anguilla/ Sandy Island Anguilla]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Save China's Tiger logo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Save China's Tigers, organization logo]]'''Save China's Tigers''' (SCT) is an international charitable foundation based in [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and the United Kingdom (Office in [[London]]) which aims to save the [[big cats]] of China from extinction. It focuses on the Chinese [[tiger]]s ([[South China tigers]]). It also has branches in [[Mainland China]] and [[South Africa]].

==Aims==
[[File:327 with Cathay.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Stud tiger 327 with his potential mate, Cathay]]
The organization's vision is to raise awareness of the plight of the Chinese tiger and to strive for its protection and preservation through public education, introduction and experimentation with advanced [[Wildlife management|conservation]] models in China and abroad, and raising funds to support these initiatives. Another aim is to act as a liaison for all those organizations concerned with the conservation of China's [[wildlife]], [[sustainable development]], [[biodiversity]] and [[habitat]].
The purpose of ''Save China's Tigers'' is to reverse the fate of the [[South China tiger]] from the brink of [[extinction]] by taking them out of zoos, breeding them, letting them regain their hunting abilities, and reintroducing them back to China's wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/222 Overview | Save China's Tigers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's stated goal is to save the South China tiger using this new method of rehabilitation and reintroduction.
No captive-born large [[predator]]s have ever been successfully reintroduced into the wild before.&lt;ref name="YouTube - Save China's Tigers!"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXOsDsPaPRY YouTube - Save China's Tigers!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
It is an experiment to attempt to save a large [[carnivore]] by re-introducing them into the wild.  To achieve this goal, Save China's Tigers is using a combination of [[In-situ conservation|in-situ]] and [[ex-situ conservation]]. The organization is aiming to set a precedent for international wildlife conservation and for zoos throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/37 Founder Ms. Li Quan's Message | Save China's Tigers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Li Quan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Founder of Save China's Tigers, Li Quan]]
"Save China's Tigers" was founded in 2000 by [[Li Quan (wildlife conservationist)| Li Quan]], former fashion executive at [[Gucci]], [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] and [[Fila (company)|Fila]] in Italy. When Li Quan realized the dire state of the South China tigers in the wild and saw the poor conditions in which captive South China tigers were living in China several years ago, she devoted herself to saving the tigers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3IoB1khb4g YouTube - CBS News on saving China's tigers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She established the charitable foundation Save China's Tigers in the UK in 2000, and subsequently in the United States (2002) and [[Hong Kong]] (2003). She engineered the Chinese Tiger Conservation Model after observing and analysing how wildlife conservation and [[eco-tourism]] have succeeded in Africa.
In 2001, Li Quan proposed to China to use South African expertise to help China's Chinese Tiger Rehabilitation &amp; Reintroduction project, which the Chinese started in the 1990s, and invited a South African Team to visit China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/184 History | Save China's Tigers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of their establishment, Save China's Tigers released a photo documentary book known as "Rewilded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tigerliquan.blogspot.com/2010/10/launching-rewilded-in-celebration-of.html Launching "Rewilded" in Celebration of Ten Years of Save China's Tigers  | Li Quan Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rewilding==

===Origin===
The word "[[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]]" was coined by conservationist and activist [[David Foreman|Dave Foreman]],&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Fraser, ''Rewilding the World:  Dispatches from the Conservation Revolution'' (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2009), p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt; first occurring in print in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Foote, "Trying to Take Back the Planet," ''Newsweek'', 5 February 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further defined and expanded by conservation biologists [[Michael Soulé]] and [[Reed Noss]] in a paper published in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Soulé and Reed Noss, "Rewilding and Biodiversity:  Complementary Goals for Continental Conservation," ''Wild Earth'' 8 (Fall 1998) 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Soulé and Noss, rewilding is a conservation method based on "cores, corridors, and carnivores."&lt;ref&gt;Soule and Noss, "Rewilding and Biodiversity," p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first independently used in 2003 by Gus Van Dyk in the concept of carnivore rewilding (having no prior knowledge of its meaning referred to by Foremen and Soule), conservationist and ex-carnivore manager of Pilanesberg National Park, in an effort to find the most appropriate translation of the Chinese term "野化".

===The rewilding process===
[[File:Tigerwoods mounting Madonna.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Tigerwoods mounting Madonna]]
In order to be successfully reintroduced into a wild environment, tigers must know how to hunt prey and have to be able to defend themselves. Once in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], an animal will gradually lose its ability to survive in the wild, and will likely die if released. Thus Save China's Tigers started a rehabilitation programme to help captive tigers regain their survival skills. Rehabilitation steps taken by the project include feeding the tigers with carcasses of small game. Once the tigers are eating the new food items, live animals similar to those taken dead will be occasionally introduced into large hunting camps.

The [[SPCA]] claimed that this process was cruel to the prey, but the courts refused to issue an interdict in terms of South African law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/sca-hears-nspca-tiger-training-appeal-1.400800?ot=inmsa.ArticlePrintPageLayout.ot NSPCA suit against SCT]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to introduce larger games into larger camp like the [[blue wildebeest]]; the tigers have already been provided with [[wildebeest]] [[carrion|carcasses]]. The prey needed for wild training of the tigers do not have to be the same as those in the original [[food chain]] of the tigers, as once a tiger knows how to hunt wild animals of a given size, it should be able to transfer those skills to hunting in the wild.

Ideally, a former zoo tiger which has been rewilded and reintroduced into a natural habitat will not only be able to survive in the wild, but pass necessary skills on to any offspring, thus contributing to the survival of the species. Save China's Tigers has also proved that not only zoo tigers can learn to hunt, they can also learn to hunt by themselves through the "adaptive process". The roles of humans are limited to that monitoring and providing a suitable environment.

Results of a 2010 workshop attended by numerous international experts confirmed the important role of the South China Tiger Rewilding Project in tiger conservation. "Having seen the tigers hunting in an open environment at Laohu Valley Reserve, I believe that these rewilded tigers have the skill to hunt in any environment." Dr. David Smith remarked. As part of the rewilding process, the Save China's Tigers team has assisted in the recovery and rehabilitation of natural habitat both in China and in South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/572 Scientists Confirm the Role of Rewilding Captive Populations to Save the South China Tiger] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728001304/http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/572 |date=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Laohu Valley Reserve==
{{main|Laohu Valley Reserve}}
The [[Laohu Valley Reserve]] (LVR) is a roughly 350 square kilometer private reserve near [[Philippolis]] in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/11/20/rare_tigers_raised_in_africa_to_be_rewilded_in_china/ Rare tigers raised in Africa to be rewilded in China]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been created with the aims of rewilding captive-born South China tigers and for South African biodiversity conservation in general.  LVR was created in 2002 out of 17 defunct sheep farms,&lt;ref name="Liu2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rewilded: Saving the South China Tiger |url=http://www.dimsum.co.uk/features/rewilded-saving-the-south-china-tiger.html |accessdate=27 August 2011 |first=Cecily |last=Liu |date=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929122435/http://www.dimsum.co.uk/features/rewilded-saving-the-south-china-tiger.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blandy2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=South China tiger finds hope in South Africa |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/12/13/2003392378 |accessdate=27 August 2011 |first=Fran |last=Blandy |date=13 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopesStory2011"&gt;{{cite web |title=Save China's Tigers - Hope's Story |url=http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/218 |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and efforts to return the overgrazed land to natural status are ongoing.  The South China tigers at LVR for rewilding are kept confined to a tiger-proof camp complex of roughly 1.8 square kilometers, with other areas of the reserve being used to protect native South African species.  The word "laohu" is a Chinese term for tiger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laohuvalleyreserve.org/background/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tigers involved==
[[File:Hope Tiger.jpeg|180px|thumb|right|Deceased South China tiger, Hope]]
Li Quan persuaded the Chinese government to allow her to bring several captive South China tigers to Africa, where they can start their [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] training. To date, five South China tigers have left the zoos of China and been sent to South Africa for re-wilding training. These tigers include:

# Hope, born on 17 February 2003, got his name from readers of the [[Sunday People]], a British [[newspaper]]. He died on 20 August 2005 in South Africa. His [[necropsy]] report suggested that the primary cause of death was [[pneumonia]] and heart failure.

# Cathay, The female tiger born on 21 January 2003, is named Cathay in acknowledgement of [[Cathay Pacific Airways]] that sponsored the transportation of the Chinese tigers till 2008.

The breeding program has successfully produced several tiger cubs, including:
# Huloo, a male offspring of Tigerwoods and Cathay was born on 23 November 2007, was the first cub to be born through the project. He was separated from his mother at birth because of fears that he would die of exposure, and was hand reared at Lory Park Zoo until he was old enough to return to Laohu Valley.

On August 29th 2013, The Save China's Tigers Project welcomed its first third generation female cub, born to Princess and Huloo.

In April 2014 Madonna gave birth to three cubs, two females and one male. The father of the cubs is Tigerwoods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080902231216/http://www.sagoodnews.co.za/environment/endangered_south_china_tigress_gives_birth_in_sa.html Endangered South China Tigress gives birth in SA | The Good News - South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently in November 20th 2015, two new South China tiger cubs have been born at [[Laohu Valley]]. The mother is Cathay and the father is King Henry. With the birth of these cubs, 20 South China tigers in total are in the care of Save China's Tigers within the Laohu Valley Reserve – more than 20% of the world population of the world's most [[critically endangered]] tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two New Beautiful Cubs!|url=http://savechinastigers.org/news.html|publisher=Savechinastigers.org|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a year later in February 2016, one of two South China tiger cubs recently born in late 2015 died, leaving 19 South China tigers in the reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The South China Tiger Is Functionally Extinct.

Three cubs were born to Madonna; Hunter, Ivan, and Jay. Two cubs to Cathay: Felix and Gilbert. And one cub to Princess known as K, however the cub's gender has yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 NEW CUBS FOR 2016!|url=http://savechinastigers.org/index.html|publisher=Savechinastigers.org|year=2017|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles==
[[File:Stud 327 with Blesbuck.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Stud Tiger 327 with [[blesbuck]] carcass]]
A large difficulty faced by the project is the limited gene pool for South China tigers – all of the South China tigers in Chinese zoos are descended from only 6 individuals caught in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/243&lt;/ref&gt; Since these tigers in captivity have been reproducing with close relatives, the quality of their genes is deteriorating. The project plans to improve living conditions and breed them scientifically – to this end a breeding centre, the David Tang Tiger Breeding Center, has been constructed at the Laohu Valley Reserve.

Mainstream conservationists, however, are not impressed. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] says that the money is being spent in the wrong place and that the [[Amur tiger]] has a better chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-investment-environment-tigers-idUSTRE71F0ZR20110216 Tiger finance, a banker's effort to fund survival]&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest obstacles are from man-made resistance,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} some organizations in China or from abroad kept raising objections and condemn the strategy used to save the tigers, telling the organization to give up. To SCT, these obstacles make the tiger salvation program even tougher.

Proponents of the Chinese Tiger Project argue that the [[South China tiger]] is not only the most ancient tiger species in the world from which all other tiger [[subspecies]] are derived, it has been a [[Tiger#Cultural depictions|cultural symbol]] of China for eight thousand years, so that saving it from the brink of extinction would have a great cultural impact.

==Establishment of South China tiger reserves in China==
Since 2001, Save China's Tigers South African team has been working with the Chinese State Forestry Administration to identify locations for the reintroduction of the rewilded South China tigers. Nine sites from four provinces were surveyed using 36 ecological parameters. Two candidate sites were selected in Jiangxi and Hunan province in early 2005, both of which were approved by the State Forestry Administration by the end of 2005.  Due to the progress of Save China's Tigers rewilding project, the Chinese authorities also decided to look for sites within the nature reserves where there would be fewer human population relocation issues.  In early 2010, a government scientific team identified an interim test site and three final sites, which are now awaiting approval from the relevant central government department.  Save China's Tigers' scientific team is assisting Chinese authorities with fencing technology, re-stocking prey, and building tiger and wildlife management  expertise.

==Save China's Tigers contribution to other conservation areas==
Save China's Tigers, a charitable foundation funding pioneering work with the South China tiger, has broadened its scope of conservation goals from tigers to include all wild cats around the world. On 7 August 2009, it launched the "Wildcat Fund" to encourage and support wild cat [[research]], conservation, and [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|reintroduction]] efforts for highly [[endangered]] and vulnerable wild cats.  Historically, funding in wild cat conservation has favoured the large, charismatic species. While giving priorities to cat species having the IUCN [[endangered]] status or above, the Wildcat Fund encourages projects conducting pioneering biological and ecological research of little known cat species in an effort to increase understanding of these species and help design improved conservation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.savechinastigers.org/node/487 Save China's Tigers to Fund Wild Cat Conservation Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of misuse of funds==
In 2013, Li accused her former husband Stuart Bray of using charitable funds for personal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2525380/Save-Chinese-Tigers-charity-couple-war-assets-marriage-breakdown.html Divorcing couple who 'used tiger charity money to pay a life of luxury' are now at war] Retrieved 27 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physical geography]], a '''steppe''' ({{lang-rus|степь|p=stʲepʲ}}) is an [[ecoregion]], in the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] and [[temperate grasslands, savannas and shrublands]] [[biome]]s, characterized by [[grassland]] [[plain]]s without [[tree]]s apart from those near rivers and lakes. In [[South Africa]], they are referred to as [[veld]]. The [[prairie]] of North America (especially the [[shortgrass prairie|shortgrass]] and mixed prairie) is an example of a steppe, though it is not usually called such. A steppe may be semi-[[desert]] or covered with [[Poaceae|grass]] or [[shrub]]s or both, depending on the [[season]] and [[latitude]]. The term is also used to denote the [[climate]] encountered in regions too dry to support a [[forest]] but not dry enough to be a desert. The [[soil]] is typically of [[chernozem]] type.

Steppes are usually characterized by a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] and [[Continentality|continental]] climate. Extremes can be recorded in the summer of up to {{convert|45|C|F}} and in winter, {{convert|-55|C|F}}. Besides this huge difference between summer and winter, the differences between day and night are also very great. In the highlands of [[Mongolia]], {{convert|30|C|F}} can be reached during the day with sub-zero °C (sub 32&amp;nbsp;°F) readings at night.

[[File:Чубовская степь.JPG|right|thumb|Steppe in [[Russia]]]]

The mid-latitude steppes can be summarized by hot summers and cold winters, averaging {{convert|10|-|20|in|mm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year. Precipitation level alone is not what defines a steppe climate; [[Evapotranspiration#Potential evapotranspiration|potential evapotranspiration]] must also be taken into account.

==Two types==
[[File:windbreakers altai steppe.jpg|right|thumb|Southern [[Siberia]]n steppe: [[windbreak]]er trees in the wintertime]]
Two types of steppe can be recorded:&lt;ref name= ecoregions&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/land/pubs/ecoregions/ecoregions.html|title=Ecoregions of the United States-Ecological Subregions of the United States|publisher= [[U.S. Forest Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]|website= fs.fed.us| accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Temperate steppe: the "true" steppe, found in [[Continentality|continental]] areas of the world; they can be further subdivided, as in the [[Rocky Mountains]] Steppes&lt;ref name="ecoregions"/&gt;
* Subtropical steppe: a similar association of plants that can be found in the driest areas with a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]-like climate; it usually has a short wet period

Peculiar types of steppe include [[shrub-steppe]] and [[alpine-steppe]].

The [[Eurasian Steppe|Eurasian Grass-Steppe]] of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] had a role in the spread of [[The Horse, the Wheel and Language|the horse, the wheel]], and the [[Indo-European languages]]. The [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European expansion]] and diverse invasions of [[horse archer civilizations]] of the steppe eventually led to, e.g., the rise of [[Mycenaean Greece]] by amalgamation of Indo-Europeans with the autochthonous pre-Greek population and also its destruction during the [[Dorian invasion]] in the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]], followed by the demise of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]], the spread of the [[Sea Peoples]], and eventually the rise of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and ultimately [[Classical Greece]].

==Locations==
[[File:Patagonian plains argentina.jpg|left|thumb|Cold Patagonian steppe near Fitz Roy, [[Argentina]]]]

===Cold steppe===

The world's largest steppe region, often referred to as "the [[Great Steppe]]", is found in [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]], and neighbouring countries stretching from [[Ukraine]] in the west through [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[China]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] to the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]], [[Koppet Dag]] and [[Tian Shan]] ranges.

The inner parts of [[Anatolia]] in [[Turkey]], [[Central Anatolia]] and [[East Anatolia]] in particular and also some parts of [[Southeast Anatolia]], as well as much of [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]] are largely dominated by cold steppe.

The [[Pannonian Plain]] is another steppe region in [[eastern Europe]], primarily [[Hungary]].
[[File:Prairie Alberta.jpg|thumb|Prairie in [[Alberta]], Canada]]
Another large steppe area ([[prairie]]) is located in the central [[United States]], [[western Canada]] and northern part of [[Mexico]]. The [[shortgrass prairie]] steppe is the westernmost part of the [[Great Plains]] region. The [[Channeled Scablands]] in Southern [[British Columbia]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] is an example of a steppe region in [[North America]] outside of the Great Plains.

In [[South America]], cold steppe can be found in [[Patagonia]] and much of the high elevation regions east of the southern [[Andes]].

Relatively small steppe areas can be found in the interior of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]].
[[File:2013-07-04 15 37 14 Sagebrush-steppe along U.S. Route 93 in central Elko County in Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sagebrush steppe]] in northeastern [[Nevada]] along [[U.S. Route 93 in Nevada|US 93]]]]

===Subtropical steppe===
In [[Europe]], some [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] areas have a steppe-like vegetation, such as central [[Sicily]] in [[Italy]], southern [[Portugal]], parts of [[Greece]] in the southern [[Athens]] area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Hellenic National Meteorological Service| location= Greece |url= http://www.hnms.gr/hnms/english/climatology/climatology_region_diagrams_html?dr_city=Athens_Hellinikon&amp;dr_region=ClimAttiki |title=Hellinikon |website=HNMS.gr |date= |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and central-eastern [[Spain]], especially the southeastern coast (around [[Murcia]]), and places cut off from adequate moisture due to [[rain shadow]] effects such as [[Zaragoza]].

In [[Asia]], a subtropical steppe can be found in semi-arid lands that fringe the [[Thar Desert]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Badia (region)|Badia]] of the Arabian peninsula.

In [[Australia]], "subtropical steppe" can be found in a belt surrounding the most severe deserts of the continent and around the [[Musgrave Ranges]].

In [[North America]] this environment is typical of transition areas between zones with a Mediterranean climate and true deserts, such as [[Reno, Nevada]], the inner part of [[California]], and much of [[West Texas|western]] [[Texas]] and adjacent areas in [[Mexico]].

'''Teckberg''' is a mountain at ''[[Esslingen (district)|Landkreis Esslingen]]'' in [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany, with an elevation of 775 metres.{{Höhe|775.0|DE-NHN|link=true}}{{GeoQuelle|DE|BFN-Karten}} Situated on top is castle [[Teck]].

== Geography ==

The Teckberg jumps from [[Swabian Jura]] edge from about 3 km towards the north front and overlooks the Albvorland to 350 m, the [[Lauter (Neckar)]] valley to 400 m. He is flanked of the approximately 602 m high foothills Hörnle and [[Hohenbol]] north and northwest. Both Foothills include smokestacks of the Swabian volcano. North below the Hörnle is the glider area Teck (between [[Dettingen unter Teck]] and [[Bissingen an der Teck]]).
The slope of the Teckberg formed by the Yellow Rock, a Schwammriff the Jura sea of bright lime. Under the "Gelber Fels", is the 31 m long and  45 m high Veronikahöhle, which is connected through columns with Verena-Beutlins-Loch. East of the Gelber Fels (Yellow Rock) three grave mounds indicate from the [[Hallstatt period]] (800-400 BC) the early settlement of the Teckberg. Under the castle Teck is the 35 m  long and 9 m high fabled  Sibyllenloch, on the other side the 22 m long Sibyllenhöhle. It was only in 1937 discovered during construction work and was explored in 1977. During excavations in Sibyllenloch 1898/99 over 2,000 skeletal remains of cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena and wild horse were found. So many conclusions about the glacial fauna could be drawn.

==Nature Reserve==
With regulation of the Regierungspräsidium Stuttgart from 9 November 1999, the entire Teckberg  with an area of 386.0 hectares was reported as nature reserve. It was managed to preserve and promote an unusually varied cultural landscape with wet and dry meadows, orchards, hedges, forest fringes, alleys, groves, solitary trees, rocks, caves, springs and rare natural forest communities. These habitats provide a quality habitat for a variety of partly endangered plant and animal species. In the versatile natural area botanists could show 464 different plant species.

'''Telephone numbers in Israel''' consist of an area code and a subscriber number. The [[Telephone numbering plan|dial plan type]] in Israel is closed, and "0" is the internal [[Trunk prefix]] in Israel. Israel's [[List of country calling codes|country calling code]] is +972.

When dialing an Israeli number from inside of [[Israel]], the format is :&lt;br /&gt;
"0 - Area/network operator code (A/N) - subscriber number (X)"

When dialing an Israeli number from outside Israel, the format is :&lt;br /&gt;
"+972 - Area/network operator code (A/N) - subscriber number (X)"

The Israeli telecommunication infrastructure is including the [[Telephone numbers in the Palestinian territories|Palestinian telecommunication system]].

==History==

In 1965, many Israeli phone numbers had 6 digits, but some had 5, according to the Tel-Aviv-area phone book. &lt;ref&gt;http://genealogyindexer.org/view/1965Israel/1965Israel%20-%200196.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  There were ten area codes at that time: 02 Jerusalem, Bet Shemesh; 03 Tel Aviv, Petah Tikva, Rehovot, Ashdod; 04 Haifa and western Galilee; 051 Ashkelon; 053 Netanya; 057 Beersheva and most of the Negev; 059 Eilat; 065 Afula, Nazareth; 063 Hadera, Zichron Yaakov; and 067 Tiberias, Zefat and eastern Galilee.  &lt;ref&gt; http://genealogyindexer.org/view/1965Israel/1965Israel%20-%200005.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

As recently as the 1990s, most telephone numbers in Israel had 6 digits (without area code digit). Currently there are 5 geographic area codes and 2 more non-geographic area codes, and numbers has 7 or 8 digits (without area code digit).

With the influence of [[VoIP]] long distance was deregulated in Israel. According to the Israel Ministry of Communication a VoIP number may be [[local number portability|ported]] to a landline carrier and vice versa providing the option to have, say, a northern number in the south of the country. Numbers may not be ported, say, from the north to the south of the country on the same kind of line (e.g., VoIP to VoIP or landline to landline). [[Mobile number portability]] was introduced in late 2007.

==Structure and format==

The format for calls to landlines within the same area code is XXX-XXXX (7 digits subscriber number). For calls to a landline outside the local area, the area code is prefixed and the format becomes (0A) XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, where "0A" is the area code.

The format for calls to cellular mobile phones is 05N-XXX-XXXX, where "05N" is the mobile operator indicator. The format for calls to VoIP lines is 07N-XXX-XXXX, where "07N" is the VoIP operator indicator.

When calling from outside of Israel, the leading "0" in area codes is not dialed, and the format is +972-A-XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, +972-5N-XXX-XXXX for calls to mobile lines, +972-7N-XXX-XXXX for calls to VoIP lines.

==International call prefix==
For calling from Israel to another country: choose operator, and dial its international access code, then dial destination country code and then the rest of the local number.
*'''00''' or '''+''' – short code (only registered customers)
*'''012''' – [[012smile]] service
*'''013''' – [[013 NetVision]] service
*'''014''' – [[Bezeq International]] service
*'''015''' – Hallo 015 service
*'''016''' – [[Golan Telecom]] service
*'''017''' – [[Hot Mobile]] service
*'''018''' – Xfone service
*'''019''' – [[019 Telzar]] service

==Area codes==

Due to mobile number portability, a mobile phone with a prefix of one provider can be associated with a different provider.

===Geographic area codes===
[[File:Israel dialing codes.svg|thumb|Geographic area codes of Israel]]
When dialing within one of the geographical area codes (2, 3, 4, 8, 9) the prefix can be dropped (so instead of dialing (0A)XXX-XXXX you can dial XXX-XXXX).

==Kosher numbers==
Kosher phones and networks are essentially phones with [[Haredi]] [[rabbinical]] approval that can be used for communication without entertainment functionality or connectivity. This is a line that has a pre-defined
prefix and it is blocked to content that Haredi activists feel is not appropriate for their community.
Such blocking includes cellular internet access, chat rooms, [[SMS]], etc.
This does not mean that other phones are not [[kosher]] according to Jewish law, as evidenced by the fact that a very large number - if not the majority - of observant [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] worldwide do not restrict themselves to "kosher" phones; rather the description "kosher" phones is a loose one, implying an added level of stringency accepted by some communities.

The companies who provides "kosher numbers" allocated exclusive ranges for those lines, which are:
 +972 '''(A) 80'''X-XXXX - [[Bezeq]] (When A = 2,3,4,8,9)
 +972 '''50 41'''X-XXXX  - [[Pelephone]]
 +972 '''52 71'''X-XXXX  - [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]], second range
 +972 '''52 76'''X-XXXX  - [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]], first range
 +972 '''53 31'''X-XXXX  - [[Hot Mobile]]
 +972 '''54 84'''X-XXXX  - [[Partner Communications Company|Partner]], first range

[[File:GOPR0061.MP4 000124020.jpg|thumb|Aerial view]]

'''The Green Cathedral''' or '''De Groene Kathedraal''' located near [[Almere]] Netherlands, is an artistic planting of [[Lombardy poplar]]s (''Populus nigra italica'') that mimics the size and shape of the [[Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Reims]], France. The Green Cathedral is {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and the mature poplar trees are approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.

==History==
The work was planted by Marinus Boezem (b. 1934) on April 16, 1987, in Southern [[Flevoland]]. The land art project was installed on [[polder]] land. 178 trees were planted on a knoll, a half-metre above the surrounding area. Over the following years, some trees were replaced due to deer damage, and stone was laid in the floor to echo the cross ribs and support beams of the cathedral.

==Current status==
Now mature, the cathedral has become a location for weddings, funerals, meetings and religious services of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, Richard. Arborsculpture Solutions for a Small Planet, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, a clearing has been made in a young beech forest so that the open space is in the shape of the same cathedral. Boezem suggests, as the poplars decline, the beech trees around the clearing will grow to create the church once more thus ensuring a cyclical evolution of growth, decline and growth.

'''Zion''' ({{lang-he|צִיּוֹן}} ''Ṣîyōn'', modern '''''Tsiyyon'''''; also [[Transliteration|transliterated]] ''Sion'', ''Sayon'', ''Syon'', ''Tzion'', ''Tsion'') is a [[toponymy|placename]] often used as a [[synonym]] for [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref name=Longmanp936/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brileyp49/&gt; as well as for the biblical [[Land of Israel]] as a whole. The word is first found in {{bibleref|2 Samuel|5:7}} which dates from c. 630–540 BCE according to modern scholarship. It originally referred to a specific hill in Jerusalem ([[Mount Zion]]), located to the south of [[Mount Moriah]] (the Temple Mount). Mount Zion held a [[Jebusite]] fortress of the same name that was conquered by [[David]] and was re-named the [[City of David]]; see [[Names of Jerusalem]]. That specific hill ("mount") is one of the many squat hills that form Jerusalem, which also includes Mount Moriah (the Temple Mount), the [[Mount of Olives]], etc. Over many centuries, until as recently as the Ottoman era, the city walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt many times in new locations, so that the particular hill known as Mount Zion is no longer inside the city wall, but its location is now just outside the portion of the Old City wall forming the southern boundary of  the Jewish Quarter of the current Old City. Most of the original City of David itself is thus also outside the current city wall. 

The term ''Tzion'' came to designate the area of Davidic Jerusalem where the fortress stood, and was used as well as [[synecdoche]] for the entire city of Jerusalem; and later, when [[Solomon's Temple]] was built on the adjacent Mount Moriah (which, as a result, came to be known as the Temple Mount) the meanings of the term ''Tzion'' were further extended by [[synecdoche]] to the additional meanings of the Temple itself, the hill upon which the Temple stood, the entire city of Jerusalem, the entire biblical Land of Israel, and "[[Jewish eschatology##.22The world to come.22|the World to Come]]", the Jewish understanding of the [[afterlife]].

In [[Kabbalah]], the more esoteric reference is made to Tzion being the spiritual point from which reality emerges, located in the [[Holy of Holies]] of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]], [[Second Temple|Second]] and [[Third Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/dimension/archives/devarim.htm|title=Parshas HaShavua|work=shemayisrael.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[etymology]] of the word ''Zion'' (''ṣiyôn'') is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Longmanp936&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longman|first1=Tremper|authorlink1=Tremper Longman|last2=Enns|first2=Peter|authorlink2=Peter Enns|title=Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry &amp; Writings: A Compendium of Contemporary Biblical Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kE2k36XAkv4C&amp;pg=PA936|year=2008|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1783-2|page=936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brileyp49&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Arnold Albert|title=The book of Psalms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq5gFlzMxQgC|year=1981|publisher=Eerdmans|isbn=978-0-551-00846-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp1006&gt;{{cite book|last=Bromiley|first=Geoffrey W.|authorlink=Geoffrey W.

Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3782-0|page=1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mentioned in the Old Testament in the [[Books of Samuel]] (2 Samuel 5:7) as the name of the [[Jebusite]] fortress conquered by [[David]], its origin likely predates the [[Israelites]].&lt;ref name=Longmanp936/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brileyp49/&gt; If [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], it may be derived from the Hebrew root ''ṣiyyôn'' ("castle") or the Hebrew צִיָּה ''ṣiyya'' ("dry land", Jeremiah 51:43). A non-Semitic relationship to the [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] word ''šeya'' ("river" or "brook") has also been suggested.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp1006/&gt;

===Orthography===
The form ''Tzion'' ({{lang-he|ציון}}; [[Tiberian vocalization]]: ''Ṣiyyôn'') appears 108 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and once as ''HaTzion''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Responsa Project: Version 13'', Bar Ilan University, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is spelled with a [[tsade]] and not [[zayin]].&lt;ref&gt;Kline, D.E., ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language for readers of English'', Carta Jerusalem, The University of Haifa, 1987, pp.XII-XIII&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly used English form is based on [[German orthography]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Dixon, ''A general introduction to the Sacred Scriptures: in a series of dissertations, critical hermeneutical and historical'', J. Murphy, 1853, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; where '''z''' is always pronounced [t͡s] (e.g. "zog" [t͡soːk]), hence "''Zion''" in German literature. A '''tz''' would only be used if the preceding vowel is short, hence the use of ''Zion'' in 19th-century German [[Biblical criticism]]. This orthography was adopted because in German, the correct transliteration can only be rendered from the one instance of ''HaTzion'' in Kings II 23:17, where the ''a'' vowel is followed by a double consonant '''tz'''.

==Judaism==
Zion is the Hebrew name for a hill south of the Temple Mount in [[Jerusalem]], upon which was built the [[City of David]]. In its most specific sense, [[Mount Zion]] is not to be confused with [[Mount Moriah]], better known as the [[Temple Mount]], upon which the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the [[Second Temple]] were built. The location of the Temple, and in particular its [[Holy of Holies]] (innermost sanctum), is the most holy place in the world for the Jewish people, seen as the connection between [[God in Judaism|God]] and humanity. Observant Jews recite the [[Amidah]] three times a day facing the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, praying for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple, the restoration of the Temple service, the redemption of the world, and for the coming of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]. 

===In the Tanakh===
&lt;!-- This article is about the historical and religious term. Refs in pop culture belong in [[Zion (disambiguation)]] --&gt;
Some examples from the book of [[Psalms]], state:
* "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Tzion." ([[Psalm 137]]:1)
* "For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us ''required of us'' mirth, ''saying'', Sing us ''one'' of the songs of Tzion. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget ''her cunning''. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze ''it'', raze ''it'', even to the foundation thereof; O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that repayeth thee as thou hast served us." (Psalms 137:3-8, italics for words not in the original Hebrew)
* "The Lord doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcast of Israel. Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Tzion." (Psalms 147:2,12)

===Daughter of Zion===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Uncle Sam]] --&gt;
Mentioned 26 times in the [[Tanakh]], the biblical phrase "Daughter of Tzion" (Hebrew "bat Tzion") is not a reference to [[Moriah]] in Jerusalem, nor to the hill upon which the old [[City of David]] was built in the immediate south of [[Mount Moriah]], but rather to the women of the entire biblical [[Land of Israel]] and, thus, of [[Jewish peoplehood]] as a whole, including the [[Jewish diaspora]].

==Latter Day Saint movement==
{{Main|Zion (Latter Day Saints)}}
Within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], Zion is often used to connote a [[utopia]]n association of the righteous. This association would practice a form of communitarian economics called the [[United Order]] meant to ensure that all members maintained an acceptable quality of life, class distinctions were minimized, and group unity achieved.{{Citation needed lead|date=January 2008}} While Zion has often been linked with [[theocracy]], the concept of Zion did not theoretically require such a governmental system.{{Citation needed lead|date=January 2008}} In this way, Zion must be distinguished from the ideal political system called [[theodemocracy]] which Latter Day Saints believed would be adopted upon Christ's [[Second Coming]].

==Arab and Islamic tradition==
''Ṣahyūn'' ({{lang-ar|صهيون}}, ''Ṣahyūn'' or ''Ṣihyūn'') is the word for Zion in Arabic and [[Syriac language|Syriac]].&lt;ref name=PEFp21&gt;{{cite book|author=Palestine Exploration Fund|authorlink=Palestine Exploration Fund|title=Palestine Exploration Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nodAAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Published at the Fund's Office|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilp114&gt;{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|authorlink=Moshe Gil|title=A History of Palestine, 634-1099|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0wUKoMJeccC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59984-9|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on biblical tradition, it is one of the names accorded to Jerusalem in Arabic and Islamic tradition.&lt;ref name=Gilp114/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freundp141&gt;{{cite book|last=Freund|first=Richard A.|title=Digging Through the Bible: Modern Archaeology and the Ancient Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EWWup0o-o4C&amp;pg=PA141|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4645-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; A valley called ''Wādī Sahyũn'' seemingly preserves the name and is located approximately one and three-quarter miles from the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]'s [[Jaffa Gate]].&lt;ref name=PEFp21/&gt;

For example, the reference to the "precious cornerstone" of the new Jerusalem in the [[Book of Isaiah]] 28:16 is identified in Islamic scholarship as the [[Black Stone]] of the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref name=Wheelerp89&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Brannon M.|title=Moses in the Quran and Islamic Exegesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=By7D11xMzlcC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1603-6|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is said by [[ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]] (1292–1350) to have come from the [[People of the Book]], though earlier Christian scholarship identifies the cornerstone with [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Wheelerp89/&gt;

==Rastafari movement==
{{Rquote|right|I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home...One bright morning when my work is over, man will fly away home...
|Rastaman Chant|[[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]]|}}
In [[Rastafari]], "Zion" stands for a [[utopia]]n place of unity, peace and freedom, as opposed to "[[Babylon]]", the oppressing and exploiting system of the materialistic modern world and a place of evil.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Babylon (chiefly among Rastafari)|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Babylon--2|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It proclaims Zion, as reference to [[Ethiopia]], the original birthplace of humankind, and from the beginning of the movement calls to [[repatriation]] to Zion, the [[Promised Land]] and Heaven on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Rastafarians Believe|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/rasta/believe.shtml|work=Jamaican Culture|publisher=Jamaicans.com|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=2003-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Rastafari believe themselves to represent the real [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] in modern times, and their goal is to repatriate to Ethiopia, or to Zion. The [[Ge'ez]]-language ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'' serves as inspiration for the idea that the "Glory of Zion" transferred from Jerusalem to Ethiopia in the time of Solomon and Sheba, c. 950 BC.

Rastafari [[reggae]] contains many references to Zion; among the best-known examples are the [[Bob Marley]] songs "Zion Train", "[[Iron Lion Zion]]", the [[Bunny Wailer]] song "Rastaman" ("The Rasta come from Zion, Rastaman a Lion!"), The Melodians song "Rivers of Babylon" (based on Psalm 137, where the captivity of ''Babylon'' is contrasted with the freedom in ''Zion''), the [[Bad Brains]] song "Leaving Babylon", the [[Damian Marley]] song featuring [[Nas]] "Road to Zion", [[The Abyssinians]]' "Forward Unto Zion" and [[Kiddus I]]'s "Graduation in Zion", which is featured in the 1977 cult roots rock reggae film ''[[Rockers (1978 film)|Rockers]]'', and "Let's Go to Zion" by [[Winston Francis]]. Reggae groups such as [[Steel Pulse]] and [[Cocoa Tea]] also have many references to Zion in their various songs.

==Zionism==
{{Main|Zionism|Types of Zionism|Labor Zionism|Religious Zionism|Post-Zionism|Neo-Zionism}}
[[File:Bat Zion I want your Old New Land join Jewish regiment.jpg|thumb|upright| Zion I want your Old New Land join Jewish regiment.jpg|thumb|A [[World War I]] recruitment poster. The Daughter of Zion (representing the Hebrew people): "Your [[The Old New Land|Old New Land]] must have you! Join the [[Jewish Legion|Jewish regiment]]."]]

The term "Zionism", coined by Austrian [[Nathan Birnbaum]], was derived from the German rendering of Tzion in his journal ''Selbstemanzipation'' (Self Emancipation) in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;De Lange, Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Judaism'', Cambridge University Press (2000), p. 30.  {{ISBN|0-521-46624-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zionism as a [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] [[First Zionist Congress|started in 1897]] and supported a [[homeland|"national home"]], and [[Biltmore Conference|later a state]], for the [[Jew]]ish people in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The Zionist movement declared the re-establishment of its [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948, following the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. Since then and with varying [[ideologies]], Zionists have focused on developing and protecting this state.

The last line of the Israeli national anthem ''[[Hatikvah]]'' (Hebrew for "Hope") is "....Eretz Zion, ViYerushalayim", which means literally "The land of Zion and Jerusalem".

==Other uses==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The Jewish longing for Zion, starting with the deportation and enslavement of Jews during the [[Babylonian captivity]], was adopted as a metaphor by Christian black [[slavery|slaves]] in the [[United States]], and after the Civil War by blacks who were still oppressed. Thus, Zion symbolizes a longing by wandering peoples for a safe homeland. This could be an actual place such as [[Ethiopia]] for [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] or [[Israel]] for some of the [[Igbos]] in [[Nigeria]] for example. For others, it has taken on a more [[spirituality|spiritual]] meaning—a safe ''spiritual'' homeland, like in [[heaven]], or a kind of [[inner peace|peace of mind]] in one's present life.

==Mount Zion today==
[[File:Dormitio Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abbey of the Dormition]] on the modern Mount Zion.]]
Today, [[Mount Zion]] refers to a hill south of the Old City's [[Armenian Quarter]], not to the Temple Mount. This apparent misidentification dates at least from the 1st century AD, when [[Josephus]] calls Jerusalem's Western Hill "Mount Zion".&lt;ref name=Pixner&gt;{{cite book|last=Pixner|first=Bargil|authorlink=Bargil Pixner|title=Paths of the Messiah and Sites of the Early Church from Galilee to Jerusalem: Jesus and Jewish Christianity in Light of Archaeological Discoveries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvhA6IE4VqgC&amp;pg=PA321|year=2010|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-0-89870-865-3|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abbey of the Dormition]] is located upon the hill currently called Mount Zion.
