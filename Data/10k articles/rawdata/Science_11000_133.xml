'''''Australasian Science''''' is a bimonthly science magazine published in [[Australia]].  It contains a mixture of news items, feature articles and expert commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.synchrotron.org.au/news/publications/case-studies/australasian-science-features/368-australasian-science-synchrotron-features-2008|title=Australasian Science synchrotron features 2008|website=www.synchrotron.org.au|access-date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Australasian Science'' is Australia's longest-running scientific publication. It was first published in 1938 as ''The Australian Journal of Science'' by the Australian National Research Council, which was the forerunner of the [[Australian Academy of Science]].

In 1954 the journal was transferred to ANZAAS – the ''[[Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science]]''. Throughout this time the journal published the research of eminent Australian scientists, including Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] and Sir [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]], whose groundbreaking [[clonal selection]] theory was published in the journal in 1957.

The journal has evolved considerably over the following decades. Since merging in 1998 with a popular [[List of science magazines|science magazine]] published by the [[University of Southern Queensland]], the magazine has been published as ''Australasian Science''. Published by Control Publications and available in newsagents, it is the only magazine that is dedicated to Australian and New Zealand science.

''Australasian Science''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s patrons are Nobel Laureate Prof [[Peter C. Doherty]] and ABC broadcaster [[Robyn Williams]].

''Australasian Science'' also has a broad team of columnists covering astronomy, politics, biodiversity, ethics, [[scepticism]], neuroscience and evidence-based medicine.

'''Biomesotherapy''' is an alternative therapy practice that combines [[homotoxicology]], [[mesotherapy]], and [[acupuncture]]. [[Saline solution]] and homeopathic formulations are injected subcutaneously at specific acupuncture or trigger points, and homeopathic formulations are administered orally during treatment sessions. Biomesotherapy is used for pain management and general well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivan | first1 = M | last2 = Dancer | first2 = C | last3 = Koehler | first3 = AP | last4 = Hobby | first4 = M | last5 = Lease | first5 = C | year = 2013 | title = Mycobacterium chelonae abscesses associated with biomesotherapy, Australia, 2008 | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume =  19| issue = | page =  | doi = 10.3201/eid1909.120898 | pmid=23968779 | pmc=3810901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of a '''biotic pump''' pertains to the importance of forests in the [[water cycle]], specifically, in determining the levels of rainfall a region will receive. It states that an increased amount of evaporation or [[transpiration]] will cause a reduction in atmospheric pressure as clouds form, which will subsequently cause moist air to be drawn to regions where evaporation is at its highest. In a desert this will correspond to the sea whereas in a forest, moist air from the sea will be drawn inland. The theory predicts two different types of coast to contentinental rainfall patterns, first in a forested area one can expect no decrease in rainfall as one moves inland in contrast to a deforested region where one observes an exponential decrease in annual rainfall. Whereas it is true current global climate models fit these patterns as well, it is argued this is due to [[parametrization]] and not the veracity of the theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheil|first=Douglas|last2=Murdiyarso|first2=Daniel|date=2009-04-01|title=How Forests Attract Rain: An Examination of a New Hypothesis|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/59/4/341/346941|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=59|issue=4|pages=341–347|doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.4.12|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is in contradiction of the more traditional view that surface winds are solely a direct product of differences in surface heating and heat released from condensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://repository.usergioarboleda.edu.co/handle/11232/397|title=How the Biotic Pump links the hydrological and the rainforest to climate : ¿Is it for real? ¿How can we prove it?|last=Bunyard|first=Peter Paul|date=2015-08-21|publisher=Universidad Sergio Arboleda|isbn=9789588745893|language=en|doi=10.22518/9789588745886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/clearing-forests-may-transform-local-and-global-climate/ |title=Clearing Forests May Transform Local—and Global—Climate |last=Schwartz |first=Judith D. |work=Scientific American |access-date=2017-12-29 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the theory argue that phase changes in water play a greater role in atmospheric dynamics than currently acknowledged.

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Effects}}

In [[quantum field theory]], the '''Casimir effect''' and the '''Casimir–Polder force''' are physical [[force (physics)|forces]] arising from a [[quantization (physics)|quantized field]]. They are named after the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Casimir]] who predicted them in 1948.

The Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of conducting metals and [[dielectric]]s alters the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy of the second quantized [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;E. L. Losada" [http://particulas.cnea.gov.ar/workshops/silafae/data/226.pdf Functional Approach to the Fermionic Casimir Effect] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531174312/http://particulas.cnea.gov.ar/workshops/silafae/data/226.pdf |date=31 May 2011 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohideen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in the Casimir effect |author1=Michael Bordag |author2=Galina Leonidovna Klimchitskaya |author3=Umar Mohideen |chapter=Chapter I; §3: Field quantization and vacuum energy in the presence of boundaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqE1f_s5PgYC&amp;pg=PA33 |pages=33 ''ff'' |isbn=0-19-923874-X |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.

Any medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the Casimir effect. For example, beads on a string&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=D.

In modern [[theoretical physics]], the Casimir effect plays an important role in the [[nucleon#Models|chiral bag model]] of the [[nucleon]]; in [[applied physics]], it is significant in some aspects of emerging [[microtechnologies]] and [[nanotechnologies]].&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Lambrecht, Serge Reynaud and Cyriaque Genet (2007) "[http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf Casimir In The Nanoworld]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122143950/http://www.fisica.unipa.it/~cewqo2007/Archive/presentations/Genet.pdf |date=22 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
The typical example is of the two [[electric charge|uncharged]] conductive plates in a [[vacuum]], placed a few nanometers apart. In a [[classical electromagnetism|classical]] description, the lack of an external field means that there is no field between the plates, and no force would be measured between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Genet|first1=C.|last2=Intravaia|first2=F.|last3=Lambrecht|first3=A.|last4=Reynaud|first4=S.|date=2004|title=Electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, Casimir and Van der Waals forces|url=http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-291/aflb291p227.pdf|journal=[[Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie]]|volume=29|issue=1–2|pages=311–328|arxiv=quant-ph/0302072|bibcode=2003quant.ph..2072G}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this field is instead studied using the [[QED vacuum|quantum electrodynamic vacuum]], it is seen that the plates do affect the [[virtual particle|virtual photons]] which constitute the field, and generate a net force&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.aps.org/story/v2/st28 The Force of Empty Space], ''[[Physical Review Focus]]'', 3 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the specific arrangement of the two plates. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of [[virtual particle]]s interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the [[zero-point energy]] of a [[Quantum field theory|quantized field]] in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by [[second quantization]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lambrecht, [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747 The Casimir effect: a force from nothing], ''[[Physics World]]'', September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/pnu/1996/split/pnu300-3.htm American Institute of Physics News Note 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations has led to some controversy. In fact, "Casimir's original goal was to compute the [[van der Waals force]] between [[dipolar polarization|polarizable molecules]]" of the conductive plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) of quantum fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe|first1=R.|year=2005|title=Casimir effect and the quantum vacuum|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=72|issue=2|pages=021301|arxiv=hep-th/0503158|bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is extremely small. On a submicron scale, this force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors. In fact, at separations of 10&amp;nbsp;nm &amp;ndash; about 100&amp;nbsp;times the typical size of an atom &amp;ndash; the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1&amp;nbsp;[[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere of pressure]] (the precise value depending on surface geometry and other factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/9747|title=The Casimir effect: a force from nothing|date=1 September 2002|work=[[Physics World]]|accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Netherlands|Dutch]] physicists Hendrik Casimir and [[Dirk Polder]] at [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips Research Labs]] proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947; this special form is called the '''Casimir–Polder force'''. After a conversation with [[Niels Bohr]], who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948 which is called the '''Casimir effect''' in the narrow sense.

Predictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, and recent calculations have considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of [[liquid helium]] films. However it was not until 1997 that a direct experiment by S. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997 /&gt; Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.

==Possible causes==
===Vacuum energy===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Faster-than-light]] --&gt;
{{Quantum field theory}}
{{Main article|Vacuum energy}}
The causes of the Casimir effect are described by [[quantum field theory]], which states that all of the various fundamental [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]], must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a "field" in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate [[wave equation]] for the particular field in question. The [[second quantization]] of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a [[Harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]], and its quantization places a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the [[elementary particle]]s of [[particle physics]]. However, even the [[vacuum]] has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.

The vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: [[spin (physics)|spin]]{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] in the case of [[light]], [[energy]], and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, "empty" in this sense. One important exception is the [[vacuum energy]] or the [[vacuum expectation value]] of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or [[zero-point energy]] that such an oscillator may have is

:&lt;math&gt;{E}=\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{2} \end{matrix} \hbar \omega \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only ''differences'' in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains [[Quantum gravity#Nonrenormalizability of gravity|beyond the scope of quantum field theory]]), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of [[renormalization]]. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a [[Renormalization#Attitudes and interpretation|cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists]] before the development in the 1970s of the [[renormalization group]], a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.

When the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently [[Cosmological constant problem|no compelling explanation]] as to why it should not result in a [[cosmological constant]] that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed.&lt;ref name=Rugh&gt;

The Casimir effect for [[fermion]]s can be understood as the [[spectral asymmetry]] of the [[(−1)F|fermion operator]] &lt;math&gt;(-1)^F&lt;/math&gt;, where it is known as the [[Witten index]].

===Relativistic van der Waals force===
Alternatively, a 2005 paper by [[Robert Jaffe]] of MIT states that "Casimir effects
can be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies. They are relativistic, quantum forces between charges and currents. The Casimir force (per unit
area) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha, the fine structure constant, goes to zero, and the standard result, which appears to be independent of alpha, corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit," and that "The Casimir force is simply the (relativistic, [[retarded potential|retarded]]) [[van der Waals force]] between the metal plates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Casimir Effect and the Quantum Vacuum |author=R.L.Jaffe |year=2005 |arxiv=hep-th/0503158v1 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.72.021301 |volume=72 |journal=Physical Review D |bibcode=2005PhRvD..72b1301J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casimir and Polder's original paper used this method to derive the Casimir-Polder force. In 1978, Schwinger, DeRadd, and Milton published a similar derivation for the Casimir Effect between two parallel plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwinger | first1 = Julian | last2 = DeRaad | first2 = Lester L. | last3 = Milton | first3 = Kimball A. | year = 1978 | title = Casimir effect in dielectrics | url = | journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 1–23 | doi=10.1016/0003-4916(78)90172-0|bibcode = 1978AnPhy.115....1S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the description in terms of van der Waals forces is the only correct description from the fundamental microscopic perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=2016-10-10|title=Proof that Casimir force does not originate from vacuum energy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269316304567|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=761|pages=197–202|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.08.036|bibcode=2016PhLB..761..197N|arxiv = 1605.04143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolić|first=Hrvoje|date=August 2017|title=Is zero-point energy physical?

==Effects==
Casimir's observation was that the [[Canonical quantization|second-quantized]] quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or [[dielectric]]s, must obey the same [[Boundary value problem|boundary condition]]s that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] or dielectric.

Consider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a [[Cavity magnetron|radar cavity]] or a [[microwave]] [[waveguide]]. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the [[standing wave]]s of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the ''n''th standing wave is &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt;. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n E_n&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over all possible values of ''n'' enumerating the standing waves. The factor of 1/2 is present because the zero-point energy of the n'th mode is &lt;math&gt;E_n/2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is the energy increment for the n'th mode. (It is the same 1/2 as appears in the equation &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar \omega/2&lt;/math&gt;.) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.

In particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape ''s'' of the cavity. Each energy level &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; depends on the shape, and so one should write &lt;math&gt;E_n(s)&lt;/math&gt; for the energy level, and &lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: the force at point ''p'' on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape ''s'' of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by &lt;math&gt;\delta s&lt;/math&gt;, at point ''p''. That is, one has

:&lt;math&gt;F(p)=- \left. \frac{\delta \langle E(s) \rangle} {\delta s} \right\vert_p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This value is finite in many practical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief summary, see the introduction in {{cite journal |last1=Passante |first1=R. |last2=Spagnolo |first2=S. |title=Casimir-Polder interatomic potential between two atoms at finite temperature and in the presence of boundary conditions |arxiv=0708.2240 |journal=Physical Review A |volume=76 |pages=042112 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042112 |issue=4 |bibcode=2007PhRvA..76d2112P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). With ''a'' &lt;&lt; ''L'', the states within the slot of width ''a'' are highly constrained so that the energy ''E'' of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region ''L'', where there is a large number (numbering about ''L'' / ''a'') of states with energy evenly spaced between ''E'' and the next mode in the narrow slot &amp;ndash; in other words, all slightly larger than ''E''. Now on shortening ''a'' by d''a'' (&lt; 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to &amp;minus;d''a''/''a'', whereas all the ''L'' /''a'' states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to d''a''/''L'' (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the ''L''/''a'' modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make ''a'' slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.

==Derivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization==
* ''See '''[[v:Quantum mechanics/Casimir effect in one dimension|Wikiversity]]''' for an elementary calculation in one dimension.''

In the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the ''xy''-plane, the standing waves are

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(x,y,z;t)=e^{-i\omega_nt} e^{ik_xx+ik_yy} \sin(k_n z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; are the [[wave number]]s in directions parallel to the plates, and

:&lt;math&gt;k_n=\frac{n\pi}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

is the wave-number perpendicular to the plates. Here, ''n'' is an integer, resulting from the requirement that ψ vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_n=c \sqrt{{k_x}^2 + {k_y}^2 + \frac{n^2\pi^2}{a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in ''k''-space. The assumption of [[Van Hove singularity#Theory|periodic boundary conditions]] yields,

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E \rangle=\frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2
\int \frac{A dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The [[Zeta function regularization|zeta-regulated]] version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=\hbar
\int \frac{dk_x dk_y}{(2\pi)^2} \sum_{n=1}^\infty \omega_n
\vert \omega_n\vert^{-s}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the end, the limit &lt;math&gt;s\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken. Here ''s'' is just a [[complex number]], not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral/sum is finite for ''s'' [[real number|real]] and larger than 3. The sum has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''s''=3, but may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] to ''s''=0, where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
\frac{\hbar c^{1-s}}{4\pi^2} \sum_n \int_0^\infty 2\pi qdq
\left \vert q^2 + \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{a^2} \right\vert^{(1-s)/2},&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;q^2=k_x^2+k_y^2&lt;/math&gt; were introduced to turn the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] into a single integral. The &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; in front is the Jacobian, and the &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if Re[''s''] &gt; 3, resulting in

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}} \frac{1}{3-s}
\sum_n \vert n\vert ^{3-s}=
-\frac {\hbar c^{1-s} \pi^{2-s}}{2a^{3-s}}\sum_n \frac{1}{\left| n\right| ^{s-3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum diverges at ''s'' in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the [[Riemann zeta function]] to ''s''=0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\lim_{s\to 0} \frac{\langle E(s) \rangle}{A}=
-\frac {\hbar c \pi^{2}}{6a^{3}} \zeta (-3).&lt;/math&gt;

But

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(-3)=\frac {1} {120}&lt;/math&gt;

and so one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\langle E \rangle}{A}=
\frac {-\hbar c \pi^{2}}{720 a^{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is

:&lt;math&gt;{F_c \over A}=-\frac{d}{da} \frac{\langle E \rangle}{A} = -\frac {\hbar c \pi^2} {240 a^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; (hbar, ħ) is the [[reduced Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]],
:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[distance]] between the two plates

The force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; shows that the Casimir force per unit area &lt;math&gt;F_c / A&lt;/math&gt; is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.

NOTE: In Casimir's original derivation [http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00018547.pdf], a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance ''a'' from one of two widely separated plates (distance ''L'' apart). The 0-point energy on ''both'' sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above ''ad hoc'' analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using [[Euler–Maclaurin summation]] with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as &lt;math&gt;\vert\omega_n\vert^{-s}&lt;/math&gt; in the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruggiero |first1=Zimerman |last2=Villani |title=Application of Analytic Regularization to the Casimir Forces |journal=Revista Brasileira de Física |volume=7 |number=3 |year=1977 |url=http://www.sbfisica.org.br/bjp/download/v07/v07a43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent theory===
Casimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E M |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=Lev P |title=GENERAL THEORY OF VAN DER WAALS' FORCES |journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi |volume=4 |pages=153 |year=1961 |doi=10.1070/PU1961v004n02ABEH003330 |issue=2 |bibcode=1961SvPhU...4..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I E |last2=Kats |first2=E I |title=Casimir forces in modulated systems |arxiv=cond-mat/0408348 |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=16 |pages=5659 |year=2004 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/16/32/003 |issue=32 |bibcode=2004JPCM...16.5659D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; force law for large separations ''a'' much greater than the [[skin depth]] of the metal, and conversely reduces to the 1/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force law of the [[London dispersion force]] (with a coefficient called a [[Hamaker constant]]) for small ''a'', with a more complicated dependence on ''a'' for intermediate separations determined by the [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of the materials.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Parsegian, ''Van der Waals Forces: A Handbook for Biologists, Chemists, Engineers, and Physicists'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifshitz' result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt; For example, the force in the experimental sphere–plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius ''R'' is much larger than the separation ''a'', in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate ''R''/''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; force (neglecting both skin-depth and [[Orders of approximation|higher-order]] curvature effects).&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Derjaguin, I. I. Abrikosova, and E. M. Lifshitz, ''Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society'', vol. 10, 295–329 (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 2000s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical [[computational electromagnetics]], that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez11-review&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

==Measurement==
{{refimprove science |section |date=July 2015}}
One of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in [[w:Eindhoven|Eindhoven]] (Netherlands), in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M. J. |title=Attractive Forces between Flat Plates |journal=Nature |volume=180 |pages=334 |year=1957 |doi=10.1038/180334b0 |issue=4581 |bibcode=1957Natur.180..334S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sparnaay |first1=M |title=Measurements of attractive forces between flat plates |journal=Physica |volume=24 |pages=751 |year=1958 |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(58)80090-7 |issue=6–10 |bibcode=1958Phy....24..751S }}&lt;/ref&gt; but with large experimental errors. Some of the experimental details as well as some background information on how Casimir, Polder and Sparnaay arrived at this point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draschan.com/gallery/casimir-sparnaay-werner.mov Movie]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are highlighted in a 2007 interview with Marcus Sparnaay.

The Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]],&lt;ref name=Lamoureaux1997&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamoreaux |first1=S. K. |title=Demonstration of the Casimir Force in the 0.6 to 6 μm Range |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=78 |pages=5 |year=1997 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5 |bibcode=1997PhRvL..78....5L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the [[University of California, Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.4549 |last1=Mohideen |first1=U. |year=1998 |pages=4549 |volume=81 |journal=Physical Review Letters |last2=Roy |first2=Anushree |title=Precision Measurement of the Casimir Force from 0.1 to 0.9 µm |issue=21 |arxiv=physics/9805038 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.4549M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a [[sphere]] with a large [[radius]].

In 2001, a group (Giacomo Bressi, Gianni Carugno, Roberto Onofrio and Giuseppe Ruoso) at the [[University of Padua|University of Padua (Italy)]] finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using [[Microelectromechanical system oscillator#Resonators|microresonators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bressi |first1=G. |last2=Carugno |first2=G. |last3=Onofrio |first3=R. |last4=Ruoso |first4=G. |title=Measurement of the Casimir Force between Parallel Metallic Surfaces |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=88 |pages=041804 |year=2002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.041804 |issue=4 |pmid=11801108 |arxiv=quant-ph/0203002 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..88d1804B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regularisation==
In order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a [[regularization (physics)|regulator]] in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.

The [[heat kernel regularization|heat kernel]] or [[Exponential function|exponentially]] regulated sum is
:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t |\omega_n |)&lt;/math&gt;

where the limit &lt;math&gt;t\to 0^+&lt;/math&gt; is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{C}{t^3} + \textrm{finite}\,&lt;/math&gt;

for three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant ''C'' which ''does not'' depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] regulator

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(t) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n |
\exp (-t^2 |\omega_n |^2)&lt;/math&gt;

is better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The [[zeta function regulator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E(s) \rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_n \hbar |\omega_n | |\omega_n |^{-s}&lt;/math&gt;

is completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the [[complex plane|complex ''s'' plane]], with the bulk divergence at ''s''=4. This sum may be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] past this pole, to obtain a finite part at ''s''=0.

Not every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at ''s''=0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the [[plasma frequency]]), metals become transparent to [[photon]]s (such as [[X-ray]]s), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in [[solid state physics]], mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the [[cutoff frequency]] comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in ''Landau and Lifshitz'', "Theory of Continuous Media".)

==Generalities==
The Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of [[functional integral]]s of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called "[[virtual particle]]s".

More interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the [[van der Waals force]], to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.

In the [[chiral bag model]] of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the [[spectral asymmetry]] is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the [[baryon number]], cancelling the [[topological winding number]] of the [[pion]] field surrounding the nucleon.

==Dynamical Casimir effect==
The dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated ''moving mirror''. This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to [[quantum mechanics]] equations made in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fulling |first1=S. A. |last2=Davies |first2=P. C. W. |title=Radiation from a Moving Mirror in Two Dimensional Space-Time: Conformal Anomaly |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=348 |pages=393 |year=1976 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1976.0045 |issue=1654 |bibcode=1976RSPSA.348..393F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the [[Chalmers University of Technology]], in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified [[SQUID]] to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required [[Speed of light|relativistic]] velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/26813/ |title=First Observation of the Dynamical Casimir Effect |publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar analysis can be used to explain [[Hawking radiation]] that causes the slow "[[Hawking radiation#Black hole evaporation|evaporation]]" of [[black hole]]s (although this is generally visualized as the escape of one particle from a [[virtual particle]]-[[antiparticle]] pair, the other particle having been captured by the black hole).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sundermier|first1=Ali|title=Evidence of Stephen Hawking's famous prediction about black holes was just observed for the first time|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-hawkings-prediction-about-black-holes-was-just-observed-for-the-first-time-2016-8|accessdate=23 January 2017|work=Business Insider|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed within the framework of [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]], the dynamical Casimir effect has been used to better understand acceleration radiation such as the [[Unruh effect]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Repulsive forces==
There are few instances wherein the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. [[Evgeny Lifshitz]] showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise.&lt;ref name=DLP&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dzyaloshinskii |first1=I.E. |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E.M. |last3=Pitaevskii |first3=L.P. |title=The general theory of van der Waals forces† |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=10 |pages=165 |year=1961 |doi=10.1080/00018736100101281 |issue=38 |bibcode=1961AdPhy..10..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was carried out by Munday et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Munday |first1=J.N. |last2=Capasso |first2=F. |last3=Parsegian |first3=V.A. |title=Measured long-range repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz forces |journal=Nature |volume=457 |pages=170–3 |year=2009 |doi=10.1038/nature07610 |pmid=19129843 |issue=7226 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..170M |pmc=4169270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have also suggested the use of [[gain media]] to achieve a similar levitation effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1559579/Physicists-have-%27solved%27-mystery-of-levitation.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Physicists have 'solved' mystery of levitation |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=6 August 2007 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium ([[Kramers–Kronig relations]]). Casimir and Casimir-Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milton |first1=K.

==Applications==
It has been suggested that the Casimir forces have application in nanotechnology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Capasso |first1=F. |last2=Munday |first2=J.N. |last3=Iannuzzi |first3=D. |last4=Chan |first4=H.B. |title=Casimir forces and quantum electrodynamical torques: physics and nanomechanics |journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics |volume=13 |pages=400 |year=2007 |doi=10.1109/JSTQE.2007.893082 |issue=2|bibcode=2007IJSTQ..13..400C }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular silicon integrated circuit technology based micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, silicon array propulsion for space drives, and so-called Casimir oscillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Serry |first1=F.M. |last2=Walliser |first2=D. |last3=MacLay |first3=G.J. |title=The anharmonic Casimir oscillator (ACO)-the Casimir effect in a model microelectromechanical system |url=http://www.quantumfields.com/IEEEJMEMSACO.pdf |journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems |volume=4 |pages=193 |year=1995 |doi=10.1109/84.475546 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in certain regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, and it has been shown theoretically that quantum field theory allows states where the energy can be ''arbitrarily'' negative at a given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many physicists such as [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html |title=Space and Time Warps |publisher=Hawking.org.uk |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kip Thorne]],&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |year=1988 |last1=Morris |first1=Michael |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf |pmid=10038800 |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sopova |author2=Ford |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.045026 |title=The Energy Density in the Casimir Effect |year=2002 |volume=66 |issue=4 |page=045026 |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |arxiv=quant-ph/0204125 |bibcode=2002PhRvD..66d5026S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ford |author2=Roman |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.51.4277 |year=1995 |title=Averaged Energy Conditions and Quantum Inequalities |pages=4277–4286 |issue=8 |volume=51 |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |arxiv=gr-qc/9410043 |bibcode=1995PhRvD..51.4277F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3567 |author1=Olum |title=Superluminal travel requires negative energies |year=1998 |volume=81 |issue=17 |pages=3567–3570 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |arxiv=gr-qc/9805003 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.3567O }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore argue that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].

'''Climateprediction.net''' ('''CPDN''') is a [[distributed computing]] project to investigate and reduce uncertainties in [[Global climate model|climate modelling]]. It aims to do this by running hundreds of thousands of different models (a large [[climate ensemble]]) using the donated idle time of ordinary [[personal computers]], thereby leading to a better understanding of how models are affected by small changes in the many [[Parametrization (climate)|parameters]] known to influence the global climate.&lt;ref name="Normalization"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climateprediction.net/content/about-climatepredictionnet-project |title=About the project |publisher=Climateprediction.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223231012/http://climateprediction.net/content/about-climatepredictionnet-project |archivedate=2011-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project relies on the [[volunteer computing]] model using the [[BOINC]] framework where voluntary participants agree to run some processes of the project at the [[client-side]] in their personal computers after receiving tasks from the [[server-side]] for treatment.

CPDN, which is run primarily by [[Oxford University]] in [[England]], has harnessed more computing power and generated more data than any other climate modelling project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/climateexperiment/theexperiment/abouttheexperiment.shtml |title=BBC quote of Nick Faull |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has produced over 100 million model years of data so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net |title= Climate prediction.net |accessdate=2010-12-13 |work=tessella.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|6}}, there are more than 12,000 active participants from 223 countries with a total [[BOINC Credit System|BOINC credit]] of more than 27 billion, reporting about 55 [[FLOPS|teraflops]] (55 trillion operations per second) of processing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=cpdn |title=Detailed user, host, team and country statistics with graphs for BOINC |accessdate=2016-06-29 |work=boincstats.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218040224/http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=cpdn |archivedate=2008-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==
[[File:Global Warming Predictions.png|thumb|300px|right|IPCC graphic of uncertainty ranges with various models over time. Climateprediction.net is aiming to reduce the ranges and produce better probability information.]]
The aim of the Climateprediction.net project is to investigate the uncertainties in various parameterizations that have to be made in state-of-the-art climate models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/science/model-intro.php |title=Modelling The Climate |publisher=Climateprediction.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204080827/http://www.climateprediction.net/science/model-intro.php |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is run thousands of times with slight perturbations to various physics parameters (a 'large [[climate ensemble|ensemble]]') and the project examines how the model output changes. These parameters are not known exactly, and the variations are within what is subjectively considered to be a plausible range. This will allow the project to improve understanding of how sensitive the models are to small changes and also to things like changes in [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur cycle|sulphur cycle]]. In the past, estimates of climate change have had to be made using one or, at best, a very small ensemble (tens rather than thousands) of model runs. By using participants' computers, the project will be able to improve understanding of, and confidence in, climate change predictions more than would ever be possible using the supercomputers currently available to scientists.

The Climateprediction.net experiment should help to "improve methods to quantify uncertainties of climate projections and scenarios, including long-term ensemble simulations using complex models", identified by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in 2001 as a high priority. Hopefully, the experiment will give decision makers a better scientific basis for addressing one of the biggest potential global problems of the 21st century.

As shown in the graph above, the various models have a fairly wide distribution of results over time. For each curve, on the far right, there is a bar showing the final temperature range for the corresponding model version. As you can see and would expect, the further into the future the model is extended, the wider the variances between them. Roughly half of the variation depends on the future [[climate forcing]] [[Climate change scenario|scenario]] rather than uncertainties in the model. Any reduction in those variations whether from better scenarios or improvements in the models are wanted. Climateprediction.net is working on model uncertainties not the scenarios.

The crux of the problem is that scientists can run models and see that x% of the models warm y degrees in response to z climate forcings, but how do we know x% is a good representation of the probability of that happening in the real world? The answer is that scientists are uncertain about this and want to improve the level of confidence that can be achieved. Some models will be good and some poor at producing past climate when given past climate forcings and initial conditions (a [[hindcast]]). It does make sense to trust the models that do well at recreating the past more than those that do poorly. Therefore, models that do poorly will be downweighted.&lt;ref name="Normalization" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boinc-wiki.ath.cx/index.php?title=An_Introduction_To_The_Science_Behind_Climateprediction.net&amp;action=history BOINC Wiki Science Introduction which has been edited by [[Dave Frame]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029085348/http://boinc-wiki.ath.cx/index.php?title=An_Introduction_To_The_Science_Behind_Climateprediction.net&amp;action=history |date=October 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The experiments==
[[Image:CPDN-Client.png|thumb|right|300px|''Climateprediction.net'' screensaver under [[BOINC]] 5.4.9]]
The different models that Climateprediction.net has and will distribute are detailed below in chronological order. Therefore, anyone who has joined recently is likely to be running the [[Transient climate simulation|Transient Coupled Model]].
* Classic [[#The original model|Slab Model]] - The original experiment not under [[BOINC]]. See [[#The original model]] for further details. This model remains in use solely for the OU short course.&lt;ref name="climateprediction.net"&gt;[http://www.climateprediction.net/openu/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050701235936/http://www.climateprediction.net/openu/index.php |date=July 1, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BOINC [[#The original model|Slab Model]] - The same as the classic [[#The original model|Slab Model]], but released under [[BOINC]].
* '''[[Thermohaline circulation|ThermoHaline Circulation]] Model (THC)''' - An investigation of how the climate might change in the event of a decrease in the strength of the '''''T'''''hermo'''''H'''''aline '''''C'''''irculation. This experiment has now been closed to new participants as they have sufficient results. It was a [[four phase model]] totaling 60 model years. The first three phases were identical to the above [[#The original model|Slab Models]]. The fourth phase imposed the effects of a 50% slowdown in the Thermohaline circulation by imposing [[Sea surface temperature|SST]] changes in the north Atlantic derived from other runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/science/thc_about.php |title=About THC |publisher=Climateprediction.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227083253/http://www.climateprediction.net/science/thc_about.php |archive-date=2009-02-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sulfur Cycle Model''' - An investigation of the effect of sulfate aerosols on the climate.

* '''Coupled Spin-Up Model''' - Inclusion of oceanic influences into the basic model in a more dynamic and realistic way than the initial [[#The original model|Slab Model]]. This was a pre-requirement for the [[Hindcast]]. This has been completed and, as planned, was not publicly released. The fastest 200 - 500 computers were invited to join because it is a 200-year model and results were needed by February 2006 for the [[Transient coupled model]] launch.
* [[Transient coupled model]] - This comprises an 80-year [[Hindcast]] and an 80-year [[Weather forecasting|Forecast]]. The [[Hindcast]] is to test how well the models perform at recreating the climate of 1920 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/science/strategy.php |title=Strategy - see experiment 2 |publisher=Climateprediction.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823062332/http://climateprediction.net/science/strategy.php |archivedate=2009-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched February 2006 under [[BBC Climate Change Experiment]] branding and later also released from the CPDN site.
* [[Seasonal Attribution Project]] - This is a high resolution model for a single model year to look at extreme precipitation events. This experiment is much shorter due to its single model year, but there are 13.5 times as many cells and timesteps are only 10 minutes instead of 30 minutes. This extra resolution means it requires at least 1.5 [[Gigabyte]]s of [[RAM]]. It uses the HadAM3-N144 climate model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://attribution.cpdn.org//about.php SAP - About] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306175722/http://attribution.cpdn.org//about.php |date=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Myles Allen]] first thought about the need for large [[Climate ensemble]]s in 1997, but was only introduced to the success of [[SETI@home]] in 1999. The first funding proposal in April 1999 was rejected as utterly unrealistic.

Following a presentation at the [[World Climate Conference]] in [[Hamburg]] in September 1999 and a commentary in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] entitled Do it yourself climate prediction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/science/pubs/nature_allen_141099.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406143729/http://www.climateprediction.net/science/pubs/nature_allen_141099.pdf |archivedate=2005-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 1999, thousands signed up to this supposedly imminently available program. The [[Dot-com bubble]] bursting did not help and the project realised they would have to do most of the programming themselves rather than outsourcing.

It was launched September 12, 2003 and on September 13, 2003 the project exceeded the capacity of the [[Earth Simulator]] to become the world's largest climate modelling facility.

The 2003 launch only offered a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] "classic" client. On 26 August 2004 a [[BOINC]] client was launched which supported Windows, [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] clients. "Classic" will continue to be available for a number of years in support of the [[Open University]] course. [[BOINC]] has stopped distributing classic models in favour of sulfur cycle models. A more user friendly BOINC client and website called GridRepublic, which supports climateprediction and other BOINC projects, was released in beta in 2006.

A [[thermohaline circulation]] slowdown experiment was launched in May 2004 under the classic framework to coincide with the film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. This program can still be run but is no longer downloadable. The scientific analysis has been written up in [[Nick Faull]]'s thesis. A paper about the thesis is still to be completed. There is no further planned research with this model.

A '''sulfur cycle model''' was launched in August 2005. They took longer to complete than the original models as a result of having five phases instead of three. Each timestep was also more complicated.

By November 2005, the number of completed results totalled 45,914 classic models, 3,455 thermohaline models, 85,685 BOINC models and 352 sulfur cycle models. This represented over 6 million model years processed.

In February 2006, the project moved on to more realistic climate models. A BBC Climate Change Experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbc.cpdn.org/ |title=climateprediction.net - BBC Climate Change Experiment |publisher=Bbc.cpdn.org |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched, attracting around 23,000 participants on the first day. The [[transient climate simulation]] introduced realistic oceans. This allowed the experiment to investigate changes in the climate response as the [[climate forcing]]s are changed, rather than an equilibrium response to a significant change like doubling the [[carbon dioxide]] level. Therefore, the experiment has now moved on to doing a hindcast of 1920 to 2000 as well as a forecast of 2000 to 2080. This model takes much longer.

The [[BBC]] gave the project publicity with over 120,000 participating computers in the first three weeks.

In March 2006, a high resolution model was released as another project, the [[Seasonal Attribution Project]].

In April 2006, the coupled models were found to have a data input problem. The work was useful for a different purpose than advertised. New models had to be handed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=myles &amp;raquo; Wed Apr 19, 2006 4:20 pm |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=4762 |title=Message Board • View topic - Message From Principal Investigator Re: April 2006 Problem |publisher=Climateprediction.net |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525005113/http://climateprediction.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=4762 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climateprediction.net/science/pubs/nerc2005allen.pdf |title=Potted History |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201102953/http://climateprediction.net/science/pubs/nerc2005allen.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results to date==
The first results of the experiment were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in January 2005 and show that with only slight changes to the parameters within plausible ranges, the models can show climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2&amp;nbsp;°C to more than 11&amp;nbsp;°C (see &lt;ref name="Stainforth2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

The higher climate sensitivities have been challenged as implausible. For example, by Gavin Schmidt (a climate modeler with the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/04/0419_060419_global_warming_2.html |title=Climate Less Sensitive to Greenhouse Gases Than Predicted, Study Says |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation===

[[Climate sensitivity]] is defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of carbon dioxide. Current levels of carbon dioxide are around 390&amp;nbsp;ppm and growing at a rate of 1.8&amp;nbsp;ppm per year compared with preindustrial levels of 280&amp;nbsp;ppm.

Climate sensitivities of greater than 5 °C are widely accepted as being catastrophic.&lt;ref&gt;www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/09/14/1618481114.full&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility of such high sensitivities being plausible given observations had been reported prior to the Climateprediction.net experiment but "this is the first time [[climate model|GCMs]] have produced such behaviour".&lt;ref name="Stainforth2005" /&gt;

Even the models with very high climate sensitivity were found to be "as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models". The test of realism was done with a root mean square error test. This does not check on realism of seasonal changes and it is possible that more diagnostic measures may place stronger constraints on what is realistic. Improved realism tests are being developed.

It is important to the experiment and the goal of obtaining a [[probability distribution function]] (pdf) of climate outcomes to get a very wide range of behaviours even if only to rule out some behaviours as unrealistic. Larger sets of simulations have more reliable pdfs.  Therefore, models with climate sensitivities as high as 11&amp;nbsp;°C are included despite their limited accuracy. The sulfur cycle experiment is likely to extend the range downwards.

===Piani ''et al.'' (2005)===
Published in Geophysical Review Letters, this paper concludes:

When an internally consistent representation of the origins of model-data discrepancy is used to calculate the probability density function of climate sensitivity, the 5th and 95th percentiles are 2.2&amp;nbsp;K and 6.8&amp;nbsp;K respectively. These results are sensitive, particularly the upper bound, to the representation of the origins of model data discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Piani | first1 = C. | last2 = Frame | first2 = D.

== Use in education ==
There is an [[Open University]] short course&lt;ref name="climateprediction.net"/&gt; and teaching material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climateprediction.net/schools/resources.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016161204/http://www.climateprediction.net/schools/resources.php |archivedate=2005-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; available for schools to teach subjects relating to climate and climate modelling. There is also teaching material available for use in Key Stage 3/4 Science, A level Physics (Advanced Physics), Key Stage 3/4 Mathematics, Key Stage 3/4 Geography, 21st Century Science, Science for Public Understanding, Use of Mathematics, Primary.

== The original model ==
The original experiment is run with [[HadSM3]], which is the [[HadAM3]] atmosphere from the [[HadCM3]] model but with only a "slab" ocean rather than a full dynamic ocean. This is faster (and requires less memory) than the full model, but lacks dynamical feedbacks from the ocean, which are incorporated into the full coupled-ocean-atmosphere models used to make projections of climate change out to 2100.

Each downloaded model comes with a slight variation in the various model [[Parametrization (climate)|parameters]].

There is an initial "calibration phase" of 15 model years in which the model calculates the "flux correction"; extra ocean-atmosphere fluxes that are needed to keep the model ocean in balance (the model ocean does not include currents; these fluxes to some extent replace the heat that would be transported by the missing currents).

Then there is a "control phase" of 15 years in which the ocean temperatures are allowed to vary. The flux correction ought to keep the model stable, but [[feedback]]s developed in some of the runs. There is a quality control check, based on the annual mean temperatures, and models which fail this check are discarded.

Then there is a "double CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase" in which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content is instantaneously doubled and the model run for a further 15 years, which in some cases is not quite sufficient model time to settle down to a new (warmer) equilibrium. In this phase some models which produced physically unrealistic results were again discarded.

The quality control checks in the control and 2*CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phases were quite weak: they suffice to exclude obviously unphysical models but do not include (for example) a test of the simulation of the seasonal cycle; hence some of the models passed may still be unrealistic. Further quality control measures are being developed.

The temperature in the doubled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; phase is exponentially extrapolated to work out the equilibrium temperature. Difference in temperature between this and the control phase then gives a measure of the [[climate sensitivity]] of that particular version of the model.

==Visualisations==
Most distributed computing projects have [[screensaver]]s to visually indicate the activity of the application, but they do not usually show its results as they are being calculated. By contrast, climateprediction.net not only uses a built-in visualisation to show the climate of the world being modelled, but it is interactive which allows different aspects of climate (temperature, rainfall, etc.) to be displayed. In addition, there are other, more advanced visualisation programs that allow the user to see more of what the model is doing (usually by analysing previously generated results) and to compare different runs and models.

[[Image:CPView.JPG|thumb|right|400px|CPView]]

The real-time desktop visualisation for the model launched in 2003 was developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = J.P.R.B. Walton, D. Frame and D.A. Stainforth | title = Visualization for Public-Resource Climate Modeling | pages = 103–108 | journal = Data Visualization 2004 | editors = O. Deussen, C. Hansen, D. Keim and D.

Other, more advanced visualisation programs in use include ''CPView'' and ''IDL Advanced Visualisation''. They have similar functionality. CPView was written by Martin Sykes, a participant in the experiment. The IDL Advanced Visualisation was written by Andy Heaps of the [[University of Reading]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]]), and modified to work with the BOINC version by Tesella Support Services plc.

Only CPView allows you to look at unusual diagnostics, rather than the usual Temperature, Pressure, Rainfall, Snow, and Clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~sykesm/cpviewdataindex.html |title=Data Index |publisher=Users.globalnet.co.uk |date=2004-08-17 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 5 sets of data can be displayed on a map. It also has a wider range of functions like Max, Min, further memory functions, and other features.

The Advanced Visualisation has functions for graphs of local areas and over 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days, as well as the more usual graphs of season and annual averages (which both packages do). There are also Latitude - Height plots and Time - Height plots.

The download size is much smaller for CPView and CPView works with [[Windows 98]].
Running the visualisation/screensaver may slow down the processing and is not recommended to be used continuously. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

As of December 2008 there is no visualisation tool that works with the newer CPDN models. Neither CPView nor Advanced Visualisation have been updated to display data gathered from those models. So users can only visualize the data through the screensaver.


== BBC Climate Change Experiment ==
[[Image:CPDN-Client.png|thumb|right|350px|''Climateprediction.net'' screensaver under [[BOINC]] 5.4.9]]

The '''BBC Climate Change Experiment''' was a [[BOINC]] project led by [[Oxford University]] with several partners including the UK [[Met Office]], the [[BBC]], the [[Open University]] and [[Reading University]]. It is the [[Transient coupled model]] of the Climateprediction.net project.

Many participants joined the project with over 120,000 people signing up in [https://web.archive.org/web/20060825024511/http://bbc.cpdn.org/top_teams.php teams].&lt;ref&gt;[http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=cce BBC Climate Change Experiment project status at BOINCStats.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214000105/http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=cce |date=14 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results continued to be collected for some time with the follow-up television program being aired in January 2007. On 8 March 2009, Climateprediction.net officially declared that BBC Climate Change Experiment was finished, and then shut down this project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprediction.net/news BBC Experiment Finished] Climateprediction.net Official Website Project News&lt;/ref&gt;

It is primarily focused on building and validation of atomic models into three-dimensional [[Resolution (electron density)|electron density]] maps obtained by [[X-ray crystallography]] methods, although it has also been applied to data from [[electron microscopy]].

==Overview==
Coot displays electron density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers, and [[Ramachandran plot|Ramachandran idealization]]. The software is designed to be easy-to-learn for novice users, achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user interface elements (menus and toolbars), or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have enhanced the usability of the software for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions, and an extensive scripting interface.

==Features==
Coot can be used to read files containing 3D atomic coordinate models of macromolecular structures in a number of formats, including [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|pdb]], [[mmcif]], and Shelx files. The model may then be rotated in 3D and viewed from any viewpoint. The atomic model is represented by default using a stick-model, with vectors representing chemical bonds. The two halves of each bond are coloured according to the element of the atom at that end of the bond, allowing chemical structure and identity to be visualised in a manner familiar to most chemists.

Coot can also display electron density, which is the result of structure determination experiments such as X-ray crystallography and EM reconstruction. The density is contoured using a 3D-mesh. The contour level controlled using the mouse wheel for easy manipulation - this provides a simple way for the user to get an idea of the 3D electron density profile without the visual clutter of multiple contour levels. Electron density may be read into the program from [[CCP4 (file format)|ccp4]] or [[Crystallography and NMR system|cns]] map formats, though it is more common to calculate an electron density map directly from the X-ray diffraction data, read from an mtz, hkl, fcf or mmcif file.

Coot provides extensive features for model building and refinement (i.e. adjusting the model to better fit the electron density), and for validation (i.e. checking that the atomic model agrees with the experimentally derived electron density and makes chemical sense). The most important of these tools is the real space refinement engine, which will optimize the fit of a section of atomic model to the electron density in real time, with graphical feedback. The user may also intervene in this process, dragging the atoms into the right places if the initial model is too far away from the corresponding electron density.

===Model building tools===

[[Image:Coot-crystallography-software-addresidue.png|right|thumb|150px|Coot Add Terminal Residue]]
Tools for general model building:
* ''C-alpha baton mode'' - trace the main chain of a protein by placing correctly spaced alpha-carbon atoms.
* ''Ca Zone -&gt; Mainchain'' - convert an initial trace of the alpha-carbon atoms to a full main-chain trace.
* ''Place helix here'' - fit a sequence of amino acids in [[alpha helix]] conformation into density.
* ''Place strand here'' - fit a sequence of amino acids in [[beta strand]] conformation into density.
* ''Ideal DNA/RNA'' - build an ideal DNA or RNA fragment.
* ''Find ligands'' - find and fit a model to any small molecule which may be bound to the macromolecule.

Tools for moving existing atoms:
* ''Real space refine zone'' - optimize the fit of the model to the electron density, while preserving stereochemistry.
* ''Regularize zone'' - optimize stereochemistry.
* ''Rigid body fit zone'' - optimize the fit of a rigid body to the electron density.
* ''Rotate/translate zone'' - manually position a rigid body.
* ''Rotamer tools (auto fit rotamer, manual rotamer, mutate and autofit, simple mutate)''
* ''Torsion editing (edit chi angles, edit main chain torsions, general torsions)''
* ''Other protein tools (flip peptide, flip sidechain, cis &lt;-&gt; trans)''

Tools for adding atoms to the model:
* ''Find waters'' - add ordered solvent molecules to the model
* ''Add terminal residue'' - extend a protein or nucleotide chain
* ''Add alternate conformation''
* ''Place atom at pointer''

===Validation tools===

[[Image:Coot-crystallography-software-densityfit.png|right|thumb|150px|Coot density fit validation tool]]

In macromolecular crystallography, the observed data is often weak and the observation-to-parameter ratio near 1. As a result, it is possible to build an incorrect atomic model into the electron density in some cases. To avoid this, careful validation is required. Coot provides a range of validation tools, listed below. Having built an initial model, it is usual to check all of these and reconsider any parts of the model which are highlighted as problematic before deposition of the atomic coordinates with a public database.

* ''[[Ramachandran plot]]'' - validate the [[torsion angle]]s of a protein chain.
* ''[[Gerard Kleywegt|Kleywegt]] plot'' - examine differences between the torsions of NCS-related chains.
* ''Incorrect chiral volumes'' - check for chiral centres with the wrong handedness.
* ''Unmodelled blobs'' - check for electron density not accounted for by existing atoms.
* ''[[Difference density map|Difference map]] peaks'' - check for large differences between observed and calculated density.
* ''Check/Delete waters'' - check for water molecules which do not fit the density.
* ''Check waters by difference map variance''
* ''Geometry analysis'' - check for improbable bond lengths, angles, etc.
* ''[[Peptide bond|Peptide]] omega analysis'' - check for non-planar peptide bonds.
* ''Temperature factor variance analysis'' -
* ''GLN and ASN B-factor outliers'' -
* ''[[Rotamer]] analysis'' - check for unusual protein side-chain conformations.
* ''Density fit analysis'' - identify parts of the model which don't fit the density.
* ''Probe clashes'' - check for Hydrogen atoms with inappropriate environments (using Molprobity).
* ''NCS differences'' - check for general differences between NCS related chains.
* ''Pukka puckers'' - check for unusual DNA/RNA conformations.

==Program architecture==
[[Image:Coot-crystallography-software-structure.png|right|thumb|300px|Coot structure]]

Coot is built upon a number of libraries. Crystallographic tools include the Clipper library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/clipper/clipper.html |title=Dr Kevin Cowtan - About staff, The University of York |website=Ysbl.york.ac.uk |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for manipulating electron density and providing crystallographic algorithms, and the MMDB&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020610085144/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~keb/cldoc/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; for the manipulation of atomic models. Other dependencies include [[FFTW]], and the [[GNU Scientific Library]].

Much of the program's functionality is available through a scripting interface, which provides access from both the Python and Guile scripting languages.

==Relation to CCP4mg==
The CCP4mg molecular graphics software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L. Potterton, S. McNicholas, E. Krissinel, J. Gruber, K. Cowtan, P. Emsley, G. N. Murshudov, S. Cohen, A. Perrakis and M.

The projects are focused on slightly different problems, with CCP4mg dealing with presentation graphics and movies, whereas Coot deals with model building and validation.

==Impact in the crystallographic computing community==
The software has gained considerable popularity over the past 5 years, overtaking widely used packages such as 'O',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xray.bmc.uu.se/~alwyn/ |title=Home Page of Alwyn Jones |website=Xray.bmc.uu.se |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; XtalView,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdsc.edu/CCMS/Packages/XTALVIEW/xtalview.html |title=CCMS Software - XtalView |website=Sdsc.edu |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turbo Frodo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/graphics/turbofrodo/turbo_descrip.html |title=Turbo Frodo Description |website=Csb.yale.edu |date=1999-03-26 |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary publication has been cited in over 10,000 independent scientific papers since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=Coot+model+building+tools+for+molecular+graphics&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5 |title=Coot model building tools for molecular graphics - Google Scholar |website=Scholar.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6669">The '''Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation''' (CAFA) is an experiment designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to [[Protein function prediction|predicting protein function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Predrag|first=Radivojac|title=A large-scale evaluation of computational protein function prediction|journal=Nature Methods|year=2013|volume=10|pages=221–227|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2340|pmid=23353650|issue=3|pmc=3584181|display-authors=etal|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:33780/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[algorithms]] are evaluated by their ability to predict the [[Gene Ontology]] (GO) terms in the categories of [[Gene ontology#GO terms and ontology|Molecular Function]], [[Gene ontology#GO terms and ontology|Biological Process]], and [[Gene ontology#GO terms and ontology|Cellular Component]].

The experiment consists of two tracks: (i) the [[eukaryotic]] track, 
(ii) the [[prokaryotic]] track. In each track, a set of targets is provided by the organizers. Participants are expected to submit their predictions by the submission deadline, after which they are assessed according to a set of specific metrics.

==Motivation==
The [[genome]] of an organism may consist of hundreds to tens of thousands of [[genes]], which encode for hundreds of thousands of different [[protein]] sequences. Due to the relatively low cost of [[genome sequencing]], determining gene and protein sequences is fast and inexpensive. Thousands of species have been sequenced so far, yet many of the proteins are not well characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernal|first=Axel|author2=Uy Ear |author3=Nikos Kyrpides |title=Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD): a monitor of genome projects world-wide|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|year=2001|volume=29 | issue = 1|pages=126–127|doi=10.1093/nar/29.1.126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of experimentally determining the role of a protein in the cell, is an expensive and time consuming task. Further, even when functional [[assays]] are performed they are unlikely to provide complete insight into protein function. Therefore it has become important to use computational tools in order to functionally annotate proteins. There are several computational methods of protein function prediction that can infer protein function using a variety of biological and evolutionary data, but there is significant room for improvement. Accurate prediction of protein function can have longstanding implications on biomedical and pharmaceutical research.

The CAFA experiment is designed to provide unbiased assessment of computational methods, to stimulate research in computational function prediction, and provide insights into the overall state-of-the-art in function prediction.

==Organization==
The experiment consists of three phases:
# ''Prediction phase'': ~4 months

Organizers provide protein sequences with unknown or incomplete function to community and set the deadline for the submission of predictions

# ''Target accumulation'': 6–12 months

After all predictions are stored and the experiment enters a waiting period in which protein functions are expected to accumulate in public databases

# ''Analysis Phase'': 1 month

Predictors are ranked according to their performance. The results are publicly shared in scientific meetings and published after [[peer review]].

==History==
The CAFA experiment is conducted by the Automated Function Prediction (AFP) Special Interest Group (AFP/SIG). An AFP/SIG meeting has been held alongside the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] conference in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedberg|first=Iddo|author2=Martin Jambon |author3=Adam Godzik |title=New avenues in protein function prediction|journal=Protein Science|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1527–1529|doi=10.1110/ps.062158406|pmid=16731984|pmc=2242544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=Ana |author2=Barry Grant |author3=Adam Godzik |author4=Iddo Friedberg|title=The 2006 Automated Function Prediction Meeting|journal=Bioinformatics|year=2007|volume=8|issue=Suppl 4|pages=S1–4 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-8-s4-s1 |pmid=17570143 |pmc=1892079}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillis|first=Jesse|author2=Paul Pavlidis|title=Characterizing the state of the art in the computational assignment of gene function: lessons from the first critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA)|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=April 2013|volume=14|issue=Suppl 3|page=S15|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-s3-s15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first CAFA experiment was organized between fall 2010 and spring 2012. The organizers provided 48,000 sequences for the community with the task to prediction Gene Ontology annotations for each of these sequences. Of those 48,000 proteins, 866 were experimentally annotated during target accumulation phase. The results showed that current function prediction algorithms perform significantly better than a simple domain assignment or a straightforward use of [[BLAST]] package. However, they also revealed that accurate prediction of a protein's biological function is still an open and challenging problem.

The second CAFA experiment kicked off in fall 2013. Starting in August, interested parties could download more than 100,000 target sequences in 27 species. Registered teams are challenged to annotate the sequences with Gene Ontology terms, with an additional challenge to annotate human sequences with [[Human Phenotype Ontology]] terms. The submission deadline was January 15, 2014. The assessment of predictions will take place in June 2014.

[[File:Fall protection allows his men to go home at the end of the day.webm|thumb|A video on the value of fall protection measures]]
'''Fall protection''' is the use of controls designed to protect personnel from [[Falling (accident)|falling]] or in the event they do fall, to stop them without causing severe injury. Typically, fall protection is implemented when working at height, but may be relevant when working near any edge, such as near a pit or hole, or performing work on a steep surface.

There are four generally accepted categories of fall protection: fall elimination, fall prevention, [[fall arrest]] and administrative controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=J. Nigel|title=Introduction to fall protection|date=2011|publisher=[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]|isbn=9781885581587|page=28|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Department of Labor, falls account for 8% of all work-related trauma injuries leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickrest|first1=Ed|title=Fall Protection: Failure is Not an Option|url=http://ehstoday.com/ppe/fall-protection/falls-remain-occupational-hazard-0309|website=EHS Today|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes, standards and regulations in the United States pertaining to the requirements for employers to provide fall protection are administered by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to have fall protection. 1926.501|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10757|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=United States Dept. of Labor|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Falls in the workplace ==
Falls from elevations were the fourth leading cause of workplace death from 1980 through 1994, with an average of 540 deaths per year accounting for 10% of all occupational fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2000-116/|title=Worker Deaths by Falls: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|page=xi|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls are a concern for oil and gas workers, many of whom must work high on a [[derrick]].  A study of falls over the period 2005–2014 found that in 86% of fatal falls studied, fall protection was required by regulation, but it was not used, was used improperly, or the equipment failed.  Many of the fatalities were because, although the workers were wearing harnesses, they neglected to attach them to an anchor point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Krystal L.|last2=Retzer|first2=Kyla D.|last3=Hill|first3=Ryan|last4=Lincoln|first4=Jennifer M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Occupational Fatalities Resulting from Falls in the Oil and Gas Extraction Industry, United States, 2005–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6616a2.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|language=en-us|volume=66|issue=16|pages=417–421|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6616a2|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fall protection ==
In most work-at-height environments, multiple fall protection measures are used concurrently.

=== Fall elimination ===
Fall [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] is often the preferred way of providing fall protection.  This entails finding ways of completing tasks without working at heights.

=== Fall prevention ===
{{main|Fall prevention}}
* Fall guarding is the use of guard rails or other barricades to prevent a person from falling. These barricades are placed near an edge where a fall-hazard can occur, or to surround a weak surface (such as a skylight on a roof) which may break when stepped on.
* Fall restraint is a class of [[personal protective equipment]] to prevent persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., fall restraint lanyards. Typically, fall restraint will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.

=== Fall arrest ===
{{main article|Fall arrest}}
Fall arrest is the form of fall protection that stops a person who has fallen.

=== Administrative controls ===
[[Administrative controls]] are used along with other measures, but they do not physically prevent a worker from going over an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Protection|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10758|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of administrative controls include placing a safety observer or warning line near an edge, or enforcing a safety policy which trains workers and requires them to adhere to other fall protection measures, or prohibiting any un-restrained worker from approaching an edge.

'''''Fibrobacter succinogenes''''' is a cellulolytic [[bacterium]] species in the genus ''[[Fibrobacter]]''. It is present in the [[rumen]] of cattle. Beta glucans are its substrate of choice in the rumen and its products after digestion include formate, acetate and succinate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8745">{{Hatnote|This article outlines the historical development of the laws describing ideal gases. For a detailed description of the ideal gas laws and their further development, see [[ideal gas law]].}}

The '''gas laws''' were developed at the end of the 18th century, when scientists began to realize that relationships between  [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[temperature]] of a sample of [[gas]] could be obtained which would hold to approximation for all gases. Gases behave in a similar way over a wide variety of conditions because they all have [[molecule]]s which are widely spaced, and the [[equation of state]] for an [[ideal gas]] is derived from [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]. The earlier gas laws are now considered as special cases of the [[ideal gas equation]], with one or more variables held constant.

==Boyle's Laws==                
{{Main|Boyle's law}}
In 1662 Robert Boyle studied the relationship between volume and pressure of a gas of fixed amount  at constant temperature. He observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a constant temperature.
Boyle's law, published in 1662, states that, at constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an [[ideal gas]] in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.

A statement of Boyle's law is as follows:

:The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to pressure when the temperature is constant.

The concept can be represented with these formulae:

:&lt;math&gt;V \propto \frac{1}{P}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning "Volume is directly proportional to 1 divided by Pressure", or
:&lt;math&gt;P \propto \frac{1}{V}&lt;/math&gt;,  meaning "Pressure is directly proportional to 1 divided by Volume", or
:&lt;math&gt;PV=k_1&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1=P_2 V_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''P'' is the pressure, and ''V'' is the volume of a gas, and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  is the constant in this equation (and is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).

==Charles's law==
{{Main|Charles's law}}
Charles's law, or the law of volumes, was found in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its [[absolute temperature]], assuming in a closed system.

The statement of Charles's law is as follows:
the volume (V) of a given mass of a gas, at constant pressure (P), is directly proportional to its temperature (T).
As a mathematical equation, Charles's law is written as either:
:&lt;math&gt;V \propto T\,&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;V/T=k_2&lt;/math&gt;, or
:&lt;math&gt;V_1/T_1=V_2/T_2&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''V'' is the volume of a gas, ''T'' is the absolute temperature and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a proportionality constant (which is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).

==Gay-Lussac's law==
{{Main|Gay-Lussac's law}}
Gay-Lussac's law, Amontons' law or the pressure law was found by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1809. It states that, for a given mass and constant volume of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted on the sides of its container is directly proportional to its [[absolute temperature]].

As a mathematical equation, Gay-Lussac's law is written as either:

:&lt;math&gt;P \propto T\,&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;P/T=k&lt;/math&gt;, or
K=P divided by T
:&lt;math&gt;P_1/T_1=P_2/T_2&lt;/math&gt;,

:where ''P'' is the pressure, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, and ''k'' is another proportionality constant.

==Avogadro's law==
{{Main|Avogadro's law}}

Avogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas present in the container. This gives rise to the [[molar volume]] of a gas, which at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] (273.15&amp;nbsp;K, 1 atm) is about 22.4&amp;nbsp;L. The relation is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\frac{V_2}{n_2}    \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''n'' is equal to the number of molecules of gas (or the number of moles of gas).

==Combined and ideal gas laws==
{{main|Ideal gas law}}
The [[Combined gas law]] or General Gas Equation is obtained by combining Boyle's Law, Charles's law, and Gay-Lussac's Law. It shows the relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed mass (quantity) of gas:

:&lt;math&gt;pV = k_5T \,&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \qquad \frac {p_1V_1}{T_1}= \frac {p_2V_2}{T_2} &lt;/math&gt;

With the addition of [[Avogadro's law]], the [[combined gas law]] develops into the [[ideal gas law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where

:''p'' is pressure
:''V'' is volume
:''n'' is the number of moles
:''R'' is the universal gas constant
:''T'' is temperature (K)

:where the proportionality constant, now named R, is the [[universal gas constant]] with a value of 8.3144598 (kPa∙L)/(mol∙K). An equivalent formulation of this law is:

:&lt;math&gt;pV = kNT \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where

:''p'' is the pressure
:''V'' is the volume
:''N'' is the number of gas molecules
:''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] (1.381×10&lt;sup&gt;−23 &lt;/sup&gt;J·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in SI units)
:''T'' is the temperature (K)

These equations are exact only for an [[ideal gas]], which neglects various intermolecular effects (see [[real gas]]). However, the ideal gas law is a good approximation for most gases under moderate pressure and temperature.

This law has the following important consequences:
# If temperature and pressure are kept constant, then the volume of the gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas.
# If the temperature and volume remain constant, then the pressure of the gas changes is directly proportional to the number of molecules of gas present.
# If the number of gas molecules and the temperature remain constant, then the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
# If the temperature changes and the number of gas molecules are kept constant, then either pressure or volume (or both) will change in direct proportion to the temperature.

==Other gas laws==
* [[Graham's law]] states that the rate at which gas molecules [[diffusion|diffuse]] is inversely proportional to the square root of its density at constant temperature. Combined with Avogadro's law (i.e. since equal volumes have equal number of molecules) this is the same as being inversely proportional to the root of the molecular weight.
* [[Dalton's law]] of [[partial pressures]] states that the pressure of a mixture of gases simply is the sum of the [[partial pressures]] of the individual components. Dalton's law is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{\rm total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ... + P_n \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n P_i \,&lt;/math&gt;,

or

:&lt;math&gt; P_\mathrm{total} = P_\mathrm{gas} + P_\mathrm{H_2 O} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; is the total pressure of the atmosphere,
:''P''&lt;sub&gt;Gas&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure of the gas mixture in the atmosphere,
:and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; is the water pressure at that temperature.

* [[Amagat's law]] of [[Partial gas volume|partial volume]] states that the volume of a mixture of gases (or the volume of the container) simply is the sum of the partial volumes of the individual components. Amagat's law is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\rm total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ... + V_n \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n V_i \,&lt;/math&gt;,

:where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; is the total volume of the gas mixture, or the volume of the container,
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial volume of the gas in the gas mixture at that pressure and that temperature.

* [[Henry's law]] states that:
:''At constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the [[partial pressure]] of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.''

:&lt;math&gt; p = k_{\rm H}\, c&lt;/math&gt;

'''Giuseppe Ferrini''' (18th century) was a Florentine model-maker.

He was commissioned by the Florentine surgeon and obstetrician [[Giuseppe Galletti]] (?-1819) to build a series of [[terracotta]] and wax obstetrical models for demonstrating different forms of [[childbirth]] to medical students, surgery students, and students at the School of [[Obstetrics]]. Ferrini worked in the renowned anatomical [[wax-modeling]] laboratory run by the abbot [[Felice Fontana]] (1730-1805). Grand Duke [[Peter Leopold]] (1747-1792) asked Fontana to set up the [[Museo di Fisica e di Storia Naturale]] of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Panzanelli, Roberta, and Julius Ritter von Schlosser.

In [[development studies]], the concept of a [[value chain]] has been used to analyse [[international trade]] in global value chains which comprises “the full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalvaluechains.org/concept-tools|title=Concept &amp; Tools - Global Value Chains|website=Globalvaluechains.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, when activities must be coordinated across geographies, the term '''global value chain''' ('''GVC''') is used in the development literature. Simply put, the global value chain includes all of the people and activities involved in the production of a good or service and its global level supply, distribution and post sales activities (also known as the [[supply chain]]). GVC is similar to [[Value_chain#Industry-level|Industry Level Value Chain]] but encompasses operations at the global level.

== In development ==
The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for [[Developing country|developing countries]] that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, [[Gary Gereffi]], describes a process of almost ‘natural’ learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.&lt;ref&gt;Gereffi, G., (1994). The Organisation of Buyer-Driven Global Commodity Chains: How US Retailers Shape Overseas Production Networks. In G. Gereffi, and M. Korzeniewicz (Eds), Commodity Chains and Global Capitalism. Westport, CT: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; This echoed the ‘export-led’ discourse of the [[World Bank]] in the ‘[[East Asian Miracle]]’ report based on the East Asian ‘[[Four Asian Tigers|Tigers]]’ success.

This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises ([[Multinational corporation|MNE]]) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.

Wider adoption of [[open source hardware]] technology used for [[digital fabrication]] such as [[3D printers]] like the [[RepRap]] has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains.&lt;ref&gt; André O. Laplume, Bent Petersen, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/27224636/Global_Value_Chains_from_a_3D_Printing_Perspective  Global value chains from a 3D printing perspective],  ''Journal of International Business Studies'' 47(5), 595–609 (2016). doi:10.1057/jibs.2015.47 &lt;/ref&gt;

GVC analysis views “upgrading” as a continuum starting with “process upgrading” (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to “product upgrading” where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system ([[Quality management system|QMS]]), and then on to “functional upgrading” in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.&lt;ref name="Humphrey and Schmitz (2004)"&gt;Humphrey, J., and H. Schmitz. 2004. "Chain Governance and Upgrading: Taking Stock". in ''Local Enterprises in the Global Economy'', edited by H. Schmitz, 349–82. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar.&lt;/ref&gt;

This upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers – some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, J. and Schmitz, H. (2000). Governance and Upgrading: Linking Industrial Cluster and Global Value Chain. IDS Working Paper 120, Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer.

=== Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective ===
There are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in [[South Asia]]. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jodie Keane|date=2014|title=''Aid for trade and Global Value Chains: Issues for South Asia''|url=http://www.sawtee.org/publications/Policy-Brief-26.pdf|format=PDF|website=Sawtee.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of [[governance]]. The first were buyer-driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain’s competitiveness.

Current research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gereffi, John Humphrey, and Timothy Sturgeon, “The governance of global value chains,” ''Review of International Political Economy'', vol. 12, no. 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; five GVC governance patterns were identified:
* '''Hierarchical''' chains represent the fully internalised operations of [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] firms.
* '''Quasi-hierarchical''' (or '''captive''' chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor).
* '''Relational''' and '''modular''' chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm.
* '''Market''' chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many [[Commodity market|commodity markets]].

As capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor (Kaplinski, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Kaplinsky, R. (2010), The Role of Standards in Global Value Chains and their Impact on Economic and Social Upgrading, Policy Research Paper 5396, World Bank&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi-hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities (Navas-Aleman, 2011;&lt;ref&gt;Navas - Aleman, L. (2011) “The Impact of Operating in Multiple Value Chains for Upgrading: The Case of the Brazilian Furniture and Footwear Industries” World Development Vol. 39(8), pp. 1386 – 1397&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNCTAD]], 2013).&lt;ref name="unctad.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2013_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=World Investment Report 2013: Global Value Chains: Investment and Trade for Development|website=Unctad.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development ===
In 2013, [[UNCTAD]] published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded &lt;ref name="unctad.org"/&gt; that:
* GVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita growth]]. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for [[Developing country|developing countries]] to enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading.
* However, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks.
* Countries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country’s overall development strategy.
* Before promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries’ trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes:
** embedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities);  
** enabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and 
** developing firm capabilities and training the local workforce.

==Gender and global value chains==
Gender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well.

The '''greater big-footed mouse''' or '''long-tailed big-footed mouse''' (''Macrotarsomys ingens'') is a [[nocturnal]] [[rodent]] found only in north west [[Madagascar]]. It was [[Species description|first described]] by F. Petter in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Petter, F. |year=1959 |title=Un nouveau rongeur de Madagascar (Nesomyinae) : ''Macrotarsomys ingens'' nov. sp. |journal=Mammalia |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=139 |doi=10.1515/mamm.1959.23.2.139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as an endangered species as a result of habitat loss.

==Description==
The greater big-footed mouse grows to a head and body length of up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} with an even longer tail of up to {{convert|24|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Its weight is {{convert|50|to|60|g}} and it has large eyes and large oval ears. Its big feet are adapted for climbing among the branches of trees. The pelage is brownish-fawn with a greyish undercoat; the underparts and legs are creamy white.&lt;ref name=ARKive&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/greater-big-footed-mouse/macrotarsomys-ingens/ |title=Greater big-footed mouse (''Macrotarsomys ingens'') |work=ARKive |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The greater big-footed mouse is found only in Mahajanga Province in north-western Madagascar, in the Ankarafantsika forest which is now part of the [[Ankarafantsika National Park]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; This is a low rainfall area with typical dry tropical vegetation. The mouse is a nocturnal species. It spends the day in a burrow in the forest floor, the entrance of which is concealed under a rock or tree root and spends the night scrambling about in bushes and trees looking for food.&lt;ref name=ARKive/&gt;

==Biology==
The greater big-footed mouse is believed to be [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and probably eats berries, fruit, nuts, seeds, roots, and stems. It probably falls prey to such [[Predation|predators]] as [[snake]]s, [[bird]]s and [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=ARKive/&gt;&lt;!--explain why these are only "believed" and "probably"?--&gt;

==Status==
The greater big-footed mouse is listed as "[[Endangered]]" in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]. This is because, although it is fairly common in the area in which it is found, its total range amounts to a single block of less than {{convert|5000|km2}}.  Its habitat is subject to degradation by fire and logging and the mouse is at risk of predation by [[feral]] animals.&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12646/0 |title=''Macrotarsomys ingens'' |author1=Goodman, S. |author2=Rakotondravony, D. |author3=Dollar, L. |date=2008 |work=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

'''Guttenberg plagiarism scandal''' refers to the German political scandal that led to the resignation of [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] as [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence of Germany]] over the plagiarism of his doctoral dissertation. The first accusations of [[plagiarism]] in Guttenberg's dissertation were made public in February 2011. Guttenberg's doctoral dissertation, "{{lang|de|Verfassung und Verfassungsvertrag}}" ("Constitution and Constitutional Treaty"), had been the basis of his 2007 Doctorate from the [[University of Bayreuth]].&lt;ref name="sz_doktorarbeit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttenbergs-doktorarbeit-summa-cum-laude-mehr-als-schmeichelhaft-1.1060779 |title=Summa cum laude? – „Mehr als schmeichelhaft“|author=Roland Preuß|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sz_plagiatsvorwurf"&gt;{{cite news|author=Roland Preuß and Tanjev Schultz |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsvorwurf-gegen-verteidigungsminister-guttenberg-soll-bei-doktorarbeit-abgeschrieben-haben-1.1060774 |title=Plagiatsvorwurf gegen Verteidigungsminister: zu Guttenberg soll bei Doktorarbeit abgeschrieben haben|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg at first denied intentional plagiarism, calling the accusations "absurd," but acknowledged that he may have made errors in his footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,745919,00.html |title=Fußnoten-Streit: Dr. Guttenberg nennt Plagiatsvorwürfe abstrus|work=Spiegel Online |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-minister-denies"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-12489762 |title=German minister denies plagiarism on PhD thesis |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-resignation"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/01/german-defence-minister-resigns-plagiarism |title=German defence minister resigns in PhD plagiarism row |author=Helen Pidd |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it emerged that Guttenberg had requested a report from the Bundestag's research department, which he had then inserted into his thesis without attribution.&lt;ref name="spiegel-accusations-widen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/plagiarism-accusations-widen-guttenberg-copied-work-of-german-parliament-s-research-department-a-746573.html |title=Plagiarism Accusations Widen: Guttenberg Copied Work of German Parliament's Research Department |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-02-19 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February 2011, Guttenberg apologized in [[Bundestag (Germany)|parliament]] for flaws in his thesis, but denied intentional deception and denied the use of a ghostwriter.&lt;ref name="reuters-admits-mistakes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-minister-plagiarism-idUKTRE71M4JY20110223 |title=German minister admits mistakes in plagiarism row |author=Erik Kirschbaum |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2011, the University of Bayreuth withdrew Guttenberg's doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,747358,00.html|title=Uni Bayreuth entzieht Guttenberg den Doktortitel|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-02-23|accessdate=2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-defense-minister-loses-doctorate-amid-plagiarism-scandal/a-14860585 |title=German defense minister loses doctorate amid plagiarism scandal |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part due to the expressions of confidence by Angela Merkel, the scandal continued to evoke heavy criticism from prominent academics, legal scholars (who accused Guttenberg of intentional plagiarism), and politicians both in the opposition and in the governing coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rudolf Neumaier |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsaffaere-um-guttenberg-wir-sind-einem-betrueger-aufgesessen-1.1065263 |title=Plagiatsaffäre um Guttenberg „Einem Betrüger aufgesessen“|work=sueddeutsche.de |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-juristen-unterstellen-guttenberg-vorsatz/3886578.html |title=Plagiatsaffäre: Juristen unterstellen Guttenberg Vorsatz |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel-resignation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/plagiarism-affair-defense-minister-guttenberg-resigns-a-748330.html |title=Plagiarism Affair: Defense Minister Guttenberg Resigns |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2011, Guttenberg announced his resignation as Minister of Defense, from his seat in the Bundestag, and from all other political offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-guttenberg-idUSTRE7201WI20110301 |title=German defense minister quits in plagiarism row |author=Erik Kirschbaum |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, a University of Bayreuth commission tasked with investigating Guttenberg's dissertation came to the conclusion that Guttenberg had engaged in intentional deception in the writing of his dissertation, and had violated standards of good academic practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/abschlussbericht-in-bayreuth-guttenberg-gibt-familie-mitschuld-an-doktorschmu-a-761868.html |title=Abschlussbericht in Bayreuth: Guttenberg gibt Familie Mitschuld an Doktorschmu |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/university-says-ex-defense-minister-deliberately-cheated-on-thesis/a-15056863 |title=University says ex-defense minister 'deliberately cheated' on thesis |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission found that he had included borrowed passages throughout his thesis, without citation, and had modified those passages in order to conceal their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13365134/Uni-Bayreuth-weist-Guttenbergs-Beteuerungen-zurueck.html |title=Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück |publisher=Die Welt |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/deutschland-1/uni-bayreuth-guttenberg-hat-vorsaetzlich-getaeuscht--45177077.html |title=Uni Bayreuth: Guttenberg hat vorsätzlich getäuscht |publisher=Badische Zeitung |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the prosecution in [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] discontinued the criminal proceedings for copyright violations against Guttenberg on condition of Guttenberg paying €20,000 to a charity. The prosecutor found 23 prosecutable copyright violations in Guttenberg's dissertation, but estimated that the material damage suffered by the authors of those texts was marginal.&lt;ref name="sz-eingestellt"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/ermittlungen-in-plagiatsaffaere-eingestellt-guttenberg-kommt-glimpflich-davon-1.1197275 |title=Guttenberg kommt glimpflich davon |publisher=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2016-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo-ap-dropped"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/prosecutors-drop-case-against-german-ex-minister-113344146.html |title=Prosecutors drop case against German ex-minister |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Background==
Guttenberg studied [[law]] at the [[University of Bayreuth]],&lt;ref name="Muench"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/portraet-der-herr-ist-so-frei_aid_371150.html|title=Der Herr ist so frei|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2009-02-16|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he passed the first legal [[Staatsexamen|state examination]] in 1999. In 2007, he was awarded a doctorate in law, under supervision of [[Peter Häberle]], with a dissertation on the development of [[constitutional law]] in the [[United States]] and the [[European Union]]. The doctoral thesis was titled "{{lang|de|Verfassung und Verfassungsvertrag. Konstitutionelle Entwicklungsstufen in den USA und der EU}}" (translation: "Constitution and Constitutional Treaties – Constitutional Steps of Development in the USA and the EU"). The university awarded the dissertation with the highest honor ''“[[summa cum laude]]”''.

==Loss of doctorate and resignation==
===Fischer-Lescano plagiarism review===
On 12 February 2011 [[Andreas Fischer-Lescano]], professor of law at the [[University of Bremen]], prepared a review of Guttenberg's thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttengerg-affaere-verhasster-enthueller-1.1067213|title=Verhasster Enthüller|date=3 March 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the left-leaning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/18/uk-germany-minister-plagiarism-idUKTRE71H3FZ20110218|title=German minister faces investigation for "Copygate"|date=18 February 2011|publisher=REUTERS|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; German legal quarterly “Kritische Justiz”.&lt;ref name="wollte es nicht glauben"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/09/Interview-Fischer-Lescano|title=Ich wollte es nicht glauben|date=24 February 2011|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer-Lescano was co-editor of this publication. During a reference check he discovered an article of the [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] (NZZ), published in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/gott-hat-keinen-platz-in-der-europaeischen-verfassung-1.268200|title=Gott hat keinen Platz in der europäischen Verfassung|date=22 June 2003|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which passages had been included in Guttenberg's thesis without citation.&lt;ref name="wollte es nicht glauben" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/guttenberg-s-printing-press-german-defense-minister-accused-of-plagiarism-a-745891.html|title=German Defense Minister Accused of Plagiarism|date=16 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE International|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this discovery Fischer-Lescano performed further searches and discovered seven more passages lacking proper citation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttenbergs-doktorarbeit-summa-cum-laude-mehr-als-schmeichelhaft-1.1060779|title=Summa cum laude? - "Mehr als schmeichelhaft"|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the findings with the other editors of “Kritische Justiz” and they decided that their publication, with only 1,800 subscribers, was not the appropriate forum to make the findings public.&lt;ref name="wollte es nicht glauben" /&gt; So Fisher-Lescano contacted the German newspaper [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] in [[Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20110216/33135|title=Guttenberg accused of plagiarizing PhD thesis|date=16 February 2011|publisher=The Local|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2011 the newspaper contacted law professor [[Diethelm Klippel]], the Bayreuth University ombudsman, and informed him of the [[plagiarism]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=1|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klippel had also been on the review committee for Guttenberg's doctoral thesis. On the same day the newspaper informed Guttenberg and gave him a few hours to respond to the allegations.&lt;ref name="Es war kein Betrug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/48/DOS-Guttenberg/komplettansicht |title=Es war kein Betrug|date=26 November 2011|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg was on an official visit in [[Poland]] that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmvg.de/portal/a/bmvg/!ut/p/c4/NYuxDsIwDET_yE4G1IgNVJBYYISypW0UGTVxZZyy8PEkA3fSG-7p8Im12W8UvRJnv-ADh4n24wfGtEV4cZG6QqJMbw1CJeG9feYAE-egjRqyUmUUryywsujSTBGpBmjGwdj-aKz5x37dadc757rucj3fcE3p8AP4zWWx/|title=Zu Guttenberg zu Gesprächen in Polen|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Bundesministerium der Verteidigung|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polen.pl/guttenberg-besuch-in-polen-von-plagiats-diskussion-uberschattet/|title=Guttenberg-Besuch in Polen von Plagiats-Diskussion überschattet|date=21 February 2011|publisher=Polen.pl|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer-Lescano informed Guttenberg's thesis supervisors Peter Häberle and [[Rudolf Streinz]] about the charges.&lt;ref name="wollte es nicht glauben" /&gt;

===Guttenberg offers resignation===
On 16 February 2011 the Süddeutsche Zeitung published an article reporting the allegations against Guttenberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsvorwurf-gegen-verteidigungsminister-guttenberg-soll-bei-doktorarbeit-abgeschrieben-haben-1.1060774|title=Guttenberg soll bei Doktorarbeit abgeschrieben haben|newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=16 February 2011|first=Roland|last=Preuß|first2=Tanjev|last2=Schultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day the German newspaper [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] (FAZ) reported that the introduction of his thesis was borrowed from an FAZ-article from 1997, written by the political scientist Barbara Zehnpfennig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/guttenberg-dissertation-anfang-bei-f-a-z-abgeschrieben-1593201.html|title=Anfang bei F.A.Z. abgeschrieben|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a first statement Guttenberg, who still was in Poland, called the charge, his thesis being a plagiarism, “abstruse”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-02/guttenberg-doktorarbeit-plagiat-reaktionen|title=Guttenberg weist Plagiatsvorwurf als "abstrus" zurück|date=16 February 2011|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plagiarism Row Plagues German Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703561604576150341564716876|title=Plagiarism Row Plagues German Official|date=18 February 2011|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that the thesis was his own achievement and that none of his employees helped him to draft it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/german-minister-rejects-plagiarism-allegations/|title=German Minister Rejects Plagiarism Allegations|date=16 February 2011|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Bayreuth delegated the allegations against Guttenberg to its Commission on Professional Self Regulation in Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|pages=1–2|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 16 February 2011, after his return from Poland, Guttenberg left for a surprise visit to German soldiers in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Plagiarism Row Plagues German Official" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/international/guttenberg-in-afghanistan-1.9563983|title=Guttenberg in Afghanistan|date=17 February 2011|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the night in the military camp “OP North” in the war zone [[Baghlan province]].&lt;ref name=" An zwei Fronten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/mit-guttenberg-in-afghanistan-an-zwei-fronten-1594642.html|title=An zwei Fronten|date=20 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/german-defense-minister-on-a-surprise-visit-to-afghanistan/a-6441641|title=German defense minister on a surprise visit to Afghanistan|date=17 February 2011|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the visit had been planned weeks in advance, allegations were raised, that this trip was some kind of “getaway” for Guttenberg.&lt;ref name=" An zwei Fronten"/&gt;

Guttenberg returned the next day, 17 February 2011, and had a meeting with [[Chancellor of Germany|German chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref name=" An zwei Fronten" /&gt; His offer to resign was refused by Merkel.&lt;ref name="Es war kein Betrug" /&gt; The same day the University of Bayreuth sent a letter to Guttenberg conceding him two weeks to respond to the plagiarism allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8331478/German-minister-given-deadline-in-plagiarism-row.html|title=German minister given deadline in plagiarism row|date=17 February 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-02/schnarrenberg-guttenberg-plagiatvorwurf|title=Uni Bayreuth setzt Guttenberg Frist|date=17 February 2011|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Crowdsourcing|crowd-source]] Guttenplag Wiki was launched by anonymous user PlagDoc as a platform for internet user to submit claims of unattributed work in Guttenberg's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.guttenplag.wikia.com/wiki/GuttenPlag_Wiki/English|title=GuttenPlag - collaborative documentation of plagiarism|publisher=Wikia|date=|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Im Schwarm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,775009-3,00.html|title=Im Schwarm|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-07-18|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German minister rejects quitting in plagiarism row"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/cnews-us-germany-minister-plagiarism-idCATRE71I24620110219|title=German minister rejects quitting in plagiarism row|date=19 February 2011|publisher=REUTERS|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A scheduled speech at an election campaign in [[Saxony-Anhalt]] was cancelled by Guttenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelsey|first=Eric|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/17/us-germany-minister-plagiarism-idUSTRE71G6C720110217|title=German minister cancels speech amid plagiarism scandal|publisher=Reuters|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his meeting with Angela Merkel.&lt;ref name=" An zwei Fronten" /&gt;

The district attorney's office in [[Hof, Bavaria]], announced it would wait on the results of the Bayreuth University's examination of Guttenberg's thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.bayern.de/sta/sta/ho/presse/archiv/2011/02950/|title=Strafanzeige gegen Bundesminister Freiherr zu Guttenberg|date=18 February 2011|publisher=Staatsanwaltschaft Hof|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed that two criminal complaints had been filed against Guttenberg, one regarding possible [[Copyright infringement|copyright violations]] and another on a possible false [[statutory declaration]]. The second was immediately declined by the attorney due to apparent insubstantiality.&lt;ref name=" Regierung: „Das geht noch weiter“"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/debatte-ueber-guttenbergs-dissertation-regierung-das-geht-noch-weiter-1597693.html|title=Regierung: "Das geht noch weiter"|date=18 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung reported its findings that Guttenberg had used texts of 19 authors without correct attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsvorwuerfe-gegen-guttenberg-er-hat-es-mindestens-mal-gemacht-1.1062139|title=19 Ghostwriter wider Willen|date=18 February 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor Angela Merkel declared: “He has my full confidence for his work, and this work is important. He has my support […] and we must wait until the university has completed its examination of the allegations”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/merkel-pledges-support-to-embattled-plagiarism-minister/a-14850899|title=Merkel pledges support to embattled 'plagiarism' minister|date=19 February 2011|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12583321/Merkel-sichert-Guttenberg-volles-Vertrauen-zu.html|title=Merkel sichert Guttenberg "volles Vertrauen" zu|date=18 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview the chancellor attested Guttenberg an “head-on approach” on the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12588218/Merkel-bescheinigt-Guttenberg-offensives-Vorgehen.html|title=Merkel bescheinigt Guttenberg offensives Vorgehen|date=18 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of Parliamentary Research Service===

On February 19, 2011, the German news magazine [[Der Spiegel]] reported that Guttenberg had used works of the German Parliamentary Research Service (PRS) without proper attribution.&lt;ref name="German minister rejects quitting in plagiarism row" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/umstrittene-doktorarbeit-guttenberg-kopierte-auch-von-bundestagsdienst-a-746518.html|title=Guttenberg kopierte auch von Bundestagsdienst|date=19 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any publication of PRS papers requires prior approval by the German Bundestag's departmental management.&lt;ref name="n24.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n24.de/n24/Nachrichten/Politik/d/1228724/guttenberg-raeumt-vor-bundestag-fehler-ein.html|title=Guttenberg räumt vor Bundestag Fehler ein|date=23 February 2011|publisher=N24|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the weekend of February 20, 2011, Guttenberg re-read his thesis to examine Guttenplag's and other's findings.&lt;ref name="Es war kein Betrug" /&gt;

[[File:Barcode zeilen.png|left|thumb|180px|Guttenplag claims of thesis’ pages containing one (black) or more (red) [[plagiarism]] fragments]]
The next day in a letter Guttenberg asked the University of Bayreuth to revoke his title&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|pages=2–3|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plagiatsaffäre: Guttenberg verzichtet dauerhaft auf Doktortitel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-guttenberg-verzichtet-dauerhaft-auf-doktortitel_aid_602194.html|title=Plagiatsaffäre: Guttenberg verzichtet dauerhaft auf Doktortitel|date=21 February 2011|publisher=FOCUS Online|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and declared that he had “lost track of the use of sources over the course of the seven years in which [he] worked on the thesis”, but “at no point made mistakes by intention”.&lt;ref name="German defense minister loses doctorate amid plagiarism scandal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/german-defense-minister-loses-doctorate-amid-plagiarism-scandal/a-14860585|title=German defense minister loses doctorate amid plagiarism scandal|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/guttenberg-brief-an-uni-bayreuth-ueberblick-ueber-quellen-teilweise-verloren-a-747141.html|title=Guttenberg-Brief an Uni Bayreuth: "Überblick über Quellen teilweise verloren"|date=22 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 21 February 2011, chancellor Merkel reiterated her support for Guttenberg and told journalists “I appointed Guttenberg as Minister of Defence. I did not appoint him as an academic assistant or doctor. What is important to me is his work as Minister of Defence and he carries out these duties perfectly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/plagiat-affaere-merkel-als-minister-ist-guttenberg-hervorragend-1594541.html|title=Merkel: Als Minister ist Guttenberg hervorragend|date=21 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German minister in plagiarism row stripped of PhD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reuters.com/article/2011/02/23/idINIndia-55105920110223?pageNumber=2|title=German minister in plagiarism row stripped of PhD|date=23 February 2011|publisher=REUTERS|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This statement caused anger in the German [[Academia|academic community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12658198/Wissenschaftler-werfen-Merkel-Verhoehnung-vor.html|title=Wissenschaftler werfen Merkel "Verhöhnung" vor|date=27 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annette Schavan]], [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|German minister of Education and Research]], who two years later had to resign herself because of plagiarism-accusations related to her own thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/09/german-education-minister-quits-phd-plagiarism|title=German education minister quits over PhD plagiarism|date=9 February 2013|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; declared, that she didn’t “consider the incident to be a trifle”, because “intellectual theft is not a small thing. The protection of intellectual property is a higher good.”&lt;ref name=" Political Allies Blast Guttenberg: Support Wanes Fast for German Defense Minister "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/political-allies-blast-guttenberg-support-wanes-fast-for-german-defense-minister-a-748197.html|title=Political Allies Blast Guttenberg: Support Wanes Fast for German Defense Minister|date=28 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE International|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same day it became known, that Guttenberg had used another PRS paper without proper citation.&lt;ref name="Plagiatsaffäre: Guttenberg verzichtet dauerhaft auf Doktortitel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/guttenberg-weiteres-bundestags-gutachten-verwendet_aid_602178.html|title=Guttenberg: Weiteres Bundestags-Gutachten verwendet|date=21 February 2011|publisher=FOCUS Online|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That evening Guttenberg attended a campaign event in [[Kelkheim]]&lt;ref name="German Defense Minister Defies Calls to Quit Over Plagiarism" /&gt; and stated that he would give up his doctorate title permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Framke|first=Andreas|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/21/us-germany-minister-plagiarism-idUSTRE71K5S320110221|title=German minister gives up PhD title amid scandal|publisher=Reuters|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
“Over the weekend I had another look at my doctorate thesis”, Guttenberg declared and continued "I lost sight of the sources in one of two places.

The University of Bayreuth confirmed the same day that Guttenberg had asked them to revoke his title.&lt;ref name="German minister gives up doctorate after plagiarism row" /&gt;
Chancellor Merkel approved his decision to give up his title, a spokesman declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-minister-renounces-phd-after-accusations-of-plagiarism-2222828.html|title=German minister renounces PhD after accusations of plagiarism|date=23 February 2011|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct criticism on Guttenberg's crisis management was passed by [[Norbert Lammert]], [[President of the Bundestag|President of the German Bundestag]]. In an interview on 22 February 2013, Lammert also expressed his doubts about the reliability of the university's awarding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdr.de/unternehmen/presselounge/pressemitteilungen/2011/02/20110222_eins_zu_eins.phtml|title=Bundestagspräsident Lammert kritisiert Krisenmanagement zu Guttenbergs|date=22 February 2011|publisher=WDR|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of doctorate===
====Parliamentary questioning====
The following day Lammert presided over a parliamentary questioning in the Bundestag on Guttenberg's use of PRS papers in his thesis.&lt;ref name=" Political Allies Blast Guttenberg: Support Wanes Fast for German Defense Minister " /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/17/17092.pdf|title=Plenarprotokoll 17/32|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the questioning politicians from the opposition called for Guttenberg's resignation”&lt;ref name="German minister in plagiarism row stripped of PhD" /&gt; and accused him of cheating, lying and intentions to deceive.&lt;ref name="German defense minister loses doctorate amid plagiarism scandal" /&gt; In his reply Guttenberg again apologized and admitted: “I wrote a dissertation that was obviously flawed”.&lt;ref name="German minister in plagiarism row stripped of PhD" /&gt; He described himself as “a man of mistakes and weaknesses”&lt;ref name="Merkel’s Defense Minister Stripped of University Doctor Title"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-23/merkel-s-defense-minister-stripped-of-university-doctor-title.html|title=Merkel’s Defense Minister Stripped of University Doctor Title|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated “I did not deliberately cheat, but made serious errors”.&lt;ref name="German defence minister stripped of doctorate for plagiarism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/24/german-defence-minister-guttenberg-plagiarism|title=German defence minister stripped of doctorate for plagiarism|date=24 February 2011|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg declared: “I was certainly so arrogant as to believe that I could square the circle by trying to coordinate political passion and work, as well as academic and intellectual challenges, with being a young father” and apologized “for me this was overload, and today I regret to say that I couldn’t manage it.”&lt;ref name="Merkel’s Defense Minister Stripped of University Doctor Title" /&gt; Asked whether his call for the allegations as “abstruse” hadn’t been premature, Guttenberg confirmed this part of his previous statement as it was related to the accusation of his thesis as being a plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/fragestunde-im-bundestag-doktor-guttenberg-und-die-quadratur-des-kreises-1.1064179|title=Guttenbergs Quadratur des Kreises|date=24 February 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/guttenberg-im-bundestag-ich-war-offensichtlich-ueberfordert-a-747280.html|title=Guttenberg im Bundestag: "Ich war offensichtlich überfordert"|date=23 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to accusations of misusing the German Parliamentary Research Service (PRS) Guttenberg pointed out, that all studies had been related to his political work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-02/guttenberg-doktorarbeit-bundestag|title=Guttenberg verwahrt sich gegen Täuschungsvorwurf|date=23 February 2011|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that all papers had been cited, but without the authors’ names, as they had been employers of the PRS. Guttenberg stated, that he couldn’t answer whether he had sought prior approval to use these reports for his thesis but that he had already apologized to Bundestag's President Lammert in case of a potential oversight.&lt;ref name="n24.de"/&gt;

====University revoked title====
On the same day the doctoral commission of Bayreuth University revoked Guttenberg's PhD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/chrono.pdf |title=Universität Bayreuth erkennt zu Guttenberg den Doktorgrad ab| language=German | publisher=Universität Bayreuth| format=PDF |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-uni-bayreuth-erkennt-den-doktortitel-ab-1597705.html|title=Uni Bayreuth erkennt den Doktortitel ab|date=24 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  University's president [[Rüdiger Bormann]] declared, that Guttenberg had “objectively not conformed” to academic standards.&lt;ref name="Defensive Minister: University Withdraws Guttenberg's Doctor Title"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/defensive-minister-university-withdraws-guttenberg-s-doctor-title-a-747402.html|title=Defensive Minister: University Withdraws Guttenberg's Doctor Title|date=24 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE International|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bormann this fast revocation was possible because of Guttenberg's statement.&lt;ref name="German defence minister stripped of doctorate for plagiarism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Die Universität Bayreuth kneift"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttenberg-verliert-doktortitel-reaktionen-die-universitaet-bayreuth-kneift-1.1064265|title=Die Universität Bayreuth kneift|date=24 February 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctoral commission made no judgment as to whether Guttenberg had acted intentionally,&lt;ref name="Defensive Minister: University Withdraws Guttenberg's Doctor Title" /&gt; something that led to criticism.&lt;ref name="Die Universität Bayreuth kneift" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12631117/Die-Uni-Bayreuth-kneift-kritisiert-die-SPD.html|title="Die Uni Bayreuth kneift" – kritisiert die SPD|date=24 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an investigation would “surely have been an extended process”, Bormann declared, which was unnecessary after Guttenberg's request for a withdrawal of his title.&lt;ref name="Defensive Minister: University Withdraws Guttenberg's Doctor Title" /&gt; Further inquiries would be done by the Commission of Professional Self Conduct in Science, Bormann announced.&lt;ref name="Die Universität Bayreuth kneift" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article12635417/Uni-Bayreuth-ueberprueft-moeglichen-Taeuschungsvorsatz.html|title=Uni Bayreuth überprüft möglichen Täuschungsvorsatz|date=24 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chancellor Merkel commented on the revocation of Guttenberg's title as being “in line of what he had requested”.&lt;ref name="Merkel’s Defense Minister Stripped of University Doctor Title" /&gt;

====Further investigations====
On 24 February 2011, [[Bundestagspräsident]] [[Norbert Lammert]] declared that Guttenberg had used six reports by the parliament's research service for his doctoral thesis without prior approval.&lt;ref name=certifiable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/verteidigungsminister-plagiatsvorwuerfe-guttenberg-bediente-sich-bei-sechs-bundestags-expertisen-1.1064636|title=Guttenberg bediente sich bei sechs Bundestags-Expertisen|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,747577,00.html|title=Guttenberg verwendete Bundestags-Expertisen ohne Erlaubnis|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-02-24|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lammert acknowledged the fact that it was widespread practice among Bundestag Members to use documents prepared by the parliamentary research service without first obtaining the necessary approval.&lt;ref name=certifiable /&gt; The same day, an [[open letter]] to chancellor Merkel was published to be signed by doctoral students and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/offener-brief-verhoehnung-aller-wissenschaftlichen-hilfskraefte-a-747702.html|title=Offener Brief: "Verhöhnung aller wissenschaftlichen Hilfskräfte"|date=25 February 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The successor of Guttenberg's thesis supervisor Häberle at the University of Bayreuth, [[Oliver Lepsius]], alleged that the minister made the mistakes deliberately and accused him of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/plagiats-affaere-wir-sind-einem-betrueger-aufgesessen-1592871.html|title=Wir sind einem Betrüger aufgesessen|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media reported that between 1999 and 2006 a new chair of the University of Bayreuth had been sponsored with €747.000 by [[Rhön-Klinikum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg-750-000-euro-fuer-die-uni-bayreuth/3879402.html|title=750.000 Euro für die Uni Bayreuth|date=25 February 2011|publisher=DER TAGESSPIEGEL|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2002 Guttenberg's family held a major stake in the hospital and he had been a member of its [[supervisory board]]. In a statement the university denied any sponsoring by Guttenberg as the funding had been part of cooperation between the university, a health insurance, the state of Bavaria and Rhön-Klinikum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/chrono.pdf |title=Kooperation mit Rhön-Klinikum AG im Bereich Gesundheitsökonomie| language=German | publisher=Universität Bayreuth| format=PDF |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days later, minister Schavan in an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/anette-schavan-ueber-guttenberg-ich-schaeme-mich-nicht-nur-heimlich-1.1065529|title=Ich schäme mich nicht nur heimlich|date=1 March 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized Guttenberg for his thesis: “As someone who earned my doctorate 31 years ago and has worked with many doctoral candidates during my career, I’m embarrassed, and not just privately.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110228-33403.html|title=Schavan 'embarrassed' by Guttenberg|date=28 February 2011|publisher=The Local|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/guttenberg-affaere-schavan-plagiatsaffaere-ist-keine-lappalie-1.1065495|title=Schavan: Plagiatsaffäre ist keine Lappalie|date=27 February 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundestag's president Lammert called the affair a “nail in the coffin for trust in our democracy”.&lt;ref name=" Political Allies Blast Guttenberg: Support Wanes Fast for German Defense Minister " /&gt;

Chancellor Merkel announced through her spokesman Steffen Seibert on 28 February 2011 that Guttenberg had still her full confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/trotz-plagiatsaffaere-merkel-bekraeftigt-ihr-vertrauen-zu-guttenberg-1658642.html|title=Merkel bekräftigt ihr Vertrauen zu Guttenberg|date=28 February 2011|publisher=stern.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asked for Merkel's opinion on the fraud accusation by Oliver Lepsius, Seibert declared, that “fraud requires intention. Any intention was denied by Guttenberg. The Chancellor believes him.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=a1&amp;dig=2011%2F03%2F01%2Fa0031&amp;cHash=67f9f3d9fc3c805eda54a10f1db5cfca|title=Doktoranden gegen Dr. Merkel|date=1 March 2013|publisher=taz|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/ausland/merkel-haelt-weiter-zu-guttenberg-aber-kritik-aus-der-koalition-105276236|title=Merkel hält weiter zu Guttenberg - Aber Kritik aus Koalition|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Aargauer Zeitung|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guttenberg himself gained strong support at a CSU-meeting in Munich, while several CSU-politicians sharply criticized Lammert and Schavan on their comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/aktuell/article12662535/CSU-stuetzt-Guttenberg-Seehofer-kritisiert-Lammert.html|title=CSU stützt Guttenberg – Seehofer kritisiert Lammert|date=28 February 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/schelte-fuer-schavan-und-lammert-seehofer-watscht-guttenberg-kritiker-ab-1659683.html|title=Seehofer watscht Guttenberg-Kritiker ab|date=3 March 2011|publisher=stern.de|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation as Defense Minister===
On 1 March 2011 Guttenberg declared his resignation from all political offices at national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/guttenbergs-erklaerung-ich-habe-die-grenzen-meiner-kraefte-erreicht-a-748372.html|title=Guttenbergs Erklärung: "Ich habe die Grenzen meiner Kräfte erreicht"|date=2011-03-02|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8354285/German-minister-resigns-amid-plagiarism-scandal.html|title=German minister resigns amid plagiarism scandal|date=1 March 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="German Defence Minister Guttenberg resigns over thesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12608083|title=German Defence Minister Guttenberg resigns over thesis|date=1 March 2011|publisher=BBC NEWS|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called this decision the “most painful step of my life” and declared "I was always ready to fight, but I have reached the limits of my strength".&lt;ref name="German defence minister resigns in plagiarism scandal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-germany-resign-20110302,0,3829961.story|title=German defence minister resigns in plagiarism scandal| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I must agree with my enemies who say that I was not appointed minister for self-defence, but defence-minister" Guttenberg said in view of his ministerial office. As for the enquiry regarding his thesis he announced his full cooperation with the district attorney's investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/guttenberg762.html|title=Minister Guttenberg erklärt seinen Rücktritt|language=German|publisher=tagesschau.de|date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg thanked Angela Merkel for her support, trust and understanding.&lt;ref name="German Defence Minister Guttenberg resigns over thesis" /&gt;

Chancellor Merkel reacted to Guttenberg's decision by saying that “I deeply regret his resignation”.&lt;ref name="German defence minister resigns in plagiarism scandal" /&gt; For Merkel he had “a unique and extraordinary ability” relating to people. For the future the Chancellor declared that "I am convinced that we will have the opportunity to work together again in the future, in whatever form that may take".&lt;ref name="German Defence Minister Guttenberg resigns over thesis" /&gt;

Rüdiger Bormann, president of University of Bayreuth, declared, that the inquiries of its Commission on Professional Self Regulation in Science would continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/chrono.pdf |title=Der Präsident der Universität Bayreuth, Professor Dr. Rüdiger Bormann, zum Rücktritt von Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg| language=German | publisher=Universität Bayreuth| format=PDF |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apology===
On 2 March 2011 the district attorney's office in Hof announced the launch of an investigation into potential copyright violations contained in Guttenberg's thesis as soon as his [[Parliamentary immunity|immunity]] would be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.bayern.de/sta/sta/ho/presse/archiv/2011/02949/|title=Strafanzeigen betreffend Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg|date=2 March 2011|publisher=Staatsanwaltschaft Hof|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With his official resignation as [[Member of Parliament]] the following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete17/ausgeschiedene/index.html|title=Ausgeschiedene Abgeordnete und deren Nachfolger|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guttenberg abandoned his parliamentary immunity, thus allowing the district attorney's investigations to proceed. Media reported on more than 80 charges, which had been filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/mehr-als-80-anzeigen-gegen-guttenberg-betrug-untreue-urheberrechtsverstoesse-a-748940.html|title=Mehr als 80 Anzeigen gegen Guttenberg: Betrug, Untreue, Urheberrechtsverstöße|date=3 March 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 2011 Guttenberg received his dismissal certificate in a ceremony hosted by [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Christian Wulff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Ermittlungen-gegen-Guttenberg-article2754991.html|title=Ermittlungen gegen Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=n-tv|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, media reported about an anonymous member of the Commission of Professional Self Regulation in Science allegedly accusing Guttenberg of deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-staatsanwalt-ermittelt-gegen-guttenberg-1659478.html|title=Staatsanwalt ermittelt gegen Guttenberg|date=3 March 2011|publisher=stern.de|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Volker Rieble]], law professor at [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], himself a strong critic of Guttenberg's thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/aberkannter-doktortitel-guttenbergs-uni-im-visier-der-kritik-1657494.html|title=Guttenbergs Uni im Visier der Kritik|date=25 February 2011|publisher=stern.|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published an op-ed disputing the legal basis for further investigations in view of the fact that the university had already revoked Guttenberg's title and that he was no longer affiliated with the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/artikel/C32372/guttenbergs-plagiataffaere-bayreuth-fehlt-legitimation-zur-pruefung-30329397.html|title=Bayreuth fehlt Legitimation zur Prüfung|language=German|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|date=2011-03-03|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2011, the thesis supervisors Peter Häberle and Rudolf Streinz issued a statement declaring that in 2006, when the thesis was finished, the plagiarism wasn’t detectable for lack of technical opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/guttenbergs-doktorvater-plagiat-war-2006-noch-nicht-erkennbar-1612183.html|title=Plagiat war 2006 noch nicht erkennbar|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without knowledge of the copied passages, Guttenberg's thesis demonstrated “a high degree of analytical depths and penetrated the dissertation topic in all its facets”, Häberle emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/guttenbergs-doktorvater-plagiat-war-noch-nicht-erkennbar-1.1068885|title=Plagiat war 2006 noch nicht erkennbar|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It is important to note that the candidate [Guttenberg] was able to respond successfully to even intense questioning regarding the methodology and content of the thesis and was completely able to hold his own during the discussion as part of the oral PhD exam”,&lt;ref name="Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen Guttenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-03/guttenberg-staatsanwaltschaft-ermittlung|title=Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen Guttenberg|date=7 March 2013|publisher=ZEIT ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the supervisors declared on Guttenberg's doctoral examination procedure and its grading (summa cum laude).&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|pages=9–10|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March 2011 the district attorney's office in Hof announced the launch of a preliminary investigation into potential copyright violations by Guttenberg.&lt;ref name="Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen Guttenberg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-staatsanwalt-leitet-ermittlungen-gegen-guttenberg-ein-a-749452.html|title=Plagiatsaffäre: Staatsanwalt leitet Ermittlungen gegen Guttenberg ein|date=7 March 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsvorwuerfe-staatsanwalt-ermittelt-gegen-guttenberg-1660910.html|title=Staatsanwalt ermittelt gegen Guttenberg|date=7 March 2013|publisher=stern.de|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Bayreuth, on 8 March 2011, announced the expansion of the commission investigating Guttenberg's dissertation to also include [[Wolfgang Löwer]], professor of law at [[University of Bonn]], and [[Jürgen Mittelstraß]], professor of philosophy at [[University of Konstanz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,750355,00.html|title=Uni entscheidet erst im April|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-03-11|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, as a means of taking responsibility for his error, Guttenberg sent personal apology letters to all those authors who were not properly quoted in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswissenschaftler-guttenberg-bittet-persoenlich-um-entschuldigung_aid_607801.html|title=Guttenberg bittet persönlich um Entschuldigung|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2011-03-12|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/vorab/0,1518,750513,00.html|title=Guttenberg entschuldigt sich bei Wissenschaftlern|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-03-12|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guttenberg resigned from his last political office, the [[Kulmbach]] county council, on 15 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,757318,00.html|title=Guttenberg legt Kreistagsmandat nieder|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-04-15|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same day the open letter, signed by 63,713 people, was delivered to the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/OffenerBrief|title=Causa Guttenberg - Offener Brief von Doktoranden an die Bundeskanzlerin|date=17 March 2011|publisher=Facebook|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 March 2011 the [[Zurich]] weekly [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung|NZZ]] published extracts of an apology Guttenberg had sent to Klara Obermüller for not quoting her in his dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/schweiz/guttenberg-entschuldigt-sich-bei-nzz-autorin-106114663|title=Guttenberg entschuldigt sich bei NZZ-Autorin|date=20 March 2011|publisher=Aargauer Zeitung|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8393924/Karl-Theodor-zu-Guttenberg-apologises-to-Swiss-journalist-over-plagiarism-row.html|title=Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg apologises to Swiss journalist over plagiarism row|date=20 March 2011|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commission report and response===
On 7 April 2011, the Commission of Professional Self Regulation in Science sent its report of preliminary findings to Guttenberg asking for his response by 26 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/076-072-guttenberg.pdf|title=Weitere Schritte der Universität Bayreuth im Fall zu Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|date=2011-04-12|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spiegel Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,756082,00.html|title=Guttenbergs Anwalt attackiert Uni Bayreuth|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-04-11|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 2011, there was a first leak of the commission's initial findings to the press, in which Guttenberg was accused of deliberate deception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/plagiatsaffaere-um-doktorarbeit-gutachten-guttenberg-hat-absichtlich-abgeschrieben-1.1083118|title=Gutachten: Guttenberg hat absichtlich abgeschrieben|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guttenberg's lawyer sharply criticized the commission's leaks as an unfair "prejudgment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-guttenberg-anwalt-keilt-gegen-universitaet-bayreuth_aid_616988.html|title=Guttenberg-Anwalt keilt gegen Universität Bayreuth|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2011-04-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenbergs Anwalt spricht von Vorverurteilung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/artikel/S32372/plagiatsaffaere-guttenbergs-anwalt-spricht-von-vorverurteilung-30333737.html|title=Guttenbergs Anwalt spricht von "Vorverurteilung"|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|date=2011-04-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-04/guttenberg-anwalt-universitaet-bayreuth|title=Guttenbergs Anwalt greift Uni Bayreuth an|language=German|publisher=Zeit Onlie|date=2011-04-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his client given that the press reports were published both before the end of the investigation and before the 26 April deadline Guttenberg had been given by the university to respond to the commission's report before its public release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/076-072-guttenberg.pdf|title=Weitere Schritte der Universität Bayreuth im Fall zu Guttenberg|date=12 April 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|language=German|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lawyer also pointed out that the leaks were a violation of Guttenberg's [[personal rights]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel Online"/&gt; Critics accused Guttenberg of trying to prevent the public release of the commission's final report,&lt;ref name=SDZ1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/plagiatsaffaere-um-doktorarbeit-gutachten-guttenberg-hat-absichtlich-abgeschrieben-1.1083118|title=Gutachten: Guttenberg hat absichtlich abgeschrieben|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-04-08|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth darf Guttenberg-Gutachten veröffentlichen|language=German"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,756858,00.html|title=Uni Bayreuth darf Guttenberg-Gutachten veröffentlichen|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation that he rejected.&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-04/guttenberg-doktorarbeit-untersuchungsergebnisse|title=Guttenberg stimmt Veröffentlichung des Uni-Berichts zu|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenberg lässt Gutachten veröffentlichen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-guttenberg-laesst-gutachten-veroeffentlichen_aid_618217.html|title=Guttenberg lässt Gutachten veröffentlichen|language=German|publisher=Focus Online|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several representatives from universities and science demanded the release of the commission's report due to public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/deutschland/parteien/id_45684104/plagiat-affaere-wissenschaftler-fordern-guttenberg-bericht-zu-veroeffentlichen.html|title=Wissenschaftler: Guttenberg-Bericht veröffentlichen|date=12 April 2011|publisher=T-Online|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman of the university rejected the lawyer's charges and stated that there had been no official report accusing Guttenberg of deliberate deception.&lt;ref name="Guttenbergs Anwalt spricht von Vorverurteilung" /&gt;
The spokesman of chancellor Merkel declared on 11 April 2011 that she was expecting full clarification of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/plagiatsaffaere-merkel-verlangt-von-guttenberg-aufklaerung-a-756280.html|title=Plagiatsaffäre: Merkel verlangt von Guttenberg Aufklärung|date=11 April 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Merkel-fordert-Aufklaerung-article3074641.html|title=Guttenbergs Plagiatsaffäre: Merkel fordert Aufklärung|date=11 April 2011|publisher=n-tv|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guttenberg's lawyers declared on 13 April 2011 that he was still standing by his commitment of full cooperation but that he was opposed to leaks to the press, which violated proper proceedings and caused prejudgment. Guttenberg had no objection against publishing the commission's report after end of proceedings, the lawyers said.&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth darf Guttenberg-Gutachten veröffentlichen|language=German" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenberg lässt Gutachten veröffentlichen" /&gt; The same day it was reported that the Bundestag would not press charges against Guttenberg.&lt;ref name=SDZ1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/plagiatsaffaere-bundestag-verzichtet-auf-strafantrag-gegen-guttenberg-1.1084537|title=Bundestag verzichtet auf Strafantrag gegen Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=2011-04-13|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later media published extracts from Guttenberg's initial response to the commission. Guttenberg denied any deliberate plagiarism. He described the working-method during the several years of his dissertation as often working in short periods and using various different data carriers. This led to his losing track of the PhD dissertation, Guttenberg stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/stellungnahme-fuer-uni-bayreuth-guttenberg-bestreitet-plagiatsvorwurf-a-757485.html|title=Stellungnahme für Uni Bayreuth: Guttenberg bestreitet Plagiatsvorwurf|date=16 April 2011|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/guttenberg-bestreitet-taeuschung-habe-die-uebersicht-verloren-1625834.html|title=Habe die Übersicht verloren|date=17 April 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preliminaries===
The report started with the elaboration of the commission's historical background,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=3|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; its internal duties within the Bayreuth University, also in relation to other committees like the university's promotion commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=4|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included institutional enhancements, the evaluation of academic misconduct corresponding to standards of scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=5|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report then defined the criteria of academic misconduct: deliberately or grossly negligent use of “Falschangaben” (misrepresentations), the violation of other's intellectual property, and the obstruction of research. “Falschangaben” were defined as the fabrication or distortion of data and the “obstruction of research” was defined as unauthorized use of material with arrogation of its authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=6|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commission comprised as regular members [[Wiebke Putz-Osterloh]], [[Nuri Aksel]], [[Paul Rösch]], [[Stephan Rixen]] as chairman, and [[Diethelm Klippel]] as a consulting member – all from the University of Bayreuth.&lt;ref name="report p. 7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=7|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 8 March 2011 [[Wolfgang Löwer]], professor of law at University of Bonn, and [[Jürgen Mittelstraß]], professor of philosophy at University of Konstanz joined the commission as consulting members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=9|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report listed four commission's meeting on Guttenberg's thesis: 16 February 2011, 8 and 23 March 2011, and the final meeting on 7 April 2011. The hearings of the thesis’ supervisors were on 23 March 2011.&lt;ref name="report p. 7" /&gt; Then the report specified the used material including its communications with Guttenberg himself.&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth"/&gt;

===Commission’s findings===
The commission reported missing citations and violations of the academic rules of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=13|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported numerous verbatim forms of plagiarism and plagiarism with regard to content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=14|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13365134/Uni-Bayreuth-weist-Guttenbergs-Beteuerungen-zurueck.html|title=Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück|date=11 May 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   where the use of other authors’ material was not clearly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=15|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission exemplified this in detail on the basis of six Parliamentary Research Service (PRS)  papers and listed the passages Guttenberg had used in his thesis, including all text modifications and extensions. Two of the PRS papers lacked any citation and four PRS papers were cited insufficiently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|pages=15–20|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to misconceptions about the initial authorship of the passages.&lt;ref name="report p. 20"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=20|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commission judged this as deception and described a pattern of creation (werkprägendes Bearbeitungsmuster).&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth gibt Guttenberg alle Schuld"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13366148/Universitaet-Bayreuth-gibt-Guttenberg-alle-Schuld.html|title=Universität Bayreuth gibt Guttenberg alle Schuld|date=11 May 2011|publisher=DIE WELT|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Guttenberg, the commission concluded on intentional actions and deliberate deception due to the numbers of violations of academic rules of citations.&lt;ref name="report p. 20" /&gt; Both the use of verbatim text elements and the use with marginal text changes lacking proper citation or listing cited sources only in bibliography were evaluated as attempts to cover up.&lt;ref name="report p. 21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=21|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The commission saw no indications that the thesis had been written by a ghost-writer.&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth gibt Guttenberg alle Schuld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="report p. 26"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=26|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to previous expectations,&lt;ref name=" University says ex-defense minister 'deliberately cheated' on thesis" /&gt; the commission denied any responsibility of the thesis supervisors&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt;&lt;ref name="report p. 26"/&gt; due to a lack of semantic or other indicators for plagiarism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=28|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Guttenberg's “exceedingly convincing” oral PhD exam ("rigorosum").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=30|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Only the supervisors’ omission to ask for the PRS papers cited in the bibliography and the grading with “summa cum laude” was criticized by the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=29|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guttenberg’s statement===
In his final response, Guttenberg once again denied that he had deliberately deceived the university and instead blamed severe “errors in workmanship” for the grave deficiencies in his doctoral thesis.&lt;ref name="Guttenberg spricht von Missverständnis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,759910,00.html|title=Guttenberg spricht von Missverständnis|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-04-30|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DerWesten.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/nachrichten/politik/Guttenberg-erklaert-Plagiat-mit-Mehrfachbelastung-Uni-legt-Abschlussbericht-vor-id4635168.html|title=Guttenberg erklärt Plagiat mit Mehrfachbelastung - Uni legt Abschlussbericht vor|language=German|publisher=DerWesten.de|date=2011-05-11|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handelsblatt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/uni-bericht-guttenberg-erklaert-plagiat-mit-dauerstress/4160418.html|title=Guttenberg erklärt Plagiat mit Dauerstress|language=German|publisher=Handelsblatt|date=2011-05-11|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described a high burden of professional commitments as a result of new political responsibilities&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt; during the years of his dissertation, which led to an ad-hoc and sometimes chaotic working-method&lt;ref name="Handelsblatt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="report p. 23"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=23|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with long intervals between working periods.&lt;ref name="report p. 24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|page=24|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guttenberg reported on diverse collections of material such as books, loose sheets of papers, more than 80 data carriers, and several laptops spread across several domiciles,&lt;ref name="report p. 23" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/2.1673/plagiatsaffaere-guttenberg-nicht-fahrlaessig-sondern-vorsaetzlich-1643270.html|title=Nicht fahrlässig, sondern vorsätzlich|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for his thesis. This led to an overburdening by the thesis, which further increased during the years, Guttenberg described.&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt; Family expectations, namely that a started task had to be finished,&lt;ref name="DerWesten.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="report p. 24" /&gt; his intention to not disappoint his supervisor,&lt;ref name="report p. 24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenberg ist die Arbeit über den Kopf gewachsen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/abschlussbericht-zur-plagiatsaffaere-guttenberg-ist-die-arbeit-ueber-den-kopf-gewachsen-1.1095827|title=Guttenberg ist die Arbeit "über den Kopf gewachsen"|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his unwillingness to admit weakness,&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt;&lt;ref name="report p. 24" /&gt; hindered him to quit the dissertation, Guttenberg explained.
The commission however, based on the view, that Guttenberg had continued his dissertation despite the feeling of being overburdened, denied negligence and concluded on intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-bayreuth.de/presse/Aktuelle-Infos/2011/Ablauf_15_03_2011.pdf|title=Dokumentation Fall Guttenberg Ablauf|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Universität Bayreuth|pages=24–25|language=German|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/panorama/vermischtes/guttenbergs-doktorarbeit-eine-grosse-schlamperei-in-folge-von-dauerstress_aid_626306.html|title=Guttenbergs Doktorarbeit: "Eine große Schlamperei in Folge von Dauerstress"|date=11 May 2011|publisher=FOCUS Online|language=German|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
===Critic of Walter Schmitt-Glaeser===
The University of Bayreuth's handling of the matter was sharply criticized by its former Vice-President and law professor [[Walter Schmitt-Glaeser]], who, while agreeing that revoking the doctoral degree was justified, described the additional measures taken by the institution as an attempt at character assassination ("Treibjagd").&lt;ref name="Über die Ohnmacht des Gejagten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg/plagiats-affaere-offener-brief-von-walter-schmitt-glaeser-17816744.bild.html|title=Über die Ohnmacht des Gejagten|language=German|publisher=Bild.de|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As any affiliation of Guttenberg to the university was severed by the withdrawal of his title, the university therefore lacked legal standing for any further investigation,&lt;ref name="Bayreuth-Professor rügt Treibjagd auf Guttenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13362187/Bayreuth-Professor-ruegt-Treibjagd-auf-Guttenberg.html|title=Bayreuth-Professor rügt "Treibjagd" auf Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Ex-Uni-Präsident spricht von Treibjagd gegen Guttenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/Ex-Uni-Praesident-spricht-von-Treibjagd-gegen-Guttenberg-id15027166.html|title=Ex-Uni-Präsident spricht von "Treibjagd" gegen Guttenberg|date=10 May 2011|publisher=Augsburger Allgemeine|language=German|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt-Glaeser argued. The leaking of information from the commission's confidential meetings to the press – according to Schmitt-Glaeser most-likely done by its members – he called “outrageous” and “more than embarrassing”.

For Schmitt-Glaeser especially the part of the report looking into a possible deception by Guttenberg should not have been published. Also, according to Schmitt-Glaeser, the fact that Guttenberg had to agree to the report's publication due to massive public pressure, including from University of Bayreuth, cast a shadow of suspicion on the entire proceedings.&lt;ref name="Über die Ohnmacht des Gejagten" /&gt; The professor, former president (CSU) of the [[Bavarian senate]], also criticized the lack of conclusive evidence to prove the university's assertion that there was "deliberate deception" on the part of Guttenberg,&lt;ref name="Bild.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/karl-theodor-zu-guttenberg/plagiats-affaere-was-jetzt-passiert-ist-eine-treibjagd-17814204.bild.html|title=Was jetzt passiert, ist eine Treibjagd|language=German|publisher=Bild.de|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmitt-Glaeser referred to the multiple instances of minor text changes – which the commission viewed as indicators of cheating – as a typical procedure with a text considered by an author as his own work.&lt;ref name="Über die Ohnmacht des Gejagten" /&gt;  With the proceedings the university denied any solicitousness for its former student Guttenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/guttenberg-affaere-walter-schmitt-glaeser-kritisiert-uni-bayreuth-1683247.html|title=Walter Schmitt-Glaeser kritisiert Uni Bayreuth|language=German|publisher=stern.de|date=2011-05-10|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and damaged his social existence,&lt;ref name=" Ex-Uni-Präsident spricht von Treibjagd gegen Guttenberg" /&gt; the professor criticized. From the judicial proceeding on this case he expected a result solely based on facts without regard to the person concerned.&lt;ref name="Über die Ohnmacht des Gejagten" /&gt;  In an interview, Schmitt-Glaeser described the university's intention as an attempt to “drag Guttenberg in front of a [[tribunal]] and find him guilty”.&lt;ref name="Bild.de"/&gt; In the professor's conviction, knowing Guttenberg personally, he had not committed intentional cheating.&lt;ref name="Bayreuth-Professor rügt Treibjagd auf Guttenberg" /&gt;

===Disputed neutrality===
Others{{Who|date=December 2016}} criticized the commission's final report for not decrying the university's own lack of [[due diligence]]&lt;ref name="Uni Bayreuth weist Guttenbergs Beteuerungen zurück" /&gt; in the matter and noted that the university had first awarded Guttenberg's degree with the highest possible distinction ("summa cum laude").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/interview_dlf/1455639/|title=War das die Landesblindenanstalt?|language=German|publisher=Deutschlandfunk|date=2011-05-11|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttenberg rührt seine Richter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/finaler-bericht-der-uni-bayreuth-guttenberg-ruehrt-seine-richter-1683658.html|title=Guttenberg rührt seine Richter|date=11 May 2011|publisher=stern.de|language=German|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the commission's neutrality was disputed as the University of Bayreuth was party to the proceedings. Among these critics was Thomas Goppel (CSU), former Bavarian Minister of Education, who viewed the report as an attempt by the university to downplay its own responsibility and acquit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/interview_dlf/1455170/|title=Goppel: Guttenbergs Politikkarriere "im Prinzip vorbei"|date=11 May 2011|publisher=Deutschlandfunk|language=German|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained about the University's lack of control provisions.&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth gibt Guttenberg alle Schuld" /&gt;

===Volker Rieble===
Professor Volker Rieble approved the report of the University but saw the case as an expression of the public desire for “ritual punishment”. Rieble decried the widespread practice of academic publications being written by assistants but published by professors as much worse for academia than any plagiarism.&lt;ref name="Guttenberg rührt seine Richter" /&gt;

===Günther Beckstein===
[[Günther Beckstein]], former [[Minister-President]] of Bavaria, referred to Guttenberg by saying that everyone deserves a second chance, after some period of time.&lt;ref name="Universität Bayreuth gibt Guttenberg alle Schuld" /&gt;

==August 2011==
In August 2011, the authors of Guttenplag Wiki, which triggered similar initiatives on [[VroniPlag Wiki]], were accused of running a partisan campaign after it emerged that the founder of VroniPlag was a member of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD party]].&lt;ref name="Im Schwarm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/deutschland-1/plagiatsjaeger-enttarnt-vorwurf-der-parteilichkeit--48254663.html|title=Plagiatsjäger enttarnt – Vorwurf der Parteilichkeit|language=German|publisher=Badische Zeitung|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13529200/VroniPlag-Gruender-sichert-sich-Namensrechte.html|title=VroniPlag-Gründer sichert sich Namensrechte|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 the attorney's office in Hof dropped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204630904577058002872268724|title=Germany Drops Criminal Probe of zu Guttenberg|date=24 November 2011|publisher=THE WALL STREET JOURNAL|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the charges against Guttenberg after having found 23 relevant copyright violations with only minor economic damage.&lt;ref name="attHof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.bayern.de/sta/sta/ho/presse/archiv/2011/03268/index.php|title=Ermittlungsverfahren Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Staatsanwaltschaft Hof|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/karriere/ermittlungen-in-plagiatsaffaere-eingestellt-guttenberg-kommt-glimpflich-davon-1.1197275|title=Guttenberg kommt glimpflich davon|date=23 November 2011|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|language=German|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was criticized for being biased toward economic criteria.&lt;ref name="Hof" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/guttenberg-opfer-er-hat-getaeuscht-ohne-zu-bereuen-a-799515.html|title=Guttenberg-Opfer: "Er hat getäuscht, ohne zu bereuen"|language=German|publisher=Spiegel online|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court approved this arrangement after Guttenberg had agreed to make a donation of 20,000 Euro to a German charitable foundation.&lt;ref name="attHof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/plagiatsaffaere-staatsanwaltschaft-stellt-ermittlungen-gegen-guttenberg-ein-a-799457.html|title=Staatsanwaltschaft stellt Ermittlungen gegen Guttenberg ein|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney's office saw no indications that Guttenberg had intentionally used other authors’ texts within his thesis without proper attribution and judged his explanation of losing track of sources as “comprehensible and irrefutable”.&lt;ref name="Spiegel 2011-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,801533,00.html|title=Staatsanwaltschaft geht nicht von Täuschungsabsicht aus|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2011-12-04|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rundschau-online.de/html/artikel/1322581266424.shtml|title=Staatsanwalt entlastet zu Guttenberg|language=German|publisher=Kölnische Rundschau|date=2011-12-04|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to University of Bayreuth, which had accused Guttenberg of deliberate deception, the prosecution concluded that Guttenberg had made the thesis’ errors only with contingent intent (dolus eventualis).&lt;ref name="Welt111204"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article13749960/Guttenberg-soll-nicht-absichtlich-getaeuscht-haben.html|title=Guttenberg soll nicht absichtlich getäuscht haben|language=German|publisher=Die Welt|date=2011-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The attorney's office also stated that there was no criminal abuse of his PhD title nor fraud or breach of trust related to PRS papers either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2016830567_apeugermanyministerplagiarism.html|title=Prosecutors drop case against German ex-minister|date=23 November 2011|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ecology]], a '''habitat''' is the type of [[natural environment]] in which a particular [[species]] of [[organism]] lives. It is characterized by both physical and biological features. A species' habitat is those places where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.

The physical factors are for example [[soil]], [[moisture]], range of [[temperature]], and [[light]] intensity as well as [[Biotic index|biotic]] factors such as the availability of [[food]] and the presence or absence of [[Predation|predators]]. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of [[moss]], and for a [[Parasitism|parasitic organism]] it is the body of its [[Host (biology)|host]], part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a [[Cell (biology)|single cell]] within the host's body.

Habitat types include [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]], [[Temperate climate|temperate]], [[Subtropics|subtropical]] and [[Tropics|tropical]]. The terrestrial [[vegetation type]] may be [[forest]], [[steppe]], [[grassland]], semi-arid or [[desert]]. [[Fresh water]] habitats include [[marsh]]es, [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[pond]]s and [[Estuary|estuaries]], and marine habitats include salt marshes, the coast, the [[intertidal zone]], [[reef]]s, bays, the open sea, the sea bed, deep water and [[Hydrothermal vent|submarine vents]].

Habitats change over time. This may be due to a violent event such as the eruption of a [[volcano]], an [[earthquake]], a [[tsunami]], a [[wildfire]] or a change in oceanic currents; or the change may be more gradual over millennia with alterations in the [[climate]], as [[ice sheet]]s and [[glacier]]s advance and retreat, and as different weather patterns bring changes of [[precipitation]] and [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Other changes come as a direct result of human activities; [[deforestation]], the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed. The [[Introduced species|introduction of alien species]] can have a devastating effect on native wildlife, through increased [[predation]], through competition for resources or through the introduction of pests and diseases to which the native species have no immunity.

==Definition and etymology==
The word "habitat" has been in use since about 1755 and derives from the [[Latin]] ''habitāre'', to inhabit, from ''habēre'', to have or to hold. Habitat can be defined as the natural environment of an [[organism]], the type of place in which it is natural for it to live and grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/habitat |title=Habitat |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]|title=Habitat |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habitat|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in meaning to a [[biotope]]; an area of uniform environmental conditions associated with a particular community of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biotope |title=Biotope |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental factors==
The chief environmental factors affecting the distribution of living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and the presence or absence of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia; Volume 4 |year=1967 |publisher=J.M. Dent |asin=B0015GRC04 |page=581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plants and animals are generalists, and their habitat requirements are met in a wide range of locations. The [[Pieris rapae|small white butterfly]] (''Pieris rapae'') for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of ''[[Brassica]]s'' and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations.&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite journal |last=Richards |first=O.W. |title=The biology of the small white butterfly (''Pieris rapae''), with special reference to the factors controlling its abundance|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|year=1940 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=243–288 |doi=10.2307/1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on ''[[Thymus (plant)|Thymus]]'' species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which ''[[Myrmica]]'' ants live.&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spitzer|first=L.|author2=Benes, J.|author3=Dandova, J.|author4=Jaskova, V. |author5= Konvicka, M.|title=The Large Blue butterfly ("Phengaris [Maculinea] arion"), as a conservation umbrella on a landscape scale: The case of the Czech Carpathians|journal=Ecological Indicators |year=2009 |volume=9 |pages=1056–1063 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2008.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disturbance is important in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. [[Wildflower]] meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either [[Annual plant|annuals]] or [[Biennial plant|biennials]] and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow.&lt;ref name=Sutherland&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sutherland, William J. |author2=Hill, David A. |title=Managing Habitats for Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcRZodbd9oQC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44776-8 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] move in to fill the gaps created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Huggett|title=Fundamentals of Biogeography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZR68HCMmPjoC&amp;pg=PA146 |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-32347-5 |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for [[Colonisation (biology)|colonisation.]] Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an [[Invasive species|invasive introduced species]] which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species.aspx |title=Invasive species |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Epiphytes (Dominica).jpg|thumb|left|Rich rainforest habitat in Dominica]]
Terrestrial habitat types include forests, grasslands, wetlands and deserts. Within these broad [[biome]]s are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes and vegetation types. Many of these habitats grade into each other and each one has its own typical communities of plants and animals. A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.&lt;ref name=Breed&gt;{{cite book|author1=Breed, Michael D.|author2=Moore, Janice|title=Animal Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGe6UzHNcp8C&amp;pg=PT248 |year=2011|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-091992-8 |page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Danau Sentarum 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Wetland habitats in Borneo]]
Freshwater habitats include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, marshes and bogs.&lt;ref name=BBCNature&gt;{{cite news |title=Habitats |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/habitats |newspaper=BBC Nature |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some organisms are found across most of these habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, [[bayou]]s and [[Backwater (river)|backwaters]] which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, [[aquatic plant]]s can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide oxygenation of the water, absorb nutrients and play a part in the reduction of pollution.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cook, C.D.K.|author2=Gut, B.J.|author3=Rix, E.M.|author4=Schneller, J.|title=Water Plants of the World: A Manual for the Identification of the Genera of Freshwater Macrophytes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRFTK3T4WTUC&amp;pg=PR7 |year=1974 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-90-6193-024-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine habitats include brackish water, estuaries, bays, the open sea, the intertidal zone, the sea bed, reefs and deep / shallow water zones.&lt;ref name=BBCNature/&gt; Further variations include [[Tide pool|rock pools]], [[Shoal|sand banks]], [[mudflat]]s, [[Brackish water|brackish]] lagoons, sandy and pebbly beaches, and [[seagrass]] beds, all supporting their own flora and fauna. The [[benthic zone]] or seabed provides a home for both static organisms, anchored to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], and for a large range of organisms crawling on or burrowing into the surface. Some creatures float among the waves on the surface of the water, or raft on floating debris, others swim at a range of depths, including organisms in the [[demersal zone]] close to the seabed, and myriads of organisms drift with the currents and form the [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=Roff&gt;{{cite book|author=Roff, John|title=Marine Conservation Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSLGGARRtfYC&amp;pg=PA105 |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-53838-4 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marsa Alam R18.jpg|thumb|left|Desert scene in Egypt]]
A [[desert]] is not the kind of habitat that favours the presence of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. [[Couch's spadefoot toad]] (''Scaphiopus couchii'') emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo [[metamorphosis]], and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_spadefoot.php |title=Couch’s spadefoot (''Scaphiopus couchi'') |publisher=Arizona–Sonora Desert Museum |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organisms cope with the drying up of their aqueous habitat in other ways. [[Vernal pool]]s are ephemeral ponds that form in the rainy season and dry up afterwards. They have their specially-adapted characteristic flora, mainly consisting of annuals, the seeds of which survive the drought, but also some uniquely adapted perennials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems |author=Witham, Carol W. |year=1998 |publisher=California Native Plant Society |isbn=978-0-943460-37-6 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals adapted to these extreme habitats also exist; [[Anostraca|fairy shrimps]] can lay "winter eggs" which are resistant to [[desiccation]], sometimes being blown about with the dust, ending up in new depressions in the ground. These can survive in a dormant state for as long as fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernalpool.org/inf_fs.htm |title=Fairy shrimp |author=Green, Scott |publisher=The Vernal Pool Association |accessdate=17 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423074123/http://www.vernalpool.org/inf_fs.htm |archivedate=23 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[killifish]] behave in a similar way; their eggs hatch and the juvenile fish grow with great rapidity when the conditions are right, but the whole population of fish may end up as eggs in [[diapause]] in the dried up mud that was once a pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The most extreme fish on Earth |author=Walker, Matt |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150519-the-most-extreme-fish-on-earth |newspaper=BBC Earth |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals and plants have taken up residence in urban environments. They tend to be adaptable generalists and use the town's features to make their homes. [[Rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] have followed man around the globe, [[pigeon]]s, [[Peregrine falcon|peregrines]], [[sparrow]]s, [[swallow]]s and [[house martin]]s use the buildings for nesting, [[bat]]s use roof space for roosting, [[fox]]es visit the garbage bins and [[squirrel]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[raccoon]]s and [[skunk]]s roam the streets. About 2,000 coyotes are thought to live in and around [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Read, Nicholas |title=City Critters: Wildlife in the Urban Jungle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED0O1Gj0froC |year=2012 |publisher=Orca Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-55469-394-8 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of dwelling houses in northern European cities in the twentieth century found about 175 species of invertebrate inside them, including 53 species of beetle, 21 flies, 13 butterflies and moths, 13 mites, 9 lice, 7 bees, 5 wasps, 5 cockroaches, 5 spiders, 4 ants and a number of other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John G.

==Microhabitats==
A microhabitat is the small-scale physical requirements of a particular organism or population. Every habitat includes large numbers of microhabitats with subtly different exposure to light, humidity, temperature, air movement, and other factors. The [[lichen]]s that grow on the north face of a boulder are different to those that grow on the south face, from those on the level top and those that grow on the ground nearby; the lichens growing in the grooves and on the raised surfaces are different from those growing on the veins of quartz. Lurking among these miniature "forests" are the [[microfauna]], each species of [[invertebrate]] with its own specific habitat requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/ecology-habitats-micro.html |title=Microhabitats |accessdate=18 May 2016 |publisher=Government of the Commonwealth of Australia|work=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research (An Australian Government Initiative)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss.&lt;ref name=Offwell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/woodland_manage/woodbio3.htm |title=Woodlands &amp; Biodiversity  |publisher=Offwell Woodland &amp; Wildlife Trust |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the structural diversity in the wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, and a range of features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain it has been estimated that various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.&lt;ref name=Offwell/&gt;

For a parasitic organism, its habitat is the particular part of the outside or inside of its [[Host (biology)|host]] on or in which it is adapted to live. The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, E.E.|author2=Campbell, J.F.|author3=Sukhdeo, M.V.K.|title=The Behavioural Ecology of Parasites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKSyEsRTk5kC&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2002 |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-0-85199-754-4 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) ''[[Microphallus turgidus]]'', present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a [[Gastropoda|snail]] and the second, a [[Palaemonetes pugio|glass shrimp]]. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pung, Oscar J. |author2=Burger, Ashley R. |author3=Walker, Michael F. |author4=Barfield, Whitney L. |author5=Lancaster, Micah H. |author6=Jarrous,  Christina E. |year=2009 |title=In vitro cultivation of ''Microphallus turgidus'' (Trematoda: Microphallidae) from metacercaria to ovigerous adult with continuation of the life cycle in the laboratory |journal=Journal of Parasitology |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=913–919 |jstor=27735680 |doi=10.1645/ge-1970.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme habitats==
{{main|Extremophile}}
[[File:Cryptoendolith.jpg|thumb|right|An Antarctic rock split apart to show an endolithic lifeform showing as a green layer a few millimetres thick]]
Although the vast majority of life on Earth lives in [[Mesophile|mesophyllic]] (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them [[Microorganism|microbes]], have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are [[bacteria]], for example, living in [[Lake Whillans]], half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gorman |first=James |title=Bacteria Found Deep Under Antarctic Ice, Scientists Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html |date=6 February 2013 |work=New York Times |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the [[Mariana Trench]], the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; [[marine snow]] drifts down from the surface layers of the sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other microbes live in habitats lacking in oxygen, and are dependent on chemical reactions other than photosynthesis. Boreholes drilled {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} into the rocky seabed have found microbial communities apparently based on the products of reactions between water and the constituents of rocks.

The [[intertidal zone]] and the [[photic zone]] in the oceans are relatively familiar habitats. However the vast bulk of the ocean is unhospitable to air-breathing humans, with [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]] limited to the upper {{convert|50|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} or so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cole |first=Bob |title=The SAA BUhlmann DeeP-Stop System Handbook |date=March 2008 |publisher=Sub-Aqua Association |isbn=978-0-9532904-8-2 |pages=vi–1 |chapter=Appendix 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower limit for photosynthesis is {{convert|100|to|200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and below that depth the prevailing conditions include total darkness, high pressure, little oxygen (in some places), scarce food resources and extreme cold. This habitat is very challenging to research, and as well as being little studied, it is vast, with 79% of the Earth's [[biosphere]] being at depths greater than {{convert|1000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=DeepSea&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/deep/ |title=The Deep Sea |date=29 December 2011 |publisher=MarineBio Conservation Society |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no plant life, the animals in this zone are either [[detritivore]]s, reliant on food drifting down from surface layers, or they are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on each other. Some organisms are [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]], swimming or drifting in mid-ocean, while others are benthic, living on or near the seabed. Their growth rates and metabolisms tend to be slow, their eyes may be very large to detect what little illumination there is, or they may be blind and rely on other sensory inputs. A number of deep sea creatures are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]]; this serves a variety of functions including predation, protection and social recognition.&lt;ref name=DeepSea/&gt; In general, the bodies of animals living at great depths are adapted to high pressure environments by having pressure-resistant biomolecules and small organic molecules present in their cells known as [[piezolyte]]s, which give the proteins the flexibility they need. There are also unsaturated fats in their membranes which prevent them from solidifying at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean |title=What does it take to live at the bottom of the ocean?|year=2016 |publisher=BBC Earth |accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrothermal vent]]s were first discovered in the ocean depths in 1977.&lt;ref name=Vent/&gt; They result from seawater becoming heated after seeping through cracks to places where hot [[magma]] is close to the seabed. The under-water hot springs may gush forth at temperatures of over {{convert|340|°C|°F|-1}} and support unique communities of organisms in their immediate vicinity.&lt;ref name=Vent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/vents.html |title=A hydrothermal vent forms when seawater meets hot magma |date=11 January 2013 |work=Ocean facts |publisher=National Ocean Service |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for this teeming life is [[chemosynthesis]], a process by which microbes convert such substances as [[hydrogen sulfide]] or [[ammonia]] into organic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-videos/hydrothermal-vent-creatures |title=Hydrothermal Vent Creatures |work=Ocean Portal |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History |accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria and [[Archaea]] are the primary producers in these ecosystems and support a diverse array of life. About 350 species of organism, dominated by [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[crustacean]]s, had been discovered around hydrothermal vents by the end of the twentieth century, most of them being new to science and [[Endemism|endemic]] to these habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Desbruyères, Daniel |author2=Segonzac, Michel|title=Handbook of Deep-sea Hydrothermal Vent Fauna |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZbLHpstfrwC&amp;pg=PA9 |year=1997 |publisher=Editions Quae |isbn=978-2-905434-78-4| page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides providing locomotion opportunities for winged animals and a conduit for the dispersal of [[pollen]] grains, [[spore]]s and [[seed]]s, the [[atmosphere]] can be considered to be a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, with hundreds of thousands of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. [[Aerobiology]] has been little studied, but there is evidence of [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen fixation]] in [[cloud]]s, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Womack, Ann M. |author2=Bohannan, Brendan J.M. |author3=Green, Jessica L. |year=2010 |title=Biodiversity and biogeography of the atmosphere |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=365 | issue = 1558  |pages=3645–3653 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0283 |pmc=2982008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat change==
{{see also|Habitat conservation}}
[[File:Mt st helens Johnston ridge 25 years later.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty five years after the devastating eruption at [[Mount St. Helens]], United States, [[pioneer species]] have moved in.]]
Whether from natural processes or the activities of man, landscapes and their associated habitats change over time. There are the slow [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] changes associated with the geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and the more rapid changes associated with earthquakes, landslides, storms, flooding, wildfires, coastal erosion, deforestation and changes in land use.&lt;ref name=Lindenmayer&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lindenmayer, David B. |author2=Fischer, Joern |title=Habitat Fragmentation and Landscape Change: An Ecological and Conservation Synthesis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpMKTIoJixMC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2013 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-59726-606-2|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then there are the changes in habitats brought on by alterations in farming practices, tourism, pollution, [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and climate change.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, G. Tyler |author2=Spoolman, Scott |title=Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gC9Dy1YWfkC&amp;pg=PA193 |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-0-495-55671-8 |pages=193–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to any species. If an island on which an endemic organism lives becomes uninhabitable for some reason, the species will become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Any type of habitat surrounded by a different habitat is in a similar situation to an island. If a forest is divided into parts by logging, with strips of cleared land separating woodland blocks, and the distances between the remaining fragments exceeds the distance an individual animal is able to travel, that species becomes especially vulnerable. Small populations generally lack genetic diversity and may be threatened by increased predation, increased competition, disease and unexpected catastrophe.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; At the edge of each forest fragment, increased light encourages secondary growth of fast-growing species and old growth trees are more vulnerable to logging as access is improved. The birds that nest in their crevices, the [[epiphyte]]s that hang from their branches and the invertebrates in the leaf litter are all adversely affected and biodiversity is reduced.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Habitat fragmentation can be ameliorated to some extent by the provision of [[wildlife corridor]]s connecting the fragments. These can be a river, ditch, strip of trees, hedgerow or even an underpass to a highway. Without the corridors, seeds cannot disperse and animals, especially small ones, cannot travel through the hostile territory, putting populations at greater risk of [[local extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holland, Matthew D. |author2=Hastings, Alan |year=2008 |title=Strong effect of dispersal network structure on ecological dynamics |journal=Nature |volume=456 |pages=792–794 |doi=10.1038/nature07395 |bibcode=2008Natur.456..792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat disturbance can have long-lasting effects on the environment. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'' is a vigorous grass from Europe which has been introduced to the United States where it has become invasive. It is highly adapted to fire, producing large amounts of flammable detritus and increasing the frequency and intensity of wildfires. In areas where it has become established, it has altered the local fire regimen to such an extant that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing it to become even more dominant.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marine example is when [[sea urchin]] populations "[[Population ecology|explode]]" in coastal waters and destroy all the [[Seaweed|macroalgae]] present. What was previously a [[kelp forest]] becomes an [[urchin barren]] that may last for years and this can have a profound effect on the [[food chain]]. Removal of the sea urchins, by disease for example, can result in the seaweed returning, with an over-abundance of fast-growing kelp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence, John M. |title=Sea Urchins: Biology and Ecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B322HrCUvNEC&amp;pg=PA196 |year=2013|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-397213-2 |pages=196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat protection==
The protection of habitats is a necessary step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may take the form of the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the protection of habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.&lt;ref name=Klemm&gt;{{cite book|author=de Klemm, Cyrille |title=Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Legislation for the Protection of Wild Flora in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oadPwh_8wqMC&amp;pg=PA65 |year=1997 |publisher=Council of Europe |isbn=978-92-871-3429-5 |pages=65–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International treaties may be necessary for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the [[Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]], protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection in more than one country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.int/ |title=Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals |publisher=UNEP/CMS Secretariat |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the protection of habitats needs to take into account the needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the [[San Quintin kangaroo rat]], and even kill the animal as a pest.&lt;ref name=endangered&gt;{{cite book|title=Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YYqd4ROFfkC&amp;pg=PA750 |year=2001 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7200-1 |page=750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of [[ecotourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Honey | first = Martha | year = 2008 | title = Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise? | publisher = Island Press | isbn =  1-59726-125-4 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monotypic habitat==
A monotypic habitat is one in which a single species of animal or plant is so dominant as to virtually exclude all other species. An example would be sugarcane; this is planted, burnt and harvested, with herbicides killing weeds and pesticides controlling invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rio Guanajibo River Basin Flood Protection Project, Mayaguez, Hormigueros, San German: Environmental Impact Statement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jk0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA94-IA29 |year=1994 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotypic habitat occurs in botanical and zoological contexts, and is a component of [[conservation biology]]. In [[restoration ecology]] of native plant communities or habitats, some [[invasive species]] create monotypic stands that replace and/or prevent other species, especially indigenous ones, from growing there. A dominant [[Colonisation (biology)|colonization]] can occur from retardant chemicals exuded, nutrient monopolization, or from lack of natural controls such as [[herbivore]]s or climate, that keep them in balance with their native habitats. The [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle, ''Centaurea solstitialis'']], is a botanical monotypic-habitat example of this, currently dominating over {{convert|15000000|acre|km2}} in California alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/images/none/nc4.JPG |title=1970 distribution of yellow starthistle in the U.S. |publisher=[[University of California, Davis|UCD]] |work=Yellow Starthistle Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231024708/http://wric.ucdavis.edu/yst/images/none/nc4.JPG |archivedate=2006-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-native freshwater [[Zebra mussel|zebra mussel, ''Dreissena polymorpha'']], that colonizes areas of the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Mississippi River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]], is a zoological monotypic-habitat example; the predators that control it in its home-range in Russia are absent and it proliferates abundantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Invasive-Species/Invasive-Mussels.aspx |title=Invasive Mussels |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though its name may seem to imply simplicity as compared with [[Wiktionary:polytypic|polytypic]] habitats, the monotypic habitat can be complex. Aquatic habitats, such as exotic ''[[Hydrilla]]'' beds, support a similarly rich fauna of macroinvertebrates to a more varied habitat, but the creatures present may differ between the two, affecting small fish and other animals higher up the [[food chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Theel, Heather J. |author2=Dibble, Eric D. |author3=Madsen, John D. |year=2008 |title=Differential influence of a monotypic and diverse native aquatic plant bed on a macroinvertebrate assemblage; an experimental implication of exotic plant induced habitat |journal=Hydrobiologia |volume=600 |pages=77–87 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9177-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Launch Complex 39 Press Site''' is a [[news media]] facility at [[Launch Complex 39]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center|John F. Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) on [[Merritt Island, Florida]] where journalists have observed every U.S. manned space launch since [[Apollo 8]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;All preceding manned flights, including [[Apollo 7]], launched from pads at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;/ref&gt; The site is just south of the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB); 3 miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) west-southwest of Pad A, and 3.4 miles (5.4&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of Pad B.[[Image:STS-121 Launch cropped.jpg|thumb|210px|left|The [[STS-121]] launch seen from the LC-39 Press Site in July 2006]]

The site includes an elevated mound where news media facilities are located, as well as the KSC News Center and several smaller support buildings. The News Center is {{convert|8700|sqft|m2}} and contains 15 site support offices, media workspace, and a media library.&lt;ref name="NASAFacts"&gt;{{Citation| last =National Aeronautics and Space Administration| first =| author-link =| title =The Press Site at KSC| journal =NASA Facts| volume =| issue =| pages =4| date =March 2006| year =| url =http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/PressSite06.pdf| doi =| id =FS-2006-03-009-KSC| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100527213050/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/PressSite06.pdf| archivedate =2010-05-27| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current media buildings include [[CBS]], [[NBC]], ''[[Florida Today]]'' and ''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]''; and trailers for [[The Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]].

The 100-seat auditorium in the audio-video support building, where pre- and post-launch news conferences are held, is named for former [[CNN]] correspondent [[John Holliman]], who covered space exploration until his death in 1998. It was built in 1980.

A large illuminated digital [[countdown]] '''clock and a flagpole''' flying an [[American flag]] on the edge of the [[turning basin]] have often been included in television coverage and launch photos. Before a launch, the clock counts down, showing the remaining time until T-zero in hours, minutes and seconds (&amp;ndash;00:00:00). After launch, the clock counts forward in [[Mission Elapsed Time]] for several hours. The flagpole also flew a smaller [[Space Shuttle Orbiter]]-specific flag below the American flag on launch day during the final years of the [[Space Shuttle Program]].

==History==

The site was ready for coverage of the first launch from KSC, the unmanned [[Apollo 4]] flight on November 9, 1967, for which NASA received 510 requests for news media accreditation.&lt;ref name="KSCStory"&gt;{{Cite web|last= |first= |title=Kennedy Space Center Story|year=1991|url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/story/ch18.html| accessdate = 21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of this first [[Saturn V]] liftoff was sufficiently powerful at the Press Site to prompt CBS-TV anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] to exclaim, "Our building's shaking here...the floor is shaking...this big glass window is shaking, we're holding it with our hands!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video  | people = CBS-TV  | title = Apollo 4 Launch Saturn V Rocket     | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeHXtyf8tA&amp;feature=player_embedded  | medium = audio clip  | publisher = YouTube |location = San Bruno, California| date = 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceiling tile or two were shaken loose above his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Woods |first = W. David |uthorlink = |coauthors = | title = How Apollo Flew to the Moon | publisher = Springer Praxis Books |year = 2008 |location = Berlin |page = 68 |url = |doi =   | isbn = 978-0-387-71675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:LC-39 Press Site.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the Press Site in May 1969 looking north with the VAB at upper right]][[Image:LC-39 Grandstand - Apollo 12.jpg|thumb|right|The grandstand before the [[Apollo 12]] launch in November 1969]]

During the [[Apollo program]], the NASA news center was located in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida|Cocoa Beach]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles D.|last1=Benson|first2=William Barnaby|last2=Faherty|title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations|publisher=Scientific and Technical Information Office, National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=1978|isbn= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To provide on-site public affairs offices, a [[Charter-Sphere dome]] from the Third Century America exhibition near the VAB during the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976 was later moved to the mound.  In 1983, it was replaced by a larger dome; and a permanent building, the current KSC News Center, replaced that dome in December 1995.&lt;ref name="NASAFacts" /&gt;

During the first decade of [[Space Shuttle]] launches, NASA [[Aerospace manufacturer|contractors]] provided reference materials to the media from the Joint Industry Press Center (JIPC, pronounced "gypsy"), housed in a semi-permanent trailer located near a large covered [[grandstand]] facing the two launch pads.

The grandstand, built in 1967, was torn down following damage from [[Hurricane Frances]] in September 2004. Several media trailers and buildings on the mound were also damaged, and were either removed or replaced with prefabricated structures.&lt;ref name="NASAFacts" /&gt;

On November 10, 2014, NASA powered on the clock for the last time for a final system test. The clock will be removed and replaced before the Orion EFT-1 Launch. The old clock is currently on display at the KSC Visitor Center.

==Media attendance==
[[File:Apollo 11 launch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Composite photo of Apollo 11 launch and the Press Site flag]]On July 16, 1969, 3,493 journalists from the U.S. and 55 other countries attended the launch of [[Apollo 11]].&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' July 25, 1969, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; A plaque noting the event placed in 1975 by [[Sigma Delta Chi]], the Society of Professional Journalists, designates the location as an Historic Site in Journalism for "the largest corps of newsmen in history...to report fully and freely to the largest audience in history". After Apollo 11, however, media attendance diminished. [[Apollo 17]], the last in the lunar landing program and its only night launch, prompted a resurgence in attendance, as did the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] launch in 1975.&lt;ref name="KSCStory" /&gt;

The [[STS-1]] launch on April 12, 1981 had 2,707 accredited representatives present.&lt;ref name="KSCStory" /&gt; The second-largest number, 2,468, was for the [[STS-26]] launch on September 29, 1988. Most, however, covered the launch from a more distant causeway viewing site because the LC-39 Press Site was restricted to a limited number of journalists as part of safety precautions implemented after the 1986 [[Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' explosion]]. The restriction was dropped for subsequent launches. Media attendance spiked again in October 1998 for [[John Glenn]]'s launch aboard [[STS-95]], and for the final shuttle launch, [[STS-135]], on July 8, 2011 when 1,585 news people attended.

==Historic status==
On July 16, 1974, a crowd gathered at the Press Site to dedicate the entire launch complex as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]], which had been listed as of May 24, 1973. The countdown clock was set to reach zero at 9:32 a.m. ET, exactly five years after the Apollo 11 liftoff. Astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] then unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On [[John F. Kennedy Space Center MPS|January 21, 2000]], the "LC-39 Press Site&amp;ndash;Clock and Flag Pole" were specifically added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of a Multiple Property Submission.

This is a '''list of [[Podicipediformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Podicipediformes have had their numbers quantified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13896">[[Tandy Corporation]] released several computer product lines starting in 1977, under both ''TRS-80'' and ''Tandy'' branding.

''TRS-80'' was a brand associated with several desktop [[microcomputer]] lines sold by Tandy Corporation through their [[Radio Shack]] stores. It was first used on [[TRS-80|the original TRS-80]] (later known as the ''Model I''), one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers.&lt;ref name="Mooallem"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/ff_radioshack/all/ |title=The Lost Tribes of RadioShack: Tinkerers Search for New Spiritual Home |author-last=Mooallem |author-first=Jon |date=2010-04-19 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |access-date=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tandy later used the ''TRS-80'' name on a number of different computer lines, many of which were technically unrelated to (and incompatible with) the original Model I and its replacements.

In addition to these, Tandy released a number of computers using the ''Tandy'' name itself.

==Original TRS-80 ("Model I") and its successors==
===Model I===
{{main|TRS-80}}
The original '''TRS-80 Micro Computer System''' (later known as the '''Model I''' to distinguish it from successors) was launched in 1977 and- alongside the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore Pet]]- was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers.&lt;ref name="Mooallem"/&gt; The line won popularity with hobbyists, home users, and small-businesses.

The Model I included a full-stroke [[QWERTY]] keyboard, floating-point [[BASIC]], a monitor, and a starting price of US$600.&lt;ref name="forster-17"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Forster |author-first=Winnie |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972–2005 |date=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market.&lt;ref name="welch2007"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Welch |author-first=David and Theresa |title=Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution |date=2007 |publisher=The Seeker Books |location=Ferndale, Michigan |isbn=978-0-9793468-0-4 |url=http://www.microcomputerpioneers.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1980 the mostly-compatible [[TRS-80 Model III]] was launched, and the original Model I was discontinued.&lt;ref name="hogan19810831"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA44 |title=A Look at Radio Shack's Five Computers |access-date=2011-02-28 |author-last=Hogan |author-first=Thom |date=1981-08-31 |work=[[InfoWorld]] |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoganm319810831"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA35 |title=The Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III Computer |access-date=2011-02-28 |author-last=Hogan |author-first=Thom |date=1981-08-31 |work=[[InfoWorld]] |pages=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robertson198012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1980-12/80Microcomputing_1280#page/n49/mode/2up |title=Model I Caught By FCC Fallout |access-date=2011-03-21 |author-last=Robertson |author-first=Nancy |date=December 1980 |work=[[80 Micro]]computing |pages=51, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model III===
{{main|TRS-80 Model III}}
[[File:TRS-80 Model 3 01.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model III]]
In July 1980 Tandy released the Model III, a mostly-compatible replacement for the Model I.

Its improvements over the Model I included built-in lower case, a better keyboard, elimination of the cable spaghetti, 1500-baud cassette interface, and a faster (2.03&amp;nbsp;MHz) Z-80 processor. With the introduction of the Model III, Model I production was discontinued as it did not comply with new [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations as of January 1, 1981 regarding [[electromagnetic interference]].{{r|hogan19810831}}{{r|hoganm319810831}}&lt;ref name="robertson198012"/&gt;

The Model III could run about 80% of Model I software, but used an incompatible disk format.{{r|hogan19810831}} It also came with the option of integrated disk drives.

===Model 4===
{{anchor|model4}}
{{main|TRS-80 Model 4}}
[[File:TRS-80 Model 4 (modified).jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4 (standard version)]]
[[File:TRS-80 Model 4P Crop Delsener.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model 4P]]

The successor to the Model III was the Model 4, which included the capability to run [[CP/M]], and had a faster Z80A 4&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/trs-80-computer-line/model-4/ |title=TRS-80 Computers: TRS-80 Model 4 |publisher=Trs-80.com |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completely compatible with Model III software. Prices started from $999 for the diskless version.

Early versions of the Model 4 mainboard were designed to accept a [[Zilog Z800]] 16 bit CPU upgrade board to replace the Z80 8 bit CPU but this option was never released.

==Business systems==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}

===Tandy 10===
{{anchor|tandy10}}
{{Main|Tandy 10 Business Computer System}}
Tandy's first design for the business market was a desk-based computer known as the Tandy 10 Business Computer System, which was released in 1978 but quickly discontinued.

===TRS-80 Model II and successors===

====Model II====
{{main|TRS-80 Model II}}
[[File:Okona-GfhR-TRS-80.jpg|thumb|TRS-80 Model II]]

In October 1979 Tandy began shipping the '''TRS-80 Model II''', which was targeted to the small-business market. It was not an upgrade of the Model I, but an entirely different system with state-of-the-art hardware and numerous features not found in the primitive Model I. The Model II was not compatible with the Model I and never had the same breadth of available software. This was somewhat mitigated by the availability of the [[CP/M]] from third parties.

====Model 12====

The Model II was replaced in 1982 by the ''TRS-80 Model 12''. This was essentially a Model 16B (described [[#Model 16, Model 16B, and Tandy 6000|below]]) without the Motorola processor, and could be upgraded to a Model 16B.

====Model 16, Model 16B, and Tandy 6000====

In February 1982, Tandy released the '''TRS-80 Model 16''',{{r|chin19830207}} as the follow-on to the Model II; an upgrade kit was available for Model II systems. The Model 16 adds a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz, 16-bit [[Motorola 68000]] processor and memory card.

The Model 16 sold poorly at first and was reliant on existing Model II software early on.&lt;ref name="vose198209"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/80-microcomputing-magazine-1982-09/80Microcomputing_0982#page/n299/mode/2up |title=DOS woes erode Tandy's lead |work=80 Micro |date=September 1982 |access-date=2015-02-11 |author-last=Vose |author-first=G. Michael |pages=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1983 Tandy switched from TRSDOS-16 to [[Xenix]].&lt;ref name="chin19830207"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_y8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA3 |title=Radio Shack goes to Microsoft's XENIX for Model 16 micros |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-02-07 |access-date=2015-01-31 |author-last=Chin |author-first=Kathy |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model 16 evolved into the '''Model 16B''' with 256 KB in July 1983,&lt;ref name="mace19830725"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4 |title=Tandy introduces the Model 16B computer |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-07-25 |access-date=2015-02-11 |author-last=Mace |author-first=Scott |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the '''Tandy 6000''', gaining an internal hard drive along the way and switching to an 8&amp;nbsp;MHz 68000. 
The 16B was the most popular Unix computer in 1984, with almost 40,000 units sold.&lt;ref name="bartimo19850311"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5C4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28 |title=Tandy Revamps Product Line |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1985-03-11 |access-date=2015-01-21 |author-last=Bartimo |author-first=Jim |pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other systems==
===Color Computers===
{{Main|TRS-80 Color Computer}}
Tandy also produced the ''TRS-80 Color Computer'' (CoCo), based on the [[Motorola 6809]] processor. This machine was clearly aimed at the home market, where the Model II and above were sold as business machines. It competed directly with the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple II]], and [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. [[OS-9]], a multitasking, multi-user operating system was supplied for this machine.

===Model 100 line===
{{Main|TRS-80 Model 100}}
In addition to the above, Tandy produced the ''TRS-80 Model 100'' series of laptop computers. This series comprised the TRS-80 Model 100, Tandy 102, Tandy 200 and Tandy 600. The Model 100 was designed by the Japanese company [[Kyocera]] with software written by Microsoft. (The Model 100 firmware was the last [[Microsoft]] product to which [[Bill Gates]] was a major code contributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |author-last=Gates |author-first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Gates |interviewer=David Allison |title=Bill Gates Interview |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm#tc35 |publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution |access-date=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  It was also marketed as the Micro Executive Workstation (MEWS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-TRS-80-model-100-computer/dp/0835978591 book about the Model 100]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model 100 had an internal 300 baud modem, built-in BASIC, and a limited text editor. It was possible to use the Model 100 with most phones in the world with the use of an optional [[acoustic coupler]] that fit over a standard telephone handset. The combination of the acoustic coupler, the machine's outstanding battery life (it could be used for days on a set of 4 AA cells), and its simple text editor made the Model 100/102 popular with journalists in the early 1980s. The Model 100 line also had an optional bar code reader, serial/RS-232 floppy drive and a Cassette interface.

Also available as an option to the Model 100 was an external expansion unit supporting video and a 5{{frac|1|4}}" disk drive, connected via the 40-pin expansion port in the bottom of the unit.

===={{anchor|tandy200}}Tandy 200====
The ''Tandy 200'' was introduced in 1984 as a higher-end complement to the Model 100. The Tandy 200 had 24 KB RAM expandable to 72 KB, a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display, and a spreadsheet (Multiplan) included. The Tandy 200 also included DTMF tone-dialing for the internal modem. Although less popular than the Model 100, the Tandy 200 was also particularly popular with journalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

=====Reception=====
''[[InfoWorld]]'' in 1985 disapproved of the computer's high cost of accessories ("and you'll find that the Tandy 200 has more accessories than a [[Barbie doll]]"), but called it "a big step up from the Model 100 for someone who needs a note-taker or spreadsheet on the run".&lt;ref name="robinson19850513"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2y4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA46 |title=Making a Good Thing Better |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1985-05-13 |access-date=2015-02-01 |author-last=Robinson |author-first=Dan |pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MC-10===
{{main|TRS-80 MC-10}}
The [[TRS-80 MC-10|MC-10]] was a short-lived and little-known Tandy computer, similar in appearance to the [[Sinclair ZX81]].

It was a small system based on the [[Motorola 6800|Motorola 6803]] processor and featured 4 [[Kilobyte|KB]] of RAM. A 16 KB RAM expansion pack that connected on the back of the unit was offered as an option as was a thermal paper printer. A modified version of the MC-10 was sold in France as the [[Matra Alice]].

Programs loaded using a cassette which worked much better than those for the Sinclair.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} A magazine was published which offered programs for both the CoCo and MC-10 but very few programs were available for purchase. Programs for the MC-10 were not compatible with the CoCo.
[[File:TRS-80 PC-2 Cleaned.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A TRS-80 Pocket Computer (Model: PC-2) ready for use]]

===Pocket Computers===
{{main|Tandy Pocket Computer}}
Both the TRS-80 and Tandy brands were used for a range of "Pocket Computers" sold by Tandy. These were manufactured by Sharp or Casio, depending on the model.

===PC-compatible computers===
{{see also|Tandy 1000|Tandy 2000}}
In the early 1980s, Tandy began producing a line of computers that were "[[DOS compatible]]": able to run [[MS-DOS]] and certain applications, but not fully compatible with every nuance of the original [[IBM PC]] systems. The first of these was the ''[[Tandy 2000]]'', followed later by the less expensive ''[[Tandy 1000]]''. As margins decreased in PC clones, Tandy was unable to compete and stopped manufacturing their own systems, instead selling computers manufactured by a variety of companies, [[AST Research]] and [[Gateway 2000]] among them.

Originally, Tandy offered computers manufactured by Tandon Corporation, and then started producing their own line of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The Tandy 2000 system was similar to the Texas Instruments Professional Computer in that it offered better graphics, a faster processor (80186) and higher capacity disk drives (80 track double sided 800k 5.25 drives) than the original IBM PC.

However, around the time of its introduction, the industry began moving away from MS-DOS compatible computers and towards fully IBM PC compatible clones; later Tandy offerings moved toward full PC hardware compatibility.

The later Tandy 1000 systems and follow-ons were also marketed by [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], as Tandy and DEC had a joint manufacturing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D8163BF93BA35751C0A964958260 |title=COMPANY NEWS; Digital Sets Plan to Build Its Own PC's |journal=New York Times |date=1982-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiometry===

{{Main article|Radiometry}}

[[File:Flux and solid angle.svg|right|275px|''275px''|thumb|Visulization of flux through differential area and solid angle. As always &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{n}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the unit normal to the incidant surface A, &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{\hat{n}}\mathrm{d}A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of incident flux on the area element, ''θ'' is the angle between them. The factor &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \mathrm{d}A = \mathbf{\hat{e}}_{\angle} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A} = \cos \theta \mathrm{d}A \,\!&lt;/math&gt; arises when the flux is not normal to the surface element, so the area normal to the flux is reduced.]]

For spectral quantities two definitions are in use to refer to the same quantity, in terms of frequency or wavelength.

These ratios are sometimes also used, following simply from other definitions of refractive index, wave phase velocity, and the luminal speed equation:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{v_2}{v_1} = \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_1 \mu_1}{\epsilon_2 \mu_2}} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In astrophysics, ''L'' is used for ''luminosity'' (energy per unit time, equivalent to ''power'') and ''F'' is used for ''energy flux'' (energy per unit time per unit area, equivalent to ''intensity'' in terms of area, not solid angle). They are not new quantities, simply different names.

[[File:CuttingABarMagnet.svg|thumb|200px|It is impossible to make '''magnetic monopoles''' from a [[bar magnet]]. If a bar magnet is cut in half, it is ''not'' the case that one half has the north pole and the other half has the south pole. Instead, each piece has its own north and south poles. A magnetic monopole cannot be created from normal matter such as [[atom]]s and [[electron]]s, but would instead be a new [[elementary particle]].]]

In [[particle physics]], a '''magnetic monopole''' is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]] that is an isolated [[magnet]] with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice versa).&lt;ref name=Hooper&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGBUvLpgmUMC&amp;pg=PA192|title=Dark Cosmos: In Search of Our Universe's Missing Mass and Energy|first=Dan|last=Hooper|date=October 6, 2009|publisher=Harper Collins|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2004/listings/s028.pdf|title=Particle Data Group summary of magnetic monopole search|author=|date=|website=lbl.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A magnetic monopole would have a net "magnetic charge". Modern interest in the concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably the [[grand unified theory|grand unified]] and [[superstring theory|superstring]] theories, which predict their existence.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, Xiao-Gang; Witten, Edward, ''Electric and magnetic charges in superstring models'', Nuclear Physics B, Volume 261, p. 651–677&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Coleman, ''The Magnetic Monopole 50 years Later'', reprinted in ''Aspects of Symmetry''&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetism in [[bar magnet]]s and [[electromagnet]]s is not caused by magnetic monopoles, and indeed, there is no known experimental or observational evidence that magnetic monopoles exist.

Some [[condensed matter]] systems contain effective (non-isolated) magnetic monopole [[quasiparticle|quasi-particles]],&lt;ref name=Castelnovo/&gt; or contain phenomena that are mathematically analogous to magnetic monopoles.&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ray |first1=M.

==Historical background==

===Pre-twentieth century===

Many early scientists attributed the magnetism of [[lodestone]]s to two different "magnetic fluids" ("effluvia"), a north-pole fluid at one end and a south-pole fluid at the other, which attracted and repelled each other in analogy to positive and negative [[electric charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1YEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA352|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=June 26, 2018|publisher=[Cambridge] University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rYXAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA424|title=Principles of Physics: Designed for Use as a Textbook of General Physics|first=William Francis|last=Magie|date=June 26, 2018|publisher=Century Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an improved understanding of [[electromagnetism]] in the nineteenth century showed that the magnetism of lodestones was properly explained not by magnetic monopole fluids, but rather by a combination of [[electric current]]s, the [[electron magnetic moment]], and the [[magnetic moment]]s of other particles. [[Gauss's law for magnetism]], one of [[Maxwell's equations]], is the mathematical statement that magnetic monopoles do not exist. Nevertheless, it was pointed out by [[Pierre Curie]] in 1894&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Curie]], ''Sur la possibilité d'existence de la conductibilité magnétique et du magnétisme libre'' (''On the possible existence of magnetic conductivity and free magnetism''), Séances de la Société Française de Physique (Paris), p76 (1894). {{fr}}[https://archive.org/stream/sancesdelasocit19physgoog Free access online copy].&lt;/ref&gt; that magnetic monopoles ''could'' conceivably exist, despite not having been seen so far.

===Twentieth century===

The [[quantum mechanics|''quantum'']] theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the [[physicist]] [[Paul A. M. Dirac]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dirac]], "Quantised Singularities in the Electromagnetic Field". Proc. Roy. Soc. (London) '''A 133''', 60 (1931). [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/133/821/60 Journal Site, Free Access] [http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/dirac1931.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Dirac showed that if ''any'' magnetic monopoles exist in the universe, then all electric charge in the universe must be [[charge quantization|quantized]] (Dirac quantization condition).&lt;ref name=littlejohn&gt;[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/0708/lectures/Lecture.2007.10.11.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], University of California, Berkeley, 2007–8&lt;/ref&gt; The electric charge ''is'', in fact, quantized, which is consistent with (but does not prove) the existence of monopoles.&lt;ref name=littlejohn/&gt;

Since Dirac's paper, several systematic monopole searches have been performed. Experiments in 1975&lt;ref name="PRL-35-487"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Price |first1=P. B. |last2=Shirk |first2=E. K. |last3=Osborne |first3=W. Z. |last4=Pinsky |first4=L.

Further advances in theoretical [[particle physics]], particularly developments in [[grand unified theories]] and [[quantum gravity]], have led to more compelling arguments (detailed below) that monopoles do exist. [[Joseph Polchinski]], a string-theorist, described the existence of monopoles as "one of the safest bets that one can make about physics not yet seen".&lt;ref name=Polchinski&gt;{{cite journal|title=Monopoles, Duality, and String Theory|first=Joseph|last=Polchinski|date=February 1, 2004|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=19|issue=supp01|pages=145–154|doi=10.1142/S0217751X0401866X|arxiv=hep-th/0304042|bibcode=2004IJMPA..19S.145P}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories are not necessarily inconsistent with the experimental evidence. In some theoretical [[Scientific modelling|model]]s, magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed, because they are too massive to create in [[particle accelerator]]s (see {{slink||Searches for magnetic monopoles}} below), and also too rare in the Universe to enter a [[particle detector]] with much probability.&lt;ref name=Polchinski/&gt;

Some [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter systems]] propose a structure superficially similar to a magnetic monopole, known as a [[flux tube]]. The ends of a flux tube form a [[magnetic dipole]], but since they move independently, they can be treated for many purposes as independent magnetic monopole [[quasiparticle]]s. Since 2009, numerous news reports from the popular media&lt;ref name=sciencedaily/&gt;&lt;ref name=symmetrymagazine/&gt; have incorrectly described these systems as the long-awaited discovery of the magnetic monopoles, but the two phenomena are only superficially related to one another.&lt;ref name=TchernyshyovQuote&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40302 Magnetic monopoles spotted in spin ices], September 3, 2009. "Oleg Tchernyshyov at Johns Hopkins University [a researcher in this field] cautions that the theory and experiments are specific to spin ices, and are not likely to shed light on magnetic monopoles as predicted by Dirac."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GibneyQuote&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |date=29 January 2014 |title=Quantum cloud simulates magnetic monopole |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14612}} "This is not the first time that physicists have created monopole analogues. In 2009, physicists observed magnetic monopoles in a crystalline material called spin ice, which, when cooled to near-absolute zero, seems to fill with atom-sized, classical monopoles. These are magnetic in a true sense, but cannot be studied individually. Similar analogues have also been seen in other materials, such as in superfluid helium.... Steven Bramwell, a physicist at University College London who pioneered work on monopoles in spin ices, says that the [2014 experiment led by David Hall] is impressive, but that what it observed is not a Dirac monopole in the way many people might understand it. "There’s a mathematical analogy here, a neat and beautiful one. But they’re not magnetic monopoles."&lt;/ref&gt; These condensed-matter systems remain an area of active research. (See {{slink||"Monopoles" in condensed-matter systems}} below.)

==Poles and magnetism in ordinary matter==
{{main|Magnetism}}
All matter ever isolated to date, including every atom on the [[periodic table]] and every particle in the [[standard model]], has zero magnetic monopole charge. Therefore, the ordinary phenomena of [[magnetism]] and [[magnet]]s have nothing to do with magnetic monopoles.

Instead, magnetism in ordinary matter comes from two sources. First, [[electric current]]s create [[magnetic field]]s according to [[Ampère's law]]. Second, many [[elementary particles]] have an ''intrinsic'' [[magnetic moment]], the most important of which is the [[electron magnetic dipole moment]]. (This magnetism is related to [[spin (physics)|quantum-mechanical "spin"]].)

Mathematically, the magnetic field of an object is often described in terms of a [[multipole expansion]]. This is an expression of the field as the sum of component fields with specific mathematical forms. The first term in the expansion is called the ''monopole'' term, the second is called ''dipole'', then ''[[quadrupole magnet|quadrupole]]'', then ''octupole'', and so on. Any of these terms can be present in the multipole expansion of an [[electric field]], for example. However, in the multipole expansion of a ''magnetic'' field, the "monopole" term is always exactly zero (for ordinary matter). A magnetic monopole, if it exists, would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose ''monopole'' term is non-zero.

A [[magnetic dipole]] is something whose magnetic field is predominantly or exactly described by the magnetic dipole term of the multipole expansion. The term ''dipole'' means ''two poles'', corresponding to the fact that a dipole magnet typically contains a ''north pole'' on one side and a ''south pole'' on the other side. This is analogous to an [[electric dipole]], which has positive charge on one side and negative charge on the other. However, an electric dipole and magnetic dipole are fundamentally quite different. In an electric dipole made of ordinary matter, the positive charge is made of [[proton]]s and the negative charge is made of [[electron]]s, but a magnetic dipole does ''not'' have different types of matter creating the north pole and south pole. Instead, the two magnetic poles arise simultaneously from the aggregate effect of all the currents and intrinsic moments throughout the magnet. Because of this, the two poles of a magnetic dipole must always have equal and opposite strength, and the two poles cannot be separated from each other.

==Maxwell's equations==
[[Maxwell's equations]] of [[electromagnetism]] relate the electric and magnetic fields to each other and to the motions of electric charges. The standard equations provide for electric charges, but they posit no magnetic charges. Except for this difference, the equations are symmetric under the interchange of the electric and magnetic fields.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The fact that the electric and magnetic fields can be written in a symmetric way is specific to the fact that space is three-dimensional. When the equations of electromagnetism are extrapolated to other dimensions, the magnetic field is described as being a rank-two [[antisymmetric tensor]], whereas the electric field remains a [[Pseudovector|true vector]]. In dimensions other than three, these two mathematical objects do not have the same number of components.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, symmetric Maxwell's equations can be written when all charges (and hence [[electric current]]s) are zero, and this is how the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] is derived.

Fully symmetric Maxwell's equations can also be written if one allows for the possibility of "magnetic charges" analogous to electric charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/STARS:Maxwell's_Equations|title=Maxwell's Equations - Engineering and Technology History Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.ieeeghn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the inclusion of a variable for the density of these magnetic charges, say {{math|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}, there is also a "magnetic current density" variable in the equations, {{math|'''j'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

If magnetic charges do not exist&amp;nbsp;– or if they do exist but are not present in a region of space&amp;nbsp;– then the new terms in Maxwell's equations are all zero, and the extended equations reduce to the conventional equations of electromagnetism such as {{math|∇⋅'''B''' {{=}} 0}} (where {{math|∇⋅}} is [[divergence]] and {{math|'''B'''}} is the [[magnetic field|magnetic {{math|'''B'''}} field]]).

In [[SI]] units, there are two conflicting units in use for magnetic charge {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}: [[Weber (unit)|webers (Wb)]] and [[ampere]]·meters (A·m). The conversion between them is {{nobreak|{{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}(Wb) {{=}} {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}(A·m)}}, since the units are {{nobreak|1 Wb {{=}} 1 H·A {{=}} (1 H·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)·(1 A·m)}} by [[dimensional analysis]] (H is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]] – the SI unit of [[inductance]]).

Maxwell's equations then take the following forms (using the same notation above):&lt;ref group=notes&gt;For the convention where magnetic charge has units of webers, see [[#References|Jackson 1999]]. In particular, for Maxwell's equations, see section 6.11, equation (6.150), page 273, and for the Lorentz force law, see page 290, exercise 6.17(a).

One can choose any real angle {{math|''ξ''}}, and simultaneously change the fields and charges everywhere in the universe as follows (in Gaussian units):&lt;ref name=Jackson611&gt;[[#References|Jackson 1999]], section 6.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

where the primed quantities are the charges and fields before the transformation, and the unprimed quantities are after the transformation. The fields and charges after this transformation still obey the same Maxwell's equations. The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] [[rotation matrix]].

Because of the duality transformation, one cannot uniquely decide whether a particle has an electric charge, a magnetic charge, or both, just by observing its behavior and comparing that to Maxwell's equations. For example, it is merely a convention, not a requirement of Maxwell's equations, that electrons have electric charge but not magnetic charge; after a {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} π/2}} transformation, it would be the other way around. The key empirical fact is that all particles ever observed have the same ratio of magnetic charge to electric charge.&lt;ref name=Jackson611/&gt; Duality transformations can change the ratio to any arbitrary numerical value, but cannot change the fact that all particles have the same ratio. Since this is the case, a duality transformation can be made that sets this ratio at zero, so that all particles have no magnetic charge. This choice underlies the "conventional" definitions of electricity and magnetism.&lt;ref name=Jackson611/&gt;

==Dirac's quantization==
One of the defining advances in [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] was [[Paul Dirac]]'s work on developing a [[special relativity|relativistic]] quantum electromagnetism. Before his formulation, the presence of electric charge was simply "inserted" into the equations of quantum mechanics (QM), but in 1931 Dirac showed that a discrete charge naturally "falls out" of QM. That is to say, we can maintain the form of [[Maxwell's equations]] and still have magnetic charges.

Consider a system consisting of a single stationary electric monopole (an electron, say) and a single stationary magnetic monopole. Classically, the electromagnetic field surrounding them has a momentum density given by the [[Poynting vector]], and it also has a total [[angular momentum]], which is proportional to the product {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and independent of the distance between them.

Quantum mechanics dictates, however, that angular momentum is quantized in units of {{math|''ħ''}}, so therefore the product {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} must also be quantized. This means that if even a single magnetic monopole existed in the universe, and the form of [[Maxwell's equations]] is valid, all electric charges would then be [[charge quantization|quantized]].

What are the units in which magnetic charge would be quantized? Although it would be possible simply to [[integration (mathematics)|integrate]] over all space to find the total angular momentum in the above example, Dirac took a different approach. This led him to new ideas. He considered a point-like magnetic charge whose magnetic field behaves as {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is directed in the radial direction, located at the origin. Because the divergence of {{math|'''B'''}} is equal to zero almost everywhere, except for the locus of the magnetic monopole at {{math|''r'' {{=}} 0}}, one can locally define the [[vector potential]] such that the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the vector potential {{math|'''A'''}} equals the magnetic field {{math|'''B'''}}.

However, the vector potential cannot be defined globally precisely because the divergence of the magnetic field is proportional to the [[Dirac delta function]] at the origin. We must define one set of functions for the vector potential on the "northern hemisphere" (the half-space {{math|''z'' &gt; 0}} above the particle), and another set of functions for the "southern hemisphere". These two vector potentials are matched at the "equator" (the plane {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}} through the particle), and they differ by a [[gauge transformation]]. The [[wave function]] of an electrically charged particle (a "probe charge") that orbits the "equator" generally changes by a phase, much like in the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]. This phase is proportional to the electric charge {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the probe, as well as to the magnetic charge {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the source. Dirac was originally considering an [[electron]] whose wave function is described by the [[Dirac equation]].

Because the electron returns to the same point after the full trip around the equator, the phase {{math|''φ''}} of its wave function {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;iφ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} must be unchanged, which implies that the phase {{math|''φ''}} added to the wave function must be a multiple of {{math|2π}}:

The hypothetical existence of a magnetic monopole would imply that the electric charge must be quantized in certain units; also, the existence of the electric charges implies that the magnetic charges of the hypothetical magnetic monopoles, if they exist, must be quantized in units inversely proportional to the elementary electric charge.

At the time it was not clear if such a thing existed, or even had to. After all, another theory could come along that would explain charge quantization without need for the monopole. The concept remained something of a curiosity. However, in the time since the publication of this seminal work, no other widely accepted explanation of charge quantization has appeared. (The concept of local gauge invariance—see [[Gauge theory]]—provides a natural explanation of charge quantization, without invoking the need for magnetic monopoles; but only if the [[U(1)]] gauge group is compact, in which case we have magnetic monopoles anyway.)

If we maximally extend the definition of the vector potential for the southern hemisphere, it is defined everywhere except for a [[semi-infinite]] line stretched from the origin in the direction towards the northern pole. This semi-infinite line is called the [[Dirac string]] and its effect on the wave function is analogous to the effect of the [[solenoid]] in the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]]. The [[quantization condition]] comes from the requirement that the phases around the Dirac string are trivial, which means that the Dirac string must be unphysical. The Dirac string is merely an artifact of the coordinate chart used and should not be taken seriously.

The Dirac monopole is a singular solution of Maxwell's equation (because it requires removing the worldline from spacetime); in more complicated theories, it is superseded by a smooth solution such as the [['t Hooft–Polyakov monopole]].

==Topological interpretation==

===Dirac string===
{{Main|Dirac string}}
A [[gauge theory]] like electromagnetism is defined by a gauge field, which associates a group element to each path in space time. For infinitesimal paths, the group element is close to the identity, while for longer paths the group element is the successive product of the infinitesimal group elements along the way.

In electrodynamics, the group is [[U(1)]], unit complex numbers under multiplication. For infinitesimal paths, the group element is {{math|1 + ''iA''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which implies that for finite paths parametrized by {{math|''s''}}, the group element is:

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;\prod_s \left( 1+ieA_\mu {dx^\mu \over ds} \, ds \right) = \exp \left( ie\int A\cdot dx \right) . &lt;/math&gt;}}

The map from paths to group elements is called the [[Wilson loop]] or the [[holonomy]], and for a U(1) gauge group it is the phase factor which the wavefunction of a charged particle acquires as it traverses the path. For a loop:

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;e \oint_{\partial D} A\cdot dx  = e \int_D (\nabla \times A) \, dS = e \int_D B \, dS.&lt;/math&gt;}}

So that the phase a charged particle gets when going in a loop is the [[magnetic flux]] through the loop. When a small [[solenoid]] has a magnetic flux, there are [[Aharonov–Bohm effect|interference fringes]] for charged particles which go around the solenoid, or around different sides of the solenoid, which reveal its presence.

But if all particle charges are integer multiples of {{math|''e''}}, solenoids with a flux of {{math|2π/''e''}} have no interference fringes, because the phase factor for any charged particle is {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2π''i''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}. Such a solenoid, if thin enough, is quantum-mechanically invisible. If such a solenoid were to carry a flux of {{math|2π/''e''}}, when the flux leaked out from one of its ends it would be indistinguishable from a monopole.

Dirac's monopole solution in fact describes an infinitesimal line solenoid ending at a point, and the location of the solenoid is the singular part of the solution, the Dirac string. Dirac strings link monopoles and antimonopoles of opposite magnetic charge, although in Dirac's version, the string just goes off to infinity. The string is unobservable, so you can put it anywhere, and by using two coordinate patches, the field in each patch can be made nonsingular by sliding the string to where it cannot be seen.

===Grand unified theories===
{{main|'t Hooft–Polyakov monopole}}
In a U(1) gauge group with quantized charge, the group is a circle of radius {{math|2π/''e''}}. Such a U(1) gauge group is called [[compact space|compact]]. Any U(1) that comes from a [[grand unified theory]] is compact – because only compact higher gauge groups make sense. The size of the gauge group is a measure of the inverse coupling constant, so that in the limit of a large-volume gauge group, the interaction of any fixed representation goes to zero.

The case of the U(1) gauge group is a special case because all its [[irreducible representations]] are of the same size – the charge is bigger by an integer amount, but the field is still just a complex number – so that in U(1) gauge field theory it is possible to take the decompactified limit with no contradiction. The quantum of charge becomes small, but each charged particle has a huge number of charge quanta so its charge stays finite. In a non-compact U(1) gauge group theory, the charges of particles are generically not integer multiples of a single unit. Since charge quantization is an experimental certainty, it is clear that the U(1) gauge group of electromagnetism is compact.

GUTs lead to compact U(1) gauge groups, so they explain charge quantization in a way that seems logically independent from magnetic monopoles. However, the explanation is essentially the same, because in any GUT that breaks down into a U(1) gauge group at long distances, there are magnetic monopoles.

The argument is topological:

# The holonomy of a gauge field maps loops to elements of the gauge group. Infinitesimal loops are mapped to group elements infinitesimally close to the identity.
# If you imagine a big sphere in space, you can deform an infinitesimal loop that starts and ends at the north pole as follows: stretch out the loop over the western hemisphere until it becomes a great circle (which still starts and ends at the north pole) then let it shrink back to a little loop while going over the eastern hemisphere. This is called [[Poincaré conjecture|''lassoing the sphere'']].
# Lassoing is a sequence of loops, so the holonomy maps it to a sequence of group elements, a continuous path in the gauge group. Since the loop at the beginning of the lassoing is the same as the loop at the end, the path in the group is closed.
# If the group path associated to the lassoing procedure winds around the U(1), the sphere contains magnetic charge. During the lassoing, the holonomy changes by the amount of magnetic flux through the sphere.
# Since the holonomy at the beginning and at the end is the identity, the total magnetic flux is quantized. The magnetic charge is proportional to the number of windings {{math|''N''}}, the magnetic flux through the sphere is equal to {{math|2π''N''/''e''}}. This is the Dirac quantization condition, and it is a topological condition that demands that the long distance U(1) gauge field configurations be consistent.
# When the U(1) gauge group comes from breaking a compact Lie group, the path that winds around the U(1) group enough times is topologically trivial in the big group. In a non-U(1) compact Lie group, the [[covering space]] is a Lie group with the same Lie algebra, but where all closed loops are [[contractible]]. Lie groups are homogenous, so that any cycle in the group can be moved around so that it starts at the identity, then its lift to the covering group ends at {{math|''P''}}, which is a lift of the identity. Going around the loop twice gets you to {{math|''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, three times to {{math|''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, all lifts of the identity. But there are only finitely many lifts of the identity, because the lifts can't accumulate. This number of times one has to traverse the loop to make it contractible is small, for example if the GUT group is SO(3), the covering group is SU(2), and going around any loop twice is enough.
# This means that there is a continuous gauge-field configuration in the GUT group allows the U(1) monopole configuration to unwind itself at short distances, at the cost of not staying in the U(1). To do this with as little energy as possible, you should leave only the U(1) gauge group in the neighborhood of one point, which is called the '''core''' of the monopole. Outside the core, the monopole has only magnetic field energy.

Hence, the Dirac monopole is a [[topological defect]] in a compact U(1) gauge theory. When there is no GUT, the defect is a singularity – the core shrinks to a point. But when there is some sort of short-distance regulator on space time, the monopoles have a finite mass. Monopoles occur in [[lattice gauge theory|lattice U(1)]], and there the core size is the lattice size. In general, they  are expected to occur whenever there is a short-distance regulator.

===String theory===
In the universe, quantum gravity provides the regulator. When gravity is included, the monopole singularity can be a black hole, and for large magnetic charge and mass, the black hole mass is equal to the black hole charge, so that the mass of the magnetic black hole is not infinite. If the black hole can decay completely by [[Hawking radiation]], the lightest charged particles cannot be too heavy.&lt;ref&gt;Nima Arkani-Hamed, Lubos Motl, Alberto Nicolis, Cumrun Vafa: [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0601001 The String Landscape, Black Holes and Gravity as the Weakest Force](arXiv:hep-th/0601001, JHEP 0706:060,2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The lightest monopole should have a mass less than or comparable to its charge in [[natural units]].

So in a consistent holographic theory, of which [[string theory]] is the only known example, there are always finite-mass monopoles. For ordinary electromagnetism, the upper mass bound is not very useful because it is about same size as the [[Planck mass]].

===Mathematical formulation===
In mathematics, a (classical) gauge field is defined as a [[connection form|connection]] over a [[principal bundle|principal G-bundle]] over spacetime. {{math|G}} is the gauge group, and it acts on each fiber of the bundle separately.

A ''connection'' on a {{math|G}}-bundle tells you how to glue fibers together at nearby points of {{math|M}}. It starts with a continuous symmetry group {{math|G}} that acts on the fiber {{math|F}}, and then it associates a group element with each infinitesimal path. Group multiplication along any path tells you how to move from one point on the bundle to another, by having the {{math|G}} element associated to a path act on the fiber {{math|F}}.

In mathematics, the definition of bundle is designed to emphasize topology, so the notion of connection is added on as an afterthought. In physics, the connection is the fundamental physical object. One of the fundamental observations in the theory of [[characteristic class]]es in [[algebraic topology]] is that many homotopical structures of nontrivial principal bundles may be expressed as an integral of some polynomial over '''any''' connection over it. Note that a connection over a trivial bundle can never give us a nontrivial principal bundle.

If spacetime is {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} the space of all possible connections of the {{math|G}}-bundle is [[connected space|connected]]. But consider what happens when we remove a [[timelike]] [[worldline]] from spacetime. The resulting spacetime is [[homotopy|homotopically equivalent]] to the [[topological sphere]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

A principal {{math|G}}-bundle over {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is defined by covering {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} by two [[chart (topology)|charts]], each [[homeomorphic]] to the open 2-ball such that their intersection is homeomorphic to the strip {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;×''I''}}. 2-balls are homotopically trivial and the strip is homotopically equivalent to the circle {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  So a topological classification of the possible connections is reduced to classifying the transition functions. The transition function maps the strip to {{math|G}}, and the different ways of mapping a strip into {{math|G}} are given by the first [[homotopy group]] of {{math|G}}.

So in the {{math|G}}-bundle formulation, a gauge theory admits Dirac monopoles provided {{math|G}} is not [[simply connected]], whenever there are paths that go around the group that cannot be deformed to a constant path (a path whose image consists of a single point). U(1), which has quantized charges, is not simply connected and can have Dirac monopoles while {{math|'''ℝ'''}}, its [[universal covering group]], '''is''' simply connected, doesn't have quantized charges and does not admit Dirac monopoles. The mathematical definition is equivalent to the physics definition provided that—following Dirac—gauge fields are allowed that are defined only patch-wise, and the gauge field on different patches are glued after a gauge transformation.

The total magnetic flux is none other than the first [[Chern number]] of the principal bundle, and depends only upon the choice of the principal bundle, and not the specific connection over it. In other words, it is a topological invariant.

This argument for monopoles is a restatement of the lasso argument for a pure U(1) theory. It generalizes to {{math|''d'' + 1}} dimensions with {{math|''d'' ≥ 2}} in several ways. One way is to extend everything into the extra dimensions, so that U(1) monopoles become sheets of dimension {{math|''d'' − 3}}. Another way is to examine the type of topological singularity at a point with the homotopy group {{math|π&lt;sub&gt;''d'' − 2&lt;/sub&gt;(G)}}.

==Grand unified theories==
In more recent years, a new class of theories has also suggested the existence of  magnetic monopoles.

During the early 1970s, the successes of [[quantum field theory]] and [[gauge theory]] in the development of [[electroweak theory]] and the mathematics of the [[strong nuclear force]] led many theorists to move on to attempt to combine them in a single theory known as a [[Grand Unified Theory]] (GUT). Several GUTs were proposed, most of which implied the presence of a real magnetic monopole particle. More accurately, GUTs predicted a range of particles known as [[dyon]]s, of which the most basic state was a monopole. The charge on magnetic monopoles predicted by GUTs is either 1 or 2 ''gD'', depending on the theory.

The majority of particles appearing in any quantum field theory are unstable, and they decay into other particles in a variety of reactions that must satisfy various [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s. Stable particles are stable because there are no lighter particles into which they can decay and still satisfy the conservation laws. For instance, the electron has a [[lepton number]] of one and an electric charge of one, and there are no lighter particles that conserve these values. On the other hand, the [[muon]], essentially a heavy electron, can decay into the electron plus two quanta of energy, and hence it is not stable.

The dyons in these GUTs are also stable, but for an entirely different reason. The dyons are expected to exist as a side effect of the "freezing out" of the conditions of the early universe, or a [[symmetry breaking]]. In this scenario, the dyons arise due to the configuration of the [[vacuum]] in a particular area of the universe, according to the original Dirac theory. They remain stable not because of a conservation condition, but because there is no simpler ''[[topology|topological]]'' state into which they can decay.

The length scale over which this special vacuum configuration exists is called the ''correlation length'' of the system. A correlation length cannot be larger than [[causality (physics)|causality]] would allow, therefore the correlation length for making magnetic monopoles must be at least as big as the horizon size determined by the [[metric tensor|metric]] of the expanding [[universe]]. According to that logic, there should be at least one magnetic monopole per horizon volume as it was when the symmetry breaking took place.

Cosmological models of the events following the [[big bang]] make predictions about what the horizon volume was, which lead to predictions about present-day monopole density. Early models predicted an enormous density of monopoles, in clear contradiction to the experimental evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the concentration of relic monopoles in the universe |first1=Ya. B. |last1=Zel'dovich |first2=M. Yu. |last2=Khlopov |year=1978 |journal=Phys.

Its widely accepted resolution was not a change in the particle-physics prediction of monopoles, but rather in the cosmological models used to infer their present-day density. Specifically, more recent theories of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] drastically reduce the predicted number of magnetic monopoles, to a density small enough to make it unsurprising that humans have never seen one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetic Monopoles |doi=10.1146/annurev.ns.34.120184.002333 |year=1984 |journal=Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. |volume=34 |pages=461–530 |first=John |last=Preskill |bibcode=1984ARNPS..34..461P}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution of the "monopole problem" was regarded as a success of [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation theory]]. (However, of course, it is only a noteworthy success if the particle-physics monopole prediction is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Martin. (1998). ''Before the Beginning'' (New York: Basic Books) p. 185 {{ISBN|0-201-15142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;) For these reasons, monopoles became a major interest in the 1970s and 80s, along with the other "approachable" predictions of GUTs such as [[proton decay]].

Many of the other particles predicted by these GUTs were beyond the abilities of current experiments to detect. For instance, a wide class of particles known as the [[X and Y bosons]] are predicted to mediate the coupling of the electroweak and strong forces, but these particles are extremely heavy and well beyond the capabilities of any reasonable [[particle accelerator]] to create.

== Searches for magnetic monopoles ==
Experimental searches for magnetic monopoles can be placed in one of two categories: those that try to detect preexisting magnetic monopoles and those that try to create and detect new magnetic monopoles.

Passing a magnetic monopole through a coil of wire induces a net current in the coil. This is not the case for a magnetic dipole or higher order magnetic pole, for which the net induced current is zero, and hence the effect can be used as an unambiguous test for the presence of magnetic monopoles. In a wire with finite resistance, the induced current quickly dissipates its energy as heat, but in a [[superconducting]] loop the induced current is long-lived. By using a highly sensitive "superconducting quantum interference device" ([[SQUID]]) one can, in principle, detect even a single magnetic monopole.

According to standard inflationary cosmology, magnetic monopoles produced before inflation would have been diluted to an extremely low density today. Magnetic monopoles may also have been produced thermally after inflation, during the period of reheating. However, the current bounds on the reheating temperature span 18 orders of magnitude and as a consequence the density of magnetic monopoles today is not well constrained by theory.

There have been many searches for preexisting magnetic monopoles. Although there have been tantalizing events recorded, in particular the event recorded by [[Blas Cabrera]] on the night of February 14, 1982 (thus, sometimes referred to as the "[[Valentine's Day]] Monopole"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v429/n6987/full/429010a.html|title=Physics:  The waiting game|first=Geoff|last=Brumfiel|date=May 6, 2004|journal=Nature|volume=429|issue=6987|pages=10–11|doi=10.1038/429010a|bibcode=2004Natur.429...10B}}&lt;/ref&gt;), there has never been reproducible evidence for the existence of magnetic monopoles.&lt;ref name="PRL-48-1378" /&gt; The lack of such events places an upper limit on the number of monopoles of about one monopole per 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; [[nucleon]]s.

Another experiment in 1975 resulted in the announcement of the detection of a moving magnetic monopole in [[cosmic ray]]s by the team led by [[P. Buford Price]].&lt;ref name="PRL-35-487"/&gt; Price later retracted his claim, and a possible alternative explanation was offered by Alvarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Luis W|last=Alvarez|title=Analysis of a Reported Magnetic Monopole|editor=ed. Kirk, W. T.|conference=International symposium on lepton and photon interactions at high energies, Aug 21, 1975|booktitle=Proceedings of the 1975 international symposium on lepton and photon interactions at high energies|pages=967|url=http://usparc.ihep.su/spires/find/hep/www?key=93726}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper it was demonstrated that the path of the cosmic ray event that was claimed due to a magnetic monopole could be reproduced by the path followed by a [[platinum]] nucleus [[nuclear decay|decaying]] first to [[osmium]], and then to [[tantalum]].

High energy particle colliders have been used to try to create magnetic monopoles. Due to the conservation of magnetic charge, magnetic monopoles must be created in pairs, one north and one south. Due to conservation of energy, only magnetic monopoles with masses less than the center of mass energy of the colliding particles can be produced. Beyond this, very little is known theoretically about the creation of magnetic monopoles in high energy particle collisions. This is due to their large magnetic charge, which invalidates all the usual calculational techniques. As a consequence, collider based searches for magnetic monopoles cannot, as yet, provide lower bounds on the mass of magnetic monopoles. They can however provide upper bounds on the probability (or cross section) of pair production, as a function of energy.

The [[MoEDAL experiment]], installed at the [[Large Hadron Collider]], is currently searching for magnetic monopoles and large supersymmetric particles using nuclear track detectors and aluminum bars around [[LHCb]]'s [[VELO]] detector. The particles it is looking for damage the plastic sheets that comprise the nuclear track detectors along their path, with various identifying features. Further, the aluminum bars can trap sufficiently slowly moving magnetic monopoles. The bars can then be analyzed by passing them through a [[SQUID]].

The Russian astrophysicist [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] claims the [[Magnetic field|fields]] of macroscopic [[black hole]]s are potential magnetic monopoles, representing the entrance to an [[Einstein–Rosen bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;''„If the structures of the magnetic fields appear to be magnetic monopoles, that are macroscopic in size, then this is a wormhole."'' Taken from [[All About Space (magazine)|All About Space]], issue No. 24, April 2014, item „Could wormholes really exist?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Monopoles" in condensed-matter systems==

Since around 2003, various [[condensed-matter physics]] groups have used the term "magnetic monopole" to describe a different and largely unrelated phenomenon.&lt;ref name=TchernyshyovQuote/&gt;&lt;ref name=GibneyQuote/&gt;

A true magnetic monopole would be a new [[elementary particle]], and would violate [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] {{math|∇⋅'''B''' {{=}} 0}}.

The monopoles studied by condensed-matter groups have none of these properties. They are not a new elementary particle, but rather are an [[emergent phenomenon]] in systems of everyday particles ([[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, [[photon]]s); in other words, they are [[quasi-particle]]s.

Some researchers use the term '''magnetricity''' to describe the manipulation of magnetic monopole quasiparticles in [[spin ice]],&lt;ref name=Bramwell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Giblin /&gt; in analogy to the word "electricity".

One example of the work on magnetic monopole quasiparticles is a paper published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in September 2009, in which researchers described the observation of [[quasiparticle]]s resembling magnetic monopoles. A single crystal of the [[spin ice]] material [[dysprosium titanate]] was cooled to a temperature between 0.6 [[kelvin]] and 2.0 kelvin. Using observations of [[neutron scattering]], the magnetic moments were shown to align into interwoven tubelike bundles resembling [[Dirac string]]s. At the [[crystallographic defect|defect]] formed by the end of each tube, the magnetic field looks like that of a monopole. Using an applied magnetic field to break the symmetry of the system, the researchers were able to control the density and orientation of these strings. A contribution to the [[heat capacity]] of the system from an effective gas of these quasiparticles was also described.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;

This research went on to win the 2012 Europhysics Prize for condensed matter physics.

In another example, a paper in the February 11, 2011 issue of ''[[Nature Physics]]'' describes creation and measurement of long-lived magnetic monopole quasiparticle currents in spin ice. By applying a magnetic-field pulse to crystal of dysprosium titanate at 0.36 K, the authors created a relaxing magnetic current that lasted for several minutes. They measured the current by means of the electromotive force it induced in a solenoid coupled to a sensitive amplifier, and quantitatively described it using a chemical kinetic model of point-like charges obeying the Onsager–Wien mechanism of carrier dissociation and recombination. They thus derived the microscopic parameters of monopole motion in spin ice and identified the distinct roles of free and bound magnetic charges.&lt;ref name=Giblin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giblin |first1=S.

In [[superfluid]]s, there is a field {{math|'''B'''*}}, related to superfluid vorticity, which is mathematically analogous to the magnetic {{math|'''B'''}}-field. Because of the similarity, the field {{math|'''B'''*}} is called a "synthetic magnetic field". In January 2014, it was reported that monopole quasiparticles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietilä | first1 = Ville | last2 = Möttönen | first2 = Mikko | year = 2009 | title = Creation of Dirac Monopoles in Spinor Bose–Einstein Condensates | url = http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v103/i3/e030401 | journal = Phys.

==Further descriptions in particle physics==
In physics the phrase "magnetic monopole" usually denoted a [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills potential]] {{math|''A''}} and [[Higgs field]] {{math|''ϕ''}} whose equations of motion are determined by the Yang–Mills [[action (physics)|action]]

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int (F_A,F_A)+(D_A \varphi,D_A \varphi) - \lambda \left( 1 - \left\| \varphi \right\|^2 \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;}}

In mathematics, the phrase customarily refers to a static solution to these equations in the [[Bogomol'nyi–Prasad Sommerfield bound|Bogomolny–Parasad–Sommerfeld limit]] {{math|''λ'' → ''ϕ''}}, which realizes, within topological class, the absolutes minimum of the functional

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb R^3} (F_A,F_A)+(D_A \varphi,D_A \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;}}

This means that it in a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] {{math|''A''}} on a [[Principal bundle|principal {{math|G}}-bundle]] over {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} (cf. also Connections on a manifold; principal {{math|G}}-object) and a section {{math|''ϕ''}} of the associated [[adjoint bundle]] of [[Lie algebra]]s such that the [[curvature]] {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and [[covariant derivative]] {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ϕ''}} satisfy the Bogomolny equations

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;F_A = * D_A \varphi&lt;/math&gt;}}

and the [[boundary condition]]s.

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt; \left\| \varphi \right\| = 1- \frac{m}{r} + \theta(r^2), \quad \left\| D_A \varphi \right\| = \mathcal{O} (r^2)&lt;/math&gt;}}

Pure mathematical advances in the theory of monopoles from the 1980s onwards have often proceeded on the basis of physically motived questions.

The equations themselves are invariant under [[Gauge theory|gauge transformation]] and orientation-preserving symmetries. When {{math|''γ''}} is large, {{math|''ϕ''/{{abs|{{abs|''ϕ''}}}}}} defines a mapping from a 2-sphere of radius {{math|''γ''}} in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} to an adjoint orbit {{math|G/''k''}} and the [[homotopy class]] of this mapping is called the magnetic charge. Most work has been done in the case {{math|G {{=}}}} SU(2), where the charge is a positive integer {{math|''k''}}. The absolute minimum value of the functional is then {{math|8π''k''}} and the coefficient {{math|''m''}} in the [[asymptotic expansion]] of {{math|''ϕ''/{{abs|{{abs|''ϕ''}}}}}} is {{math|''k''/2}}.

The first SU(2) solution was found by E. B. Bogomolny, J. K. Parasad and C. M. Sommerfield in 1975. It is spherically symmetric of charge 1 and has the form

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     A &amp;= \left( \frac{1}{\sinh\gamma} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right) \ \varepsilon_{ijk} \frac{x_j}{\gamma} \sigma_k \, dx_i, \\
  \varphi &amp;= \left( \frac{1}{\tanh\gamma} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right) \ \frac{x_j}{\gamma} \sigma_i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}

In 1980, [[Clifford Taubes|C.H.Taubes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffe |first1=A. |last2=Taubes |first2=C. H. |authorlink2=Clifford Taubes |year=1980 |title=Vortices and monopoles |edition= |publisher= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed by a gluing construction that there exist solutions for all large {{math|''k''}} and soon after explicit axially symmetric solutions were found. The first exact solution in the general case was given in 1981 by R.S.Ward for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 2}} in terms of [[elliptic function]]s.

There are two ways of solving the [[Bogomolny equations]]. The first is by [[Twistor theory|twistor]] methods. In the formulation of N.J. Hitchin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchin |first=N. J. |year=1982 |title=Monopoles and geodesics |publisher= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an arbitrary solution corresponds to a [[holomorphic vector bundle]] over the [[complex surface]] {{math|''TP''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the [[tangent bundle]] of the projective line. This is naturally isomorphic to the space of oriented straight lines in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The boundary condition show that the holomorphic bundle is an extension of line bundles determined by a compact [[algebraic curve]] of genus {{math|(''k'' − 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (the spectral curve) in {{math|''TP''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, satisfying certain constraints.

The second method, due to [[Werner Nahm|W.Nahm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nahm |first=W. |year=1982 |title=The construction of all self-dual monopoles by the ADHM method |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; involves solving an [[eigen value problem]] for the coupled [[Dirac operator]] and transforming the equations with their boundary conditions into a system of [[ordinary differential equations]], the [[Nahm equations]].

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT_1}{ds}=[T_2,T_3],\ \ \frac{dT_2}{ds}=[T_3,T_1],\ \ \frac{dT_3}{ds}=[T_1,T_2]&lt;/math&gt;}}

where {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''s'')}} is a {{math|(''k'' × ''k'')}}-matrix valued function on {{math|(0,2)}}.

Both constructions are based on analogous procedures for [[instantons]], the key observation due to N. S. Manton being of the self-dual [[Yang–Mills equations]] (cf. also Yang–Mills field) in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The equivalence of the two methods for SU(2) and their general applicability was established in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=N.J. Hitchin |title=On the construction of monopoles |publisher= |year=1983 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also:&lt;ref name="N.J.Hitchin 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchin |first=N. J. |editor-last=Terng |editor-first=C.-L. |year=1999 |title=Integrable sustems in Riemannian geometry |edition=K.Uhlenbeck |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Explicit formulas for {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''ϕ''}} are difficult to obtain by either method, despite some exact solutions of Nahm's equations in symmetric situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitchin  |first1=N. J. |last2=Manton |first2=N. S. |last3=Murray |first3=M. K. |year=1995 |title=Symmetric Monopoles |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximally imbedded spherically symmetric magnetic monopole solutions in the Bogolomony–Parasad–Sommerfield limit for the gauge group SU(''n'') were exhibited by Bais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bais | first1 = F.A. | last2 = Weldon | first2 = H. | year = 1978 | title = Exact Monopole Solutions in SU(N) Gauge Theory | url = | journal = Phys.

equation:

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{d^2\theta_i}{dr^2} = \exp K_{ij\theta_j}, \\
&amp; \text{where } B_r(r,\hat{k}) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{\frac{d^2 \theta_i}{dr^2} - \frac{\bar{R}_i}{r^2}\right\} H_i,\\
&amp; \text{and } \varphi(r,\hat{k}) = \frac{1}{2}\left\{\frac{d\theta_i}{dr} + \frac{\bar{R}_i}{r}\right\} H_i\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Non-singular solutions have a magnetic field vanishes at the origin.  Explicit finite energy solutions for the Lie algebras {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have been obtained using this method.

The case of a more general [[Lie group]] {{math|''G''}}, where the stabilizer of {{math|''ϕ''}} at infinity is a maximal torus, was treated by M. K. Murray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=M. K. |year=1983 |title=Monopoles and spectral curves for arbitrary Lie groups |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the twistor point of view, where the single spectral curve of an SU(2)-monopole is replaced by a collection of curves indexed by the vertices of the [[Dynkin diagram]] of {{math|''G''}}. The corresponding Nahm construction was designed by J. Hustubise and Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[moduli space]] (cf. also Moduli theory) of all SU(2) monopoles of charge {{math|''k''}} up to gauge equivalence was shown by Taubes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taubes |first=C. H. |year=1983 |title=Stability in Yang–Mills theories |publisher= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be a smooth non-compact manifold of dimension {{math|4''k'' − 1}}. Restricting to gauge transformations that preserve the connection at infinity gives a {{math|4''k''}}-dimensional manifold {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which is a circle bundle over the true moduli space and carries a natural complete hyper-Kähler metric&lt;ref name="M.F.Atiyah, N.J.Hitchin 1988"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atiyah |first1=M. F. |last2=Hitchin |first2=N. J. |year=1988 |title=The geometry and dynamics of magnetic monopoles |publisher=Princeton Univ.Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. also [[Kähler–Einstein manifold]]). With suspected to any of the complex structures of the hyper-Kähler family, this manifold is holomorphically equivalent to the space of based rational mapping of degree {{math|''k''}} from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donaldson |first=S. K. |year=1984 |title=Nahm's equations and the classification of monopoles |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metric is known in twistor terms,&lt;ref name="M.F.Atiyah, N.J.Hitchin 1988"/&gt; and its [[Kähler potential]] can be written using the Riemann [[theta functions]] of the spectral curve,&lt;ref name="N.J.Hitchin 1999"/&gt; but only the case {{math|''k'' {{=}} 2}} is known in a more conventional and usable form&lt;ref name="M.F.Atiyah, N.J.Hitchin 1988"/&gt; (as of 2000). This Atiyah–Hitchin manifold, the Einstein [[Taub-NUT metric]] and {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the only 4-dimensional complete hyper-Kähler manifolds with a non-triholomorphic SU(2) action. Its [[geodesics]] have been studied and a programme of Manton concerning monopole dynamics put into effect. Further dynamical features have been elucidated by numerical and analytical techniques.

A cyclic {{math|''k''}}-fold conering of {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} splits isometrically is a product {{math|''M''&amp;#x0303;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''M''&amp;#x0303;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the space of strongly centred monopoles. This space features in an application of [[S-duality]] in theoretical physics, and in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=G. B. |last2=Selby |first2=A. |year=1996 |title=The cohomology of the space of magnetic monopoles |publisher= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; G. B. Segal and A. Selby studied its topology and the {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} harmonic forms defined on it, partially confirming the physical prediction.

Magnetic monopole on hyperbolic three-space were investigated from the twistor point of view by M. F. Atiyah&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Atiyah |first=M. F. |year=1987 |title=Magnetic monopoles in hyperbolic space, Vector bundles on algebraic varieties |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (replacing the complex surface {{math|''TP''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} by the complement of the anti-diagonal in {{math|''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × ''P''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) and in terms of discrete Nahm equations by Murray and M.

In biochemistry, the '''metallome''' distribution of free [[metal]] [[ions]] in every one of [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] compartments. The term was defined in analogy with [[proteome]] as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''metallomics''' is  the study of metallome: the  "comprehensive analysis of the entirety of metal and metalloid species within a cell or tissue type".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Szpunar|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, metallomics can be considered a branch of [[metabolomics]],{{cn|date=January 2018}} even though the metals are not typically considered as [[metabolites]].

An alternative definition of "metallomes" as [[metalloprotein]]s or any other metal-containing [[biomolecules]], and "metallomics" as a study of such biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haraguchi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Metallointeractome==
In the study of metallomes the [[transcriptome]], proteome and the [[metabolome]] constitutes the whole metallome. A study of the metallome is done to arrive at the '''metallointeractome'''.

==Metallotranscriptome==
The '''metallotranscriptome'''&lt;ref name="Shanker2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Shanker|Djanaguiraman|Venkateswarlu|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be defined as the map of the entire transcriptome in the presence of biologically or environmentally relevant concentrations of an essential or toxic metal, respectively. The metallometabolome constitutes the complete pool of small metabolites in a cell at any given time. This gives rise to the whole metallointeractome and knowledge of this is important in comparative metallomics dealing with toxicity and drug discovery.&lt;ref name="Shanker2009" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4017">A '''nucleogenic''' [[isotope]], or nuclide, is one that is produced by a natural terrestrial [[nuclear reaction]], other than a reaction beginning with cosmic rays (the latter nuclides by convention are called by the different term [[cosmogenic]]). The nuclear reaction that produces nucleogenic nuclides is usually interaction with an alpha particle or the capture of fission or thermal [[neutron]]. Some nucleogenic isotopes are stable and others are radioactive.

An example of a nucleogenic nuclide would be neon-21 produced from neon-20 that absorbs a thermal neutron, to become stable neon-21 (some neon-21 is also primordial).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050223190710/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/feb102005/445.pdf] Neon-21 production from absorption of neutrons from alpha-spallation on oxygen-18&lt;/ref&gt; Other nucleogenic reactions that produce heavy neon isotopes are (fast neutron capture, alpha emission) reactions, starting with magnesium-24 and magnesium-25, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/ne_iig.html] USGS explanation of the nucleogenic sources of Ne-21 and Ne-22&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the neutrons in these reactions is often secondary neutrons produced by alpha radiation from natural [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] in rock.

Because nucleogenic isotopes have been produced later than the birth of the solar system (and the nucleosynthetic events that preceded it), nucleogenic isotopes, by definition, are not [[primordial nuclide]]s. However, nucleogenic isotopes should not be confused with much more common [[radiogenic]] [[nuclides]] that are also younger than primordial nuclides, but which arise as simple [[daughter isotope]]s from [[radioactive decay]]. Nucleogenic isotopes, as noted, are the result of a more complicated nuclear reaction, although such reactions may begin with a radioactive decay event.

Alpha particles that produce nucleogenic reactions come from natural [[alpha particle]] emitters in uranium and thorium decay chains. Neutrons to produce nucleogenic nuclides may be produced by a number of processes, but due to the short half-life of free neutrons, all of these reactions occur on Earth. Among the most common are [[cosmic ray]] spallation production of neutrons from elements near the surface of the Earth. Alpha emission produced by some radioactive decay also produces neutrons by spallation knockout of neutron rich isotopes, such as the reaction of alpha particles with oxygen-18. Neutrons are also produced by the [[neutron emission]] type of radioactive decay, and also from spontaneous fission of fissile elements on Earth, particularly uranium-235.

'''Nucleogenesis''' (also known as [[nucleosynthesis]]) as a general phenomenon is a process usually associated with production of nuclides in the [[Big Bang]] or in stars, by nuclear reactions there. Some of these neutron reactions (such as the [[r-process]] and [[s-process]]) involve absorption by atomic nuclei of high-temperature (high energy) neutrons from the star. These processes produce most of the [[chemical element]]s in the universe heavier than [[zirconium]] (element 40), because nuclear fusion processes become increasingly inefficient and unlikely, for elements heavier than this. By convention, such heavier elements produced in normal [[elemental abundance]], are ''not'' referred to as "nucleogenic." Instead, this term is reserved for nuclides (isotopes) made on Earth from natural nuclear reactions.

Also, the term "nucleogenic" by convention excludes artificially produced [[radionuclide]]s, for example [[tritium]], many of which are produced in large amounts by a similar artificial processes, but using the copious neutron flux produced by conventional [[nuclear reactor]]s.

'''''Out of the Cradle: Exploring the Frontiers beyond Earth''''' is a book written and illustrated by planetary scientist [[William K. Hartmann]], [[Ron Miller (artist and author)|Ron Miller]] and Pamela Lee. '''''Cradle''''' describes potential manned space missions to the planets, moons and asteroids of the [[Solar System]]. The approximately 100&lt;ref name="psi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psi.edu/hartmann/writing.html|title=BILL HARTMANN'S WRITING PAGE &amp;#124; Planetary Science Institute|publisher=psi.edu|accessdate=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[space art]] illustrations were in large part based on the plethora of new photographs from the unmanned space probes [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager 1]] and the [[Viking Lander]], available at the time of publication, with scientific extrapolation of the likely appearance of various planetary surfaces. The title is derived from a quote from [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], which is included in the preface: "Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in the cradle forever."

==Program overview==
[[File:MRBM-IRBM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Missile comparison: India and Pakistan, by [[Americans|US]] [[Missile Defense Agency|MDA]].]]
Planning and initiatives for the program began in 1987 based on an [[ISI (Pakistan)|intelligence estimates]] on the existence of the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program|missile program]] of [[India]], which was taking place under the [[India]]n [[Defence Research and Development Organisation|DRDO]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt; Memoirs written by former [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|chief of army staff]] General [[Mirza Aslam Beg|Mirza Beg]], the eventual planning of the program began in 1987, with many of the organizations associated with the [[Ministry of Defence Pakistan|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref name="Dawn newspapers, 1998"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beg|first1=M.A.|title=Ghauri won't rock the region|url=http://dawn.com/|accessdate=21 November 2014|agency=Dawn newspapers|publisher=Dawn newspapers, 1998|date=6 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was delegated to [[SUPARCO|Space Research Commission]], [[Defence Science and Technology Organization (Pakistan)|DESTO]], [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]], and [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], all individually working on the program under the [[Ministry of Defence Pakistan|MoD]] and the [[Ministry of Defence Production|MoDP]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt;

[[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] had held several national security meetings with the [[Ministry of Defence|MoD]] and [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|MoST]] officials to give crucial authorization for the launch of the program in 1987.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt; The major motivation for this program, according to a military official, was to counter the India's ingeniously developed [[Prithvi missile|Prithvi system]], first successfully tested in 1988.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt; Only [[Hatf|Hatf project]] was made it operational in 1987–88.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Consortium"/&gt; Restriction and strict [[technology transfer]] monitored by the [[Missile Technology Control Regime|MTCL]] by the numbers of [[Western world|Western countries]] and the [[United States]] slowed the efforts for the program.&lt;ref name="APH Publ. Corp." /&gt; In a direct [[Technological rationality|technological race]] with India, the program was focused more towards ingenuity.&lt;ref name="Khalid Hanif, original article at Jang Newspapers"/&gt;

The program was aggressively pursued by [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s government faced with the [[missile gap]] with India with apparent testing of [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi-I]] missile in 1990 and strongly advocated and lobbied for the program's feasibility in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="APH Publ.

The program eventually expended and diversified with the successful development of the [[cruise missile]]s and other strategic level arsenals in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="ainonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ain-defense-perspective/2012-06-08/pakistan-launches-indigenous-alcm-again|title=Pakistan Launches Indigenous ALCM Again &amp;#124; Defense: Aviation International News|publisher=ainonline.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codenames===
[[Secrecy|Secretive]] codenames for the projects of concerning national security had been issued since the 1970s, and the [[Pakistani military|military]] continued to do so, to promote the secrecy around the missile programme. The missile systems in this program were all given codenames by their respective organizations. However, all missiles were issued single codename series: ''Hatf'', for the [[Surface to surface missile|surface to surface]] [[guided missile|guided]] [[ballistic missile]]s.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt; This codename  was selected by the [[Research and development in Pakistan|research and development]] committee at the [[GHQ (Pakistan Army)|GHQ]] of the [[Pakistan Army]].&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt; In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], ''hatf'' meaning "death" refers to the [[sword]] of the Prophet [[Prophet Muhammad|Muhammad]] which was used in many of his [[Military career of Muhammad|military conquest]]s, and had the unique distinction of never missing its target.&lt;ref name="Defence Journal, 1998" /&gt;

The other unofficial names, such as [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri]] and [[Abdali-I|Abdali]], are given the names of historical figures in the [[Islamic conquest of South Asia|Islamic conquest]] of [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="BBC, Pakistan Bureau"/&gt; Pakistan's missile systems are named after the powerful [[Afghanistan#Islamization and Mongol invasion|Pashtun warlords]] who invaded India from the historical region of [[Greater Khorasan]];present day Afghanistan and western Pakistan between the 11th and 18th centuries in an attempt to expand their empires.&lt;ref name="BBC, Pakistan Bureau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abbas|first1=Zaffar|title=Pakistan's missile symbolism|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2014843.stm|accessdate=26 December 2014|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC, Pakistan Bureau|date=28 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle-range system===
{{Main|Hatf}}

The [[Hatf-I|Hatf system]] ([[English language|English tr.]]: "Vengeance") was the first project that was developed under this program in 1980s and the project went to the [[Pakistan Army]]. Designed by the [[SUPARCO|SRC]] and developed by the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]], the program was seen as to India's [[Prithvi (missile)|''Prithvi'']], with three variants developed for the use by the [[Pakistan Army]]. Classified under the [[Battlefield range ballistic missile|BRBM]] class, the missile has been in services with [[Pakistan Army]] since 1992.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Consortium"&gt;{{cite web|last1=et.al.|title=Timelime of Missiles|url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Nuclear&amp;Missiles/Missile_Program_Chronology.html|publisher=Pakistan Defence Consortium|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hatf-I|Hatf–I]] is an [[Unguided missile|unguided]] [[ballistic missile]] mounted on a [[transporter erector launcher|TEL]] vehicle with a range of {{convert|70|km|mi}}; it has capability of both carrying the [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear material|nuclear]] payloads of {{convert|500|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Consortium"/&gt; The programme initially led by the [[SUPARCO|SRC]] after developing the [[Hatf|Hatf–IA]], an improved version {{convert|300|km|mi}} with same [[Payload (air &amp; space craft)|payload]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pakistan derives its first 'Hatf' missiles from foreign space rockets," The Risk Report, October 1995, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Its final evolution led to the development of the [[Hatf-III|Hatf–IB]] which includes a proper computer [[inertial guidance system|inertial guidance]] system with an extended range. The program evolved into final introduction of the [[Hatf-I|Hatf–IV]] designation with a maximum range of {{convert|900|km|mi}} with a payload of 1,000[[Kilogram|kg]] (2,200[[Pound (mass)|lb]]), equipped with a computer inertial navigation system.&lt;ref name="Missiles of the World"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missilethreat.com/missilesoftheworld/id.47/missile_detail.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008193609/http://www.missilethreat.com/missilesoftheworld/id.47/missile_detail.asp |archive-date=2007-10-08 |dead-url=yes |title=MissileThreat :: Hatf 1 :: Missiles of the World |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[National Defence Complex|NDC]] developed the latest battle-field range system that seen as a compatible to [[Hatf-I|Hatf–IV]] and widely believed to be a delivery system for small [[tactical nuclear weapon|tactical]] [[nuclear weapons]], which is codenamed as: [[Nasr (missile)|Hatf–IX ''Nasr'']].

===Short–medium range development===
[[File:SRBM Comparison.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Comparison by [[Missile Defense Agency|MDA]] of India and Pakistan's [[SRBM|short-range]] systems.]]
With the development of [[BRBM]] type missiles, the program extended towards the creation of the both [[SRBM|short]]–to–[[IRBM|intermediate]] range system.&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; Originally, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] was initially interested in seeking the procurement of [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Dongfeng missile|M–11]] missiles but cancelled the talks due to international pressure in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; After convincing arguments, the project went to [[SUPARCO|SRC]] in 1995 and the development soon began. Codename [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]], it is the first [[Solid fuel rocket motor|solid–fuel]] based [[SRBM|short range]] system with a range of 600[[Kilometer|km]] with a payload of 500[[Kilogram|kg]].&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; The [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]] system was tested in 1997 and is stated to have been a major break-through.&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; The [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]] is a two-stage [[Solid rocket booster|solid fuel]] based missile and an advanced terminal [[Inertial navigation system|guidance system]] with an [[Control engineering|onboard computer]].&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; The [[DESTO (Pakistan)|DESTO]] designed five different types of [[warhead]]s for the [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]] can be delivered with a [[Circular Error Probability|CEP]] of 0.1% at 600&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Janes"/&gt; It is believed that the design of the [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]] is influenced from the Chinese [[Dongfeng (missile)#Dongfeng 11 .28CSS-7.29|M-11]] missile,&lt;ref name="Janes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hatf 3 (Ghaznavi) (Pakistan), Offensive weapons|url=http://articles.janes.com/articles/Janes-Strategic-Weapon-Systems/Hatf-3-Ghaznavi-Pakistan.html|accessdate=16 June 2011|publisher=Janes}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the military officials have claimed that the [[Ghaznavi (missile)|Ghaznavi]] was developed entirely in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Lodi, Pakistan's Missile Technology"&gt;{{Cite web  | last =Lodi  | first =[[Lieutenant General]] Safdar F.S. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Pakistan's Missile Technology  | work =Head of Integrated Missile Research and Development Programme (IMRDP)  | publisher =Defence Journal of Pakistan  | date = May 1998  | url =http://www.defencejournal.com/may98/pakmissiletech.htm  | doi =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the same category of [[SRBM]], the second project which was codename [[Shaheen-I|Shaheen]], was widely pursued and developed by the [[National Defence Complex|National Defence Complex (NDC)]]– a spinoff of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]].&lt;ref name="Khalid Hanif, original article at Jang Newspapers"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a Shaheen-III airframe with an enlarged [[payload fairing]] and slightly shorter range of 2,200&amp;nbsp;km. The intention of the MIRV system is to counteract [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme|Indian BMD]].

While Shaheen was developed in 1995, another parallel project was being run under the [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]]. Codename [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri]], the project was aimed towards developing the [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fuel]] [[ballistic missile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title = surface to surface missile, Hatf-V (Ghauri)  | date =6 April 1998  | url =https://fas.org/news/pakistan/1998/04/16980406.htm    | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ghauri missile|Ghauri]] was based on entirely on [[North Korea]]'s [[Rodong-1]] as its technology heavily reflected the [[Rodong-1]].&lt;ref name="Defence News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ansari|first1=Usman|title=Pakistan Test-Fires Medium-Range Ballistic Missile|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20121128/DEFREG03/311280005/Pakistan-Test-Fires-Medium-Range-Ballistic-Missile|accessdate=22 November 2014|agency=Defence News|publisher=Defence News|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was supported by [[Benazir Bhutto]] who consulted for the project with [[North Korea]] and facilitated the [[technology transfer]] to [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] in 1993. According to the military officials, the original design was flawed and the missile burned up on re-entry during its first test flight.&lt;ref name="Defence News"/&gt; The [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] was forced to perform the heavy [[reverse engineering]] and had to redesign the entire missile.&lt;ref name="Defence News"/&gt; With scientific assistance from the [[DESTO (Pakistan)|DESTO]], [[National Development Complex|NDC]], and the [[NESCOM]], the first missile [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri–I]] was developed. It was successfully tested on 8 April 1998 and entered in the service.&lt;ref name="Defence News"/&gt; As [[Shaheen-I|Shaheen]], the [[Ghauri missile|Ghauri]] evolves and produced [[Ghauri-II]], also in the 1990s. The  [[Ghauri-II]] has a maximum range of 2,000[[Kilometer|km]] (1,200[[miles|mi]]) with a payload of  1,200[[Kilogram|kg]].&lt;ref name="Defence News"/&gt;

Under the [[Ghauri (missile)|Ghauri]], its third variant which was codenamed as [[Ghauri-III|Ghauri III]] was underdeveloped by [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=6307&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=5/28/2011|title=Musharraf stopped funds for Ghauri-III missile saying: "Do you want to destroy Israel"|date=28 May 2011|publisher=The News International (thenews.com.pk)|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ghauri-III|Ghauri III]] was cancelled in 2000 despite the project being completed its 50% of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/world/fullnews-218609.html|title=Musharraf stopped funds for Pak missile, asking AQ Khan: "You want to destroy Israel?"|date=28 May 2011|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cruise systems===
In 2005 the [[Babur (cruise missile)|Hatf VII ''Babur'']] ground-launched [[cruise missile]] was revealed in a public test-firing. Early versions had a range of 500&amp;nbsp;km but later a 700&amp;nbsp;km variant was tested. In September 2012 a new launch vehicle was tested, as well as a new command and control system named the Strategic Command and Control Support System. It was stated that the SCCSS would give "decision-makers at the National Command Centre robust command and control capability of all strategic assets with round the clock situational awareness in a digitised network-centric environment." It was also stated that the Babur's guidance system uses [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]] and [[TERCOM#DSMAC|digital scene matching and area co-relation (DSMAC)]] techniques to achieve accuracy described as "pin-point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-17/pakistan/33901443_1_nuclear-capable-hatf-vii-terrain-contour | work=The Times Of India | title=Pakistan test-fires nuclear-capable Babur missile with 700 km range - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new launch vehicle, a MAZ transporter erector launcher, is armed with three missile rounds launched vertically.

In 2007 the [[Ra'ad|Hatf VIII ''Ra'ad'']], an air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) was revealed in a test by the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. It has a stated range of 350&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article3492864.ece | title=Pak test fires Hatf VII nuclear missile | date=5 June 2012 | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flight test on 31 May 2012 was stated to have validated integration with the new Strategic Command and Control Support System (SCCSS), stated to be capable of remotely monitoring the missile's flight path in real time.&lt;ref name="ainonline.com"/&gt; It can avoid radar detection due to its low altitude trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1234015/pakistan-successfully-tests-raad-cruise-missile-ispr|title=Pakistan successfully tests Ra’ad cruise missile: ISPR|work=dawn.com|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proteins@home''' ("Proteins at home") was one of many [[distributed computing]] projects that used the [[BOINC]] architecture. The project was run by the Department of Biology at [[École Polytechnique]]. The project began on December 28, 2006 and ended in June 2008.

== Purpose ==
Proteins@Home was a large-scale non-profit [[protein structure prediction]] project utilizing distributed computing to perform a lot of computations in a small amount of time. From their website:

''The amino acid sequence of a protein determines its three-dimensional structure, or 'fold'. Conversely, the three-dimensional structure is compatible with a large, but limited set of amino acid sequences. Enumerating the allowed sequences for a given fold is known as the 'inverse protein folding problem'. We are working to solve this problem for a large number of known protein folds (a representative subset: about 1500 folds). The most expensive step is to build a database of energy functions that describe all these structures. For each structure, we consider all possible sequences of amino acids. Surprisingly, this is computationally tractable, because our energy functions are sums over pairs of interactions. Once this is done, we can explore the space of amino acid sequences in a fast and efficient way, and retain the most favorable sequences. This large-scale mapping of protein sequence space will have applications for predicting protein structure and function, for understanding protein evolution, and for designing new proteins. By joining the project, you will help to build the database of energy functions and advance an important area of science with potential biomedical applications.''

== Statistics ==
On March 25, 2007, Proteins@Home had 6040 of 9548 users actively participating with a total of 10405 of 15381 computers contributing. There were approximately 479 active teams spread across 100 countries.

== See also ==
A number of other [[distributed computing]] projects are also contributing to the protein folding idea.
Some of these projects are:

*[[Folding@home]]
*[[Predictor@home]]
*[[Rosetta@home]]
*[[Similarity Matrix of Proteins|SIMAP]]
*[[TANPAKU]]
*[[Human Proteome Folding Project]]
*[[POEM@Home]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">A '''pseudodeficiency allele''' or '''pseudodeficiency mutation''' is a mutation that alters the protein product or changes the gene's expression, but without causing disease. For example, in the [[lysosomal storage diseases]], patients with a pseudodeficiency allele show greatly reduced enzyme activity, yet they remain clinically healthy.

In medical genetics, a [[false positive]] result occurs in an [[enzyme assay]] test when test results are positive, but disease or morbidity is not present. One possible cause of false positive results is a pseudodeficiency allele. Disease may also be present, but at a subclinical level.

== Examples ==

* '''[[Tay-Sachs disease]]'''. Enzyme assay testing was especially effective among Ashkenazi Jews because fewer pseudodeficiency alleles are found in this population, as compared with the general population. Carrier screening has not been as reliable in the general population.&lt;ref name="nonjewish"&gt;{{cite journal | year=1992 | title=A pseudodeficiency allele common in non-Jewish Tay-Sachs carriers: Implications for carrier screening | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=51 | pages=793–801 |vauthors=Triggs-Raine BL, Mules EH, Kaback MM, Lynne-Steele JS, Dowling CE, Ackerman BR | pmid=1384323 | issue=4 | pmc=1682803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1993 | title=A second mutation associated with apparent beta-hexosaminidase A pseudodeficiency: identification and frequency estimation. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=53 | pages=1198–1205 |author1=Cao, Z |author2=Natowicz, MR |author3=Kaback, MM |author4=Lim-Steele, JS |author5=Prence, EM |author6=Brown, D |author7=Chabot, T |author8=Triggs-Raine, BL. | pmid=7902672 | issue=6 | pmc=1682498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Metachromatic leukodystrophy]]'''. Low [[Arylsulfatase A|arylsulphatase A]] activity can occur in healthy individuals. This poses a challenge in genetic testing, making it difficult to distinguish between patients who are at risk of developing the disease and those who are healthy carriers of a pseudodeficiency mutation. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a classic example of the difficulties caused by pseudodeficiency in carrier screening, because very high pseudodeficiency carrier frequencies have been detected in some populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1136/jmg.31.9.667 |vauthors=Barth ML, Ward C, Harris A, Saad A, Fensom A |title=Frequency of arylsulphatase A pseudodeficiency associated mutations in a healthy population |journal=Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=31 |issue= 9 |pages=667–71 |year=1994 | pmid=7815433 |pmc= 1050073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==

A pseudodeficiency allele may indicate a deficiency of the enzyme assay method, or it may reflect incomplete understanding of the enzyme's activity.

* The enzyme assay may be invalid because of differences between the natural substrate and an artificial substrate used in testing.
* The gene may be expressed differently in different tissues, causing a positive result in the tissue that is tested even though no disease is present. Blood serum is often used for enzyme assay testing because it can be sampled inexpensively. Testing with other tissue types may produce more reliable results.
* The enzyme assay may be valid, but understanding of the disease and the [[metabolic pathway]] in which it occurs may be incorrect or incomplete.

Because of pseudodeficiency alleles, the results of enzyme assay testing in one population cannot be generalized to other populations. For example, while Tay-Sachs screening was able to nearly eliminate Tay-Sachs disease among [[Ashkenazi Jews]], similar screening in the general population has proven less effective.&lt;ref name="nonjewish" /&gt;

For some genetic diseases, especially those that have low [[penetrance]] or are easily treatable, [[genetic testing|carrier screening]] may be of questionable value when pseudodeficiency alleles are present at high frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=2007-09-19 | title=Carrier screening for Gaucher disease: Lessons for low-penetrance, treatable diseases | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume=298 | issue=11 | pages=1281–90 |vauthors=Zuckerman S, Lahad A, Shmueli A, Zimran A, Peleg L, Orr-Urtreger A, Levy-Lahad E, Sagi M | pmid=17878420 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.11.1281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9523">'''[[Quasi-empiricism]] in [[mathematics]]''' is the attempt in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] to direct philosophers' attention to [[mathematical practice]], in particular, relations with [[physics]], [[social science]]s, and [[computational mathematics]], rather than solely to issues in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. Of concern to this discussion are several topics: the relationship of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|empiricism]] (see [[Penelope Maddy|Maddy]]) with [[mathematics]], issues related to [[Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematical realism|realism]], the importance of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Social constructivism or social realism|culture]], necessity of [[Philosophy of mathematics#Constructivism|application]], [[et cetera|etc.]]

==Primary arguments==
A primary argument with respect to quasi-empiricism is that whilst mathematics and physics are frequently considered to be closely linked fields of study, this may reflect human [[cognitive bias]]. It is claimed that, despite rigorous application of appropriate [[empirical methods]] or [[mathematical practice]] in either field, this would nonetheless be insufficient to disprove alternate approaches.

[[Eugene Wigner]] (1960)&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Wigner]], 1960, "[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,]" ''Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics 13'':&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|noted]] that this culture need not be restricted to mathematics, physics, or even humans.  He stated further that "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or for worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning." Wigner used several examples to demonstrate why 'bafflement' is an appropriate description, such as showing how mathematics adds to situational knowledge in ways that are either not possible otherwise or are so outside normal thought to be of little notice. The predictive ability, in the sense of describing potential phenomena prior to observation of such, which can be supported by a mathematical system would be another example. 

Following up on [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]], [[Richard Hamming]] (1980)&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hamming|R. W. Hamming]], 1980, [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Hamming.html The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics], ''The [[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' Volume 87 Number 2 February 1980&lt;/ref&gt; wrote about [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences#Hamming.27s follow-on to Wigner|applications of mathematics]] as a central theme to this topic and suggested that successful use can sometimes trump proof, in the following sense: where a theorem has evident veracity through applicability, later evidence that shows the theorem's proof to be problematic would result more in trying to firm up the theorem rather than in trying to redo the applications or to deny results obtained to date. [[Richard Hamming|Hamming]] had four explanations for the 'effectiveness' that we see with mathematics and definitely saw this topic as worthy of discussion and study. 

# "We see what we look for." Why 'quasi' is apropos in reference to this discussion.
# "We select the kind of mathematics to use." Our use and modification of mathematics is essentially situational and goal driven.
# "Science in fact answers comparatively few problems." What still needs to be looked at is a larger set.
# "The evolution of man provided the model." There may be limits attributable to the human element. 

For [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1960),&lt;ref&gt;Willard Van Orman Quine (1960), ''[[Word and Object]]'', MIT Press, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; existence is only existence in a structure. This position is relevant to quasi-empiricism, because Quine believes that the same evidence that supports theorizing about the structure of the world is the same as the evidence supporting theorizing about mathematical structures.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ernest (ed.), ''Mathematics Education and Philosophy: An International Perspective'', Routledge, 2003, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] (1975)&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1975, ''Mind, Language, and Reality.  Philosophical Papers, Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.  {{ISBN|88-459-0257-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that mathematics had accepted informal proofs and proof by authority, and had made and corrected errors all through its history. Also, he stated that [[Euclid]]'s system of proving [[geometry]] theorems was unique to the [[Ancient Greece|classical Greeks]] and did not evolve similarly in other mathematical cultures in [[China]], [[India]], and [[Arabia]].  This and other evidence led many mathematicians to reject the label of [[Philosophy of mathematics|Platonists]], along with [[Plato's ontology]]{{snd}} which, along with the methods and epistemology of [[Aristotle]], had served as a [[foundation ontology]] for the Western world since its beginnings.  A truly international culture of mathematics would, Putnam and others (1983)&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Benacerraf|Benacerraf, Paul]], and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]] (eds.), 1983, ''Philosophy of Mathematics, Selected Readings'', 1st edition, Prentice–Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1964.  2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; argued, necessarily be at least 'quasi'-empirical (embracing 'the scientific method' for consensus if not experiment).

[[Imre Lakatos#Proofs and refutations|Imre Lakatos]] (1976),&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos, Imre]] 1976, ''Proofs and Refutations''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-29038-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who did his original work on this topic for his dissertation (1961, [[Cambridge]]), argued for '[[Imre Lakatos#Research programmes|Research Programs]]' as a means to support a basis for mathematics and considered [[thought experiments]] as appropriate to mathematical discovery. Lakatos may have been the first to use 'quasi-empiricism' in the context of this subject.

===Operational aspects===
Several recent works pertain to this topic. [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]'s and [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s work, though their positions may be considered controversial, apply.  Chaitin (1997/2003)&lt;ref name="limits"&gt;[[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin, Gregory J.]], 1997/2003, "''[http://cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/lm.html Limits of Mathematics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101134749/http://cs.umaine.edu/~chaitin/lm.html |date=January 1, 2006 }}''", Springer-Verlag, New York, NY.  {{ISBN|1-85233-668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests an underlying randomness to mathematics and  Wolfram (''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', 2002)&lt;ref name="new"&gt;[[Stephen Wolfram|Wolfram, Stephen]], 2002, ''A New Kind of Science'' ([http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/notes-section-12.8 Undecidables]), Wolfram Media, Chicago, IL.  {{ISBN|1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that undecidability may have practical relevance, that is, be more than an abstraction.  

Another relevant addition would be the discussions concerning [[interactive computation]], especially those related to the meaning and use of [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s model ([[Church-Turing thesis]], [[Turing machines]], etc.). 

These works are heavily computational and raise another set of issues. To quote Chaitin (1997/2003):  "Now everything has gone topsy-turvy.  It's gone topsy-turvy, not because of any philosophical argument, not because of [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s results or [[Alan Turing|Turing]]'s results or my own incompleteness results. It's gone topsy-turvy for a very simple reason — the computer!".&lt;ref name="limits"/&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--Not found in archive.org, then not sure if mdash, not really ndash is in the quote.--&gt;

The collection of "Undecidables" in Wolfram (''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', 2002)&lt;ref name="new"/&gt; is another example. 

[[Peter Wegner|Wegner's]] 2006 paper "Principles of Problem Solving"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/pw/home.html Peter Wegner], Dina Goldin, 2006, "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1139922.1139942 Principles of Problem Solving]".  ''Communications of the ACM'' 49 (2006), pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ''[[interactive computation]]'' can help mathematics form a more appropriate framework ([[empirical]]) than can be founded with [[rationalism]] alone. Related to this argument is that the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] (even recursively related ad infinitum) is too simple a construct to handle the reality of entities that resolve (via computation or some type of analog) n-dimensional (general sense of the word) systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">In applied mathematics, the '''Rosenbrock system matrix''' or '''Rosenbrock's system matrix''' of a linear time-invariant system is a useful representation bridging [[state space representation|state-space representation]] and [[transfer function matrix]] form. It was proposed in 1967 by [[Howard Harry Rosenbrock|Howard H. Rosenbrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenbrock|first1=H. H.|title=Transformation of linear constant system equations|journal=Proc. IEE|date=1967|volume=114|pages=541–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Consider the dynamic system
:: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}= Ax +Bu,&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;y= Cx +Du.&lt;/math&gt;
The Rosenbrock system matrix is given by 
::&lt;math&gt;P(s)=\begin{pmatrix}
sI-A &amp; -B\\
C  &amp; D
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the original work by Rosenbrock, the constant matrix &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to be a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;.

The transfer function between the input &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;  and output &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is given by 
::&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\frac{\begin{vmatrix}
sI-A &amp; -b_i\\
c_j  &amp; d_{ij}
\end{vmatrix}}{|sI-A|}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is the column &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_j&lt;/math&gt; is the row &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

Based in this representation, Rosenbrock developed his version of the PHB test.

==Short form==

For computational purposes, a short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix is more appropriate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenbrock|first1=H. H.|title=State-Space and Multivariable Theory|date=1970|publisher=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given by
::&lt;math&gt;P\sim\begin{pmatrix}
A &amp; B\\
C  &amp; D
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The short form of the Rosenbrock system matrix has been widely used in [[H-infinity methods in control theory]], where it is also referred to as packed form; see command '''pck''' in MATLAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mu Analysis and Synthesis Toolbox|url=http://radio.feld.cvut.cz/matlab/toolbox/mutools/pck.html|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interpretation of the Rosenbrock System Matrix as a Linear Fractional Transformation can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhou|first1=Kemin|last2=Doyle|first2=John C.|last3=Glover|first3=Keith|title=Robust and Optimal Control|date=1995|publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first applications of the Rosenbrock form was the development of an efficient computational method for [[Kalman decomposition]], which is based on the pivot element method. A variant of Rosenbrock’s method is implemented in the '''minreal''' command of Matlab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Schutter|first1=B.|title=Minimal state-space realization in linear system theory: an overview|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|date=2000|volume=121|issue=1-2|pages=331–354|doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(00)00341-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and

[[Ronald Inglehart]], the [[University of Michigan]] professor who developed the theory of [[post-materialism]], has worked extensively with this concept. On the [[World Values Survey#Results|Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map]] ''self-expression values'' are contrasted with ''survival values'', illustrating the changes in values across countries and generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org|title=World Values Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the world is moving towards self-expression values  was discussed at length in an article in [[the Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/1511812 ''American Values: Living with a superpower''] January 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Self expression is to say something that you truly believe is important in a form of communication, such as art, speech and dance. It is to reveal yourself in a way that is special to yourself. 

==Emergence of self-expression values==
The emergence of the [[post-industrial society]] has brought about a wave of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|title=The silent revolution in Europe: Intergenerational change in postindustrial societies|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|year=1971|volume=65|pages=991–1017|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart|doi=10.2307/1953494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], and a growing share of [[East Asia]], a majority of the people are no longer employed in factories, but work in the [[service sector]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] | title = Field Listing: Labor force – by occupation | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html| accessdate = 23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a shift from a mechanical environment to one where ever more people spend their days dealing with other people, symbols, and [[information]], which means that workers in the knowledge sector must exercise their own judgment and choice.

This shift has had major consequences:
* Unprecedentedly high levels of prosperity and welfare states that make food, clothing, shelter, housing, education and health service available to almost everyone. Even in the United States, where the [[welfare state]] is relatively limited, a significant portion of the [[GDP]] is redistributed through the state. This makes physical survival, a minimum living standard, and an average life expectancy of nearly 80 years to be taken for granted by people living in the respective societies, which encourages people to focus on goals beyond immediate survival.
* Modern service jobs increasingly require use of [[cognitive skill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florida|first=Richard|year=2002|title=The Rise of the Creative Class|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|authorlink=Richard Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers, teachers, lawyers, accountants, counselors, programmers and analysts all belong to the [[creative class]]. These workers have high autonomy in their work, even if they sometimes continue to work in hierarchical organizations. The need for cognitive skills is dramatically larger than in societies in the early stages of industrialization. To meet these needs, the labor forces of post-industrial societies increasingly pursue higher education, emphasizing creativity, imagination and intellectual independence. 
* Post-industrial societies are socially liberating compared to their predecessors. The centrally controlled, highly regimented workforces of the industrial world are gone, as are the strong [[conformity]] pressures that accompanied them. The traditional system—in which children's survival depended on their parents' providing for them, in return for which the children would take care of the parents in old age—has been undermined by the welfare state. As a result, close-knit family structures, once a necessity for survival, become increasingly a matter of choice, replacing "communities of necessity" with "elective affinities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|year=2002|chapter=Losing the Traditional: Individualization and Precarious Freedoms|title=Individualization|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|pages=1–21|authorlink=Ulrich Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destandardization of economic activities and social life diminishes social constraints in unprecedented ways. The shift in post-industrial societies is thus one of emancipation from authority.&lt;ref name="Inglehart05"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = New York | year = 2005 | ISBN = 9780521846950 | author2link=Christian Welzel}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-expression values and democracy==
[[Industrialization]] can lead to [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[theocracy]] or [[democracy]]. But post-industrial society brings socio-cultural changes that make truly effective democracy increasingly probable.

[[Knowledge society|Knowledge societies]] cannot function effectively without highly educated workers, who become articulate and accustomed to thinking for themselves. Furthermore, rising levels of economic security bring growing emphasis on self-expression values that give high priority to free choice. Mass publics become increasingly likely to want democracy, and increasingly effective in getting it. Repressing mass demands for liberalization becomes increasingly costly and detrimental to economic effectiveness. These changes link economic development with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | title = Changing Mass Priorities: The Link between Modernization and Democracy | journal = Perspectives on Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 551–567 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1017/S1537592710001258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical measurements of self-expression values==
The most thorough assessment of self-expression values is carried out in the [[World Values Survey]]. Five "[[World Values Survey#History|waves]]" have been conducted so far, each adding additional countries to the survey.

Subsequent [[data analysis]] by Inglehart revealed that a large percentage in the variability in the data could be explained by using a set of measures that tapped just two dimensions: a traditional to secular-rational axis, and a survival to self-expression axis. The factor scores were originally based on 22 variables,&lt;ref name="Inglehart97" /&gt; but this was reduced to  only 10 (5 for each dimension) for the purposes of data availability.

The self-expression axis has the following [[factor loadings]].&lt;ref name="Inglehart05" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-

|-

The '''Small Astronomy Satellite 3''' ('''SAS 3''', also known as '''SAS-C''' before launch) was a NASA [[X-ray astronomy]] [[space telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics'' "X-ray Astronomy Missions", H. Bradt, T. .Ohashi,. and K. Pound., Vol. 30, p. 391 ff (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; It functioned from May 7, 1975 to April 1979. It covered the [[X-ray]] range with four  experiments on board.  The satellite, built by the [[Johns Hopkins University]] [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL), was proposed and operated by [[MIT]]'s Center for Space Research (CSR).  It was launched on a [[Scout (rocket)|Scout]] vehicle from the Italian [[San Marco platform|San Marco launch platform]] near Mombasa, Kenya, into a low-Earth, nearly equatorial orbit. It was also known as Explorer 53, as part of NASA's [[Explorer program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/sas3/sas3_about.html HEASARC GSFC, retrieved Oct 17, 2009] Mission Overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacecraft was 3-axis stabilized with a momentum wheel that was used to establish stability about the nominal rotation, or z-axis.  The orientation of the z-axis could be altered over a period of hours using magnetic torque coils that interacted with the Earth's magnetic field.  Solar panels charged batteries during the daylight portion of each orbit, so that SAS 3 had essentially no expendables to limit its lifetime beyond the life of the tape recorders, batteries, and orbital drag.  The spacecraft typically operated in a rotating mode, spinning at one revolution per 95-min orbit, so that the LEDs, tube and slat collimator experiments, which looked out along the y-axis, could view and scan the sky almost continuously.  The rotation could also be stopped, allowing extended (up to 30 min) pointed observations of selected sources by the y-axis instruments.  Data were recorded on board by magnetic tape recorders, and played back during station passes every orbit.&lt;ref&gt;W. Mayer 1975, APL Tech Digest, 14, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

SAS 3 was commanded from the NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) in Greenbelt MD, but data were transmitted by modem to MIT for scientific analysis, where scientific and technical staff were on-duty 24 hours a day.  The data from each orbit were subjected to quick-look scientific analysis at MIT before the next orbital station pass, so the science operational plan could be altered by telephoned instruction from MIT to GSFC in order to study targets in near real-time.

==Objectives==
The major scientific objectives of the mission were:
# Determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds
# Study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55&amp;nbsp;keV 
# Continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena

==Instrumentation==
SAS 3 carried four experiments:

# Rotating Modulation Collimator (RMC) Experiment, which observed along the rotation (Z) axis of the spacecraft, covering the 2–11&amp;nbsp;keV energy range, and providing high-precision locations of X-ray sources to an accuracy of up ~15 arcseconds.
# Slat collimated proportional counter instrument, covering 1–60&amp;nbsp;keV, looking out perpendicular to the spacecraft Z-axis, and providing coarse positions of unknown and transient sources.
# Tube collimated proportional counter instrument, also covering 1–60&amp;nbsp;keV and also looking out perpendicular to the spacecraft Z-axis, for detailed study of the spectral behavior and time-variability of sources observed during pointed or dithered observations.
# Low-Energy Detector (LED) system, covering 0.1-1&amp;nbsp;keV with a 2.9° FOV along the y-axis.

==Research results==
SAS 3 was especially productive due to its flexibility and rapid responsiveness. Among its most important results were:

* Shortly after the discovery of the first [[X-ray burster]] by the [[Astronomical Netherlands Satellite|ANS]], an intense period of burst source discovery by SAS 3 quickly led to the discovery and characterization of about a dozen additional objects, including the famous Rapid Burster,&lt;ref&gt;[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/objects/binaries/rapid_burster_lc.html HEASARC Rapid burster] Light curve of the Rapid Burster&lt;/ref&gt; MXB1730-335.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, W. H. G. et al. Astrophys. J. Lett. 209, L95−L99 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Marshall ''et al.'', "Further analysis of SAS 3 observations of the rapid burster /MXB 1730-335",Astrophysical Journal, Part 1, vol. 227, Jan. 15, 1979, p. 555-562.&lt;/ref&gt; These observations established the identification of bursting X-ray sources with neutron star binary systems.
* The RMC was the first instrument to routinely provide X-ray positions that were sufficiently precise to allow followup by optical observatories to establish X-ray/optical counterparts, even in crowded regions near the galactic plane.  Roughly 60 positions were obtained with accuracies on the order of 1 arcminute or less.  The resulting source identifications helped to connect X-ray astronomy to the main body of stellar astrophysics.
* Discovery of the 3.6 s pulsations of the transient [[neutron star]]/[[Be star]] binary [[List of X-ray pulsars|4U 0115+63]].,&lt;ref&gt;L. Cominsky ''et al.'', "Discovery of 3.6-s X-ray pulsations from 4U0115+63", ''Nature'' 273, 367 - 369 (01 June 1978); {{doi|10.1038/273367a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to determination of its orbit and observation of a cyclotron absorption line in its strong magnetic field.  Many Be star/neutron star binaries were subsequently discovered as a class of X-ray emitters.
* Discovery of X-ray emission from HZ 43 (an isolated white dwarf),&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, D. R. et al. 1976, ''Astrophys. Journal(Letters)'', Vol 203, L21&lt;/ref&gt; Algol, and from [[Polar (cataclysmic variable)|AM Her]],&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Richarson, &amp; Clarke, 1976, "SAS-3 Observations of AM Her = 3U1809+50", BAAS, Vol. 8, p.512&lt;/ref&gt; the first highly magnetic white dwarf binary system seen in X rays.
* Established the frequent location of X-ray sources near the centers of globular clusters.
* First identification of a QSO through its X-ray emission.
* The soft X-ray instrument established that the 0.10-28&amp;nbsp;keV diffuse intensity is generally inversely correlated with the neutral [[Hydrogen|H]] column density, indicating absorption of external diffuse sources by the foreground galactic [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;"SAS 3 survey of the soft X-ray background", F. J. Marshall and G. W. Clark, Astrophysical Journal, Part 1 (ISSN 0004-637X), vol. 287, Dec. 15, 1984, p. 633-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead investigators on SAS 3 were MIT professors [[George W. Clark]], Hale V. Bradt, and [[Walter H. G. Lewin]].  Other major contributors were Profs Claude Canizares and Saul A. Rappaport, and Drs [[Jeffrey A. Hoffman]], George Ricker, Jeff McClintock, [[Rodger E. Doxsey]], [[Garrett Jernigan]], John Doty, and many others, including numerous graduate students.

The '''Bodleian Social Science Library, Oxford''' ('''SSL''') is the main teaching [[social sciences]] [[lending library]] at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. The library supports taught programmes for both [[undergraduates]] and [[postgraduates]], and houses a dedicated research collection part of which contains [[legal deposit]] material out-housed from the [[Bodleian Library]]. The Social Science Library uses the [[Library of Congress]] classification scheme.

Subject coverage includes:
* [[Criminology]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[International Development]]
* [[Politics]] and [[International Relations]]
* [[Russia]]n and [[Eastern Europe|East European Studies]]
* [[Social Policy]] and [[Social Work]]
* [[Sociology of law|Socio-Legal Studies]]
* [[Sociology]]

The library is located in the [[Manor Road Building, Oxford|Manor Road Building]] on Manor Road, Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manor-road.ox.ac.uk/en/general/about Manor Road Building]. University of Oxford. Retrieved 8 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Manor Road Building was designed by Foster &amp; Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harris| first = Katy| authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  New centre for the advanced study of the social sciences opens at Oxford University| work = | publisher = Foster + Partners| date = 8 November 2004| url = http://www.fosterandpartners.com/news/archive/2004/11/new-centre-for-the-advanced-study-of-the-social-sciences-opens-at-oxford-university/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 8 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Seating for wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Seating in SSL]]
The Social Science Library officially opened 1 October 2004, following a period in which subject collections housed within smaller units were amalgamated into a central library site.
The institution was preceded by the Social Studies Libraries; a grouping of three separate libraries:
* Politics, International Relations, and Sociology Library (PIRS)
* Economics Library (formerly the Institute of Economics and Statistics (IES) until 1999)
* Social Policy and Social Work Library (SPSW)
These three libraries were the first to be combined, at the site of the existing Economics Library, between 2002 and 2003. Further integration followed with the Criminology Library and Socio-Legal Studies Library moving to the site in 2004. The collections housed at the International Development Centre (IDS) at [[Queen Elizabeth House]] joined the Social Science Library after its launch, in the summer of 2005. Material from the Slavonic and East European collections, previously kept within the Bodleian Library Slavonic reading room, also moved into the library later that year.

In March 2010 the Social Science Library was renamed the Bodleian Social Science Library.  This was as result of the Oxford University Library Services - of which the Social Science Library was a part - changing its name to the Bodleian Libraries.

'''Solid fat index''' (SFI) is a measure of the percentage of [[fat]] in crystalline (solid) phase to total fat (the remainder being in liquid phase) across a temperature gradient. The SFI of a fat is measured using a [[dilatometer]] that measures the expansion of a fat as it is heated; density measurements are taken at a series of standardized temperature check points. The resulting SFI/temperature curve is related to melting qualities and flavor. For example, [[butter]] has a sharp SFI curve, indicating that it melts quickly and that it releases flavor quickly. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/Butter/ButterBasics/Characteristics.aspx Physical and Chemical Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060312132907/http://www.wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/Butter/ButterBasics/Characteristics.aspx |date=2006-03-12 }}.

'''Soyuz''' ({{Lang-rus|Сою́з|t=Union|p=sɐˈjus}}) is a series of [[spacecraft]] designed for the [[Soviet space program]] by the Korolev Design Bureau (now [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energia]]) in the 1960s that remains in service today. The Soyuz succeeded the [[Voskhod spacecraft]] and was originally built as part of the [[Soviet manned lunar programs]]. The Soyuz spacecraft is launched on a [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]], the most reliable [[launch vehicle]] in the world to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Delta_Mission/Soyuz_launch_vehicle_The_most_reliable_means_of_space_travel |title=Soyuz launch vehicle: The most reliable means of space travel |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=12839 |title=France and Russia agree: Soyuz will launch from Kourou in French Guyana |date=October 22, 2003 |publisher=SpaceRef |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soyuz rocket design is based on the [[Vostok (rocket)|Vostok]] launcher, which in turn was based on the 8K74 or [[R-7A Semyorka]], a Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. All Soyuz spacecraft are launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]]. &lt;!-- NB: Soyuz-ST from CSG does _not_ carry the Soyuz spacecraft! Mention that in the article about the Soyuz rocket, not here. --&gt;

==History==
The first Soyuz flight was unmanned and started on November 28, 1966. The first Soyuz mission with a crew, [[Soyuz 1]], launched on 23 April 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure, killing [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] [[Vladimir Komarov]]. The [[Soyuz 2|following flight]] was unmanned. [[Soyuz 3]], launched on October 26, 1968, became the program's first successful manned mission. The only other flight to suffer a fatal accident, [[Soyuz 11]], killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry. These were the only humans to date to have died above the [[Kármán line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903011,00.html |title=Science: Triumph and Tragedy of Soyuz 11 |date=12 July 1971 |work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these early incidents, Soyuz is widely considered the world's safest, most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9509254/ns/technology_and_science-space/ |title=Russia thriving again on the final frontier |date=September 29, 2005 |author=Alan Boyle |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by its unparalleled length of operational history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141202-the-greatest-spacecraft-ever Soyuz:The Greatest Spacecraft Ever]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/12/the-best-ride-in-the-galaxy-coming-back-to-earth-in-a-soyuz/ The best ride in the galaxy—coming back to Earth in a Soyuz]&lt;/ref&gt; Soyuz spacecraft were used to carry [[astronaut|cosmonaut]]s to and from [[Salyut]] and later [[Mir]] Soviet space stations, and are now used for transport to and from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). At least one Soyuz spacecraft is docked to ISS at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency. The spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six-person [[Federation (spacecraft)|Federation spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/ptk_np_2011.html |title=Russia to rollout a full-scale mockup of a next-generation spacecraft |date=June 30, 2011 |author=Anatoly Zak |publisher=russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Soyuz-TMA parts.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the three elements of the Soyuz TMA spacecraft.]]
A Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):
* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]], which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission;
* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]], which returns the crew to Earth;
* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached, which contains the instruments and engines.

The orbital and service modules are single-use and are destroyed upon re-entry in the atmosphere. Though this might seem wasteful, it reduces the amount of heat shielding required for re-entry, saving mass compared to designs containing all of the living space and life support in a single capsule. This allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew (6.2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in Apollo CM vs 7.5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  in Soyuz) in the mass budget. The orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space, with the service module containing the fuel, main engines and instrumentation.

Soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[potassium superoxide]] (KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH) cylinders which absorb leftover CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The vehicle is protected during launch by a [[payload fairing]], which is jettisoned along with the SAS at {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes into launch. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.

===Launch Escape System===
The [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]] spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure, as well as during reentry, however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy. Inspired by the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] LES, Soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962. This included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred. Based on data from R-7 launches over the years, engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster, low engine thrust, loss of combustion chamber pressure, or loss of booster guidance. The Spacecraft Abort System (SAS; {{lang-ru|Система Аварийного Спасения|translit=Sistema Avarijnogo Spaseniya}}) could also be manually activated from the ground, but unlike American spacecraft, there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves.

Since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the Soyuz service module cleanly, the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort. Four folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent. Two test runs of the SAS were carried out in 1966-67.&lt;ref name="Shayler2009"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEHL8MIhRa8C&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;pg=PA158 |title=Space Rescue: Ensuring the Safety of Manned Spacecraft |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |series=Springer-Praxis Books in Space Exploration |first=David J. |last=Shayler |pages=153-160 |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-387-69905-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic design of the SAS has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all Soyuz launches carry it. The only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the SAS motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft carried extra life support equipment. The unmanned Progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and removes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud. There have been three failed launches of a manned Soyuz vehicle, [[Soyuz 18-1]] in 1975, [[Soyuz T-10-1]]  in 1983 and [[Soyuz MS-10]] in October 2018. The 1975 failure was aborted after escape tower jettison. In 1983, [[Soyuz T-10-1]]'s SAS successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz_sas.html |title=Emergency escape rocket: The ultimate lifeboat for spacecraft |work=RussianSpaceWeb.com |first=Anatoly |last=Zak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently in 2018, the SAS sub-system in the payload shroud of [[Soyuz MS-10]] successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettisoned.

===Orbital module===
{{Main|Orbital module}}
[[Image:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]

The forepart of the spacecraft is the Orbital Module ({{lang-ru|бытовой отсек|translit=bytovoi otsek}}), also known as habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. The module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. Internal volume is {{convert|6|m3|cuft|0|abbr=on}}, living space {{convert|5|m3|cuft|0|abbr=on}}. On the latest Soyuz versions (since Soyuz TM), a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.

A hatch between it and the Descent Module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed, crew members exiting through its side port (near the descent module). On the launch pad, the crew enter the spacecraft through this port.

This separation also lets the Orbital Module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in a [[micro-g environment]] differs from that of the Descent Module, as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port. Also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the SAS system is complicated because of the orbital module.

Separation of the Orbital Module is critical for a safe landing; without separation of the Orbital Module, it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the Descent Module. This is because the Orbital Module would interfere with proper deployment of the Descent Module's parachutes, and the extra mass exceeds the capability of the main parachute and braking engines to provide a safe soft landing speed. In view of this, the Orbital Module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s. This guaranteed that the Descent Module and Orbital Module would be separated before the Descent Module was placed in a reentry trajectory. However, after the problematic landing of [[Soyuz TM-5]] in September 1988 this procedure was changed and the Orbital Module is now separated after the return maneuver. This change was made as the TM-5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their Orbital Module, which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to MIR. The risk of not being able to separate the Orbital Module is effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it, following a failed deorbit.

===Descent module===
{{Main|Descent module}}
[[Image:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]

The Descent Module ({{Lang-rus|Спуска́емый Аппара́т|r=Spuskáyemy Apparát}}), also known as a reentry capsule, is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. Half of the Descent Module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[reentry]]; this half faces the Earth during re-entry. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the Descent Module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere — as the pioneering [[Vostok (spacecraft)#Design|Vostok]] spacecraft's Descent Module used — but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the "headlight" shape that the Soyuz uses&amp;mdash;a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled (seven degrees) conical section to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular. The small dimensions of the Descent Module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the [[Soyuz 11]] crew. The later Soyuz T spacecraft solved this issue. Internal volume of Soyuz SA is {{convert|4|m3|cuft|0|abbr=on}}; {{convert|2.5|m3|cuft|0|abbr=on}} is usable for crew (living space).

===Service module===
{{Main|Service module}}
[[Image:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]

At the back of the vehicle is the Service Module ({{Lang-rus|прибо́рно-агрега́тный отсе́к|r=pribórno-agregátny otsék}}). It has a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can (instrumentation compartment, {{transl|ru|priborniy otsek}}) that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. A non-pressurized part of the Service Module (propulsion compartment, {{transl|ru|agregatniy otsek}}) contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion system]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{transl|ru|perekhodnoi otsek}}). Outside the Service Module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship. An incomplete separation between the Service and Reentry Modules led to emergency situations during [[Soyuz 5]], [[Soyuz TMA-10]] and [[Soyuz TMA-11]], which led to an incorrect reentry orientation (crew ingress hatch first). The failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the Service/Reentry Modules on the latter two flights.

===Re-entry procedure===
The Soyuz uses a method similar to the Apollo to deorbit itself. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for deorbiting on the far side of Earth ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for [[atmospheric entry|re-entry]]; the spacecraft travels on an elliptical [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] to the entry interface point where atmospheric drag slows it enough to fall out of orbit.

Early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the Service and Orbital Modules detach simultaneously from the Descent Module. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the Descent Module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the Descent Module alter its orientation.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Later Soyuz spacecraft detached the Orbital Module before firing the main engine, which saved propellant. Since the [[Soyuz TM-5]] landing issue, the Orbital Module is once again detached only after the re-enter firing, which led to (but did not cause) emergency situations of [[Soyuz TMA-10]] and [[Soyuz TMA-11|TMA-11]]. The Orbital Module cannot remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, as the airlock hatch between the Orbital and Reentry Modules is a part of the Reentry Module, and the Orbital Module therefore depressurizes after separation.

Re-entry firing is usually done on the "dawn" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the Sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Soyuz craft is designed to come down on land, usually somewhere in the deserts of Kazakhstan in central Asia. This is in contrast to early US manned missions which "splashed down" in the ocean.

===Soyuz 7K (part of the ''7K-9K-11K'' circumlunar complex) (1963)===
[[File:Soyuz-A drawing.png|thumb|Soyuz 7K manned spacecraft concept (1963).]]
{{Main|Soyuz A-B-V}}

[[Sergei Korolev]] initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-V circumlunar complex (''7K-9K-11K'') concept (also known as L1) in which a two-man craft Soyuz 7K would rendezvous with other components (9K and 11K) in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle, the components being delivered by the proven [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7 rocket]].
{{Clear}}

===First generation===
[[Image:Soyuz 7K-OK(A) drawing.svg|thumb|Soyuz 7K-OK(A) spacecraft with an active docking unit.]]
[[Image:RP1357 p22 Salyut 1-type Soyuz.svg|thumb|Soyuz 7K-OKS for Salyut space stations.]]

The manned Soyuz spacecraft can be classified into design generations. [[Soyuz 1]] through [[Soyuz 11]] (1967&amp;ndash;1971) were first-generation vehicles, carrying a crew of up to three without [[spacesuit]]s and distinguished from those following by their bent [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and their use of the [[Igla (spacecraft docking system)|Igla]] automatic docking navigation system, which required special radar antennas. This first generation encompassed the original [[Soyuz 7K-OK]] and the [[Soyuz 7K-OKS]] for docking with the [[Salyut 1]] space station. The probe and drogue docking system permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the Soyuz to the station.

The [[Soyuz 7K-L1]] was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to circle the moon, and was the primary hope for a Soviet circumlunar flight. It had several test flights in the [[Zond program]] from 1967&amp;ndash;1970 ([[Zond 4]] to [[Zond 8]]), which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1's re-entry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped. The [[Soyuz 7K-L3]] was designed and developed in parallel to the Soyuz 7K-L1, but was also scrapped. [[Soyuz 1]] was plagued with technical issues, and cosmonaut [[Vladimir Komarov]] was killed when the spacecraft crashed during its return to [[Earth]]. This was the first [[Space accidents and incidents|in-flight fatality]] in the [[history of spaceflight]].

The next manned version of the Soyuz was the Soyuz 7K-OKS. It was designed for [[space station]] flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft. The Soyuz 7K-OKS had two manned flights, both in 1971. [[Soyuz 11]], the second flight, depressurized upon re-entry, killing its three-man crew.
{{Clear}}

===Second generation===
[[Image:RP1357 p24 Soyuz Ferry.svg|thumb|Upgraded Soyuz 7K-T version.]]

The second generation, called ''Soyuz Ferry'' or [[Soyuz 7K-T]], comprised [[Soyuz 12]] through [[Soyuz 40]] (1973&amp;ndash;1981).

It was developed out of the [[military Soyuz]] concepts studied in previous years and was capable of carrying 2 cosmonauts with [[Sokol space suit]]s (after the [[Soyuz 11]] accident). Several models were planned, but none actually flew in space. These versions were named ''[[Soyuz P]]'', ''[[Soyuz PPK]]'', ''[[Soyuz R]]'', ''[[Soyuz 7K-VI]]'', and ''[[Soyuz OIS]]'' (Orbital Research Station).

The [[Soyuz 7K-T/A9]] version was used for the flights to the military [[Almaz]] space station.

[[Soyuz 7K-TM]] was the spacecraft used in the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] in 1975, which saw the first and only docking of a Soyuz spacecraft with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]. It was also flown in 1976 for the Earth-science mission, [[Soyuz 22]]. Soyuz 7K-TM served as a technological bridge to the third generation.

===Third generation===
[[Image:Soyuz-T drawing.svg|thumb|Soyuz-T spacecraft.]]
{{Main|Soyuz-T}}
The third generation [[Soyuz-T]] (T: {{lang-ru|транспортный|translit=transportnyi|lit=transport}}) spacecraft (1976&amp;ndash;1986) featured solar panels allowing longer missions, a revised Igla rendezvous system and new translation/attitude thruster system on the Service module. It could carry a crew of three, now wearing spacesuits.

===Fourth generation===

====Soyuz-TM (1986–2003)====
[[Image:Soyuz-TM drawing.png|thumb|Soyuz-TM spacecraft. Compare the antennas on the orbital module to those on Soyuz-T. Differences reflect the change from the Igla rendezvous system used on Soyuz-T to the Kurs rendezvous system used on Soyuz-TM.]]
{{Main|Soyuz-TM}}
The Soyuz-TM crew transports (M: {{lang-ru|модифицированный|translit=modifitsirovannyi|lit=modified}}) were fourth generation Soyuz spacecraft, and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to [[Mir]] and the [[International Space Station]].

====Soyuz-TMA (2003–2012)====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Soyuz programme]] --&gt;
[[Image:Soyuz TMA-6 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|The [[Soyuz TMA-6]]]]
{{Main|Soyuz-TMA}}

Soyuz TMA (A: {{lang-ru|антропометрический|translit=antropometricheskii|lit=[[Anthropometry|anthropometric]]}}) features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by NASA in order to service the [[International Space Station]], including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems. It is also the first expendable vehicle to feature "[[glass cockpit]]" technology. Soyuz-TMA looks identical to a Soyuz-TM spacecraft on the outside, but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches.

====Soyuz TMA-M (2010–2016)====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Soyuz programme]] --&gt;
{{Main|Soyuz TMA-M}}

The Soyuz TMA-M was an upgrade of the baseline Soyuz-TMA, using a new computer, digital interior displays, updated docking equipment, and the vehicle's total mass was  reduced by 70 kilograms. The new version debuted on 7 October 2010 with the launch of [[Soyuz TMA-01M|TMA-01M]], carrying the ISS [[Expedition 25]] crew.&lt;ref name="soyuz100"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Soyuz_100_Times_More_Reliable_Than_Shuttle_999.html |title=Soyuz 100 Times More Reliable Than Shuttle |date=February 8, 2010 |publisher=Spacedaily.com |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soyuz TMA-08M]] mission set a new record for the fastest manned docking with a space station.  The mission used a new six-hour rendezvous, faster than the previous Soyuz launches, which had, since 1986, taken two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp35/130305rendezvous/ |title=Soyuz crew approved for fast approach to space station |first=Stephen |last=Clark |publisher=SPACEFLIGHT NOW |date=5 March 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soyuz MS (since 2016)====
[[Image:Soyuz MS-01 docked to the ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Soyuz MS-01]] docked to the ISS]]
{{Main|Soyuz MS}}

Soyuz MS is the final planned upgrade of the Soyuz spacecraft. Its maiden flight was in July 2016 with mission [[Soyuz_MS-01|MS-01]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show?notificationId=8309758&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=July 2016}}&lt;ref name="soyuzms2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=26410.msg1134462#msg1134462 |title=Topic: Soyuz-MS spacecraft |date=December 17, 2013 |publisher=forum.nasaspaceflight.com |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unmanned [[Progress spacecraft]] were derived from Soyuz and are used for servicing space stations.

While not being direct derivatives of Soyuz, the Chinese [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] uses Soyuz TM technology sold in 1984 and the Indian [[ISRO Orbital Vehicle|Orbital Vehicle]] follow the same general layout as that pioneered by Soyuz.

&lt;!--Justification for images: 
* 'Soyuz National Space Centre.jpg' gives the reader an idea what the initial Soyuz looked like. 
* 'Soyuz 19 (Apollo Soyuz Test Project) spacecraft.jpg' gives the reader an idea what the variant looked like (at the time it was radically different than the standard Soyuz). 
* 'Soyuz acoplada MIR.jpg' and 'Soyuz TMA-19 docked to the Rassvet Mini-Research Module.jpg' demonstrate how the Soyuz has been used to service various space stations, ideally we would also have a picture of Soyuz docked to a Salyut station but those images are not in the public domain.
* 'Soyuz spacecraft.jpg' shows how modules that make up Soyuz are attached (this is typically not possible to see because they are covered in micro-meteorite shielding).
* 'Soyuz tm-31 transported to launch pad.jpg' shows how Soyuz is transported to the pad, this image maybe should be replaced with an one showing the spacecraft being encapsulated.

In elementary [[arithmetic]], a standard algorithm or method is a specific method of computation which is conventionally taught for solving particular mathematical problems. These methods vary somewhat by nation and time, but generally include exchanging, regrouping, long division, and long multiplication using a standard notation, and standard formulas for average, area, and volume. Similar methods also exist for procedures such as square root and even more sophisticated functions, but have fallen out of the general mathematics curriculum in favor of calculators (or tables and slide rules before them).

The concepts of [[reform mathematics]] which the [[NCTM]] introduced in 1989 favors an alternative approach. It proposes a deeper understanding of the underlying theory instead of memorization of specific methods will allow students to develop individual methods which solve the same problems. Students' alternative algorithms are often just as correct, efficient, and generalizable as the standard algorithms, and maintain emphasis on the meaning of the quantities involved, especially as relates to place values (something that is usually lost in the memorization of standard algorithms). The development of sophisticated calculators has made manual calculation less important (see the note on square roots, above) and cursory teaching of traditional methods has created failure among many students. Greater achievement among all types of students is among the primary goals of mathematics education put forth by [[NCTM]]. Some researchers such as [[Constance Kamii]] have suggested that elementary arithmetic, as traditionally taught, is not appropriate in elementary school.  Many first editions of textbooks written to the original 1989 standard such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] deliberately discouraged teaching of any particular method, instead devoting class and homework time to the solving of nontrivial problems, which stimulate students to develop their own methods of calculation, rooted in number sense and place value. This emphasis by no means excludes the learning of number facts; indeed, a major goal of early mathematical education is procedural fluency.

The [[NCTM]] in recent revisions has made more explicit this need for learning of basic math facts and correct, efficient methods. Many new editions of standards-based texts do present standard methods and basic skills. However, the original guidelines continue to draw fire from well-meaning parents and community members, some of whom advocate a return to [[traditional mathematics]]. Success of a particular text depends not only upon its content, but also on the willingness of a school community to allow new pedagogy and content and to commit to the recommended implementation of the materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2503">A '''Star rigger''' is a person in author [[Jeffrey Carver]]'s Star Rigger universe books who pilots a [[spacecraft]] through the [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] realm known as "the Flux."

==Riggers==
Ships can be piloted by a solo rigger, or several riggers working as a team. Riggers must be very creative people, since navigating the Flux requires much imagination. In the Star Rigger books, it is suggested that riggers can "burn out", spending so much time in the Flux that they begin to live in their own dream world.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J: "Star Rigger's Way.", p. 84. Tor Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legend]]s say that some become vaguely translucent, having seemingly left a part of themselves in the Flux.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J: "Star Rigger's Way.", p. 73. Tor Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 

Riggers are members of the Rigger[[Guild]], which protects them from exploitation and grants them certain rights.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J: "Dragons in the Stars.", p.11. Tor Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a planet's Spacing Authority must provide all possible assistance and transportation to a ship's rigger crew and passengers from the point of first possible contact in the event of a FluxSpace accident.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J.:"Star Rigger's Way.", p. 56. Tor Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; If the RiggerGuild is not satisfied that its members are being treated appropriately, it can call a general [[General strike|strike]], paralyzing a planet's interstellar economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J: "Star Rigger's Way.", p. 114. Tor Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first known rigger was Panglor Balef, in the Twelfth Century of Space.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J.:"Panglor." Tor Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J.:"Star Rigger's Way.", p. 8. Tor Books, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigating the Flux==
Riggers must navigate space by visualizing the intangible features of the Flux as an interactive [[landscape]] and adapting their flight patterns to the landscape. Although no two riggers will experience the same space in exactly the same way, a team of riggers must work together to create a shared vision of the Flux in order to successfully navigate their ship.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J: "Dragons in the Stars.", p.16. Tor Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The Flux has treacherous areas that can entrap a ship, manifesting themselves as [[whirlpools]] and eddies, or the more dangerous quantum flaws.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, J:"Eternity's End.", p.413. Tor Books, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Tales exist among the riggers of strange visions of [[dragons]] and ghost ships within the Flux.

'''''The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices: Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists''''' is a handbook printed by the nonprofit environmental group [[Union of Concerned Scientists]].

In accordance with UCS's pledge to provide scientifically sound and nonbiased solutions to environmental problems, this book's main goal is to debunk myths associated with the environmental movement and reinforce realistic ways in which the average citizen can do his or her part in conservation.

The back cover of the book reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Paper or plastic? Bus or car?  Old house or new? Cloth diapers or disposables? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others are of negligible importance.  To those of us who care about our quality of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important issue.  In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the environment.  For example, a few major decisions such as the choice of a house or vehicle have such a disproportionately large effect on the environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison.  This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer Related Environmental Problems, 7 Most Damaging Categories, 11 Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Symbolic Species''''' is a 1997 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]] on the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. Combining perspectives from neurobiology, evolutionary theory, linguistics, and [[semiotics]], Deacon proposes that language, along with the unique human capacity for symbolic thought, co-evolved with the brain.

''The Symbolic Species'' is a multi-disclipinary book that at the time of publishing was seen as groundbreaking. It is considered to have bound together a wide array of ideas in a way that advanced the understanding of professionals in several fields.

==Symbolic thought and language==
The reasons for the unique cognitive capacity of humans are explored, along with those for the large number human activities impossible for animals. The human use of language is said to be responsible for both.

==Co-evolution==
A [[chicken-and-egg problem]] is shown to exist between the emergence of symbolic thought and language: language is said to be the medium of symbolic thought, but it is reasoned that mastery of language would first require the ability to think symbolically. The solution of this chicken-and-egg problem, according to Deacon, is the subtle evolutionary process of [[coevolution|co-evolution]].

'''Tito Livio Burattini''' ({{lang-pl|Tytus Liwiusz Burattini}}, 8 March 1617 – 17 November 1681) was an [[inventor]], [[architect]], [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], [[scientist]], [[scientific instrument|instrument]]-maker, [[travel]]ler, [[engineer]], and [[nobleman]].&lt;ref name="frysinger-1675"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frysinger|first=James R.|url=http://www.cofc.edu/~frysingj/background.htm|title=SI Background|work=SI Guide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010214505/http://www.cofc.edu/~frysingj/background.htm|archivedate=2006-10-10|accessdate=2009-05-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham591"&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Needham|title=[[Science and Civilisation in China]]|volume=IV (part 2)|year=1965|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeGyrCfYs2AC&amp;pg=PA591 591]|isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton94"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hamilton|editor-first=Alastair|editor2-last=van den Boogert|editor2-first=Maurits H|editor3-last=Westerweel|editor3-first=Bart|last=Shalev|first=Zur|chapter=The Travel Notebooks of John Greaves|title=The Republic of Letters and the Levant|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2005|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJDoAhXrMOUC&amp;pg=PA94 94]|isbn=978-90-04-14761-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born in [[Agordo]], Italy, and studied in [[Padua]] and [[Venice]].  In 1639, he explored the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] with English [[mathematician]] [[John Greaves]];&lt;ref name="hamilton94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="quarrie20"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quarrie|first=Paul|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/60/1/5.full.pdf|title=The Scientific Library of the Earls of Macclesfield|journal=[[Notes and Records of the Royal Society]]|volume=60|pages=5–24|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2005.0124|issn=0035-9149|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; both Burattini and Sir [[Isaac Newton]] used measurements made by Greaves in an attempt to accurately determine the circumference of the earth.&lt;ref name="mehler26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehler|first=Stephen S.|year=2001&lt;!--per book's copyright page--&gt;|title=The Land of Osiris: An Introduction to Khemitology|publisher=[[David Hatcher Childress|Adventures Unlimited Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xqIxO3-M8ikC&amp;pg=PA26 26]|isbn=978-0-932813-58-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Germany]] in 1641, the court of King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] invited him to [[Poland]].  In [[Warsaw]], Burattini built a model aircraft with four fixed [[Glider aircraft|glider]] wings in 1647.&lt;ref name="needham591" /&gt;  Described as "four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate 'dragon'", it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself.&lt;ref name="harrison27"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=James Pinckney|year=2000|title=Mastering the Sky|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwJsr5QjkRMC&amp;pg=PA27 27]|isbn=978-1-885119-68-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Clive Hart's ''The Prehistory of Flight'', he promised that "only the most minor injuries" would result from landing the craft.&lt;ref name="oconner-1985"&gt;Qtd. in {{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/17/books/in-short-nonfiction-man-was-meant-to-fly-but-not-at-first.html|title=In Short: Nonfiction; Man Was Meant to Fly, But Not at First|last=O'Conner|first=Patricia T.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1985-11-17|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later developed an early [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement]] based on time, similar to today's [[International System of Units]]; he published it in his book ''{{lang|it|Misura universale}}'' (lit. "universal measure") in 1675 at [[Wilno]].&lt;ref name="quarrie20" /&gt;  His system includes the ''{{lang|it|metro cattolico}}'' (lit. "[[wiktionary:catholic|catholic]] [i.e. universal] metre"), a [[unit of length]] equivalent to the length of a free [[seconds pendulum]]; it differs from the modern metre by half a centimetre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Agnoli|first=Paolo|last2=D'Agostini|first2=Giulio|title=Why does the meter beat the second?|date=2005-01-25|eprint=physics/0412078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered the first to recommend the name ''metre'' for a unit of length.

Along with two others he met at [[Kraków]], Burattini "performed optical experiments and contributed to the discovery of irregularities on the surface of [[Venus]], comparable to those on the Moon".&lt;ref name="imss-burattini"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/museum/esim.asp?c=300102|title=Tito Livio Burattini|work=[[Institute and Museum of the History of Science]] - Multimedia Catalogue - Biographies|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made lenses for microscopes and telescopes, and gave some of them to Cardinal [[Leopoldo de' Medici]].&lt;ref name="imss-burattini" /&gt;  He is also credited with building a calculating machine, which he donated to Grand Duke [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], that borrows from both a [[Blaise Pascal]] machine and [[Napier's bones|Napier's rods]].&lt;ref name="imss-calculating"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/mediciscienze/emed.asp?c=35423|title=Tito Livio Burattini &lt;nowiki&gt;[attr.]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Calculating machine|work=Institute and Museum of the History of Science - The Medici and Science|accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in Kraków, aged 64.

'''Vasiliev equations''' are ''formally'' consistent gauge invariant nonlinear equations whose linearization over a specific vacuum solution describes free massless higher-spin fields on anti-de Sitter space. The Vasiliev equations are classical equations and no Lagrangian is known that starts from canonical two-derivative Fronsdal Lagrangian and is completed by interactions terms. There is a number of variations of Vasiliev equations that work in three, four and arbitrary number of space-time dimensions. Vasiliev's equations admit supersymmetric extensions with any number of super-symmetries and allow for Yang-Mills gaugings. Vasiliev's equations are background independent, the simplest exact solution being anti-de Sitter space. It is important to note that locality is not properly implemented and the equations give a solution of certain formal deformation procedure, which is difficult to map to field theory language. The higher-spin [[AdS/CFT correspondence|AdS/CFT]] correspondence is reviewed in [[Higher-spin theory]] article.

The Vasiliev equations are generating equations and yield differential equations in the space-time upon solving them order by order with respect to certain auxiliary directions. The equations rely on several ingredients: unfolded equations and higher-spin algebras.

The exposition below is organised in such a way as to split the Vasiliev's equations into the building blocks and then join them together. The example of the four-dimensional bosonic Vasiliev's equations&lt;ref name=VasFour&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasiliev|first1=M.A.|title=Consistent equations for interacting gauge fields of all spins in 3+1 dimensions|journal=Physics Letters B|date=July 1990|volume=243|issue=4|pages=378–382|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(90)91400-6|bibcode=1990PhLB..243..378V}}&lt;/ref&gt; is reviewed at length since all other dimensions and super-symmetric generalisations are simple modifications of this basic example. 
* the definition of the [[#Higher-Spin Algebra|higher-spin algebra]] is given since the higher-spin theory equations turns out to be the equations for two fields taking values in the higher-spin algebra;
* the specific star-product that the fields that enter Vasiliev's equations take values in is defined;
* part of the Vasiliev equations is related to an interesting deformation of the Harmonic oscillator, called [[#Deformed oscillators|deformed oscillators]], which is reviewed; 
* the [[#Unfolded Equations|unfolded approach]] is discussed, which is a slightly advanced form of writing the differential equations in the first order form;
* the [[#Vasiliev's Equations|Vasiliev equations]] are given;
* it is proved that the linearisation of Vasiliev's equations over anti-de Sitter space describes free massless higher-spin fields.

Three variations of Vasiliev's equations are known: four-dimensional,&lt;ref name=VasFour/&gt; three-dimensional&lt;ref name=VasThree&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VASILIEV|first1=M.A.|title=EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR d=3 MASSLESS FIELDS INTERACTING THROUGH CHERN–SIMONS HIGHER-SPIN GAUGE FIELDS|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|date=21 December 1992|volume=07|issue=39|pages=3689–3702|doi=10.1142/S0217732392003116|bibcode=1992MPLA....7.3689V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VasProk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prokushkin|first1=S.F.|last2=Vasiliev|first2=M.A.|title=Higher-spin gauge interactions for massive matter fields in 3D AdS space-time|journal=Nuclear Physics B|date=April 1999|volume=545|issue=1–3|pages=385–433|doi=10.1016/S0550-3213(98)00839-6|arxiv=hep-th/9806236|bibcode=1999NuPhB.545..385P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and d-dimensional.&lt;ref name=VasD&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasiliev|first1=M.A.|title=Nonlinear equations for symmetric massless higher spin fields in (A)dSd|journal=Physics Letters B|date=August 2003|volume=567|issue=1–2|pages=139–151|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(03)00872-4|arxiv=hep-th/0304049|bibcode=2003PhLB..567..139V}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ by mild details that are discussed below.


== Higher-spin algebras ==


Higher-spin algebras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasiliev|first1=M. A.|title=Extended Higher-Spin Superalgebras and Their Realizations in Terms of Quantum Operators|journal=Fortschritte der Physik/Progress of Physics|date=1988|volume=36|issue=1|pages=33–62|doi=10.1002/prop.2190360104|bibcode=1988ForPh..36...33V}}&lt;/ref&gt; are global symmetries of the higher-spin theory multiplet. The same time they can be defined as global symmetries of some [[Conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] (CFT), which underlies the kinematic part of the [[Higher-spin theory#Higher Spin AdS/CFT Correspondence|higher-spin AdS/CFT correspondence]], which is a particular case of the [[AdS/CFT correspondence|AdS/CFT]].  Another definition is that higher-spin algebras are quotients of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the anti-de Sitter algebra &lt;math&gt;so(d,2)&lt;/math&gt; by certain two-sided ideals. Some more complicated examples of higher-spin algebras exist, but all of them can be obtained by tensoring the simplest higher-spin algebras with matrix algebras and then imposing further constraints. Higher-spin algebras originate as [[associative algebra]]s and the Lie algebra can be constructed via the commutator.

In the case of the four-dimensional bosonic higher-spin theory the relevant higher-spin algebra is very simple thanks to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;so(3,2)\sim sp(4,\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt; and can be built upon [[Quantum harmonic oscillator#N-dimensional harmonic oscillator|two-dimensional quantum Harmonic oscillator]]. In the latter case two pairs of creation/annihilation operators &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_1,a^\dagger_1, a_2,a_2^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; are needed. These can be packed into the quartet 
&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat{Y}^A, A=1,...,4&lt;/math&gt; of operators obeying the canonical commutation relations
:&lt;math&gt;
[\hat{Y}^A,\hat{Y}^B]=2iC^{AB}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C^{AB}=-C^{BA}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;sp(4)&lt;/math&gt; invariant tensor, i.e. it is anti-symmetric. As is well known, the bilinears provide an oscillator realization of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;sp(4)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
T^{AB}=-\frac{i}4\{\hat{Y}^A,\hat{Y}^B\}\,, \qquad [T^{AB},T^{CD}]=T^{AD}C^{BC}+\text{3 more}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
The higher-spin algebra is defined as the algebra of all even functions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(\hat{Y}), f(\hat{Y})=f(-\hat{Y})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat{Y}^A&lt;/math&gt;. That the functions are even is in accordance with the bosonic content of the higher-spin theory as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat{Y}^A&lt;/math&gt; will be shown to be related to the Majorana spinors from the space-time point of view and even powers of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\hat{Y}^A&lt;/math&gt; correspond to tensors. It is an associative algebra and the product is conveniently realised by the [[Moyal product|Moyal star product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
(f\star g)(Y)=f(Y)\exp i\left({\frac{\overleftarrow{\partial}}{\partial Y^A} C^{AB} \frac{\overrightarrow{\partial}}{\partial Y^B }}\right)g(Y)\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
with the meaning that the algebra of operators &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(\hat{Y})&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with the algebra of function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(Y)&lt;/math&gt; in ordinary commuting variables &lt;math display="inline"&gt;{Y}^A&lt;/math&gt; (hats off) and the product needs to be replaced with the non-commutative star-product. For example, one finds
:&lt;math&gt;
(Y^A \star g)(Y)=(Y^A+iC^{AB}\partial_B)g(Y)\,, \qquad (f \star Y^B)(Y)=(Y^B-iC^{BA}\partial_B)f(Y)\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y^A\star Y^B-Y^B\star Y^A=[Y^A,Y^B]_\star=2iC^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; as it would be the case for the operators. Another representation of the same star-product is more useful in practice:
:&lt;math&gt;
(f\star g)(Y)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\int dU dV f(Y+U) g(Y+V) e^{iU_A V_BC^{AB}}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
The exponential formula can be derived by integrating by parts and dropping the boundary terms. The prefactor is chosen as to ensure &lt;math&gt;1\star 1=1&lt;/math&gt;. In the Lorentz-covariant base we can split &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A=\alpha,\dot{\alpha};\alpha=1,2;\dot{\alpha}=1,2&lt;/math&gt; and we also split &lt;math&gt;Y^A=y^\alpha,y^{\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the Lorentz generators are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;L^{\alpha\beta}=T^{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bar{L}^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}=T^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; and the translation generators are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;P^{\alpha\dot{\beta}}=T^{{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-automorphism can be realized in two equivalent ways: either as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pi(y^\alpha)=-y^\alpha, \pi(y^{\dot{\alpha}})=y^{\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pi(y^\alpha)=Y^\alpha, \pi(y^{\dot{\alpha}})=-y^{\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;. In both the cases it leaves the Lorentz generators untouched and flips the sign of translations.

The higher-spin algebra constructed above can be shown to be the symmetry algebra of the three-dimensional [[Klein–Gordon equation|Klein-Gordon equation]] &lt;math&gt;\square_3 \phi(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Considering more general free CFT's, e.g. a number of scalars plus a number of fermions, the Maxwell field and other, one can construct more examples of higher-spin algebras.

== Vasiliev star-product ==


The Vasiliev equations are equations in certain bigger space endowed with auxiliary directions to be solved for. The additional directions are given by the doubles of  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;{Y}^A&lt;/math&gt;, called &lt;math display="inline"&gt;{Z}^A&lt;/math&gt;,
which are furthermore entangled with Y. The star-product on the algebra of functions in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f(Y,Z)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;{Y}, Z&lt;/math&gt;-variables is
:&lt;math&gt;F(Y,Z)\star G(Y,Z) =\frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\int dU\, dV\, F(Y+U,Z+U) G(Y+V,Z-V)\exp{[i U_A V_B C^{AB}]}\,. &lt;/math&gt;
The integral formula here-above is a particular star-product that corresponds to the Weyl ordering among Y's and among Z's, with the opposite signs for the commutator:
:&lt;math&gt;
[Y^A,Y^B]=2iC^{AB}\,, \qquad\qquad [Z^A,Z^B]=-2i C^{AB} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, the Y-Z star product is normal ordered with respect to Y-Z and Y+Z as is seen from 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}F(a,a^\dagger)\star G(a,a^\dagger) &amp;=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^4}\int dU\, dV\, F(a+2U,a^\dagger) G(a,a^\dagger+2V)\exp{[i U_A V_B C^{AB}]} \,,
&amp;\quad a=Y+Z\,, a^\dagger =Y-Z\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The higher-spin algebra is an associative subalgebra in the extended algebra. In accordance with the bosonic projection is given by &lt;math&gt;f(Y,Z)=f(-Y,-Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Deformed oscillators ==


The essential part of the Vasiliev equations relies on an interesting deformation of the [[Quantum harmonic oscillator]], known as deformed oscillators. First of all, let us pack the usual creation and annihilation operators &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a^\dagger, a&lt;/math&gt; in a doublet &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_\alpha\,,\alpha=1,2&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical commutation relations (the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2i&lt;/math&gt;-factors are introduced to facilitate comparison with Vasiliev's equations)
:&lt;math&gt;\left[q_\alpha,q_\beta\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}\,, \qquad \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;1 \\-1 &amp;0\end{bmatrix}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to prove that the bilinears in &lt;math&gt;q_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; form &lt;math&gt;sp(2)\sim sl(2)&lt;/math&gt; generators
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T_{\alpha\beta}&amp;=\frac{i}{4}\{q_\alpha,q_\beta\}\,, \\
\left[T_{\alpha\beta},q_\gamma\right]&amp;= q_\alpha \epsilon_{\beta\gamma}+q_\beta \epsilon_{\alpha\gamma} \,,\\
\left[T_{\alpha\beta},T_{\gamma\delta}\right]&amp;=T_{\alpha\delta}\epsilon_{\beta\gamma}+T_{\beta\delta}\epsilon_{\alpha\gamma}+T_{\alpha\gamma}\epsilon_{\beta\delta}+T_{\beta\gamma}\epsilon_{\alpha\delta}\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; rotates &lt;math&gt;q_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as an &lt;math&gt;sp(2)&lt;/math&gt;-vector with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; playing the role of the &lt;math&gt;sp(2)&lt;/math&gt;-invariant metric. The deformed oscillators are defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VASILIEV|first1=M.A.|title=HIGHER SPIN ALGEBRAS AND QUANTIZATION ON THE SPHERE AND HYPERBOLOID|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|date=20 March 1991|volume=06|issue=07|pages=1115–1135|doi=10.1142/S0217751X91000605|bibcode=1991IJMPA...6.1115V}}&lt;/ref&gt; by appending the set of generators with an additional generating element &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and postulating
:&lt;math&gt;
\{q_\alpha, Q\}=0\,,  \qquad \left[q_\alpha,q_\beta\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}(1+Q)\,.
&lt;/math&gt;
Again, one can see that &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, as defined above, form &lt;math&gt;sp(2)&lt;/math&gt;-generators and rotate properly &lt;math&gt;q_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. At &lt;math&gt;Q=0&lt;/math&gt; we get back to the undeformed oscillators. In fact, &lt;math&gt;q_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; form the generators of the [[Lie superalgebra]] &lt;math&gt;osp(1|2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; should be viewed as odd generators. Then, &lt;math&gt;\{q_\alpha,q_\beta\}=-4iT_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the part of the defining relations of &lt;math&gt;osp(1|2)&lt;/math&gt;.
One (or two) copies of the deformed oscillator relations form a part of the Vasiliev equations where the generators are replaced with fields and the commutation relations are imposed as field equations.

== Unfolded equations ==


The equations for higher-spin fields originate from the Vasiliev equations in the unfolded form.
Any set of differential equations can be put in the first order form by introducing auxiliary fields to denote derivatives. Unfolded approach&lt;ref name=Unfolding&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasiliev|first1=M.A|title=Consistent equations for interacting massless fields of all spins in the first order in curvatures|journal=Annals of Physics|date=February 1989|volume=190|issue=1|pages=59–106|doi=10.1016/0003-4916(89)90261-3|bibcode=1989AnPhy.190...59V}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an advanced reformulation of this idea that takes into account gauge symmetries and diffeomorphisms. Instead of just &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\partial_\mu \phi^i(x)=f_\mu^i(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; the unfolded equations are written in the language of differential forms as
:&lt;math&gt; d W^A =F^A(W)\,, &lt;/math&gt;
where the variables are [[differential form]]s &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^A=W^A_{\mu_1...\mu_q}(x)\,dx^{\mu_1}\wedge...\wedge dx^{\mu_q}&lt;/math&gt; of various degrees, enumerated by an abstract index &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior derivative]]  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d=dx^\mu\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The structure function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F^A(W)&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be expandable in exterior product Taylor series as
:&lt;math&gt;F^A(W)=\sum_{q_1+...+q_n=q+1} F^A_{B_1...B_n} W^{B_1}\wedge ...\wedge W^{B_n}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^A&lt;/math&gt; has form degree &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and the sum is over all forms whose form degrees add up to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q+1&lt;/math&gt;. The simplest example of unfolded equations are the zero curvature equations &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d\omega=\tfrac12[\omega,\omega]&lt;/math&gt; for a one-form connection &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of any Lie algebra &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; runs over the base of the Lie algebra, and the structure function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;F^A(\omega)=f^A_{BC}\,\omega^A\wedge \omega^B&lt;/math&gt; encodes the structure constants of the Lie algebra.

Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;dd\equiv0&lt;/math&gt; the consistency of the unfolded equations requires 
:&lt;math&gt;0\equiv ddW^A=dF^A(W)=dW^B\frac{\partial}{\partial W^B}F^A(W)=F^B\frac{\partial}{\partial W^B}F^A(W) \qquad \longleftrightarrow\qquad F^B\frac{\partial}{\partial W^B}F^A(W)=0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[Frobenius theorem (differential topology)|Frobenius integrability condition]]. In the case of the zero curvature equation this is just the Jacobi identity. Once the system is integrable it can be shown to have certain gauge symmetries. Every field &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^A&lt;/math&gt; that is a form of non-zero degree &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; possesses a gauge parameter &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\xi^A&lt;/math&gt; that is a form of degree &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q-1&lt;/math&gt; and the gauge transformations are
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W^A=d\xi^A+\xi^B\frac{\partial }{\partial W^B}F^A(W)&lt;/math&gt;

The Vasiliev equations generate the unfolded equations for a specific field content, which consists of a one-form &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and a zero-form &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, both taking values in the [[#Higher-Spin Algebra|higher-spin algebra]]. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;W^A=(\omega,C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega=\omega_\mu(Y|x)dx^\mu, \omega(Y|x)=\omega(-Y|x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C=C(Y|x), C(Y|x)=C(-Y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. The unfolded equations that describe interactions of higher-spin fields are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
d\omega&amp;=\omega \star \omega +\mathcal{V}(\omega,\omega,C)+\mathcal{V}(\omega,\omega,C,C)+...\,,\\
dC&amp;=\omega\star C-C\star \pi(\omega)+\mathcal{V}(\omega,C,C)+...\,,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathcal{V}(\omega,...,C)&lt;/math&gt; are the interaction vertices that are of higher and higher order in the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-field. The product in the higher-spin algebra is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;. The explicit form of the vertices can be extracted from the Vasiliev equations. The vertices that are bilinear in the fields are determined by the higher-spin algebra. [[Automorphism]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the automorphism of the [[Anti-de Sitter space|anti-de Sitter]] algebra that flips the sign of translations, see below.
If we truncate away higher orders in the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-expansion, the equations are just the zero-curvature condition for a connection &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; of the higher-spin algebra and the covariant constancy equation for a zero-form &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; that takes values in the twisted-adjoint representation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greub|first1=Werner|title=Multilinear Algebra|date=1978|publisher=Springer US|location=New York, NY|isbn=1461394252|page=263|edition=2nd edition.|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=0Tz0BwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;ots=LvEcgFJ9lW&amp;dq=twisted%20adjoint%20representation&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q=twisted%20adjoint%20representation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; (twist is by the automorphism &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).

== Field content ==


The field content of the Vasiliev equations is given by three fields all taking values in the extended algebra of functions in Y and Z: 
* gauge connection &lt;math&gt;W=W_\mu(Y,Z|x)\, dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt;, whose value at Z=0 gives the connection of the higher-spin algebra &lt;math&gt;\omega=\omega_\mu(Y|x)\, dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt;. The bosonic projection implies &lt;math&gt;W(Y,Z|x)=W(-Y,-Z|x)&lt;/math&gt;;
* zero-form &lt;math&gt;B=B(Y,Z|x)&lt;/math&gt;, whose value at Z=0 gives the zero-form of the higher-spin algebra &lt;math&gt;C=C(Y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. The bosonic projection implies &lt;math&gt;B(Y,Z|x)=B(-Y,-Z|x)&lt;/math&gt;;
* an auxiliary field &lt;math&gt;S=S_A(Y,Z|x)\, dZ^A&lt;/math&gt;, where it is sometimes useful to view it as a one-form in the auxiliary Z-space, hence the differentials: &lt;math&gt;dZ^A\wedge dZ^B=-dZ^B\wedge dZ^A\,.&lt;/math&gt; 
:This field can be eliminated when solving for the Z-dependence. The bosonic projection for the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-field is &lt;math&gt;S_A(Y,Z|x)=-S_A(-Y,-Z|x)&lt;/math&gt; due to the additional index &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that is eventually carried by Y,Z.

As to avoid any confusion caused by the differential forms in the auxiliary Z-space and to reveal the relation to the [[#Deformed oscillators|deformed oscillators]] the Vasiliev equations are written below in the component form. 
The Vasiliev equations can be split into two parts. The first part contains only zero-curvature or covariant constancy equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
dW&amp;=W\star W\,,\\
dB&amp;=W\star B- B\star \pi(W)\,,\\
dS_A&amp;=W\star S_A-S_A\star W\,,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the higher-spin algebra automorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is extended to the full algebra as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\pi(W)(y_\alpha,y_{\dot{\alpha}},z_\alpha,z_{\dot{\alpha}})&amp;={W}(-y_\alpha,y_{\dot{\alpha}},-z_\alpha,z_{\dot{\alpha}})={W}(y_\alpha,-y_{\dot{\alpha}},z_\alpha,-z_{\dot{\alpha}})\,, 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
the latter two forms being equivalent because of the bosonic projection imposed on &lt;math&gt;W(Y,Z|X)&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the first part of the equations implies that there is no nontrivial curvature in the x-space since &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is flat. The second part makes the system nontrivial and determines the curvature of the auxiliary connection &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left[ S_A,S_B\right]_\star&amp;=-2i\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{\alpha\beta} (1+B\star \varkappa) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}(1+B\star \bar{\varkappa})
\end{bmatrix}\,,\\
\{B\star \varkappa, S_\alpha\}_\star&amp;=0\,, \\
\{B\star \bar{\varkappa}, S_{\dot{\alpha}}\}_\star&amp;=0\,,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where two Klein operators were introduced
:&lt;math&gt;\varkappa=\exp{i y_\alpha z^\alpha}\,, \qquad \bar{\varkappa}=\exp{i y_{\dot{\alpha}} z^{\dot{\alpha}}}&lt;/math&gt;
The existence of the Klein operators is of utter importance for the system. They realise the  &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; automorphism as an inner one 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\varkappa\star f(y_\alpha,y_{\dot{\alpha}},z_\alpha,z_{\dot{\alpha}})\star \varkappa&amp;= f(-y_\alpha,y_{\dot{\alpha}},-z_\alpha,z_{\dot{\alpha}})\,, \qquad &amp;&amp; \varkappa\star \varkappa=1\,,\\
\bar{\varkappa}\star f(y_\alpha,y_{\dot{\alpha}},z_\alpha,z_{\dot{\alpha}})\star \bar{\varkappa}&amp;= f(y_\alpha,-y_{\dot{\alpha}},z_\alpha,-z_{\dot{\alpha}})\,, \qquad &amp;&amp; \bar{\varkappa}\star \bar{\varkappa}=1\,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, the Klein operator &lt;math&gt;\varkappa&lt;/math&gt; behave as &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{N_y+N_z}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. it anti-commutes to odd functions and commute to even functions in y,z.

These 3+2 equations are the Vasiliev equations&lt;ref name=VasFour/&gt; for the four-dimensional bosonic higher-spin theory. Several comments are in order.
* The algebraic part of the system when split into components &lt;math&gt;A=\alpha,\dot{\alpha}; \alpha=1,2; \dot{\alpha}=1,2&lt;/math&gt; in accordance with the choice of the &lt;math&gt;sp(4)&lt;/math&gt;-metric
:&lt;math&gt;C_{AB}=\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{\alpha\beta} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:becomes equivalent to two copies of the mutually commuting deformed oscillators:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\left[S_{{\alpha}},S_{{\beta}}\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\alpha\beta} (1+B\star \varkappa) &amp; \left[S_{{\alpha}},S_{\dot{\beta}}\right] =0 &amp; \{B\star \varkappa, S_\alpha\}_\star=0\\
\left[S_{\dot{\alpha}},S_{{\beta}}\right]=0 &amp; \left[S_{\dot{\alpha}},S_{\dot{\beta}}\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}(1+B\star \bar{\varkappa}) &amp; \{B\star \bar{\varkappa}, S_{\dot{\alpha}}\}_\star=0
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
:Therefore, the last two equations are equivalent to the definition relations of two copies of &lt;math&gt;osp(1|2)&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;S_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; playing the role of the odd generators and with &lt;math&gt;B\star \varkappa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\star \bar{\varkappa}&lt;/math&gt; playing the role of the deformations. Since &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the same for the two copies, they are not independent, which does not spoil the consistency.
* The system is consistent. The consistency of the first three equations is obvious since they are zero-curvature/covariant-constancy equations. The consistency of the last two equations is thanks to the deformed oscillators. The mutual consistency of the two parts of the equations is thanks to fact that the twisted covariant constancy of the &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;-field is equivalent to the usual covariant constancy of either &lt;math&gt;B\star \varkappa&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\star \bar{\varkappa}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, 
:&lt;math&gt;d (B\star \varkappa)-[W,(B\star \varkappa)]=(dB-W\star B+B\star \varkappa \star W \star \varkappa)\star \varkappa=(dB-W\star B+ B\star \pi(W))\star \varkappa=0&lt;/math&gt;
:where we used &lt;math&gt;\varkappa\star \varkappa=1&lt;/math&gt; and its relation to the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-automorphism. Then, &lt;math&gt;\varkappa&lt;/math&gt; can be cancelled since it is invertible;
* The equations are gauge invariant. The gauge symmetry transformations with &lt;math&gt;\xi=\xi(Y,Z|x)&lt;/math&gt; are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\delta W&amp;= d\xi-[W,\xi]_\star\\
\delta B&amp;=\xi\star B-B\star \pi(\xi)\\
\delta S_A&amp;=\xi\star S_A-S_A\star \pi(\xi)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* The equations are background independent and some vacuum needs to be specified in order to give an interpretation of the linearized solution
* The simplest exact solution is the empty anti-de Sitter space:
:&lt;math&gt;
W=\Omega=\frac12 \varpi^{\alpha\alpha}L_{\alpha\alpha}+ h^{\alpha\dot{\alpha}} P_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}+\frac12 \varpi^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\alpha}}\bar{L}_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\alpha}}\,, \qquad B=0\,, \qquad S_A=Z_A\,,
&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a flat connection &lt;math&gt;d\Omega=\Omega\star \Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the anti-de Sitter algebra and the components along the Lorentz and translations generators correspond to spin-connection &lt;math&gt;\varpi^{\alpha\alpha}, \varpi^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; and vierbein &lt;math&gt; h^{{\alpha}\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. It is important that the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-field has a nontrivial vacuum value, which is a solution due to &lt;math&gt;[Z_A,Z_B]_\star=-2iC_{AB}&lt;/math&gt; and the fact that &lt;math&gt;B=0&lt;/math&gt;.
* The Vasiliev equations linearized over the anti-de Sitter vacuum do describe all free massless fields of spin s=0,1,2,3,..., which requries some computation and is shown below.

== Linearization ==


To prove that the linearized Vasiliev equations do describe free massless higher-spin fields we need to consider the linearised fluctuations over the anti-de Sitter vacuum. First of all we take the exact solution where &lt;math&gt;W=\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a flat connection of the anti-de Sitter algebra, &lt;math&gt;B=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_A=Z_A&lt;/math&gt; and add fluctuations  
:&lt;math&gt;W=\Omega + w\,, \qquad B=0+2ib\,, \qquad S_A=Z_A+2is_A\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Then, we linearize the Vasiliev equations 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
dw-\Omega\star w-w\star\Omega&amp;=0\,,\\
db-\Omega\star b+b\star \pi(\Omega)&amp;=0\,,\\
ds_A-\Omega\star s_A+s_A\star \Omega&amp;= \partial_A w\,,\\
\partial_A b&amp;=0\,,\\
\partial_\alpha s_\beta-\partial_\beta s_\alpha &amp;=\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}b\star \varkappa\,,\\
\partial_{\dot{\alpha}} s_{\dot{\beta}}-\partial_{\dot{\beta}} s_{\dot{\alpha}} &amp;=\epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}b\star \bar{\varkappa}\,,\\
\partial_\alpha s_{\dot{\beta}}-\partial_{\dot{\beta}}s_\alpha&amp;=0 \,,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Above it was used several times that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;[Z^A, f(Z)]_\star=-2i\partial_A f(Z), \partial_A\equiv\frac{\partial}{\partial Z^A}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the vacuum value of the S-field acts as the derivative under the commutator. It is convenient to split the four-component Y,Z into two-component variables as &lt;math&gt;Y^A=(y^\alpha,y^{\dot{\alpha}}), Z^A=(z^\alpha,z^{\dot{\alpha}})&lt;/math&gt;. Another trick that was used in the fourth equation is the invertibility of the Klein operators: 
:&lt;math&gt;\{b\star \varkappa, z_\alpha\}=b\star \varkappa\star z_\alpha+z_\alpha\star b\star \varkappa=
(b\star \varkappa\star z_\alpha\star\varkappa+z_\alpha\star b)\star \varkappa=[z_\alpha,b]\star\varkappa\,.&lt;/math&gt;
The fifth of the Vasiliev equations is now split into the last three equation above.

The analysis of the linearized fluctuations is in solving the equations one by one in the right order. Recall that one expects to find unfolded equations for two fields: one-form &lt;math&gt;\omega=\omega_\mu(Y|x)dx^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and zero-form &lt;math&gt;C=C(Y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. From the fourth equation it follows that  
&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the auxiliary Z-direction. Therefore, one can identify &lt;math&gt;b=C(Y|x)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The second equation then immediately leads to 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla C +ih^{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}\left(y_\alpha y_{\dot{\alpha}}-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^\alpha\partial y^{\dot{\alpha}}}\right)C=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the Lorentz covariant derivative
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla=d-\varpi^{\alpha\beta}\left(y_\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial y^\beta}+y_\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial y^\alpha}\right)-...&lt;/math&gt;
where ... denote the term with &lt;math&gt;\varpi^{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; that is similar to the first one. The Lorentz covariant derivative comes from the usual commutator action of the spin-connection part of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The term with the vierbein results from the &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-automorphism that flips the sign of the AdS-translations and produces anti-commutator &lt;math&gt;h^{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}\left\{P_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}},\bullet\right\}_\star&lt;/math&gt;.

To read off the content of the C-equation one needs to expand it in Y and analyze the C-equation component-wise
:&lt;math&gt;C=\sum_{k+m= \text{even}}C_{\alpha_1...\alpha_k,\dot{\alpha}_1...\dot{\alpha}_m}(X)\,y^{\alpha_1}...y^{\alpha_k}\,y^{\dot{\alpha}_1}...y^{\dot{\alpha}_m}&lt;/math&gt;
Then various components can be seen to have the following interpretation:
* The very first component &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar field. The one next to it, &lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed by virtue of the C-equation as the derivative of the scalar. One of the component equations imposes the Klein-Gordon equation &lt;math&gt;(\square -2)C(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where the cosmological constant is set to one. The components with equal number of dotted and undotted indices are expressed as on-shell derivatives of the scalar
:&lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha_1...\alpha_k,\dot{\alpha}_1...\dot{\alpha}_k}(x)\,h^{\alpha_1\dot{\alpha}_1}_{\mu_1}...h^{\alpha_k\dot{\alpha}_k}_{\mu_k}\sim \nabla_{\mu_1}...\nabla_{\mu_k}C(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha\beta}, C_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}&lt;/math&gt; are the self-dual and anti self-dual components of the [[Electromagnetic tensor|Maxwell tensor]] &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The C-equation imposes the Maxwell equations. The components with k+2=m and k=m+2 are on-shell derivatives of the Maxwell tensor; 
* &lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}, C_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}\dot{\gamma}\dot{\delta}}&lt;/math&gt; are the self-dual and anti self-dual components of the [[Weyl tensor]] &lt;math&gt;C_{\mu\nu,\lambda\rho}&lt;/math&gt;. The C-equation imposes the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The components with k+4=m and k=m+4 are on-shell derivatives of the Weyl tensor; 
* &lt;math&gt;C_{\alpha_1...\alpha_{2s}}, C_{\dot{\alpha}_1...\dot{\alpha}_{2s}}&lt;/math&gt; are the self-dual and anti self-dual components of the higher-spin generalization of the Weyl tensor. The C-equation imposes the Bianchi identities and the components with k+2s=m and k=m+2s are on-shell derivatives of the higher-spin Weyl tensor;

The last three equations can be recognized to be the equations of the form &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mu=\nu, \mathrm{d}\nu=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the exterior derivative on the space of differential forms in the Z-space. Such equations can be solved with the help of the [[Closed and exact differential forms|Poincare Lemma]]. In addition one needs to know how to multiply by the Klein operator from the right, which is easy to derive from the integral formula for the star-product:
:&lt;math&gt;f(y_\alpha,z_\beta)\star \varkappa=f(-z_\alpha,-y_\beta)\varkappa\,.&lt;/math&gt;
I.e. the result is to exchange the half of the Y and Z variables and to flip the sign. The solution to the last three equations can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;s_\alpha= z_\alpha \int_0^1 t\,dt\, C(-zt,\bar{y})e^{ity^\alpha z_\alpha}+\partial_\alpha \epsilon\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where a similar formula exists for &lt;math&gt;s_{\dot{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Here the last term is the gauge ambiguity, i.e. the freedom to add exact forms in the Z-space, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon=\epsilon(Y,Z|x)&lt;/math&gt;.
One can gauge fix it to have &lt;math&gt;\partial_\alpha\epsilon=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, one plugs the solution to the third equation, which of the same type, i.e. a differential equation of the first order in the Z-space. Its general solution is again given by the Poincare Lemma
:&lt;math&gt;w=\omega+Z^A\int_0^1dt\, f_A(zt)\,,\qquad f_A=dS_A-[\Omega,S_A]_\star\,,&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\omega=\omega(Y|x)&lt;/math&gt; is the integration constant in the Z-space, i.e. the [[De Rham cohomology|de-Rham cohomology]]. It is this integration constant that is to be identified with the one-form &lt;math&gt;\omega(Y|x)&lt;/math&gt; as the name suggests. After some algebra one finds
:&lt;math&gt;w=\omega+\int_0^1dt(1-t)\left(t\varpi^{\alpha\beta}z_\alpha z_\beta-ih^{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}z_\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\dot{\alpha}}}\right)C(-z_\gamma t,y_{\dot{\gamma}})e^{ity^\delta z_\delta}+...&lt;/math&gt; 
where we again dropped a term with dotted and undotted indices exchanged. The last step is to plug the solution into the first equation to find
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \omega -h^{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}\left(y_\alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\dot{\alpha}}}+y_{\dot{\alpha}}\frac{\partial}{\partial y^\alpha}\right)\omega=-\frac{1}{2} h_\gamma{}^{\dot{\alpha}}\wedge h^{\gamma\dot{\beta}}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^{\dot{\alpha}} \partial y^{\dot{\beta}}}C(0,y_{\dot{\delta}})+...&lt;/math&gt;
and again the second term on the right is omitted. It is important that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is not a flat connection, while &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a flat connection. To analyze the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-equations it is useful to expand &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in Y
:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\sum_{k+m= \text{even}}\omega_{\alpha_1...\alpha_k,\dot{\alpha}_1...\dot{\alpha}_m}(X)\,y^{\alpha_1}...y^{\alpha_k}\,y^{\dot{\alpha}_1}...y^{\dot{\alpha}_m}&lt;/math&gt;
The content of the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-equation is as follows:
* The diagonal components with k=m are the higher-spin vierbeins, whose totally-symmetric component can be identified with the [[Higher-Spin gauge theory#Fronsdal Fields|Fronsdal field]] as
:&lt;math&gt;h_{\mu_1}^{\alpha_1\dot{\alpha}_1}... h_{\mu_{s-1}}^{\alpha_{s-1}\dot{\alpha}_{s-1}}\,\omega_{\mu_s|\alpha_1...\alpha_{s-1},\dot{\alpha}_1...\dot{\alpha}_{s-1}}\sim \Phi_{\mu_1...\mu_s}&lt;/math&gt;
:where the symmetrization on the left is implied;
* The &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-equation can be shown to impose the Fronsdal equations for s=2,3,4,... . The Maxwell equations and the Klein-Gordon equations for the s=1 and s=0 components of the multiplet are in the C-equation;
* Other components are expressed as on-shell derivatives of the Fronsdal field;
* The order-s derivative of the Fronsdal field with the symmetry of the higher-spin Weyl tensor determines the corresponding component of the C-field via the right-hand side of the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;-equation.

To conclude, anti-de Sitter space is an exact solution of the Vasiliev equations and upon linearization over it one finds unfolded equations that are equivalent to the Fronsdal equations for fields with s=0,1,2,3,... .

== Other dimensions, extensions, and generalisations ==


* there is an important option to introduce a free parameter in the four-dimensional equations, which is related to the parity breaking. The only modifications needed are
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ll}
\left[S_{{\alpha}},S_{{\beta}}\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\alpha\beta} (1+e^{i\theta}B\star \varkappa) &amp; \left[S_{\dot{\alpha}},S_{\dot{\beta}}\right]=-2i\epsilon_{\dot{\alpha}\dot{\beta}}(1+e^{-i\theta} B\star \bar{\varkappa})
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
:This free parameter plays in important role in the [[Higher-spin theory#Higher Spin AdS/CFT Correspondence|higher-spin AdS/CFT correspondence]]. The theory at &lt;math&gt;\theta=0,\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; is parity invariant;
:One can also take &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to be any even function &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)=\theta(-x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;B\star \varkappa&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation above and of &lt;math&gt;B\star \bar{\varkappa}&lt;/math&gt; in the second one, which does not destroy the consistency of the equations.

There also exist Vasiliev's equations in other dimensions:
* in three dimensions there is the minimal higher-spin theory&lt;ref name=VasThree/&gt; and its development, known as Prokushkin-Vasiliev theory,&lt;ref name=VasProk/&gt; that is based on a one-parameter family of higher-spin algebras (usually the family is denoted as &lt;math&gt;hs(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;) and also allows for super-symmetric extensions;
* there exist Vasiliev equations that operate in any space-time dimension.&lt;ref name=VasD/&gt; The spectrum of the theory consists of all the fields with integer (or even only) spins. 
The equations are very similar to the four-dimensional ones, but there are some important modifications in the definition of the algebra that the fields take values in and there are further constraints in the d-dimensional case.


== Discrepancies between Vasiliev equations and Higher Spin Theories ==
There is a number of flaws/features of the Vasiliev equations that have been revealed over the last years. First of all, classical equations of motion, e.g. the Vasiliev equations, do not allow one to address the problems that require an action, the most basic one being quantization. Secondly, there are discrepancies between the results obtained from the Vasiliev equations and those from the other formulations of higher spin theories, from the [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] or from general field theory perspective. Most of the discrepancies can be attributed to the assumptions used in the derivation of the equations: gauge invariance is manifest, but locality was not properly imposed and the Vasiliev equations are a solution of a certain formal deformation problem. Practically speaking, it is not known in general how to extract the interaction vertices of the higher spin theory out of the equations.

Most of the studies concern with the four-dimensional Vasiliev equations. 
The correction to the free spin-2 equations due to the scalar field stress-tensor was extracted out of the four-dimensional Vasiliev equations and found to be&lt;ref name=Krist&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristiansson|first=Fredric|last2=Rajan|first2=Peter|date=2003|title=Scalar field corrections to AdS 4 gravity from higher spin gauge theory|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1126-6708/2003/i=04/a=009|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|language=en|volume=2003|issue=04|pages=009|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2003/04/009|issn=1126-6708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nabla_{\rho(k)}\phi = '\nabla_{\rho_1}...\nabla_{\rho_k}\phi +\text{symmetrization}-\text{traces}'&lt;/math&gt; are symmetrized derivatives with traces subtracted. The most important information is in the coefficients &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\xi_k, \eta_k, \zeta_k&lt;/math&gt; and in the prefactor &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Re(b_1^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;b_1=\exp[i\theta]&lt;/math&gt; is a free parameter that the equations have, see [[Vasiliev equations#Other dimensions, extensions, and generalisations|Other dimensions, extensions, and generalisations]]. It is important to note that the usual stress-tensor has no more than two derivative and the terms &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; are not independent (for example, they contribute to the same &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\langle T_{ab} j_0j_0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; AdS/CFT three-point function). This is a general property of field theories that one can perform nonlinear (and also higher derivative) field redefinitions and therefore there exist infinitely many ways to write the same interaction vertex at the classical level. The canonical stress-tensor has two derivatives and the terms with contracted derivatives can be related to it via such redefinitions.

A surprising fact that had been noticed&lt;ref name=Krist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sezgin |first1=Ergin |last2=Sundell |first2=Pear |title=Holography in 4D (super) higher spin theories and a test via cubic scalar couplings |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |date=19 July 2005 |volume=2005 |issue=07 |pages=044–044 |doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2005/07/044}}&lt;/ref&gt; before its inconsistency with the AdS/CFT was realized is that the stress-tensor can change sign and, in particular, vanishes for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\theta=\pi/4&lt;/math&gt;. This would imply that the corresponding correlation function in the Chern-Simons matter theories vanishes, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\langle T_{ab} j_0j_0\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is not the case. 

The most important and detailed tests were performed much later. It was first shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giombi |first1=Simone |last2=Yin |first2=Xi |title=Higher spin gauge theory and holography: the three-point functions |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |date=30 September 2010 |volume=2010 |issue=9 |doi=10.1007/JHEP09(2010)115}}&lt;/ref&gt; that some of the three-point AdS/CFT functions, as obtained from the Vasiliev equations, turn out to be infinite or inconsistent with AdS/CFT, while some other do agree. Those that agree, in the language of [[Vasiliev equations#Unfolded equations|Unfolded equations]] correspond to &lt;math&gt;\omega\star C-C\star \pi(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and the infinities/inconsistencies resulted from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{V}(\omega,C,C)&lt;/math&gt;. The terms of the first type are local and are fixed by the higher spin algebra. The terms of the second type can be non-local (when solved perturbatively the master field &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a generating functions of infinitely many derivatives of higher spin fields). These non-localities are not present in higher spin theories as can be seen from the explicit cubic action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sleight |first1=Charlotte |last2=Taronna |first2=Massimo |title=Higher Spin Interactions from Conformal Field Theory: The Complete Cubic Couplings |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=2 May 2016 |volume=116 |issue=18 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.181602}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Further infinities, non-localities or missing structures were observed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giombi |first1=Simone |last2=Yin |first2=Xi |title=Higher spins in AdS and twistorial holography |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |date=18 April 2011 |volume=2011 |issue=4 |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2011)086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giombi |first1=Simone |last2=Yin |first2=Xi |title=Higher spin gauge theory and the critical model |journal=Physical Review D |date=18 April 2012 |volume=85 |issue=8 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.086005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giombi |first1=Simone |last2=Minwalla |first2=Shiraz |last3=Prakash |first3=Shiroman |last4=Trivedi |first4=Sandip P. |last5=Wadia |first5=Spenta R. |last6=Yin |first6=Xi |title=Chern–Simons theory with vector fermion matter |journal=The European Physical Journal C |date=25 August 2012 |volume=72 |issue=8 |doi=10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2112-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giombi |first1=Simone |last2=Yin |first2=Xi |title=The higher spin/vector model duality |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |date=31 May 2013 |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=214003 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/46/21/214003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Chi-Ming |last2=Minwalla |first2=Shiraz |last3=Sharma |first3=Tarun |last4=Yin |first4=Xi |title=ABJ triality: from higher spin fields to strings |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |date=31 May 2013 |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=214009 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/46/21/214009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these tests explore the extension of the [[Higher-spin theory#Klebanov-Polyakov Conjecture|Klebanov-Polyakov Conjecture]] to Chern-Simons matter theories where the structure of correlation functions is more intricate and certain parity-odd terms are present. Some of these structures were not reproduced by the Vasiliev equations. General analysis of the Vasiliev equations at the second order&lt;ref name=Bref/&gt; showed that for any three fixed spins the interaction term is an infinite series in derivatives (similar to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-sum above); all of the terms in the series contribute to the same AdS/CFT three-point function and the contribution is infinite. All the problems can be attributed to the assumptions used in the derivation of the Vasiliev equations: restrictions on the number of derivatives in the interaction vertices or, more generally, locality was not imposed, which is important for getting meaningful interaction vertices, see e.g. [[Higher-spin theory#Noether Procedure|Noether Procedure]]. The problem how to impose locality and extract interaction vertices out of the equations is now under active investigation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasiliev |first1=M.A. |title=Current interactions and holography from the 0-form sector of nonlinear higher-spin equations |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |date=17 October 2017 |volume=2017 |issue=10 |doi=10.1007/JHEP10(2017)111}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As is briefly mentioned in [[Vasiliev equations#Other dimensions, extensions, and generalisations|Other dimensions, extensions, and generalisations]] there is an option to introduce infinitely many additional coupling constants that enter via phase factor &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)=\theta_0 +\theta_2 x^2+...&lt;/math&gt;. As was noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maldacena |first1=Juan |last2=Zhiboedov |first2=Alexander |title=Constraining conformal field theories with a slightly broken higher spin symmetry |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |date=21 May 2013 |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=104003 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/30/10/104003}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the second such coefficient &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; will affect five-point AdS/CFT correlation functions, but not the three-point ones, which seems to be in tension with the results obtained directly from imposing higher spin symmetry on the correlation functions. Later, it was shown&lt;ref name=Bref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boulanger |first1=Nicolas |last2=Kessel |first2=Pan |last3=Skvortsov |first3=Evgeny |last4=Taronna |first4=Massimo |title=Higher spin interactions in four-dimensions: Vasiliev versus Fronsdal |journal=Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical |date=4 March 2016 |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=095402 |doi=10.1088/1751-8113/49/9/095402}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the terms in the equations that result from  
&lt;math&gt;\theta_{2,4,...}&lt;/math&gt; are too non-local and lead to an infinite result for the AdS/CFT correlation functions. 

In three dimensions the Prokushkin-Vasiliev equations, which are supposed to describe interactions of matter fields with higher spin fields in three dimensions, are also affected by the aforementioned locality problem. For example, the perturbative corrections at the second order to the stress-tensors of the matter fields lead to infinite correlation functions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvortsov |first1=Evgeny |last2=Taronna |first2=Massimo |title=On locality, holography and unfolding |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics |date=6 November 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=11 |doi=10.1007/JHEP11(2015)044}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is, however, another discrepancy: the spectrum of the Prokushkin-Vasiliev equations has, in addition to the matter fields (scalar and spinor) and higher spin fields, a set of unphysical fields that do not have any field theory interpretation, but interact with the physical fields.

== Exact solutions ==


Since the Vasiliev equations are quite complicated there are few exact solutions known
* as it was already shown, there is an important solution --- empty anti-de Sitter space, whose existence allows to interpret the linearized fluctuations as massless fields of all spins;
* in three dimensions to find anti-de Sitter space as an exact solution for all values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a nontrivial problem, but it is known;&lt;ref name=VasProk/&gt;
* there is a domain-wall type solution of the four-dimensional equations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=E.|last2=Sundell|first2=P.|title=An exact solution of 4D higher-spin gauge theory|journal=Nuclear Physics B|date=January 2007|volume=762|issue=1–2|pages=1–37|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2006.06.038|arxiv=hep-th/0508158|bibcode=2007NuPhB.762....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* there is a family of the solutions to the four-dimensional equations that are interpreted as black holes, although the metric transforms under the higher-spin transformations and for that reason it is difficult to rely on the usual definition of the horizon etc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Didenko|first1=V.E.|last2=Vasiliev|first2=M.A.|title=Static BPS black hole in 4d higher-spin gauge theory|journal=Physics Letters B|date=December 2009|volume=682|issue=3|pages=305–315|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.023|bibcode=2009PhLB..682..305D|arxiv=0906.3898}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iazeolla|first1=Carlo|last2=Sundell|first2=Per|title=Families of exact solutions to Vasiliev's 4D equations with spherical, cylindrical and biaxial symmetry|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|date=22 December 2011|volume=2011|issue=12|doi=10.1007/JHEP12(2011)084|arxiv=1107.1217|bibcode=2011JHEP...12..084I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourdier|first1=Jun|last2=Drukker|first2=Nadav|title=On classical solutions of 4d supersymmetric higher spin theory|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|date=20 April 2015|volume=2015|issue=4|doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2015)097|arxiv=1411.7037|bibcode=2015JHEP...04..097B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the case of three-dimensions there is a consistent truncation that decouples the scalar field from the higher-spin fields, the latter being described by the Chern–Simons theory. In this case any flat connection of the higher-spin algebra is an exact solution and there has been a lot of works on this subclass;
