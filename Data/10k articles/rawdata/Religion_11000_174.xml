[[File:40 Window world map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|The nations in the 10/40 Window]]
The '''10/40 Window''' is a term coined by [[mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]] strategist and Partners International CEO [[Luis Bush]] in 1990&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/ |title=The 10/40 Window |work=Time |date=June 30, 2003| accessdate= March 1, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234833/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101030630/map/| archivedate= April 28, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}.

At the time, the authoritative source for socioeconomic and political metrics for every nation. Extreme poverty was denoted as under US$500 per capita GNP (in 1990 dollars).

What is least controversial is those areas with least access throughout history, as all metrics for such areas are zero or close to zero. Examples of metrics used include the presence of (Christian) work and workers (of any kind, whether community development, health, business, child care, house servants, etc), media in an appropriate language (print, TV, radio, web, etc.),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ow&gt;[[Operation World]] provides a concise well-researched/cited data summary for each nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wce&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=David B.|author2=Kurian, George T.|author3=Johnson, Todd M.

The concept behind the ''10/40 Window'' highlights these three elements (as of data available in 1990): an area of the world with great poverty and low quality of life, combined with lack of access to Christian resources. The Window forms a band encompassing [[Sahara]]n and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[animist]], [[Jewish]], or [[atheist]]. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

==Origin==
This region of the world was previously known to Christians as the "resistant belt", as noted by [[Luis Bush]] at the 1989 [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne II Conference in Manila]]. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based [[GIS]] software.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas GIS, produced by Strategic Mapping Inc., was the first PC Geographic Information System.{{cite news|url=http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php |title=ESRI Retires ArcCAD and Atlas GIS| accessdate= September 21, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070925180632/http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php| archivedate= September 25, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the ''10/40 box''. A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the ''10/40 Window'', stating that this region ought to be seen as a "window of opportunity".{{citation needed |date= September 2007}} The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase ''10/40 Window region''.

Before being called the "resistant belt", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the "unoccupied fields" by [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer|Samuel Zwemer]], in his book by that same title, published in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwemer|first=Samuel M. |title=The Unoccupied Mission Fields of Africa and Asia|location=New York|publisher=Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions|page=260|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Some&lt;ref&gt;Verbal and online discussions, no documentation available outside of Wikipedia itself.&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.

The 1990 research data states:
* this part of the world was home to the largest populations living in deep poverty and lowest [[quality of life]];&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=mappoor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mapqual/&gt;
* this part of the world did have least access to Christian resources. Note the emphasis on ''access'' not ''percent Christian''. The West has ubiquitous access to such resources; this area of the world did and does not.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;&lt;ref name=wce/&gt;

This research deals in overall population characteristics. The ''10/40 Window'' is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:
* The 10/40 Window article refers to the "poorest of the poor" living in that region (based on late-1980s per-capita [[GNP]] under US$500).&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; Of the three billion people living in such poverty-stricken nations, 82% lived in the 10/40 Window. Yet the 10/40 Window also includes nations such as [[South Korea]] and Japan. In the late 20th century, Japan boasted the world's third largest economy, and South Korea the eleventh. Such nations were strong throughout the late 20th century.
* Geographically, the 10/40 Window includes the [[Philippines]] and [[Portugal]], which both have a Roman Catholic Christian majority; [[Greece]], where almost 98% of the population belonged to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]; and South Korea, which is home to the largest single congregation church in the world&lt;ref&gt;The largest congregation is in Seoul ([[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]) {{cite news |url=http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html |title=The Top 10 Churches in the World (by size)| accessdate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162953/http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html| archivedate= September 27, 2007 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the second largest missionary-sending nation in the world.&lt;ref name=misinc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html |title=Missions Incredible|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107083606/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html|archivedate=November 7, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10/40 Window does not encompass [[Indonesia]] or Sri Lanka, nations that had very little access to Christian resources.&lt;ref name=ow/&gt;

==Gaining widespread use==
Over the years, the 10/40 Window has evolved from a specialist term used by Christian [[Missiology|missiologists]] to assumed vocabulary for Christians in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=792 |title=Becoming Global Christians in the 21st Century By Justin Long – Charisma Magazine, (2001) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=1575 |title=Islam and China's Christmas By David Aikman – Charisma Magazine, (2002) |publisher=Charismamag.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tcw/2003/001/11.12.html |title=Marli Spieker &amp;#124; Today's Christian Woman &amp;#124; Your Life.

==Analysis==
The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):
*82% of the poorest of the world's poor (per capita GNP less than US$500 per year),&lt;ref name=mappoor&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poorest Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy),&lt;ref name=mapqual&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Quality of Life &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.,)&lt;ref name=maprel&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Three Religious Blocks &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mapislam&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Islam &amp;  &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*close to 100% of those who were both most-poor ''and'' had least-access to Christian resources (two-dimensional analysis)&lt;ref name=mapprun&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poor, The Unevangelized, &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The least Christian resource investment&lt;ref&gt;Well below 10 percent in any of the study populations. Each of the cited maps provides side data on population, Christian involvement, etc in the various study populations (poor, low quality of life, non-Christian, etc)&lt;/ref&gt; and least sharing of the Christian message&lt;ref name=mapleast&gt;{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The 55 Least Evangelized Countries &amp; The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World&lt;ref name=ow/&gt; almanac, the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref name=wce/&gt; and the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name=wfb/&gt;

===Non-Christians in the 10/40 Window by religion===
The first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:
* 28 Muslim countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 2 Hindu countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 8 Buddhist countries, 237 million population est. (2000)

[http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/1040.htm Later updates] have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of "[[unreached]]" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:
*865 million Muslims
*550 million Hindus
*275 million Buddhists
*140 million in 2550 tribal groups (mainly animist)
*17 million Jews&lt;ref&gt;Note that this number is higher than the census-based world total of 14 million. However, even authoritative [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html Jewish sources] state that many Jews do not identify themselves in population censuses.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nations in the 10/40 Window===
The 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the [[Joshua Project]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/resources/articles/10_40_window |title=What is the 10/40 Window? |publisher=joshuaproject.net |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Vas''' (born 15 March 1981 in [[Maracay]], [[Venezuela]]) is a contemporary artist. He grew up living between [[Surinam]], [[Guyana]], and [[Belgium]]. After studies at EAVRA in Maracay and at the [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]] in [[Amsterdam]] he lives and works in Amsterdam and [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcthemagazine.com/arc/2013/03/abdul-vas-shoot-to-thrill-curated-by-alexis-callado-estefania-casado-santapau-gallery-madrid/ Abdul Vas’ Shoot to Thrill-Curated by Alexis Callado Estefania-Casado Santapau Gallery] [[ARC Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has created handmade [[books]] and [[zines]], [[photographs]], [[collages]], [[drawings]], [[paintings]] and [[murals]].

== Work ==

Abdul Vas work broaches heavily the obsessions of his home country Venezuela with the symbols of the American dream. Heavily influenced by [[Marc Chagall]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Al Feldstein]] and [[James Ensor]], Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung [[rooster]]s that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[MLB]], [[Malcolm Young]],  [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Slayer]], [[Metallica]], [[the Black Crowes]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[SUV]]s, [[rock and roll]] and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the [[Navistar]] trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group [[AC/DC]], particularly lead singer [[Brian Johnson]]. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55383">{{short description|General review of religious attitudes towards scientific descriptions of evolution, and where relevant, their counterclaims}}
Although biological [[evolution]] has been vocally opposed by some religious groups, many other groups accept the scientific position, sometimes with additions to allow for theological considerations.  The positions of such groups are described by terms including "[[theistic evolution]]", "theistic evolutionism" or "evolutionary creation".  Theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is [[Creator deity|the creator]] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]]. According to the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], a [[Christian]] organization of scientists:

{{quotation|A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Rusbult, Ph.D.|title=Evolutionary Creation|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm|year=1998|publisher=American Scientific Affiliation|quote=A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation * — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve.  Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Eugenie Scott]], Director of the US [[National Center for Science Education]], "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church".&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"&gt;* [[Eugenie C. Scott|Scott, Eugenie C.]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2952523 Antievolution and Creationism in the United States]", ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 26, (1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;263–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory]], but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. Proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian [[Darwinism|Darwinists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Acceptance ==
This view is generally accepted by major [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Episcopal Church USA]], and some other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations;&lt;ref name="Scott, 271"/&gt; virtually all [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]]. A 2007 poll showed that acceptance among American Buddhists, Hindus and Jews was higher than among any Christian groups (graph below). One recent survey, conducted by physicist [[Max Tegmark]], on "of how different US faith communities view origins science, particularly evolution and Big Bang cosmology." Although "[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] reports that 46% of Americans believe that God created humans in their present form less than 10,000 years ago", it found "only 11% belong to religions openly rejecting evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[Max Tegmark, Eugena Lee, and Meia Chita-Tegmark, "The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap", Feb. 11, 2013,http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey/survey.pdf, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature.
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms "light", "day", and "morning" hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, "The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation" from ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' 40.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [In later work, Augustine said that "there are some who think that only the world was made by God and that everything else is made by the world according to his ordination and command, but that God Himself makes nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, JH (trans) (1982) "St. Augustine. The Literal Meaning of Genesis", Paulist Press, New York, p171&lt;/ref&gt;]  Three noted Jewish examples are that of the writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]] (1st century),&lt;ref name="book2.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html |title="Allegorical Interpretation, I" from ''The Works of Philo Judaeus'', translated by C.D. Yonge |accessdate=2013-06-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515164341/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] (12th century) and [[Gersonides]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' 2:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish philosophy#Jewish Philosophy after Maimonides|Milchamot Hashem]]'' 6:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week-long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of "creatio continua" or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation.  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem otherwise to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectrum of viewpoints ==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.  There is considerable variance in overall acceptance of evolution between different countries, with studies showing that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan (only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate in the 34 countries sampled),&lt;ref name=miller-et-al&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1126746|title=SCIENCE COMMUNICATION: Public Acceptance of Evolution|year=2006|last1=Miller|first1=J.D.|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=765–6|pmid=16902112|last2=Scott|first2=EC|last3=Okamoto|first3=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attitudes within religious groups may differ somewhat between counties.

=== Bahá'í ===
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdul-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; however, according to [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] denominations, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.&lt;ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"/&gt; Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

==== Contemporary Christian denominations ====
All of the traditional [[mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by "[[Evolution Sunday]]" where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] United States has issued a teaching resource to "assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation." This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis "should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

===== Anglicanism =====
[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible "contains all things necessary to salvation," while believing that "science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding." Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, some Anglicans view "Big Bang cosmology" as being "in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation." Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://episcopalscience.org/creation-science/ Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that "creationism is, in a sense, a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

===== United Methodist Church =====
The [[United Methodist Church]] affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of evolution.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070533/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227 |date=2011-06-07 }}  The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008,  The United Methodist Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Church of the Nazarene =====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees "knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation," and, while the church "'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the "how" of creation.'"&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ "Can God Love Darwin, Too?" by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Richard G. Colling]], author of ''Random Designer''&lt;ref&gt;''Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator'', Browning Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9753904-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professor at [[Olivet Nazarene University]], received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004),&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; [[Darrel R. Falk]] of [[Point Loma Nazarene]] published a similar book in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8308-2742-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Giberson]] of [[Eastern Nazarene]], the first Nazarene scholar to publish with [[Oxford University Press]], has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds Apart: The Unholy War between Religion and Science'', Beacon Hill Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8341-1504-2}}&lt;br&gt;With [[Donald Yerxa]], ''Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002 {{ISBN|0-7425-0764-5}}&lt;br&gt;With [[Mariano Artigas]], ''The Oracles of Science: Celebrity Scientist Versus God and Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-531072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; including his most recently published ''Saving Darwin''.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt;

Theologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include [[Thomas Jay Oord]] (''Science of Love'', ''[[The Altruism Reader]]'', ''Defining Love''), [[Michael Lodahl]] (''[[God of Nature and of Grace]]''), and [[Samuel M. Powell]] (''[[Participating in God]]'').  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: "The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . ."—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf Manual, p.371] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf |date=2013-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Eastern Orthodox Church =====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and dualism.

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that evolutionary science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, dualists hold that evolution can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that evolutionary science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place. Their stance is somewhat similar to [[Averroism]], in that there is one truth, but it can be arrived at through (at least) two different paths, namely Philosophy and Religion.
Bufeev, S. V, is a dualist, preferring to see the spiritual level above the mechanical, physico-chemical, or biological levels; he attributes discrepancies between spiritual matters and scientific matters to be because of the purely naturalistic views of evolutionists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Roman Catholic Church =====
{{Main article|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the early-1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single human ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|monogenism]]) for all of mankind. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life.  Indeed, Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]], astronomer and physics professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], was the first to propose the theory of [[expansion of the universe]], often incorrectly credited to [[Edwin Hubble]]. In the 1950 [[encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual [[soul]] is a direct creation by [[God in Christianity|God]] and not the product of purely material forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catholics and the Evolving Cosmos |first=John |last=Farrell |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447493644515142 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|alt=Today}}, many members of the Church supports [[theistic evolution]](ism), also known as ''evolutionary creation'',&lt;ref name="Alberta"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.lastseminary.com/genesis-modern-science/Evolutionary%20Creation.pdf|title =Evolutionary Creation|quote=Evolutionary creation best describes the official position of the Roman Catholic Church, though it is often referred to in this tradition as 'theistic evolution.'|publisher = [[University of Alberta]]|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], the International Theological Commission published a paper accepting the [[Big Bang|big bang]] of 15 billion years ago and the evolution of all life including humans from the microorganisms that formed approximately 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God."

=== Deism ===
{{See also|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments.

One recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently clarified this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: "What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2012}}&lt;!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --&gt;&lt;!-- He accepts evolution, but believes in a deity. --&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
{{See also|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints with regard to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary, but classically tell of the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], performing the act of "creation", or more specifically of "propagating life within the universe". with the other two deities responsible for "preservation" and "destruction" (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

Some Hindus{{Who|date=June 2012}} find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

==== Day and night of Brahma ====
Science writers [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Fritjof Capra]] have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a "day and night of Brahma", which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
{{quotation|The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sagan | first =Carl | authorlink =Carl Sagan | title =[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]] | publisher =Ballantine Books | year =1985 | isbn =978-0-345-33135-9 }} p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Capra, in his popular book ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'', wrote that:
{{quotation|This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe, which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions, has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Capra | first =Fritjof | authorlink =Fritjof Capra | title =[[Tao of Physics]] | publisher =Shambhala | year =1991 | isbn =978-0-87773-594-6 }} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Daśāvatāras and evolution ====
The British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J B S Haldane]] observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]]) provide a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of [[evolution]]. The avatars of [[Vishnu]] show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;

Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islamic creationism}}
Some literalist Muslims{{Who|date=June 2012}} reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that "Allah is the Creator of everything" (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to "nature," because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Ahmadiyya ====
{{See also|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement also [[Ahmadiyya views on evolution|universally accepts]] the principle of the process of evolution with divine guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html  Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of American [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbol]]ic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods. The latter view, called [[day-age creationism]], is justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned and by how the seventh day of rest has no evening and morning. In the day-age view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

[[Karaite Judaism]] is a Jewish a movement which is distinct in that they do not accept the [[Talmud]] (a series of Rabbinic commentaries) as law and follow the Hebrew scriptures as they are written. Karaites are currently divided on the question of evolution with many or most Karaite Jews leaning in favor of Theistic Evolution.

=== Samaritanism ===
The [[Samaritans]], a divergent branch of the Israelites (the other being the Jews), generally accept Theistic Evolution. Samaritans do not consider themselves to be Jewish, but hold similar beliefs. The Jews, however, hold the [[Tanakh]] (consisting of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]], plus [[Nevi'im]], and [[Ketuvim]]) as canonical scripture in conjunction with the Oral Law as compiled in the Talmud, while the Samaritan's canonical scriptures consists only of the Torah (a slightly differing Pentateuch, i.e. the Five Books of Moses), but exclude both Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as excluding the Talmud.

=== Pantheism ===
[[Pantheism|Pantheists]] (for instance in [[Naturalistic Pantheism]]) may view natural processes, including evolution, as work or emanations from the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English  | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford  | pages =  1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X  | mr =   | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deity"&gt;Owen, H.

=== Evolutionary biologists who were also theists ===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&amp;ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fichman, (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2E293wQ63AC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace]''. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |title=Historical Resources |year=2009 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and [[natural theology]], and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life.&lt;ref name=Grayreviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |title=Essays &amp; reviews by Asa Gray |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |title=Essay: Evolution &amp; theology |author=Asa Gray |authorlink=Asa Gray |date=January 15, 1874 |work= Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=The Nation |pages= |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] in mind when he wrote that "It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist &amp; an evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |title=Letter 12041 — Darwin, C.

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&amp;ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries.

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&amp;ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&amp;ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:"I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness."

In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps appropriate: "The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant."

'''Awareness Sunday''' takes place each year on a Sunday in September. Awareness Sunday in 2014 will take place on Sunday 14 September. Awareness Sunday is described as "about healing and reconciliation in our communities". Awareness Sunday is an initiative of the [[Awareness Foundation]]. "Awareness Sunday is an annual opportunity to reflect on the value of loving our neighbour as ourself, even if our neighbour is of a different religious faith or worldview."&lt;ref name="ref 1"&gt;Awareness Sunday official website: http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/awareness-sunday&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Awareness Sunday website,&lt;ref name="ref 1"/&gt; "This is an invitation to everyone, whatever their faith or world view, to join us at this time and make a commitment to change attitudes and build relationships in your own community, based on respect and understanding."

== Supporters ==
Awareness Sunday is supported by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and many other leading clergy in the [[Church of England]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Methodist]] Church and the [[Baptist]] Church. In addition, Awareness Sunday is supported by [[Lord Sacks]], the former Chief Rabbi for the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, and Sunni and Shia scholars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awareness-foundation.co.uk/index.php/awareness-sunday-quotes&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">'''Bheemana Amavasya''' is a festival celebrated in [[South India]], most in parts of [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. It is celebrated on the [[new moon]] day (''[[amavasya]]'') of the ''[[ashadha]]'' month of the [[Hindu calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;''A handbook of Karnataka'' by S. R. Honnalingaiah, Karnakataka Gazetteer Dept., Govt. of Karnataka, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amavasya]] is the day of [[new moon]] occurrence in the sky, and any fortnight containing the new-moon is considered auspicious by Hindus. They believe that during this period, the offerings they make, reach their late forefathers and in return are showered with blessing. Signifies the beginning of auspicious period, and many pooja's are performed to Hindu deity's during this period seeking blessing.

First moon occurrence of August month is marked as Bheemana Amavasya, which is considered very auspicious by Hindus; it is believed that on this day [[Shiva]], the Lord of destruction in [[Hindu mythology]], is impressed by Parvathi's devotion towards him and accepts her as his wife. [[Parvathi]] is considered by some schools of Hinduism as the supreme Divine Mother or Lordess and all other goddesses are considered her incarnations or manifestations.

Parvathi, thus, symbolizes many different virtues esteemed by Hindu tradition: fertility, marital felicity, devotion to the spouse, asceticism, and power. It is believed if women abstain from consuming food on this day and offer prayers to Lord Shiva, Parvathi chastely an unmarried would seek a good virtuous husband and married would pray for their husband's long life, success and happiness.

Usually two idols are made using red mud clay, dried and decorated.One Idol depicts Lord Shiva &amp; the other symbolizes Parvathi. One can use Idols made of panchaloha ( 5 materials namely gold,silver,copper,bronze,zinc ... the combination may differ)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5187">Mainline Christian theology (including [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and most other [[Protestant]]s) has traditionally held that only one [[baptism]] is valid to confer the benefits of this sacrament.  In particular, the [[Council of Trent]] [[dogmatic definition|defined a dogma]] that it is forbidden to baptize a person who is already baptized, because the first baptism would make an [[sacramental character|indelible mark]] on the soul.  Likewise, "[[Methodist]] theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity."&lt;ref name="CracknellWhite2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cracknell|first1=Kenneth|last2=White|first2=Susan J.|title=An Introduction to World Methodism|date=5 May 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9780521818490|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in cases where the validity of a baptism is in doubt, a '''"conditional" baptism''' may be performed.&lt;ref name="Jr2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Charles Yrigoyen|title=T&amp;T Clark Companion to Methodism|date=25 September 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|language=English|isbn=9780567290779|page=263|quote=Methdoists historically do not rebaptize unless the ecumenical formula was not used or another major impediment calls into question the adequacy of an earlier rite.

==Description==
Such uncertainty may result from questions about whether the [[Trinitarian formula|Triune name of God]] was used by the person administering the baptism.  In some cases, there are doubts about whether a church from which someone is converting baptizes in a valid manner.  For example, the [[Catholic Church]] has said that the validity of baptisms in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (which does not practice conditional baptism) and in some other communions is doubtful.  It is an issue where an infant is a foundling, and it is not known whether the child had been baptized before abandonment.  Another example of a case requiring conditional baptism is when an [[emergency baptism]] has been performed using impure water. Then, the validity of the baptism is in question. In that case, a conditional baptism is later performed by an ordinary minister of the sacrament with certainly valid matter.

In a typical baptism, the minister of the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacrament]] (in the Catholic Church usually a deacon or a priest, but sometimes, especially when the baptized is in imminent danger of death, a lay person or even a non-Christian) says

: ''I baptize you [[trinitarian formula|in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Common Prayer]] p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

while pouring water upon the head of the one being baptized, or immersing him or her in water.  In a conditional baptism, the minister of the sacrament says

:''If you are not yet baptized, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Common Prayer|BCP]] p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cases==

Only the living can be recipients of Sacraments. Thus, if it is uncertain whether the baptizand is dead (''i.e.'', his soul has parted from the body; this is the case for the first few hours or so after death in the modern sense), the formula is "If you are alive, I baptize [...]". In severe cases of birth anomaly, the (practically, always [[emergency baptism|emergency]]) baptism formula is "If you are a human being, I baptize [...]".&lt;ref name=rituale&gt;''[[Roman Ritual|Rituale Romanum]]'': [http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/rituale-romanum/07-the-sacrament-of-baptism-general-rules.html Holy Baptism - General Rules]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, if an emergency baptism has been performed over a part of the body other than the head (practically: during birth), or on a pregnant woman's womb (for the unborn child), the child is to be conditionally rebaptized (with the usual "if you are not baptized") even though the emergency baptisms ''should'' be performed in this way if necessary.&lt;ref name=rituale/&gt;

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''Danda'' (दन्द, Danda) meaning "stick",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/dandasana/ | title = Dandasana - AshtangaYoga.info | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Asana'' (आसन, Āsana) meaning "posture".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
It was founded by Sajag.

To achieve this asana, begin in a seated position with the legs extended forward.  The palms or the fingertips (if the palms don't reach) should be rested on either side of the body.  The upper-body should be extending upward through the crown of the head, and the back should be completely perpendicular to the ground (as though sitting against a wall).  If this is not possible, one may want to use a block underneath one's sitting bones to reduce the intensity in the hamstring muscles.  The entire core should be engaged and ujjayi breath active throughout this asana.  The legs should be squeezing together, and the toes should be pointing inwards toward the body.  It may even be possible to create space between the heels and the ground by activating the leg muscles.

This asana is usually followed by [[Paschimottanasana]] (forward fold).

==Benefits==
This asana is believed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/pose/staff-pose/|title=Staff Pose - Dandasana - Yoga Pose|date=2007-08-28|newspaper=Yoga Journal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yogabasics.com/asana/staff-posture/|title=Staff Posture|newspaper=Yoga Basics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help improve digestion, prevent sciatic pain, stretch and activate the muscles of the legs, and prevent tiredness in the feet and calf-muscles.

[[File:Dave Rubin in Meat Packing District, NYC, 2012.png|thumb|upright|Rubin in 2012]]
In 2000, Rubin continued his career at the New York-based [[Comedy Cellar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theawl.com/2012/12/funny-guy-david-rubin-answers-our-questions|title=Funny Guy Dave Rubin Answers Our Questions|author=Awl Sponsors|publisher=The Awl|accessdate=2012-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310063933/http://www.theawl.com/2012/12/funny-guy-david-rubin-answers-our-questions|archivedate=2013-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year he joined with other Comedy Cellar comedians to create a [[public-access television]] series, a news program parody called ''The Anti-Show'' which was secretly filmed at [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] in [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2002/11/nbcs-topsecret-show/|title=NBC’s Top-Secret Show|author=Jason Gay|publisher=New York Observer|accessdate=2002-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Podcasting and social media===
He was the host of two popular [[podcasts]], ''Hot Gay Comics'' and ''[[The Ben and Dave Show]]''. Both podcasts were turned into a television series on the [[here!]] television network.&lt;ref name = Wheat&gt;{{cite news

In May 2009, Rubin co-created and co-hosted a new podcast called ''[[The Six Pack]]'', which went on to become a top podcast on [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebacklot.com/interview-the-six-packs-ben-and-dave-are-like-a-married-couple-with-no-sex/06/2011/

===Hosting===
In January 2013, Rubin left radio and began his television career. He was offered his own politics and current events talk show, ''The Rubin Report'', on [[The Young Turks]] Network and moved from New York City to Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metrosource.com.s123317.gridserver.com/2013/05/13/post-six/|title=Post-Six|author=Paul Hagen|publisher=Metrosource|accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, while still hosting ''The Rubin Report'', Rubin also hosted ''[[The Golden Girls]] Ultimate Fan Club'', a weekly web-series on [[Logo TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/logo-tv-launches-the-golden-girls-ultimate-fan-club/05/2013/&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=KF_bUa2aLKfDigKZvYCABQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwBjhhlys6Xr5WOU5aurtN7jnFCQ|title=Logo TV launches The Golden Girls Ultimate Fan Club|publisher=New Now Next|accessdate=2013-05-13}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the holy text of [[Ayyavazhi]] the present universe has eight aeons and we are in the seventh aeon, [[Kali Yukam]].

In the sixth aeon called Dwapara Yukam, the fifth fragment of [[Kroni]], the primordial personification of evil, was apportioned into hundred pieces, and made into Thuriyothanan and ninety-nine brothers to support him. The [[three brothers of Raman]], along with [[Vibushanan]]  and Sampoovan of the preceding epoch, were created as [[Pandava|Pancha Pandavas]] in this aeon. In the battle drawn between the forces of [[Thuriyothanan]] and Panchapantavarkal, the wicked Thuriyothanan was killed by the later with the support of Mayon who came in the form of Krishnan. Even at the point of death Thuriyothanan refuse to repent, saying that, “only with your cunning mind you was able to defeat me and otherwise not”. Mayon then told him: You will be created with knowledge, intelligence, and artistic skills in the next Yukam, and if you do not repent in that age, that will be your eternal annihilation.

{{chaos magic}}'''Egregore''' (also '''egregor''') is an [[occult]] concept representing a "[[thoughtform]]" or "[[collective]] group mind", an autonomous [[psychic]] entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people.  The [[symbiotic]] relationship between an egregore and its group has been compared to the more recent, non-occult concepts of the [[corporation]] (as a [[Juristic person|legal entity]]) and the [[meme]].

== History ==

The first author to adapt "egregore" in a modern language seems to be the French poet [[Victor Hugo]], in ''[[La Légende des siècles]]'' ("The Legend of the Ages"), First Series, 1859, where he uses the word "égrégore" first as an adjective, then as a noun, while leaving the meaning obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Hugo, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Jour_des_rois "Le jour des rois"], ''La Légende des Siècles'' IV, V, and [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/L%E2%80%99Italie_-_Ratbert "L'Italie – Ratbert"], ''La Légende des Siècles'' VII. Both in the Première Série, 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; The author seems to have needed a word rhyming with words ending in the sound "or". It would not be the only example of word creation by Victor Hugo. However, the word is the normal form that the Greek word ἑγρήγορος ([[Watcher (angel)|Watcher]]) would take in French. This was the term used in the [[Book of Enoch]] for great angel-like spirits.

[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], in ''Le Grand Arcane'' ("The Great Mystery", 1868) identifies "egregors" with the tradition concerning the "[[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]]", the fathers of the [[nephilim]], describing them as "terrible beings" that "crush us without pity because they are unaware of our existence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliphas Levi|Lévi, Eliphas]], "The Great Mystery" (1868) pp. 127–130, 133, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the egregore as a group thoughtform was developed in works of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Rosicrucians]]&lt;ref&gt;Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis.(1614)  Manifesto: Positio. Epilogue page 25&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referenced by writers such as [[Valentin Tomberg]], notably in his anonymously-penned book ''Meditations on the Tarot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey Into Christian Hermeticism|last=Anonymous|date=2002-06-01|publisher=Jeremy P. Tarcher/ Putnam|isbn=9781585421619|language=English|translator-last=Powell|translator-first=Robert|id= {{ASIN|1585421618|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known concept of the egregore is the GOTOS of the [[Fraternitas Saturni]].&lt;ref&gt;Flowers (1995), pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
Gaetan Delaforge, in [[Gnosis (magazine)|''Gnosis'' magazine]] in 1987, defines an egregore as a kind of group mind that is created when people consciously come together for a common purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Delaforge, Gaeten, [http://www.masonicworld.com/education/files/artjun02/TEMPTRAD.htm "The Templar Tradition: Yesterday and Today"], ''[[Gnosis (magazine)|Gnosis Magazine]],'' #6, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was featured in ''Corporate Metabolism'' series of articles by [[Paco Nathan|Paco Xander Nathan]], which were published in 2001.

The notion of "egregor" also appears in [[Daniil Andreyev]]'s ''[[Roza Mira]]'', where it represents the shining cloud-like spirit associated with the Church.

Egregore is also used in relation to the Montreal [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], best known as [[Les Automatistes]], in Ray Ellenwood's ''Egregore: a history of the Montréal automatist movement''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellenwood, Ray, ''Egregore : a history of the Montréal automatist movement''. Toronto: Exile Editions, 1992. {{ISBN|9781550960211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egregore is also the term for the spiritual personification of each nation in the UK LRP game Empire, run by [[Profound Decisions]].&lt;ref name="Egregore Page on Empire Wiki"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.profounddecisions.co.uk/empire-wiki/Egregores |title=Egregores - Empire |website=Empire Wiki |publisher=profounddecisions.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Yemen|Constitution]] of [[Yemen]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the [[Politics of Yemen|Government]] generally respected this right in practice; however, there were some restrictions. The Constitution declares that [[Islam]] is the [[state religion]], and that [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law) is the source of all legislation. Government policy continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion; however, there were some restrictions. [[Muslims]] and followers of religious groups other than Islam are free to worship according to their beliefs, but the Government prohibits conversion from Islam and the [[proselytization]] of Muslims. Although relations among religious groups continued to contribute to religious freedom, there were some reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. There were isolated attacks on [[Jews]] and some prominent [[Zaydi]] Muslims felt targeted by government entities for their religious affiliation. Government [[Military of Yemen|military]] reengagement in the [[Saada]] governorate caused political, tribal, and religious tensions to reemerge in January 2007, following the third military clash with rebels associated with the [[Houthis|al-Houthi family]], who adhere to the Zaydi school of [[Shi'a Islam]].

==Religious demography==
{{Main|Religion in Yemen}}

Virtually all citizens are Muslims, either belonging to the Zaydi order of Shi'a Islam (45%-50%) or to the [[Shafa'i]] order of [[Sunni]] Islam (55-50%).&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf Country profile: Yemen]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 2008). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jews are the only indigenous religious minority. Nearly all of the country's once-sizable Jewish population has emigrated. Fewer than 500 Jews remain in the country. There are 3,000 [[Christians]] throughout the country, most of whom are refugees or temporary foreign residents.

==Status of religious freedom==
===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, there were some restrictions. The Constitution declares that Islam is the state religion and that Shari'a is the source of all legislation. Followers of religious groups other than Islam are free to worship according to their beliefs and to wear religiously distinctive ornaments or dress; however, Shari'a forbids conversion and prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing, and the Government enforces this prohibition. The Government requires permission for the construction of new places of worship and prohibits non-Muslims from holding elected office.

The Government issues residence visas to priests so that they may provide for their community's religious needs. Christian clergy, who ministered to the foreign community, were employed in teaching, social services, and health care.

The country maintains regular diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

The Government does not maintain records of an individual's religious identity, and there is no law that requires religious groups to register with the state; however, the General Election Committee has adopted a policy barring all non-Muslims from running for Parliament. Chapter 2, Article 106 of the Constitution further notes that the President of the Republic must "practice his Islamic duties."

Public schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions; however, Muslim citizens can attend private schools that do not teach Islam. Almost all non-Muslim students in the country are foreigners and attend private schools.

The Muslim holy days of [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Muharram]], and [[Eid al-Fitr]] are public holidays.

Public schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions, although Muslim citizens are allowed to attend private schools that do not teach Islam. In an effort to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools, the government does not permit any courses outside of the officially approved curriculum to be taught in private and national schools. Because the government is concerned that unlicensed religious schools deviate from formal educational requirements and promote militant ideology, it has closed more than 4,500 of these institutions and deported foreign students studying there.&lt;ref name="cp"/&gt;

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion; however, there were some restrictions.

During the reporting period, the Government engaged in efforts to ease religious tension between it and some members of the Zaydi-Shi'a establishment; however, public tension reemerged in January 2007, most notably in the media, as a result of government action against the al-Houthi group's armed insurrection. The Government maintains that the al-Houthis are adherents of [[Twelver Shi'ism]], a variant of Shi'ism which differs from that of the country's predominant Zaydi-Shi'a. The al-Houthis and the Shabab follow the teachings of the late rebel cleric [[Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi|Hussein Badr Eddine al-Houthi]], who was killed during a ten-week rebellion that he led in June 2004 against the Government in Saada. Some Zaydis reported harassment and discrimination by the Government because they were suspected of sympathizing with the al-Houthis. However, it appears the Government's actions against the group were probably politically, not religiously, motivated.

Government actions to counter an increase in political violence in [[Saada]] restricted some practice of religion. In January 2007, for the third year, the Government banned the celebration of the Shi'a holy day [[Eid al-Ghadeer]] in parts of the Saada governorate. During the reporting period, the Government also reportedly intensified its efforts to stop the growth of the al-Houthis' popularity by limiting the hours that [[mosques]] were permitted to be open to the public. The Government closed down what it claimed to be extremist Shi'a religious institutes, reassigning imams who were thought to espouse radical doctrine, and increasing surveillance of mosque sermons. The Government abolished the Zaydi-affiliated al-Haq political party in March 2007, reportedly for not meeting political party law requirements. Many members of the party, however, believed the party was inappropriately dissolved because of its links to the al-Houthis and Shabab movement.

The Government prohibits the proselytization of Muslims. During the period covered by this report, there were reports of persons being temporarily detained for possession of religious materials with the intent to proselytize.

Under Shari'a, as applied in the country, the conversion of a Muslim to another religion is considered apostasy, which the Government interprets as a crime punishable by death. During the period covered by this report, there were no reported cases in which persons were charged with apostasy or prosecuted for it by government authorities.

The Government did not allow the building of new public places of worship without previous authorization. Roman Catholic officials at the end of this reporting period, like last year, were still waiting for a decision from the Government on whether it would allow an officially recognized Roman Catholic establishment to be built in Sana'a. Church officials did not attribute government inaction to discrimination.

Weekly services for [[Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Christians were held throughout Sana'a, Aden, and other cities without government interference. Throughout the country, Christian and Jewish services were held regularly in private homes or facilities, such as schools, without harassment, and such facilities appeared adequate to accommodate the small numbers involved.

The ruling [[General People's Congress (Yemen)|General People's Congress]] (GPC) and the [[Yemeni Congregation for Reform|Islah]] opposition party both drew on Islam as a basis for law in their platforms. The ruling GPC did not exclude members of any religion from its membership. Islah required that a member must be "committed" to Islamic teachings. There were other minor political parties that were said to be Islamic in nature, although it was not clear if they restricted their membership to Muslims.

During the reporting period, the Government continued its efforts to prevent the politicization of mosques and schools, and to curb extremism, and increase tolerance. The Government's efforts concentrated on monitoring mosques for sermons that incite violence or other political statements that it considered harmful to public security. Private Islamic organizations could maintain ties to international Islamic organizations; however, the Government sporadically monitored their activities through the police and intelligence authorities.

During the reporting period, the Government also continued efforts to close unlicensed schools and religious centers. By the end of the period covered by this report, more than 4,500 unlicensed religious schools and institutions were closed. The Government expressed concern that these schools deviated from formal educational requirements and promoted militant ideology. The Government also deported some foreign students found studying in unlicensed religious schools. The Government prohibited private and national schools from teaching courses outside of the officially approved curriculum. The purpose of these actions was to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools.

There were reports that both the Ministry of Culture and the Political Security Office (PSO) monitored and sometimes removed books that espoused Zaydi-Shi'a Islamic doctrine from store shelves after publication. There were also credible reports from Zaydi scholars and politicians that authorities banned the publishing of some materials that promoted Zaydi-Shi'a Islam. The Government denied that the media was subject to censorship by any security apparatus.

Government policy does not prohibit or provide punishment for the possession of non-Islamic religious literature; however, on occasion there were credible reports that persons were harassed by members of the PSO, an organization which reports directly to the president's office, and by police for possessing such literature. There were also reports that some members of the PSO monitored, harassed, and occasionally censored the mail of missionary groups and those associated with them, ostensibly to prevent proselytizing.

Following the unification of [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]] in 1990, owners of property expropriated by the communist government of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were invited to seek restitution of their property; however, implementation has been extremely limited, and very few properties have been returned to previous owners. In exchange for its confiscated property, the Catholic Church requested from the Government a small plot of land in Sana'a on which to build a Catholic establishment. The Church was awaiting action on the request at the end of the period covered by this report.

The Constitution declares that Islamic Shari'a is the source of all legislation. Some local customs, believed to be part of Shari'a as practiced in the country, are codified in various laws and policies. Some of these laws discriminate against women and persons of other religious groups.

According to the Government's interpretation of Shari'a, Muslim women are not permitted to marry outside of Islam. Under 1992 Personal Status Law No. 20, men are permitted to marry as many as four wives, although very few do so. The law also forbids men from marrying non-Muslims (except for Jews and Christians) or apostates (those who have renounced Islam).

===Abuses of religious freedom===
During the reporting period, security officials arbitrarily arrested and detained some individuals suspected of proselytizing and looking for H.A.Lutf Alshabi for the same reason. There was also a credible newspaper report that claimed security officials harassed and detained a Muslim carrying missionary publications in [[Taiz]]. Unconfirmed reports attributed such incidents to followers of conservative [[Salafi Islam]]ic doctrine within the security apparatus.

Since 2001 the Government has detained several hundred Islamists who returned to Yemen from Afghanistan and/or Iraq "for questioning." Although most persons were released within days, some reportedly continued to be detained beyond the maximum detention period as terrorist or security suspects.

In May 2006 President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] pardoned two [[imam]]s, Yahia Hussein al-Dailami, who was sentenced to death, and Muhammed Ahmad Miftah, who was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. The two were originally convicted of establishing contacts with Iran for the purpose of harming the country. The two men publicly opposed the Government's action in Saada and formed the Sana'a Youth Organization, a Zaydi religious-based group that supported the al-Houthis. Both men maintained that they only advocated peaceful dissent against government action in Saada.

During the same month, the Government released more than 200 al-Houthi rebel detainees in an amnesty. It was unclear how many of those detained participated in the renewed March 2005 rebellion against the Government. Although some of those detained were held for their support of the al-Houthis' religious teachings, the arrests appeared to have been more politically than religiously motivated.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced conversion|forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such children to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom===
As part of its campaign against religious extremism, the Government also took action to improve conditions that affected societal attitudes on religious freedom. In May 2006 the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Guidance conducted a six-day training course for 500 imams to promote principles of moderation and religious tolerance. The Government continued to support this campaign and planned for similar programs in the future, under the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Guidance.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were some reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice, but a general sense of religious freedom persisted. Religious minorities generally lived in harmony with their Muslim neighbors.

Isolated attacks in recent years by anti-Jewish extremists have convinced most of the country's Jews to relocate to the town of Raida for safety and to sustain their community. [[The Jewish community of Saada|The Saada Jewish community]] was displaced by fighting to Sana'a.

There were no reported incidents of violence or discrimination between the adherents of Zaydi and Shafa'i Islam, the two main orders of Islam practiced in the country.

Religiously motivated violence was neither incited nor tolerated by the Islamic clergy, except for a small, politically motivated clerical minority, often with ties to foreign extremist elements.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During the reporting period, there were sporadic reports of violence initiated by Salafi elements attempting to take control of moderate and Sufi mosques around the country. There were also unconfirmed reports that followers of [[Ismaili]] Islamic teachings were occasionally harassed and forbidden entry to mosques affiliated with Salafi followers.

The '''Ghorawadi caves''', also known as '''Ghorawdeshwar caves''' or '''Shelarwadi caves''', are around 25&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Pune]], India, were originally Buddhist caves, and now contain carvings and statues of Buddhist and Hindu deities.
 
They are close to the NH4 highway connecting Pune and [[Mumbai]].  The caves were carved out of a single rock formation around the 3rd and 4th century CE.

There are nine rooms for [[meditation]] adjoining the [[chaityagriha]]. An inscription in [[Brāhmī script]] on one of the walls says that the [[Chaityagriha]] is dedicated with affection to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and the [[Samgha]] by the daughters of "Dhapar", who was a disciple of "Bhadantsingh". The chaityagriha is now known as [[Shri Ghorwadeshwar Temple]].

The caves are situated at the top of a hill. Several caves contain representations of deities including  [[Vitthal]], [[Rakhumai]] and [[Tukaram|Saint Tukaram]].  It is said that [[Saint Tukaram]] used to [[meditate]] at Ghorawadi caves and also at places like [[Durga Tekdi]] near [[Nigdi]], [[Bhandara]] and [[Bhamchandra]] near [[Dehu]].

A large cave contains a representation of [[Shiva|Shivlinga]] that is visited during [[Mahashivratri]] by people seeking the blessings of [[Lord Shiva]].

Newspaper ''Yidishes tageblat'' (יידישעס טאגעבלאט) was founded in 1906 by Zionist [[Shmuel Yankev Yatskan]], a former contributor to the [[Hebrew language]] paper [[Ha-Tsefirah]]. 
In 1908 ''Yidishes tageblat'' changed its name to ''Haynt'' and quickly established itself as the premier Yiddish newspaper in the [[Congress Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/downloads/Warsaw.pdf Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Practice of reprinting Yiddish fiction in serialized form, helped ''Haynt'' set new circulation records for Yiddish journalism. By 1913 newspaper reached circulation of more than 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yivo.org/downloads/Warsaw.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1908 till 1932 ''Haynt'' was a private company. In 1932 a cooperative called ''Alt-Nay'' was formed by the staff, who administered newspaper ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haynt.org/chronicles.htm Haynt: Chronicles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heshang Gong''' (also '''Ho-Shang Kung''' ) was a reclusive hermit from the 1st century CE who wrote a commentary on [[Laozi|Laozi’s]] [[Tao Te Ching|Dao De Jing]]. Little is known about the life of Heshang Gong; however the impact of his writing is extensive in regards to the understanding and translation of the Dao De Jing, and is considered one of the earliest proponents of [[Daoist meditation|Daoist meditative practices]] which cultivate the “three treasures” of vitality, energy, and spirit, and the "dual cultivation" of spiritual nature ({{zh|c=性|p=xìng}}) and life-and-destiny ({{zh|c=命|p=mìng}}).

==Biography==
Heshang Gong's name is only known as the epithet Riverside Elder ({{zh|c=河上公|p=héshàng gōng}}), being an early form of ''anshang'' 岸上, meaning on the bank or shore.{{sfn|Reid|2015|p=ii}}

==Commentary on the ''Daodejing''==
Dan G. Reid says, "Heshang Gong’s insights into Daoist wisdom, history, cosmogony, and meditative practices, have been an essential aid to understanding the meaning, applicability, and cultural context of the Dao De Jing throughout Chinese history. He was the first to explain, in written form, its many paradoxical idioms and place them in context of the time and culture in which they were written. Every subsequent commentary, re-editing, and translation of the Dao De Jing has absorbed some degree of influence from his work."{{sfn|Reid|2015|p=ii}}

Heshang Gong provides what Kohn calls the "first evidence for Taoist meditation" and "proposes a concentrative focus on the breath for harmonization with the [[Tao|Dao]]."{{sfn|Kohn|2008|p=118}} Eduard Erkes says the purpose of the Heshang Gong commentary was not only to explicate the ''Daodejing'', but chiefly to enable "the reader to make practical use of the book and in teaching him to use it as a guide to meditation and to a life becoming a Taoist skilled in meditative training."{{sfn|Erkes|1945|p=127–128}}

'''''Hippobroma longiflora''''' (also called '''Star of Bethlehem''' or '''madamfate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=HILO3|taxon=Hippobroma longiflora|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a flowering plant in the [[Campanulaceae]] family. It is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[West Indies]], but has become naturalized across the American tropics and [[Oceania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 7 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is notable for its concentrations of two [[pyridine]] [[alkaloid]]s: [[lobeline]] and [[nicotine]]. The effects of nicotine and lobeline are quite similar, with psychoactive effects at small dosages and with unpleasant effects including vomiting, muscle paralysis, and trembling at higher dosages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, ''H. longiflora'' (and its various synonyms) is often referenced for both its toxicity and its [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanical]] uses.

When uprooting this weed, it is important to wear gloves: the sap is an irritant which can be absorbed through the skin, and a small amount of sap in the eyes can cause blindness.

[[Image:Great Mosque of Djenné 3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[Great Mosque of Djenné]], the largest [[adobe|mud brick]] building in the world, is considered the greatest achievement of the [[Sudano-Sahelian]] architectural style. The first [[mosque]] on the site was built in the 13th century; the current structure dates from 1907. Along with the city of [[Djenné]], it was designated a [[World Heritage]] site by [[UNESCO]]]]

Muslims currently make up approximately 95 percent of the population of [[Mali]]. The majority of Muslims in Mali are [[Maliki]]te [[Sunni]], influenced with [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=usdepstate&gt;{{ cite web | title=International Religious Freedom Report 2015 - Mali | publisher=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

{{Islam by country}}

==History==
During the 9th century, Muslim [[Berber people|Berber]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] merchants brought Islam southward into West Africa. Islam also spread in the region by the founders of [[Sufi]] brotherhoods ([[tariqah]]). Conversion to Islam linked the West African savannah through belief in one God and similar new forms of political, social and artistic accoutrements.{{definition|date=January 2011}} Cities including [[Timbuktu]], [[Gao]] and [[Kano]] soon became international centers of Islamic learning.

The most significant of the Mali kings was [[Mansa Musa]] (1312–1337), who expanded Mali influence over the large Niger city-states of [[Timbuktu]], [[Gao]], and [[Djenné]]. Mansa Musa was a devout Muslim who was reported to have built various major mosques throughout the Mali sphere of influence; his gold-laden pilgrimage to Mecca made him a well-known figure in the historical record.

==Muslims in Mali==
Islam as practiced in the country until recently was reported to be relatively tolerant and adapted to local conditions. Women participated in economic and political activity, engaged in social interaction, and generally did not wear veils. Islam in Mali has absorbed mystical elements, ancestor veneration and the [[African Traditional Religion]] that still thrive. Many aspects of Malian traditional society encourage norms consistent with democratic citizenship, including tolerance, trust, pluralism, the separation of powers and the accountability of the leader to the governed.

Relations between the Muslim majority and the Christian and other religious minorities—including practitioners of [[African Traditional Religion]] were reported to be generally stable until recently, although there have been several cases of instability and tension in the past. It is relatively common to find adherents of a variety of faiths within the same family. Many followers of one religion usually attend religious ceremonies of other religions, especially weddings, baptisms, and funerals.

Since the 2012 imposition of [[Sharia]] rule in northern parts of the country, persecution of Christians in the north increased significantly and was described as severe by [[Open Doors]] which publishes the Christian persecution index; Mali appears as number 7 in the 2013 index list.&lt;ref name = DeutscheWelle&gt;[http://www.dw.de/report-points-to-100-million-persecuted-christians/a-16507067 Report points to 100 million persecuted Christians.] Retrieved on 10 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = OpenDoor&gt;[http://www.worldwatchlist.us/ OPEN DOORS World Watch list 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of Sharia in the rebel-controlled north included banning of music, cutting off of hands or feet of thieves, stoning of adulterers and public whipping of smokers, alcohol drinkers and women who are not properly dressed.&lt;ref name=GUAR/&gt; In 2012, several Islamic sites in Mali were destroyed or damaged by vigilante activists linked to Al Qaeda which claimed that the sites represented "idol worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are foreign Islamic preachers that operate in the north of the country, while mosques associated with Dawa (an [[Islamist]] group) are located in [[Kidal]], [[Mopti]], and [[Bamako]]. The organization Dawa has gained adherents among the [[Bellah (caste)|Bellah]], who were once the slaves of the Tuareg nobles, and also among unemployed youth. The interest these groups have in Dawa is based on a desire to dissociate themselves from their former masters, and to find a source of income for the youth. The Dawa sect has a strong influence in Kidal, while the [[Wahabi]] movement has been reported to be steadily growing in Timbuktu. The country's traditional approach to Islam is relatively moderate, as reflected in the ancient manuscripts from the former [[University of Timbuktu]].

In August 2003, a conflict erupted in the village of Yerere in Western Mali when traditional Sunni practitioners attacked [[Wahhabi]] Sunnis, who were building an authorized mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61580.htm |title=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor - Mali |publisher=US Department of State |date=2006-03-08| accessdate=2009-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other foreign missionary groups are Christian groups that are based in Europe and engaged in development work, primarily the provision of health care and education.

==Status of religious freedom==
[[File:Mosque Bamako.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bamako Grand Mosque]]]]
The constitution provides for freedom of religion and does not permit any form of religious discrimination or intolerance by the government or individual persons. There is no [[state religion]] as the constitution defines the country as a secular state and allows for religious practices that do not pose a threat to social stability and peace.&lt;ref name=usdepstate/&gt;

The government requires that all public associations, including religious associations, register with the government. However, registration confers no tax preference and no other legal benefits, and failure to register is not penalized in practice. Traditional indigenous religions are not required to register.&lt;ref name=usdepstate/&gt;

A number of foreign missionary groups operate in the country without government interference. Both Muslims and non-Muslims are allowed to convert people freely.

The family law, including laws pertaining to divorce, marriage, and inheritance, are based on a mixture of local tradition and Islamic law and practice.

During presidential elections held in April and May 2002, the Government and political parties emphasized the secularity of the state. A few days prior to the elections, a radical Islamic leader called on Muslims to vote for former Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta]]. The High Council of Islam, the most senior Islamic body in the country, severely criticized the statement and reminded all citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice.

In January 2002, the High Council was created to coordinate religious affairs for the entire Muslim community and standardize the quality of preaching in mosques. All Muslim groups in the country currently recognize its authority.

==Extremism==
Extremist worshippers of Islam have been responsible for some reprehensible acts in Mali, most notably what has been nicknamed the [[Battle of Gao]], in which an extremist Muslim group, [[Ansar Dine]] began to destroy various [[World Heritage Site]]s. The most significant of these was the mausoleum of [[Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar]] and in mausoleums around the capital, including that of [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]], militants broke in and destroyed tombs.

Many towns in Mali are falling victim to extremist groups’ implementation of Sharia law, by which many African cultures and enjoyments have been denied.&lt;ref name=GUAR&gt;{{Cite news

'''Jñāna Vigraham''' is a distinctively styled statue of the revered saint [[Narayana Guru|Sree Nārāyana Guru]]. In [[Sanskrit]], the word ''Jñāna'' means knowledge, and ''Vigraham'' is the common term for statue (or embodiment). The name Jñāna Vigraham signifies ''embodiment of knowledge''. The first such statue was carved in wood and portrays facial likeness to Nārāyana Guru. 

The overall [[iconography]] incorporates aesthetic design elements, Sanskrit words of reverence, and symbolic depiction of the Guru’s spiritual reform initiative, concepts of human equality and knowledge universe ''[[knowledge|arivu]].'' The aesthetic elements of the design of a Jñāna Vigraham conform to ancient Eastern philosophic and religious iconography and carvings commonly seen across [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].



==The first Jñāna Vigraham==

The first Jñāna Vigraham was designed and commissioned by a private art collector and researcher of Nārāyana Guru’s philosophy and teachings. It was primarily intended as a trendsetter to improve the quality of Nārāyana Guru’s statues, kept in homes and in small chapel-like places of reverence and worship called ''Guru Mandirams'. These shrines dot the length and breadth of [[Kerala]], the south-western part of India where Nārāyana Guru was born and lived during the period 1856 to 1928.

The Jñāna Vigraham was sculptured in wood by the sculptor Artist Mani Mesthiri of [[Thiruvananthapuram]], Kerala, during 2006-2007. The work signified the period commemorating one and a half centuries since the Guru’s birth, as well as the 75th anniversary of the annual pilgrimage to [[Sivagiri, Kerala|Sivagiri]], the chosen spiritual abode and eternal resting place of saint Nārāyana Guru.


==Design elements==

The design of Jñāna Vigraham incorporates three parts of its structure - the anatomical statue, the pedestal and the radiance board (''Prabha'').

===The anatomical statue===

The core anatomical statue is devoid of any decorative elements. It is a lifelike figure of Nārāyana Guru, supposedly in his mid-life, in a seated posture and with hands in the ‘dharmachakra mudra’, the gesture of teaching usually interpreted as turning the wheel of righteousness. The hands are held level with the heart, the thumbs and index fingers form circles, symbolising the teachings of the Nārāyana Guru. The legs are placed in ‘vajrāsana’ an iconographic [[yoga]] posture (also referred to as ‘padmasana’), symbolising that Narayana Guru had mastered various yoga practices and endorsed [[Raja Yoga]], which is yoga of meditation and also incorporates [[Hatha Yoga]].

===The pedestal===

The pedestal has three front-facing panels with relief carvings. The centre panel depicts the conch and lotus, the traditional Eastern symbol of dharma. One of the side panels illustrate the historic consecration of the [[Sivalinga]] in 1888 at Aruvippuram; an action of Nārāyana Guru that broke the centuries-old tradition of such spiritual practices that was reserved as a prerogative of orthodox priests of those days. The third panel depicts the eastern proverbial [[blind men and an elephant]] as represented by Nārāyana Guru in verse 44 of the Guru’s philosophical masterpiece and scripture Atmopadesa Satakam (one hundred verses of self-instruction).

===The radiance board===

The radiance board providing the backdrop and [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] for the statue incorporates decorative elements and symbolism. The overall structure of the backdrop displays likeness to the [[Sarnath]] Buddha. The lower portion of the board figures the relief carvings of two elephants in outward facing and welcoming posture signifying Nārāyana Guru’s openness to the views and beliefs of other religions and philosophies. The radiance board also has relief carvings of fluttering birds representing the Guru’s words in verse 8 of the scripture Atmopadesa Satakam. The six fluttering birds represent the [[sense|five senses]] and the sixth sense of philosophical [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] as visualised by the designers to venerate the Guru. The relief carvings of the birds are intertwined with creepers and flowers signifying the growth and fruition of wisdom.

===Words of reverence===

The Jñāna Vigraham incorporates the citation of a befitting Sanskrit verse from the ancient Indian scripture [[Bhagavata_purana|Bhagavata Purana]] to revere Nārāyana Guru as follows:


&lt;blockquote&gt;
eke tvākhila-karmāni
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
sannyasyopaśamaḿ gatāḥ
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
jñānino jñāna-yajñena
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
yajanti jñāna-vigraham
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


''Translation: In pursuit of spiritual knowledge, some persons renounce all material activities and, having thus become peaceful, perform the sacrifice of philosophic investigation to worship You, the embodiment of knowledge.''

'''Jonathan Julian Hopkins''' (born 15 August 1979)&lt;ref name="fluxwhois"/&gt; is an English musician and producer who writes and performs [[electronic music]]. He began his career playing keyboard for [[Imogen Heap]], and has produced or contributed to albums by [[Brian Eno]], [[Coldplay]], [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] and others.

Hopkins composed the soundtrack for the 2010 film ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'',&lt;ref name="dominoromonsters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amazonmonsters"/&gt; which was nominated for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Original Score. His third studio album, ''[[Insides]]'', reached no. 15 on the US [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart in 2009.&lt;ref name="billb"/&gt; His collaborations on ''[[Small Craft on a Milk Sea]]'' with Brian Eno and [[Leo Abrahams]] and ''[[Diamond Mine (King Creosote and Jon Hopkins album)|Diamond Mine]]'' with [[King Creosote]] both reached no. 82 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;&lt;ref name="soundcl"/&gt; In 2011 ''Diamond Mine'' was nominated for a [[Mercury Prize]], which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; ''[[Immunity (Jon Hopkins album)|Immunity]]'' was also nominated for the 2013 Mercury Prize.&lt;ref name="mercuryshortlist"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jon Hopkins was born in 1979 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey and grew up in nearby [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. He first became aware of [[electronic music]] after hearing early [[house music]] on the radio at the age of seven or eight, and also became a fan of [[Depeche Mode]] and the [[Pet Shop Boys]].&lt;ref name="clubbers"/&gt; These records inspired an early fascination with [[synths]].&lt;ref name="moog"/&gt;

At the age of 12 Hopkins began studying piano at the Junior Department of the [[Royal College of Music]] in London, where he continued until age 17.&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt; The composers that were greatly influential to him whilst studying were [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Stravinsky]], and he eventually won a competition to perform a concert of Ravel's [[Piano Concerto in G]] with an orchestra.&lt;ref name="ibzia"/&gt; For a time Hopkins considered becoming a professional pianist, only to decide classical performance was too formal and unnerving to pursue full-time.&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt;

As a teenager he also listened to [[acid house]], early [[hardcore techno|hardcore]], [[grunge]],&lt;ref name="opal"/&gt; as well as [[electronica]] artists such as [[Acen]], [[Seefeel]], and [[Plaid (band)|Plaid]].&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; When Hopkins was 14 he got his first computer, an [[Amiga 500]], and started programming [[MIDI]] material.&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt; By the age of 15 he had saved up enough money from winning piano competitions to buy a low-level professional [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[synth]],&lt;ref name="moog"/&gt; and on this he began creating his first full-length electronic compositions.&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt;

==Career==
===1997–2004: Early years===
After finishing his final exams at age 17, Hopkins accompanied his friend [[Leo Abrahams]] to an audition for [[Imogen Heap]]'s backing band. Hopkins decided to audition as well, and was hired to handle both keyboard and samples, while Abrahams was hired as guitarist.&lt;ref name="ibzia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt; He toured with the new band for the entirety of 1998.&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt;

In 1999 Hopkins signed with boutique London label Just Music as a solo artist, and began recording his debut album ''Opalescent''. At the time he was also working part-time as a studio session musician.&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt; ''Opalescent'' attracted positive press attention upon its release, and several tracks were licensed to ''[[Sex and the City]]''.&lt;ref name="ibzia"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' reviewed it as "a beautifully realized debut. Using synth oozes, phased and echoed guitars and pianos and chilled beats, his wonderful tunes drift from calm to eerie power like a restless sea. It will delight any lovers of beautiful music." ''[[DJ Magazine]]'' gave it 4/5 stars, and stated "Piano, guitar strings and slow beats blend like the clouds at sunset (or an opiate smoothy) filtering in and out like elegantly wasted beauty. Darker drums add a further depth."&lt;ref name="opalreviews"/&gt;

Hopkins released his second album, ''Contact Note'', on Just Music in 2004 while still working as a studio musician. The album slowly gained an underground following but failed to take off, and led Hopkins to become disillusioned with his solo career, and take a break from writing to learn how to become a producer.&lt;ref name="ibzia"/&gt;

===2004–07: Work with Brian Eno and Coldplay===

By 2004, Abrahams had been collaborating for some time with [[ambient music|ambient]] musician and producer [[Brian Eno]]. Abrahams played some of Hopkins' second record for Eno, and Eno invited him to join them for a jam session. On the first day of their collaboration they came up with some of the music for Eno's upcoming album ''[[Another Day on Earth]]'',&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt; and Hopkins became a long-term collaborator.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt; Shortly afterwards Hopkins produced [[King Creosote]]'s album ''[[Bombshell (King Creosote album)|Bombshell]]'', which initiated his relationship with the [[Fence Collective]]. He also co-wrote tracks with DJ and composer [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]] for Holmes' ''Holy Pictures'' album, and remixed for [[James Yorkston]].&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt;

In 2007, Hopkins was invited by Eno, who was producing [[Coldplay]]'s upcoming album ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'', to join the band in the studio for a day.&lt;ref name="coldint"/&gt; Hopkins ended up staying and contributing to the album for the next year, co-producing&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt; several tracks and playing [[Organ (music)|organs]], [[Pump organ|harmoniums]], and other keyboard instruments on others. The intro to the track "[[Violet Hill (song)|Violet Hill]]" came from an improvisation with Hopkins and [[Davide Rossi]], the album's string arranger. Throughout this period Hopkins was periodically creating his own solo tracks, and his song "Light Through the Veins" was adapted to serve as the introduction to the album's first track "[[Life in Technicolor]]". "Light Through the Veins" was also picked by the band to serve as the backing for the track "The Escapist", which is [[Hidden track|hidden]] at the end of the album.&lt;ref name="coldint"/&gt; ''Viva la Vida'' was released in 2008, and won [[Best Rock Album]] at the [[2009 Grammy Awards]] and became the best-selling album of 2008. Coldplay asked Hopkins to serve as the pre-show DJ and opening act for their 2008 world tour.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tinymix"/&gt; Hopkins toured with the band for six months through England, the United States, and Japan.&lt;ref name="mutek"/&gt; He performed at venues including [[Madison Square Garden]]&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt; and the London [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]],&lt;ref name="coldint"/&gt; with crowds as large as 20,000 people.&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt;

===2008–13: ''Entity''; production===
[[File:Jon Hopkins (3679985832).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hopkins performing live in 2009]]
In 2008 Hopkins was commissioned by choreographer [[Wayne McGregor]] to compose music for ''Entity'', a production of McGregor's "Random Dance" group. ''Entity'' was performed live at [[Sadler's Wells]] in April 2008 to critical acclaim. A world tour followed throughout 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt;

Hopkins also has co-writing or producing credits on albums by artists such as&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt; [[David Holmes (musician)|David Holmes]]&lt;ref name="tinymix"/&gt; and Dan Arborise.&lt;ref name="coldint"/&gt; He is also known for remixing a variety of artists, including [[Wild Beasts]], [[Nosaj Thing]], Imogen Heap, [[Four Tet]],&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; and [[James Yorkston]].&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; He was also one of the few producers chosen by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s [[Rob Da Bank]] to remix film director [[David Lynch]]'s first electronica release, "Good Day Today" / "I Know", which was released on Sunday Best Records.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===2008–09: ''Insides''===
{{main|Insides}}
Hopkins signed to [[Domino Recording Company]] in late 2008.&lt;ref name="soundcl"/&gt; Hopkins's third album, ''[[Insides]]'', was released by Domino Records on 5 May 2009.&lt;ref name="tinymix"/&gt; It included the track "Light Through the Veins", which had previously been used on the [[Coldplay]] album, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''. Some of the tracks had been written by Hopkins sporadically since his last release, while others were based on the music he had composed for the ''Entity'' production.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; Hopkins developed an intense live show to support the release, resulting in club and festival performances across Europe and the United States. He secured supporting slots with [[The xx]], [[Röyksopp]], and Four Tet.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; Many of his live shows used background visuals featuring the animations of Vince Collins.&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt;

''Insides'' charted at no. 15 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance/Electronic Albums chart.&lt;ref name="billb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; ''[[PopMatters]]'' listed the album as one of the top ten electronic albums of 2009.&lt;ref name="moog"/&gt; According to reviews, the album "takes its cues from [[ambient music|ambient]] electronica, but uses strings and piano, along with some very tasty beats and [[dubstep]]-influenced bass on some tracks."&lt;ref name="hollo"/&gt; ''TinyMixTapes'' stated the album&lt;blockquote&gt;strikes me as his single most aggressive release yet. His sense of timing, the clarity of his production, and the variety of effects he employs draw you into the story that each instrumental tells. Jon Hopkins is not a button-pushing man of presets; he is a bona fide composer and a trained pianist. Craftsmanship sets him apart, and allows ''Insides'' to be as incredibly moving as it is and always will be. It will easily be one of the best electronic albums of 2009.&lt;ref name="tinymix"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Paul Clarke of the BBC wrote that&lt;blockquote&gt;Hopkins [is] capable of producing music as epic, soaring and emotional as any power ballad in his own way. Take "Light Through The Veins" for example ... a close relative of [[Ulrich Schnauss]]' "In All The Wrong Places", it's a majestic piece of widescreen [[shoegazing]] which grows ever more expansive throughout its entire ten-minute duration ... no amount of reflected glory could ever fully illuminate ''Insides''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; mysterious depths.&lt;ref name="bbcyo"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===2009–13: Pure Scenius, film scores===
[[File:Jon Hopkins (5571448335).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hopkins performing live in 2011]]
In June 2009 Hopkins was invited by Brian Eno to play some solo shows at the Luminous Festival at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. A few weeks prior to leaving, Eno asked Hopkins to join with himself, [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s [[Karl Hyde]], Leo Abrahams, and the Sydney-based improv trio [[The Necks]] in the group "Pure Scenius", the planned finale for the Luminous Festival.&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; They then improvised music based on pre-planned themes, putting on three 1½-hour shows in the Opera House with Hyde on vocals. Pure Scenius was repeated a year later in [[Brighton]], when Eno was curating the [[Brighton Festival]].&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt;

In 2009, Hopkins collaborated with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams to score the [[Peter Jackson]] film ''[[The Lovely Bones (film)|The Lovely Bones]].''&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; In early 2010, Hopkins composed the score for the short film ''Rob and Valentyna in Scotland'' directed by Eric Lynne, which won an honourable mention for the short film-making award at [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Also in 2010 Hopkins was commissioned to create the soundtrack for the British science fiction film ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'', which was directed by [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]].&lt;ref name="dominoromonsters"/&gt; To create the score, Hopkins partly used string parts performed by arranger [[Davide Rossi]] and guitar by Leo Abrahams.&lt;ref name="dominvor"/&gt; The soundtrack album was released on 29 November 2010 on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]].&lt;ref name="amazonmonsters"/&gt; In 2011 the score was nominated for an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Original Score.&lt;ref name="dominvor"/&gt;

===2009–12: Collaborations===
{{See also|Small Craft on a Milk Sea|Diamond Mine (King Creosote &amp; Jon Hopkins album)|Honest Words}}
Hopkins collaborated with [[Tunng]] on the EP ''Seven Gulps of Air'' in 2009, which was commissioned by designer Christopher Kelly for [[London Fashion Week]].&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; ''Seven Gulps of Air'' was listed as one of ''[[Drowned in Sound]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s singles of the year.&lt;ref name="singelofyear"/&gt;

In 2010 Hopkins collaborated with Leo Abrahams and Brian Eno to create the album ''[[Small Craft on a Milk Sea]]''. Released on [[Warp Records]] in late 2010,&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; the album is based on a three-week session of improvisation wherein the artists recorded about six hours of material a day.&lt;ref name="moog"/&gt;

In 2011 Hopkins collaborated with Scottish musician King Creosote to create the album ''[[Diamond Mine (King Creosote and Jon Hopkins album)|Diamond Mine]]'', which featured lyrics and vocals by Creosote sung over musical backdrops arranged and recorded by Hopkins. The album was a culmination of about seven weeks of work spread over seven years of recording and collaboration,&lt;ref name="clubbers"/&gt; from whenever the two artists had the opportunity to get together. The album was released on 28 March 2011&lt;ref name="soundcl"/&gt; to acclaim,&lt;ref name="colplay"/&gt; which included a glowing review from [[NPR]]. On 19 July 2011 Hopkins and Anderson were announced as nominees for the 2011 [[Barclaycard Mercury Prize]], which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

Also in 2011, the EP ''[[Honest Words]]'', a Hopkins collaboration with King Creosote, was released on Domino Records. In April 2012, this was followed by another collaboration with King Creosote: ''The Jubilee'', also on Domino.

Hopkins wrote the score for the 2013 film by [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]], ''[[How I Live Now (film)|How I Live Now]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===2013: ''Immunity''===

|style="text-align: left;"| "[Hopkins] created the album's warm, alive feel by shunning digital perfection in favor of the analog synthesis of original sounds, both electronic and physical. The ambient prelude of the haunting, scrambled glitch-house opener 'We Disappear'—a key unlocks the door of Hopkins' London studio and his footsteps lead in—is more than idle window dressing: He is ushering us into the tactile space that suffuses the record. He drums on desks, plays salt shakers, slows down serendipitous recordings of nearby fireworks, boosts the kick-drummed rattle of a window."

''[[Immunity (Jon Hopkins album)|Immunity]]'' is Hopkins' fourth studio album, released on 4 June 2013, by Domino Records.&lt;ref name="ohpitchfor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="imomh"/&gt; Among the artists that contributed vocals were long-time collaborator King Creosote, and Corin Roddick and Megan James of the band [[Purity Ring (band)|Purity Ring]].&lt;ref name="immauneall"/&gt; It was recorded and produced in Hopkins' London studio, with Hopkins often using homemade sound effects or the natural sound of the room.&lt;ref name="ohpitchfor"/&gt; Stated ''[[MixMag]]'', "''Immunity'' is an album of organic techno and exquisite mini-symphonies."&lt;ref name="emmixmag"/&gt;

''Immunity'' peaked at no. 13 on [[Top Electronic Albums]] by ''Billboard'' in the United States.&lt;ref name="immunbill"/&gt; In Britain it was nominated for the 2013 [[Mercury Prize]] for best album.&lt;ref name="mercuryshortlist"/&gt; The album met with a largely positive reception among critics, receiving perfect scores from ''Mixmag''&lt;ref name="emmixmag"/&gt; and [[MusicOMH]],&lt;ref name="imomh"/&gt; and 4/5 from ''The Guardian.''&lt;ref name="spnguardian"/&gt; [[Pitchfork Media]] described ''Immunity'' as a "remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record,"&lt;ref name="ohpitchfor"/&gt; and MusicOMH called it a "modern classic".&lt;ref name="imomh"/&gt;

The video for the single 'Open Eye Signal' directed by [[Aoife McArdle]] won best cinematography at the [[UK Music Video Awards]].

===2014–present: Recent projects and ''Singularity''===
{{main|Singularity (Jon Hopkins album)}}
In 2014 Hopkins co-produced the song "[[Midnight (Coldplay song)|Midnight]]" for Coldplay's 2014 album ''[[Ghost Stories (Coldplay album)|Ghost Stories]]'', and released an [[Extended Play|EP]] titled ''Asleep Versions'' on 10 November. The EP includes (according to [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]]) "four decelerated, dreamlike re-imaginings" of four tracks featured on his album ''[[Immunity (Jon Hopkins album)|Immunity]]''. The EP has additional vocals from [[Raphaelle Standell-Preston]] of the band [[Braids (band)|Braids]] &amp; regular collaborator [[King Creosote]], and artwork from Robert Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/news/25-09-14/jon-hopkins-asleep-versions-ep-10th-november-2014/|title=Jon Hopkins 'Asleep Versions EP' announcement from Domino Recs|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live performances==
Hopkins has performed at music festivals such as [[Moogfest]],&lt;ref name="moog"/&gt; [[Mutek]],&lt;ref name="mutek"/&gt; Beacons Festival, and [[Electric Zoo]],&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt; and at venues such as Madison Square Garden&lt;ref name="patriarch"/&gt; and the London O2 Arena.&lt;ref name="coldint"/&gt; As of 2014 he maintains a regular touring schedule both in England and internationally, playing at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June, with upcoming dates at the [[Pitchfork Music Festival]], [[Electric Picnic]] and Time Music Festival and in 2015 at [[Wonderfruit]] in Thailand for the premiere of the iy_project, a collaboration with light artist, [[Chris Levine]].&lt;ref name="live"&gt;{{cite news

==Style and equipment==
;Style and genre
According to reviews, "Hopkins's aesthetic is perpetually intriguing. He transcends genres, melding digital coldness with subtle, bucolic textures; veering from skewed elegance to strange, unsettling depths."&lt;ref name="opal"/&gt; "He makes powerfully emotive, instrumental music that consistently crosses genres, ranging from solo acoustic piano to explosive, bass-heavy electro."&lt;ref name="dom"/&gt; Also, he "meticulously constructs lush, downtempo arrangements, blending digital beats and soothing ambience."&lt;ref name="jasn"/&gt;

;Equipment and software
As of September 2010 his studio setup relies on a [[Logic Studio|Logic]] system,&lt;ref name="kirn"/&gt; though all his previous releases were on [[Cubase|Cubase VST]], used in conjunction with an old version of [[SoundForge]].&lt;ref name="ibzia"/&gt; He began using Logic because his old system was not powerful enough to include the video for film soundtracks.&lt;ref name="kirn"/&gt; His live setup includes [[Ableton Live|Ableton]] and a chain of up to five [[Kaoss Pad]]s.

==Personal life==
Hopkins practices [[autogenic training]] and [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]], of which he says, "For me, it's not about relaxing. It can get music flowing in a way that's really uninhibited, and I want to spend as much time in that place as possible."&lt;ref name=latimes2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=August|title=Jon Hopkins crafts dance music to meditate on|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-dj-jon-hopkins-dance-music-20140725-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Käthe Fanny Schuftan''' (12 January 1899 – 21 February 1958) was a German Jewish artist whose paintings and drawings expressed both human suffering and the aspiration of spirit,&lt;ref&gt;Tribute given at her funeral by [[Eugene Halliday]], {{cite web|url=http://www.eugenehalliday.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Halliday-Review-Winter-2012-2013-Vol-2-Issue-2.pdf|title=Halliday Review Winter 2012–2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}} p. 21 (22 of pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 20th century. Josef Paul Hodin wrote that she "worked in an Expressionist style reminiscent of [[Käthe Kollwitz]]' social pathos".&lt;ref name="Hodin"&gt;Josef Paul Hodin, "[[John Milne (sculptor)|John Milne]]: sculptor, life and work", London: Latimer New Dimensions 1977, Section 2, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; An artist at the time of the [[Weimar culture]], she was tortured and imprisoned by the Nazis in the early 1930s, and her work was destroyed. She escaped in 1939, arriving in [[Manchester]], England, not long before the outbreak of the [[World War II]]; she lived and worked there until her death in 1958.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Obituary, by [[Margo Ingham]], ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 24 February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breslau==
Käthe Fanny Schuftan was born on 12 January 1899 in [[Breslau]], now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]; her father was the chemist Dr. Georg Schuftan, her mother Else née Mugdan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeion.net/repo/82/1425/PL_82_1425_0_0_337/index.djvu|title=Archiwum Państwowe we Wrocławiu, sygn. 1425 (Standesamt Breslau I), seria 1 (Geburtenregister), 1899, tom 1|accessdate=1 February 2015}} Nr. 88, p. 49/206 in DejaVu version&lt;/ref&gt; The chemist [[Paul Schuftan]] was her older brother.

'''Mar Qardagh''' ({{lang-syc|ܡܪܝ ܩܪܕܐܓ}}), was a [[Sassanid]] prince who was [[Christian martyrs|martyred]] for converting to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Walker2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Walker|title=The Legend of Mar Qardagh: Narrative and Christian Heroism in Late Antique Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2UoQttQcy0C|date=25 March 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93219-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Qardagh was born to a noble family in the [[Sassanid Empire]] during the 4th century. When Qardagh was 25 years old, [[Shapur II]] visited his parents’ estate and was impressed with Qardagh’s handsome appearance and athleticism. Qardagh was appointed as a governor for a large region in northern [[Persia]], there he met [[Abdisho]] ({{lang|syc|ܥܒܕܝܫܘܥ}}) and converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name=stpeter&gt;[http://www.kaldu.org/EasternSaints/MarQardagh.html Mar Qardagh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129054301/http://www.kaldu.org/EasternSaints/MarQardagh.html |date=2011-11-29 }}, St. Peter The Apostle Catholic Diocese for Chaldeans.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning home Qardagh was rejected by his family and under pressure from the religious elite, Shapur sentenced him to be [[Stoning|stoned]]. Qardagh fled with a small army to the mountains where he was able to repel the Persians for months. One night [[Saint Stephen]] appeared to him and told him that it was better to give his life for his faith than to continue fighting. He surrendered to the king and it was his own father who threw the first stone.&lt;ref name=stpeter/&gt;

He was buried in [[Arbil]], [[Adiabene]] where a church holding his relics was later constructed.&lt;ref name=stpeter/&gt;

'''Michel de Certeau''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁto|lang}}; 17 May 1925 – 9 January 1986) was a [[French people|French]] [[Jesuit]] and scholar whose work combined [[history]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[philosophy]], and the [[social sciences]].

==Education==
Michel Jean Emmanuel de La Barge de Certeau was born in 1925 in [[Chambéry]], [[Savoie]].  Certeau's education was eclectic, following the medieval tradition of ''peregrinatio academica''.&lt;ref&gt;Luce Giard, ''Michel de Certeau in the Americas. A conference in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Michel de Certeau’s death'', Dept. of History, UC San Diego, February 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After obtaining degrees in [[classics]] and [[philosophy]] at the universities of [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], he studied the works of [[Pierre Favre]] (1506–1546) at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (Paris) with [[Jean Orcibal]]. He undertook religious training at a [[seminary]] in [[Lyon]], where he entered the [[Jesuit]] order (Society of Jesus) in 1950 and was ordained in 1956.  Certeau entered the Society of Jesus hoping to do missionary work in [[China]]. In the year of his ordination, Certeau became one of the founders of the journal ''Christus'', with which he would actively be involved for much of his life. In 1960 he earned his doctorate ("thèse de 3e Cycle") at the  [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] with a study of co-founder of the Society of Jesus Pierre Favre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuites.com/histoire/certeau.htm Jesuites.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910002903/http://www.jesuites.com/histoire/certeau.htm |date=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Sorbonne is a secular state university where theology may not be taught) before embarking on his celebrated study of [[Jean-Joseph Surin]].

== Professional life ==
Certeau was greatly influenced by [[Sigmund Freud]] and was, along with [[Jacques Lacan]], one of the founding members of ''[[École Freudienne de Paris]]'', an informal group which served as a focal point for French scholars interested in psychoanalysis. He came to public attention after publishing an article dealing with the [[May 1968 events in France]]. He also took part in [[Robert Jaulin]]'s department of ethnology at the [[University of Paris-VII]] after May 68.

Certeau went on to teach at several universities in locations as diverse as [[Geneva]], [[San Diego]], and [[Paris]]. Through the 1970s and 1980s he produced a string of works that demonstrated his interest in [[mysticism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[psychoanalysis]].  He died in Paris, aged 60.

===''The Practice of Everyday Life''===
Certeau's most well-known and influential work in the United States has been ''[[The Practice of Everyday Life]]''[[The Practice of Everyday Life|,]] cited in fields such as rhetoric,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickinson|first=Greg|date=2006|title=The Pleasantville Effect: Nostaliga and the Visual Framing of (White) Suburbia|url=|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=70|pages=212-33|doi=10.1080/10570310600843504|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Kendall R.|date=2006|title=Rhetorical Maneuvers: Subjectivity, Power, and Resistance|url=|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|volume=39|pages=310-32|doi=10.1353/par.2007.0005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; performance studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories of Performance|last=Bell|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Sage|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Kevin A.|date=2017|title=Student cyberbullying inside the digital schoolhouse gate: Toward a standard for determining where a “School” is|url=|journal=First Amendment Studies|volume=51|pages=30-48|doi=10.1080/21689725.2016.1278177|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Practice of Everyday Life'', Certeau combined his disparate scholarly interests to develop a theory of the productive and consumptive activity inherent in [[everyday life]].  According to Certeau, everyday life is distinctive from other practices of daily existence because it is repetitive and unconscious. Certeau’s study of everyday life is neither the study of “popular culture”, nor is it necessarily the study of everyday resistances to regimes of power.  Instead, he attempts to outline the way individuals unconsciously navigate everything from city streets to literary texts.

''The Practice of Everyday Life'' has been a subject of study for its distinction between the concepts of [[strategy]] and [[tactic (method)|tactics]].  Certeau links "strategies" with institutions and structures of power who are the "producers", while individuals are "consumers" or "poachers," acting in accordance with, or against, environments defined by strategies by using "tactics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Practice of Everyday Life|last=Certeau|first=Michel de|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=xvi, xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the chapter "Walking in the City", Certeau asserts that "the city" is generated by the strategies of governments, corporations, and other institutional bodies who produce things like maps that describe the city as a unified whole.  Certeau uses the vantage from the World Trade Center in New York to illustrate the idea of a synoptic, unified view.  By contrast, the walker at street level moves in ways that are tactical and never fully determined by the plans of organizing bodies, taking shortcuts in spite of the strategic grid of the streets. Certeau's argument is that everyday life works by a process of poaching on the territory of others, using the rules and products that already exist in culture in a way that is influenced, but never wholly determined, by those rules and products.

According to Andrew Blauvelt who relies on the work of Certeau in his essay on design and everyday life:&lt;ref&gt;''Strangely Familiar: Design and Everyday Life'', edited by Andrew Blauvelt, Walker Art Center. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Certeau's investigations into the realm of routine practices, or the "arts of doing" such as walking, talking, reading, dwelling, and cooking, were guided by his belief that despite repressive aspects of modern society, there exists an element of creative resistance to these strictures enacted by ordinary people. In ''The Practice of Everyday Life'', de Certeau outlines an important critical distinction between strategies and tactics in this battle of repression and expression. According to him, strategies are used by those within organizational power structures, whether small or large, such as the state or municipality, the corporation or the proprietor, a scientific enterprise or the scientist. Strategies are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations for official or proper ends, whether adversaries, competitors, clients, customers, or simply subjects. Tactics, on the other hand, are employed by those who are subjugated. By their very nature tactics are defensive and opportunistic, used in more limited ways and seized momentarily within spaces, both physical and psychological, produced and governed by more powerful strategic relations."

===''The Writing of History''===
His work ''The Writing of History'', translated into English after his death, deals with the relationship between [[history]] and [[religion]].  De Certeau makes a point in linking the history of writing history to the legitimization of political power and that "Western" traditions of history involve using the act of writing as a tool of colonialism; writing their own histories while un-writing the embodied traditions of native peoples.

'''Monsignor''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|iː|n|j|ər}}; {{lang-it|monsignore}} {{IPA-it|monsiɲˈɲoːre|}}) is an honorific [[form of address]] for those members of the [[clergy]] of the Roman [[Catholic Church]] including bishops, honorary prelates and canons. In some cases, these [[ecclesiastical]] [[honorific]] titles derive from the pope, but in other cases it is simply a customary or honorary style belonging to a prelate or honorary prelate. These are granted to individuals who have rendered valuable service to the Church, or who provide some special function in Church governance, or who are members of bodies such as certain [[chapter (religion)|chapters]]. Although in some languages the word is used as a form of address for bishops, which is indeed its primary use in those languages, this is not customary in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0077.html Catholic Education Resource Center, "ow to Address Church Officials"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monsignor'' is the [[apocope|apocopic]] form of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''monsignore'', from the [[French language|French]] ''mon seigneur'', meaning "my lord".

"Monsignor" is a form of address, not an appointment: properly speaking, one cannot be "made a monsignor" or be "the monsignor of a parish". The title or form of address is associated with certain papal awards, which [[Pope Paul VI]] reduced to three classes: those of [[Protonotary Apostolic]], [[Honorary Prelate]], and [[Chaplain of His Holiness]].

Apart from those working in the [[Roman Curia]] and the diplomatic service of the [[Holy See]], it is usually on the proposal of the local [[bishop]] that the Pope grants this title to Catholic diocesan clergy. The grant is subject to criteria of the Holy See that include a minimum age.

Soon after his election in March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] suspended the granting of the honorific title of Monsignor except to members of the Holy See's diplomatic service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.finesettimana.org/pmwiki/uploads/Stampa201309/130912giansoldati.pdf | title = Il Messaggero | date = 12 September 2013 | publisher = Fine settimana | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=Sep 2013 |url=http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2013/09/monsignor-moratorium.html |newspaper=The Tablet |publisher=Rorate Cæli |title=Pope scales back honorifics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108044215/http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2013/09/monsignor-moratorium.html |archivedate=January 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year he communicated his definitive decision to accept no further requests from bishops for appointments to any class but that of Chaplain of His Holiness, the lowest of the three classes, and that candidates presented must be at least 65 years old. He himself, during his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, never asked that any of his priests receive the title, and he was understood to associate it with clerical "careerism".&lt;ref name=Stampa/&gt; Grants already made were not revoked.&lt;ref name= Stampa&gt;{{cite news| last = O'Connell | first = Gerard| title= Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65 |url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 | newspaper =Vatican Insider|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNS&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1400044.htm | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140107054138/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1400044.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2014-01-07 | newspaper = Catholic News Service | title = Pope limits 'monsignor' honor for diocesan priests }}.{{broken citation|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VR&gt;{{Citation | url = http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/01/07/pope_francis_reforms_ecclesiastical_honours/en1-761830 | newspaper = Vatican Radio | date = 7 January 2014 | title = Pope Francis reforms ecclesiastical honours}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointments to all three classes of awards continue to be granted to officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, and there was no revocation of privileges granted to certain bodies such as chapters of [[canon (priest)|canons]] whereby all their members or some of them have the rank of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate or Chaplain of His Holiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Annuario Pontificio | year = 2013 | publisher = Vaticana | ISBN = 978-88-209-9070-1 | pages = 1846–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unaffected is the association of the style with the office of [[vicar general]], an appointment made by the bishop of the diocese, not by the Pope. Without necessarily being a protonotary apostolic, a [[diocesan priest]] has that titular rank as long as he remains in office.

==Title and forms of address==
Although in some languages, "Monsignore", "[[Monseigneur]]", "Monsenyor", "Monseñor", and the like are normal forms of address for all higher prelates of the Catholic Church below the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] or [[patriarch]], including bishops and archbishops, in English bishops are not usually addressed as "Monsignor", a title reserved in English for diocesan priests who have received certain specific honorary awards or who hold certain offices.

The written form of address for such a priest is ''Monsignor (first name) (last name)'' or ''The Reverend Monsignor (first name) (last name)''. The spoken form of address is ''Monsignor (last name)''.{{Sfn | Secretary of State | 2000 | ps =: “26. For Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotaries, Prelates of Honour and Chaplains of His Holiness there may be used the title 'Monsignor', preceded, where appropriate, by 'Reverend'”.}}

Before the simplification of ecclesiastical titles in 1969, those of the lowest class were addressed in English as ''The Very Reverend Monsignor'' (in Latin, ''Reverendissimus Dominus''; in Italian, ''Reverendissimo Monsignore'') and those belonging to the higher classes were addressed as ''The Right Reverend Monsignor'' (in Latin, ''Illustrissimus et Reverendissimus Dominus''; in Italian, ''Illustrissimo e Reverendissimo Monsignore'').

The 1969 Instruction of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] indicated that the title of "Monsignor" may be used for bishops. This is normal practice in [[Italian (language)|Italian]], [[French (language)|French]], [[Catalan (language)|Catalan]], and [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], but not in English. The same instruction indicated that, in the case of bishops, "Reverendissimus" (usually translated in this case as "Most Reverend", rather than "Very Reverend"), may be added to the word "Monsignor", as also in the case of prelates without episcopal rank who head offices of the [[Roman Curia]], judges of the [[Sacra Rota Romana|Rota]], the Promotor General of Justice and the Defender of the Bond of the [[Apostolic Signatura]], the Protonotaries Apostolic "''de numero''", and the four Clerics of the Camera.{{Sfn | Secretary of State | 2000 | loc = 23–25}} The (in meaning identical) predicate "His Lordship" or "Your Lordship" is, in English, used as a clerical title only for bishops.

==Classes of monsignori==
Until 1968 there were at least 14 different grades, including domestic prelates, four kinds of [[protonotary apostolic|protonotaries apostolic]], four kinds of papal chamberlains, and at least five types of papal chaplains.{{Sfn | Galles | 1999}}

Pope Paul VI in his ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968 reduced the grades to three. Since then, protonotaries apostolic have been classified either ''de numero'' or supernumerary. Most of the former classes of chamberlains and chaplains were abolished, leaving only a single class of "Chaplains of His Holiness", a specifically priestly-sounding category.&lt;ref name=Cappellani&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2012, p. 1853&lt;/ref&gt;

The three ranks established by Pope Paul VI are, in descending order of precedence:
* [[Protonotary Apostolic]], of which two types were retained:
** ''de numero'' (the higher and less common form, customarily only seven)
** supernumerary (the highest grade of monsignor found outside Rome)
* [[Honorary Prelate]] of His Holiness (formerly "Domestic Prelate")&lt;ref name="Cappellani"/&gt;
* [[Chaplain of His Holiness]] (formerly "Supernumerary Privy Chamberlain")&lt;ref name=Cappellani /&gt;

Before 1968 the appointment of a Privy Chamberlain expired at the death of the Pope who granted it. This no longer holds.&lt;ref name=Cappellani/&gt; Those listed in the index of the ''Annuario Pontificio'' as Chaplains of His Holiness continue to be listed in the edition that follow the death of the Pope, as after the deaths of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I in 1978 and after that of Pope John Paul II in 2005.

In 2014, Pope Francis abolished the practice of granting priests under the age of 65 the title of "monsignor".  However, existing members of all three ranks established by Pope Paul VI retain their membership. Higher ranks are still attained by virtue of membership of certain chapters of canons or because of being a vicar general, and new appointments continue to be made for officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See.&lt;ref name=Stampa /&gt;&lt;ref name =CNS /&gt;&lt;ref name= VR/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ecclesiastical dress==
The 1969 Instruction of the Secretariat of State also simplified the [[choir dress|dress]] of monsignori.

* Chaplains of His Holiness use a purple-trimmed black [[cassock]] with purple [[Fascia (sash)|sash]] for all occasions.
* Honorary Prelates use a red-trimmed black cassock with purple sash for all occasions. The red is the same shade as that used by bishops. They may use a purple cassock as their choir dress for liturgical events of special solemnity.
* Supernumerary Protonotaries Apostolic dress the same as Honorary Prelates. As an additional privilege, they have the option of also using a purple ''[[ferraiuolo]]'', a silk cape worn with the red-trimmed black cassock for non-liturgical events of special solemnity (for instance, graduations and commencements).
* Protonotaries Apostolic ''de numero'' (and other superior prelates of the offices of the Roman curia who are not bishops and who, as indicated above, may be addressed as Most Reverend Monsignor) have the same dress as other Protonotaries Apostolic, but wear the [[mantelletta]] in choir and a black [[biretta]] with a red tuft. They are thus called ''prelati di mantelletta'' (prelates of the mantelletta) because of this distinctive item of dress.

==Other monsignori==
Under legislation of [[Pope Pius X]], [[vicar general|vicars general]] and [[vicar capitular|vicars capitular]] (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries ''durante munere'', i.e. as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Pariter, qui vicarii generalis aut etiam capitularis munere fungitur, hoc munere dumtaxat perdurante, erit protonotarius titularis | author-link = Pope Pius X | author = Pope Pius X | title = Inter multiplices curas | at = 62 | date = 21 February 1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only privileges of dress that Pope Pius X granted them were a black silk fringed sash ([[fascia (sash)|fascia]]), black piping on the biretta with a black tuft,&lt;ref&gt;"Super habitu quotidiano, occasione solemnis conventus, audientiae et similium... zonam tantum sericam nigram, cum laciniis item nigris, gestare poterunt, cum pileo chordula ac floccis nigris ornato" (''Inter multiplices curas'', 67).&lt;/ref&gt; and a black [[mantelletta]]. As a result of this they were in some countries referred to as "black protonotaries".{{Sfn | Noonan | 1996}}{{Page needed | date = January 2014}}  However, ''Pontificalis domus'' of Paul VI removed this position (titular protonotaries) from the [[Papal Household]], even though the title of "monsignor", which is to be distinguished from a prelatial rank, has not been withdrawn from vicars general, as can be seen, for instance, from the placing of the abbreviated title "Mons." before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]''.

Under Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum qualifications of age and priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 years of age and 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in view of the fact that, as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.&lt;ref name= Stampa/&gt;

A '''pantheon''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πάνθεον ''pantheon'', literally "(a temple) of all [[deity|gods]]", "of or common to all gods" from [[wikt:παν|πᾶν]] ''pan-'' "all" and [[wikt:θεός|θεός]] ''theos'' "god") is the particular set of all gods of any [[polytheistic]] [[religion]], [[mythology]], or tradition.

==Significance==
A pantheon of gods is a common element of polytheistic societies, although not all polytheists have such a pantheon, and not all pantheons require a polytheistic worldview.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The nature of a society's pantheon can be considered a reflection of that society:

{{quote|A pantheon is an overview of a given culture's gods and goddesses and reflects not only the society's values but also its sense of itself. A pantheon directed by a thunderboltwielding autocrat might suggest a patriarchy and the valuing of warrior skills. A pantheon headed by a great-mother goddess could suggest a village-based agricultural society. To confront the pantheon of the Egyptians is to confront a worldview marked by a sense of death and resurrection and the agricultural importance of the cycles of nature. The Greek pantheon is a metaphor for a pragmatic view of life that values art, beauty, and the power of the individual, and that is somewhat skeptical about human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Fee, ''Gods, Heroes, &amp; Kings: The Battle for Mythic Britain'' (2004), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]] gods and the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Post-classical polytheistic religions include [[Norse mythology|Norse]] Æsir and Vanir, the [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] Orisha, the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as "[[mythology]]",&lt;ref&gt;Eugenie C. Scott, ''Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction'' (2009), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; though the stories cultures tell about their gods should be distinguished from their worship or religious practice. For instance, deities portrayed in conflict in mythology would still be worshipped sometimes in the same temple side by side, illustrating the distinction in the devotees mind between the myth and the reality.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Evolution of pantheons==
Scholars such as [[Jaan Puhvel]], [[J. P. Mallory]], and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] have reconstructed aspects of the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], from which the religions of the various [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European peoples]] derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of ''[[Dyeus|*dyēus]]'', which is attested in several distinct religious systems.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

In many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek [[Titanomachia]], and possibly also the case of the [[Æsir]] and [[Vanir]] in the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythos]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Cultural exchange could lead to "the same" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian deity [[Osiris]], which was later followed in [[ancient Greece]]. [[Max Weber]]'s 1922 opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'' discusses tendency in the ancient Greek philosophers to interpret gods worshiped in the pantheons of other cultures as "equivalent to and so identical with the deities of the moderately organized Greek pantheon".&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[[Max Weber]], ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1922), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other instances, however, national pantheons were consolidated or simplified into fewer gods, or into a single god with power over all of the areas originally assigned to a pantheon.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} For example, in the ancient Near East during the first millennium BCE, [[Syria]]n and [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] tribes worshiped much smaller pantheons than had been developed in Egypt and Mesopotamia.&lt;ref name="Gnuse"&gt;Robert Karl Gnuse, ''No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel'' (1997), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber also identified the link between a pantheon of gods and the development of [[monotheism]], proposing that the domination of a pantheon by a particular god within that pantheon was a step towards followers of the pantheon seeing that god as "an international or universal deity, a transnational god of the entire world".&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt; The first known instance of a pantheon being consolidated into a single god, or discarded in favor of a single god, was with the development of the short-lived practice of [[Atenism]] in ancient Egypt, with that role being accorded to the sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Karl Gnuse, ''No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel'' (1997), p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process is thought to have taken place with respect to the Israelite deity [[Yahweh]], who, "as a typical West Semitic deity... would have four or five compatriot gods in attendance as he became the national high god".&lt;ref name="Gnuse"/&gt;

The concept of a pantheon of gods has been widely imitated in Twentieth-century [[fantasy literature]] and [[role-playing games]] like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. These uses tend to borrow heavily from historical patterns. In these contexts, it is considered important for the writer to construct pantheon of gods that fits the genre, where the characteristics of the gods are in balance so that none of them is able to overwhelm the story, and so that the actions of the characters are not overwhelmed by the machinations of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;William Sims Bainbridge, ''eGods: Faith versus Fantasy in Computer Gaming'' (2013), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension of the concept into structures and celebrities==

In order to avoid the difficulty of giving an exhaustive list of deities when devoting a [[temple]] or sacred building, a structure explicitly dedicated to "all deities" also came to be referred to as a "Pantheon".&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Edmund Thomas, "From the pantheon of the gods to the Pantheon of Rome", in Matthew Craske, ed., ''Pantheons: Transformations of a Monumental Idea'' (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known of such structures is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] of [[Rome]], first built between the years 27 BCE and 14 CE.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The building standing today was constructed on the same site around 126 CE.  It was dedicated to "all gods" as a gesture embracing the religious [[syncretism]] in the increasingly multicultural [[Roman Empire]], with subjects worshipping gods from many cultures and traditions. The building was later renovated for use as a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church (building)|church]] in 609 under [[Pope Boniface IV]].&lt;ref&gt;John the Deacon, ''Monumenta Germaniae Historia'' (1848) 7.8.20, quoted in {{cite book |last=MacDonald|first = William L.|title=The Pantheon: Design, Meaning, and Progeny |publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1976|isbn=0-674-01019-1|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[T]he relation between the building and the primary reference point of the term 'pantheon', the pantheon of the gods, has always been a matter of the greatest uncertainty. By the sixteenth century these two aspects, the building and the grouping of gods, had become merged, to the extent that the building in Rome became the principal model for subsequent 'pantheons'.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;}}

Since the 16th century, "pantheon" has also been used in a secular sense to refer to the set of a society's exalted persons—initially including heroic figures, and later extending to celebrities, generally.&lt;ref name="C-W"&gt;Matthew Craske and Richard Wrigley, "Introduction", in Matthew Craske, ed., ''Pantheons: Transformations of a Monumental Idea'' (2004), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is hinted at in previous references; for example, [[Jove]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European_religion#Pantheon|proto-Indo-European pantheon]] (whose other linguistic forms are "deus" and "divus") meant 'god, rich man'.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} [[Lord Byron]] drew this connection after viewing the busts of famous historical figures in the Roman Pantheon, writing in ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' of how he wished to be at the center of an English Pantheon, and thereby associated with divinity.&lt;ref name="Tuite"&gt;Clara Tuite, ''Lord Byron and Scandalous Celebrity'' (2015), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pantheon "thus imbues the modern with the aura of the divine", and "models the interplay of ancient and modern forms of fame".&lt;ref name="Tuite"/&gt; This trend continued into modern times, with the word "pantheon" 'of or for the gods' being reflected in the journalistic meme that refers to financial titans as "Masters of the Universe". For example: [[Francis Ford Coppola]] has been described as a member of "that revered pantheon of independent movie directors, which broke the standard Hollywood studio mould as the 1960s expired".&lt;ref&gt;Simon Warner, ''Text and Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: The Beats and Rock Culture'' (2013), p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sibghatullah Shah Rashidi''' II ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پير صبغت الله شاه راشدي شهيد}}}}; ([[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]) صبغت الله شاهه راشدي ), [[Pir Pagaro]] the sixth, was a spiritual leader of the [[Hurs|Hur Movement]] during [[Sindh]]'s independence struggle against British colonial rule. ''Hur'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''' حر''' meaning "free", "not slave") is a [[Sufi]] [[Muslim]] community in the province of [[Sindh]], Pakistan.

''Soreh Badshah'' (شهيد سورهيه بادشاهه) (the Victorious King) is the title given him by his admirers. He was hanged by British rulers on 20 March 1943 in the Central Jail [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], Sindh. His burial place remains unknown, despite requests to the British from people in Sindh.

== Independence Movement ==

According to Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan, the Hur movement began with Sibghtullah Shah Badshah I [1831-1779]. It reached its peak in the time of Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Suraih Badshah when the Hurs became aggressive against British rule. Many were imprisoned in the Vasarpur district [[Ahmednagar|Ahmed Nagar]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2013}}

Sibghatullah Shah I provided forces to Syed Ahmed Shaheed to fight the Sikhs. Since that time these people have been called "Hurs" [free people]. The independence struggle was started by Syed Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Awal in 1246 [Hijri].

Pagaras' and their followers fought against the British for 108 years, from 1843 to 1951.

In 1922, Sibghtullah Shah II (Soreh Badshah) became [[Pir Pagara]] at age 12. He believed that British officers' behaviour towards Hur Jamat and the Sindhi people was insulting and humiliating. He resented their behaviour and raised his voice against British rule. He organised the struggle against British rulers and encouraged others to do the same. As a result, [[martial law]] was imposed to control the Hur movement. [[Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II|Pir Sahib]] established Gring Bungalow as his general headquarters. He recruited and trained followers to continue an armed struggle. Their slogans were "homeland or death" and "freedom or death".

The "Lahore mail" railway train was derailed by Hurs on 16 May 1942.
When Hurs attacked the army and police they raised the slogan of "Bhej Pagaara". In an effort to rush the Hurs, their center Gring Bungalow was bombarded and destroyed on 26 May 1943. Pir Soreh Badshah was arrested on 24 October 1941 and imprisoned in Seoni in India.

The Hurs intensified their activities against the colonial government by attacking police stations, government buildings and railway stations as well as telephone and irrigation systems to paralyse society and to pressure the British to release their spiritual leader.

Dargah Sharif and the bungalow in Pir Jo Goth were destroyed in 1943.

In 1942 important leaders in Sindh Prant were arrested. [[Pir Sahib Pagara]] was brought from Seoni to Sindh in January 1943 and was detained in the central jail in Hyderabad. The Hurs established the [[Makhi]] forest as their base.

The Government then began air bombing Gring Bungalow, Makhi Forest and Dargah Sharif. They arrested thousands of Hur leaders along with their families and kept them in concentration camps until 1952.

Jail employees told the writer Nasir Jamal that they had heard from the ancestors that Soreh Badshah was buried outside of Phasi Ghat (place of execution) in the central jail at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], Sindh, Pakistan. Because they anticipated an extreme reaction by the Hur Mujahid. The British authorities did not disclose the place of burial. They also flattened the surrounding land.

== History of the Hur Movement ==

During British rule (according to ''Voice of Sureh'' by Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan), Pir Pagaro declared his community "Hur" (free from British slavery). The British tried to crush the uprising and that resulted in an armed resistance by Hurs. Ultimately the British passed the Hurs Act, where the entire Hur community was declared criminals and were ordered to be shot on sight.{{Citation needed|date= February 2013}}

The Hurs continued their struggle even after the hanging of Pir Sahib, right up to the time of Pakistan's independence.

Pir Pagaro Syed Sibghatullah Shah II was hanged on 20 March 1943 and the British left the South Asia four years later on 14 August 1947. After the end of British rule, Pir Pagaro's two sons, who were in British custody in England, were released and came back to lead their community. Sindh was a province in the newly independent Pakistan. The sons of Sibghatullah Shah Shaheed, Pir [[Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II|Syed Shah Mardan Shah Rashdi-II]] alias Pir Syed Sikandar Ali Shah Rashidi and Pir Syed Nadir Ali Shah Rashidi were brought to Pakistan in December 1951 after long negotiations. The elder son, Pir [[Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II]] became the new Pir Pagara on 22 February 1952.

'''''Psilocybe germanica''''' is a species of [[psychedelic mushroom]] in the family [[Strophariaceae]]. It was [[species description|described]] as a new species in 2015 by Jochen Gartz and Georg Wiedemann.

==Description==
''Psilocybe germanica'' has produces [[basidiocarp|fruitbodies]] with broadly [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] caps measuring {{convert|1|–|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. They are a deep brown color when moist, but become whitish when dry. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially brownish before becoming purplish-brown when the spores mature. The whitish, curved [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures {{convert|5|–|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.3|–|0.7|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and is thicker at the top. It is initially stuffed with [[mycelia]] but later hollows.  The wood substrate under the mushroom is held together by [[rhizomorph]]s at the base of the stipe. The cap and stipe bruise blue when touched, while the umbo typically becomes gray-bluish on its own. Frosts or rains often cause an intense bluing reaction.&lt;ref name="Gartz 2015"/&gt;

[[Basidiospore|Spores]] measure 9–12 by 5.5–7.5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]], and have a [[germ pore]]. Cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges) are lageniform (flask-shaped), measuring 25–33 by 6.0–8.3&amp;nbsp;µm; pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent from the [[hymenium]].&lt;ref name="Gartz 2015"/&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
A [[saprobic]] species, ''Psilocybe germanica'' grows on wood chips, or bark chips mixed with soil. Found in parks, fruiting occurs from September to December. It is known only from Germany.&lt;ref name="Gartz 2015"/&gt;

The '''Ravidassia religion''', or '''Ravidassia Dharam''',  is a [[Indian religions|Dharmic religion]], founded in the 21st century out of [[Sikhism]],&lt;ref name=paramjitjudge181/&gt; and is based on the teachings of the 14th century Indian guru [[Ravidas]], revered as a ''[[satguru]]''.

Historically, Ravidassia represented a range of beliefs in South Asia, with some devotees of Ravidass counting themselves as Ravidassia [[Sikh]]s, but there is evidence that Ravidassia Dera{{clarify|date=August 2018}} first formed in the early 20th-century in colonial [[British India]].&lt;ref name=paramjitjudge181&gt;Paramjit Judge (2014), Mapping Social Exclusion in India: Caste, Religion and Borderlands, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107056091}}, pages 179-182&lt;/ref&gt; The Ravidassia community began to take on more cohesion following 1947, and the establishment of successful Ravidassia communities in the diaspora.&lt;ref name="Parsons1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Parsons|title=The Growth of Religious Diversity: Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlKkZoNPi0oC&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=10 April 2012|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-08326-3|pages=227–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravidassias, states Ronki Ram, accept present ''[[Sant (religion)|sants]]'' of Ravidass Deras as ''Guru'' whereas the Sikhs do not.&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligion1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v16_1/articles/RonkiRam16_1.pdf |journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|year=2009 |volume=16 | issue=1 |title=Ravidass, Dera Sachkhand Ballan and the Question of Dalit Identity in Punjab |publisher=Panjab University, Chandigarh |author=Ronki Ram |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Ravidassia religion was launched following the murder of their cleric [[Ramanand Dass]] in Vienna in 2009 by some radical, where the movement declared itself to be a religion fully separated from Sikhism.&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligion1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JacobsenMyrvold2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knut A.

Prior to their break from Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan revered and recited the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] of Sikhism in Dera Bhallan.&lt;ref name=toinewreligion2010/&gt; However, following their split from mainstream Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan compiled their own holy book based exclusively on Ravidas's teachings, the [[Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji]], and these Dera Bhallan Ravidassia temples now use this book in place of the Guru Granth Sahib.&lt;ref name=toinewreligion2010&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-01/india/28118439_1_dera-head-dera-sachkhand-ballan-sant-ramanand | work=The Times Of India | title=Punjab sect declares new religion | date=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.taaza.com/source/218739-new-punjab-sect-lays-down-code.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425133316/http://news.taaza.com/source/218739-new-punjab-sect-lays-down-code.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Teachings of Ravidas represent an offshoot of the ''[[bhakti movement]]'' of the fifteenth century, a religious renaissance in India. Ravidas taught the following principles:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* The oneness, omnipresence and omnipotence of God.
* The human soul is a particle of God.
* The rejection of the notion that God cannot be met by lower castes.
* To realize God, which is the goal of human life, man should concentrate on God during all rituals of life.
* The only way of meeting with God (''[[moksha]]'') is to free the mind from duality.

==Membership==
The [[Shri Guru Ravidass Mission London|Shri Guru Ravidas Mission]] states that the conditions on being a member of the community are:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
*That one who preaches Guru Ravidas's philosophy is a Ravidassia.
*It is not a condition that one should have been born in the Ravidassia community to become or to be initiated as one.
*To celebrate [[Shri Guru Ravidass Jayanti]] according to the Punjabi calendar, Sunday, Sukhal Falgin Parvithta.

==Objectives==
[[Dera Sach Khand]] Ballan of Jallandhar, Punjab on 30 January 2010 at the 633rd birth anniversary of Ravidas announced the objectives of Ravidassia religion as, "to propagate the Bani and teachings of Satguru Ravidass. Besides, the teachings and thought of Maharishi Bhagwan Balmiki, Satguru Namdev, Satguru Kabir, Satguru Trilochan, Satguru Sain and Satguru Sadna would also be propagated".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Places of worship==
The Ravidassia place of worship is called a ''Bhawan'', ''[[Sabha]]''{{dn|date=September 2018}}, ''[[Gurdwara]]'' or ''[[Darbar]]''{{dn||date=September 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gururavidas.org.uk/ point 15: # To address our place of worship as Ravidassia Temple’ all the time and for all the purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered respectful towards Guru Ravidas if one covers his head and takes off his or her shoes while entering the place of worship. It is believed that everyone must follow it as a respect to Guru Ravidas.

Outside the Sabha there is always a flag upon which is written the ''[[Nishaan]]'', and above it the "Harr" symbol which symbolising enlightenment from Guru Ravidas's teachings.

''[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]'' takes place inside the ''sabha'' continuously as a practice, all are free to partake of it.

In some Ravidassia ''sabhas'' the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] is still installed as the focal point in the main worship room. The Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is respected at all times. However most Ravidassia Sabhas have replaced it with the new holy book, the Guru Ravidass Amrit Bani.

''[[Aarti]]'' and ''[[kirtan]]'' of all saints and gurus takes place daily at the closing of the day's formal services, this consists of the famous ''Arti'' written by Guru Ravidas in which he tells God is one and equality is among all in the eyes of God.

Some saints which Ravidassias refer to while at the end of every prayer is Satguru Kabir, Satguru Sain, Satguru Sadhna, Satguru Trilochan, Meera Bai, Baba Farid and Bhagwan Valmik.

==Scriptures==
The Ravidassia temples "Sabha" contain the holy book ''Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji'' which contains all the hymns by Guru Ravidas. This book contains the following hymns: Raga – Siri (1), Gauri (5), Asa (6), Gujari (1), [[Sorath (raga)|Sorath]] (7), Dhanasari (3), Jaitsari (1), Suhi (3), Bilaval (2), Gaund (2), Ramkali (1), Maru (2), Kedara (1), Bhairau (1), Basant (1), and Malhar (3). The book contains 140 shabads, 40 pade, and 231 salok. There are 177 pages in all of the book.

A version of the holy book ''Amrit Bani'' containing 240 hymns of Guru Ravidas was installed at the Guru Ravidas temple in [[Jalandhar]], Punjab, on 1 February 2012 on the occasion of birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass. The Dera Sach Khand Ballan religious community had announced the formation of the new Ravidassia religion and separation from Sikhism at Varanasi. The split from Sikhism was triggered after the killing of its deputy head [[Ramanand Dass]] in May 2009 at a temple in [[Vienna]] by some Sikh radicals.

President of newly formed Begumpura Lok Party and a supporter of the new religion, Satish Bharti, said that the copies of the new  Bani were put on display during the religious processions in order to assert that the community members are firm believers of the new religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jagopunjabjagoindia.com/no-guru-granth-sahib-but-amrit-bani-adorned-at-ravidas-sobha-yatra-3292 |title=Punjab News - No ‘Guru Granth Sahib’ but ‘Amrit Bani’ adorned at Ravidas Sobha Yatra |publisher=Jagopunjabjagoindia.com |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/ravidassias-assert-identity-display-new-granth-in-shobha-yatras/908944/0 |title=Ravidassias assert identity, display new Granth in shobha yatras |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SUPPORTED BY REFS, NEED TO DOUBLE-CHECK THESE FOR CITING In Doaba region – comprising Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Nawanshahr – more than than 45 per cent population belong to Dalit community, a majority of whom are now following the Ravidassia religion.  --&gt;

==Leaders==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dera Ravidass.jpg|thumb|right|Dera Sachkand Ballan]] --&gt;
Ravidassias are aligned with a ''sant'' who mentors them on their spiritual path, providing personalised ''[[mantras]]'' and advice. The head of the Ravidassia Dharam, known as the ''[[sadhu]]s'' are present mainly in Punjab and the Dera Sach Khand Ballan consists of ''sadhus'', also known as Sant Samaj who in turn lead and are heads of all Ravidassias ''[[dera]]s'' around the world. The leader of the Ravidassia religion, known as the [[Gaddi Nashin]] is Sant Niranjan Dass alongside Sant Surinder Dass Bawa. Former leaders include Sant Hari Dass, Sant Sarwan Dass, Sant Garib Dass and Sant Baba Pippal Dass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Ronki Ram |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/5450/dera-sachkhand-ballan-repositorydalit.html |title=Dera Sachkhand Ballan: Repository of Dalit consciousness |publisher=Deccanherald.com |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs==
The Ravidassia employ the greeting "ਜੈ ਗੁਰੂਦੇਵ" (''Jai Gurdev'') "जय गुरुदेव " the motto of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/religion-or-a-prayer-for-identity/574754 |title=Religion or a prayer for identity? |agency=Indian Express |accessdate=2013-12-05 |date=2010-02-03 |author=[[Amrita Chaudhry]] |location=Ludhiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbols ==
[[File:Religious flag 1.jpg|thumb|Nishan Sahib]]
The Ravidassia religious symbol is known as the [[Harr Nishaan]] ("sign of God"). The [[Gurmukhi]] transliteration of the name Harr is the main symbol of the Ravidassia religion.&lt;ref name="toinewreligion2010"/&gt; It is also called as ''Koumi Nishan''.&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligionsymbol"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v16_1/articles/RonkiRam16_1.pdf |journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|year=2009 |volume=16 | issue=1 |title=Ravidass, Dera Sachkhand Ballan and the Question of Dalit Identity in Punjab |publisher=Panjab University, Chandigarh |author=Ronki Ram |page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion is also represented by a flag, with the insignia "Har" which, states Ronki Ram, includes:&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligionsymbol"/&gt;
* A bigger circle with 40 rays of sunlight signifying forty hymns of Guru Ravidas;
* Inside the big circle is a small circle, inside which is written "Har" in [[Gurmukhi language]] (ਹਰਿ) with a flame on top of it;
* The flame represents the ''Naam'' (word) that would illuminate the entire world, and reaches the outer circle;
* Between the two circles is written a couplet composed by Ravidas: ਨਾਮ ਤੇਰੇ ਕਿ ਜੋਤੀ ਲਗਾਈ, ਭੇਈਓ ਓ ਭਵਣ ਸਗਲਈ (''Naam tere kee jot lagayi, Bhaio Ujiaaro Bhawan saglaare'', "Your Name is the flame I light; it has illuminated the entire world")

The insignia Har, states Ram, represents the "very being of Ravidass and his teachings".&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligionsymbol"/&gt; It is chosen after the name of their Guru, as ''ravi'' means "illumination" and ''dass'' "servant of god".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Relationship with Sikhism==
Dera Bhallan Ravidasis claim that their religion was created after they were excluded from Sikh gurdwaras in Punjab.&lt;ref name="reldiversityp227"&gt;{{cite book | last=Parsons | first=Gerald  | year=1994 | title=The Growth of Religious Diversity: Britain from 1945 | publisher=Routledge  | isbn = 0415083265 | page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many similarities with mainstream Sikhism and indeed temple worship is almost identical. The primary difference is the reverence of Ravidas as their main prophet or teacher.

The Dera Bhallan community insists they are separate from Sikhism as Guru Ravidas and not the Guru Granth Sahib is their spiritual [[Satguru]].

==Festival==

[[File:Devotees at 635th Anniversary of Sri Guru Ravidass ji.jpg|right|thumb|Devotees at 635th Anniversary of Guru Ravidas at Sri Guru Ravidass Janamsthan Mandir, Varanasi]]
The birthday of Ravidas is celebrated every year at the Seer Gowardhapur village temple in the state of Uttar Pradesh in January or February and the government of India has declared it a gazetted holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/city-briefs-pgi-opds-to-be-closed-on-feb-7/908346/ |title=City Briefs : PGI OPDs to be closed on Feb 7 |publisher=Indian Express |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year more than 1 million devotees from India and abroad visit the Seer Goverdhanpur temple. In India, devotees pour in from Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, MP, Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand while foreign devotees from the US, Canada and UK throng the village.

On the day there is a Path of Amritbani Guru Ravidas read, the Harr(i) nishaan sahib is changed ceremonially, and there is a special ''[[Ravidassia Arti]]'' and a ''[[Nagar Kirtan]]'' procession bearing Shri Guru Ravidas' portrait are taken out to the accompaniment of music through the streets of the temple locality.

Special pilgrim trains have been run to and from Varanasi for the last 12 years on the occasion of Parkash Ustav of Guru Ravi Dass. A special train is run from Jalandhar to Varanasi and back every year on Guru Ravidass Jyanti Purb for the convenience of the pilgrims since 2000.

'''[[Sariputra]]''' and '''[[Mahamoggallana]]''' were the two chief disciples of [[Gautama Buddha]], and died within two weeks of one another, after which they were [[cremation|cremated]] and their [[relic]]s kept. After a period, the relics were lost to civilisation.

==Excavation==
[[File:Sanchi Stupa No 3 relics.jpg|thumb|Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana at [[Sanchi]] , Stupa No3.&lt;ref name="AC"/&gt;]]
In 1851, the [[British people|British]] [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] was excavating at the [[Asoka]]n Buddhist complex in [[Sanchi]], near [[Bhopal]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] in [[India]], which dated to the 3rd century BCE. In the famous Third Stupa, he uncovered the bodily relics of Sariputra and Mahammoggallana. At approximately the same time, more relics of the two [[arahant]]s were found in a [[stupa]] at [[Satadhara]], about ten kilometres from Sanchi.

After sinking a shaft in the centre of the stupa on Sanchi Hill, Cunningham unearthed a large stone slab, more than five feet in length, lying in a north-south axis. Beneath the slab were two boxes of gray [[sandstone]], each with a brief inscription in [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] characters on the lid. The box at the southern end was inscribed "Sariputtasa" meaning "(Relics) of Sariputra," while that to the north bore the inscription "Maha-Mogalanasa." "(Relics) of Maha Moggallana".&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;The Bhilsa topes; or, Buddhist monuments of central India: 1854, by Cunningham, Alexander, Sir, 1814-1893 [https://archive.org/details/bhilsatopesorbud00cunn], Plate XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the relics==
Sariputra's box contained a large flat casket of white [[steatite]], more than six inches wide and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box, which is believed to have been turned on a [[lathe]], was an elaborate piece of workmanship. Surrounding the casket were some fragments of [[sandalwood]] believed to have been from the [[funeral pyre]], while inside it, in addition to the relics, were various precious stones. The casket also contained a single bone relic of Sariputra, shorter than one inch in length.

Mahamoggallana's stone box enclosed another steatite casket, similar to that of Sariputra but slightly smaller and with a softer surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less than half an inch long.

Each of the caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: "Sa" for Sariputra on the southern and "Ma" for Mahamoggallana on that to the north. Cunningham analysed the situation thus: "Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life." This is explained by the fact that Gautama Buddha customarily sat facing east, and thus Sariputta and Mahamoggallana were aligned south and north respectively.

In the Satadhara stupa, one of a group which Cunningham noted was locally referred to as "Buddha Bhita" or "Buddha Monuments," he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatite. These were inscribed, like those at Sanchi, "Sariputtasa" and "Maha Mogallanasa". This stupa showed signs of tampering by burglars, but the bone relics appeared to have been undisturbed. Cunningham, left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas, and the authenticity of the relics was established among scholarly ranks.

==Display==
{{Buddhism}}
The relics from both locations were taken to [[England]] and placed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited led to speculation that someone transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara, and thus what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not concretely known.

The Sacred Relics were preserved there until 1939, when the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] approached the [[British government]] to request their return to India. The request was granted, but the implementation was delayed due to the [[World War II|Second World War]]. As a result, the actual transfer did not occur until 24 February 1947, to ensure safe passage.

==Subcontinent tour==
Before returning to India, the relics were taken to [[Sri Lanka]], where they were received with fanfare. For two and a half months in 1947, they were displayed for public viewing at the [[Colombo Museum]], where it was estimated that more than two million people of all faiths paid homage to them. The relics were then taken to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], where they were displayed for public viewing at the [Dharmarajika Vihara],headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of India. Long queues existed for the two weeks of display, and although most of the pilgrims were [[Hinduism|Hindus]], but there was also a large number of [[Islam|Muslims]] among them.

This was followed by a tour of [[Myanmar|Burma]]. In order that a wide cross section of Burmese society had an opportunity to view the relics, a marine tour along the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy]] from [[Mandalay]] to [[Rangoon]] was commissioned, drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of [[sutra]]s which accompanied the tour. This was followed be tours of [[Nepal]] and [[Ladakh]].

==Interment==
After the end of the international tour, the relics were returned to India. However the Burmese government requested a portion of the relics should be given to Burma. The Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this, and the then [[Prime Minister of Burma]] went in person to Calcutta to receive them. The Burmese portion was ceremonially transferred to him in October 1950, and was later enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] (World Peace Pagoda), built on the site of the Sixth Buddhist Council, close to Rangoon. Extensive ceremonies connected with the crowning of the pagoda and the installation of the relics lasted from the 5th to 11 March 1952.

Another portion was given to Sri Lanka to be enshrined in a new stupa built by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka to receive them. They are currently housed in the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society, [[Colombo]], awaiting the completion of the building.

On 30 November 1952, the remaining relics were enshrined at Sanchi on completion of the new [[Chetiyagiri Vihara]] built to store them.

[[Jesus in Christianity|Christianity teaches]] that Jesus is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Son of God]] [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate]]. Christians believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"&gt;''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' p.649&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name=anselm &gt;''The Christology of Anselm of Canterbury'' by Dániel Deme 2004 {{ISBN|0-7546-3779-4}} pages 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.

In [[Islam]], Jesus (commonly transliterated as ''[[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]'') is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (''[[tawhid]]'') and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'').

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.

Apart from his own [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s and followers, the [[Jews]] of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.
[[Sikhism]] views Jesus as a high-ranked Holy man or saint. 

Other world religions such as [[Buddhism]] have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see [[historical Jesus]].

[[Jesus in Christianity|Christian views of Jesus]] are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the [[Canonical gospels]], [[New Testament|New Testament letters]], the [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]], as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schreiner|first=Thomas R.|title=New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ|year=2008|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2680-5|pages=23–37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elw8xkVeTTUC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their [[catechism|catechetical]] or [[Confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first= Gregory L. |title= Catholic, Lutheran, Protestant: a doctrinal comparison|year= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-615-16635-3| pages= 11–17 |publisher=Christian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the [[Son of God]] and the ''[[Messiah]]'' or ''[[Christ]]''. Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.&lt;ref name=OneTeacher &gt;''One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel'' by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 {{ISBN|3-11-018151-7}} pages 240-241&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider Jesus to be the Messiah ([[Christ]]) and believe that through [[Resurrection of Jesus|his death and resurrection]], humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref name="Bible' p.649"/&gt; These teachings emphasize that as the willing [[Lamb of God]], Jesus ''chose to'' suffer in [[Calvary]] as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".&lt;ref name="anselm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cullmann"/&gt; The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s disobedience.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg &gt;''Systematic Theology, Volume 2'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 2004 0567084663 ISBN pages 297-303&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incarnation===
{{Further information|Incarnation (Christianity)|Christology}}
Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian]] Christians generally believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]], [[God the Son]], and "[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]" (or both fully divine and fully human).

==Islam==
{{main article|Jesus in Islam}}
{{See also|Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam}}
In Islam, Jesus (''Isa'') is considered to be a [[Apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God (''[[Allah]]'') and the Messiah (''[[Messiah#Islam|al-Masih]]'') who was sent to guide the [[Israelites|Children of Israel]] (''Bani Isra'il'') with a new scripture, the Gospel.&lt;ref name="CEI"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7tu12gt4JYC&amp;pg=PA270#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | last=Glassé | first=Cyril | year=2008 | pages=270–271 | isbn=978-0-7425-6296-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|year=2003|first=John L. |last=Esposito |page= 158|publisher=Oxford University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E324pQEEQQcC&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-975726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aboul-Enein|first=Youssef H.|title=Militant Islamist Ideology: Understanding the Global Threat|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-015-6|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tX3suVDTJz0C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and emphasises that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message.&lt;ref name="comparative"&gt;{{cite book|title=Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach|first1=Darrell J.|last1= Fasching |first2= Dell |last2=deChant|year=2001| pages= 241, 274–275 |isbn=978-0-631-20125-0 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Christian writings, the Quran  does not describe Jesus as the [[son of God]], but as one of four major human [[Rasul|messengers]] (out of many [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]]) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystical Dimensions of Islam|publisher=Chapel Hill:University of North Carolina Press|author=Annemarie Schimmel|date=1975|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves).

Muslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''. However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was [[tahrif|lost or altered]] and that the Christian New Testament does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N. A. |title=Quests for the historical Jesus |first=James C. |last=Paget |year=2001|encyclopedia= Cambridge companion to Jesus|publisher= Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-521-79678-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (''[[Mary in Islam|Maryam]]'' in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John. ''What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam''. New York: University Press, 2002. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform [[miracle]]s&amp;mdash;though only by the will of God&amp;mdash;including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Diane|title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36025-1|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|27|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the [[Old Testament]].

Most Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of [[Ahmadi]] Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Majority of the Muslim population does not consider Ahmadi Muslims to be Muslims and consider them as Infidels due to their unorthodox perspectives. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually [[Judas Iscariot]] who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in [[heaven]] and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the [[Antichrist]], once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.&lt;ref name="CEI"/&gt;

Islam rejects the [[Trinity|Trinitarian Christian]] view that Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] or the [[son of God]], that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever [[Atonement in Christianity|atoned]] for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.{{Cite quran|5|116}}

==Judaism==
{{Main article|Judaism's view of Jesus}}
[[Judaism]] rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the [[Jewish Messianism|Messiah]], arguing that he had not fulfilled the [[Messianic prophecies]] in the [[Tanakh]] nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after [[Malachi]], who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shraga Simmons|Simmons, Shraga]], "[http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/jewishsociety/Why_Jews_Dont_Believe_In_Jesus.asp Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/2637/Q1/ Why Jews Do not Believe in Jesus]", [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Samayach]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Ask the Rabbi'', Retrieved April 15, 2007; "[http://www.askmoses.com/qa_detail.html?h=120&amp;o=350 Why do not Jews believe that Jesus was the Messiah?]", [[AskMoses.com]], Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Conservative Judaism]], Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have "crossed the line out of the Jewish community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html|title=Messianic Jews Are Not Jews|accessdate=January 15, 2008|last=Waxman|first=Jonathan|year=2006|publisher=[[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism]]|quote=Judaism has held that the Mashiach will come and usher in a new era; not that he will proclaim his arrival, die and wait centuries to finish his task.

Judaism rejects the claim that a new covenant was created with Jesus and asserts instead that the chain of Tradition reaching back to Moshe continues to make valid claims on our lives, and serve as more than mere window dressing. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109024012/http://uscj.org/Messianic_Jews_Not_J5480.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]], the modern progressive movement, states "For us in the Jewish community anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew and is an [[apostate]]".&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary American Reform Responsa, #68, "[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/10-Reform/section-15.html Question 18.3.4: Reform's Position On...What is unacceptable practice?]", faqs.org.

===Jesus in Jewish writings===
{{See also|Jesus in the Talmud}}
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] include stories of ''[[Yeshu]]'' {{lang|he|יֵשׁוּ}}; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the [[historical Jesus]].&lt;ref name="TM1998"&gt;Theissen, Gerd and Annette Merz. The historical Jesus: a comprehensive guide. Fortress Press. 1998. translated from German (1996 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boyarin, ''Dying for God: Martyrdom and the Making of Christianity and Judaism'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rubenstein ''Rabbinic Stories'' (The Classics of Western Spirituality) New York: The Paulist Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', an authoritative work of [[halakha|Jewish law]], states in ''Hilkhot Melakhim'' 11:10–12 that Jesus is a "stumbling block" who makes "the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God".
{{quote|Even Jesus the Nazarene who imagined that he would be [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]] and was killed by the court, was already prophesied by [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. So that it was said, "And the members of the outlaws of your nation would be carried to make a (prophetic) vision stand. And they stumbled."{{Bibleref2c|Dan.|11:14}} Because, is there a greater stumbling-block than this one? So that all of the [[prophet]]s spoke that the Messiah redeems Israel, and saves them, and gathers their banished ones, and strengthens their commandments. And this one caused (nations) to destroy Israel by sword, and to scatter their remnant, and to humiliate them, and to exchange the Torah, and to make the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God. However, the thoughts of the Creator of the world&amp;nbsp;— there is no force in a human to attain them because our ways are not God's ways, and our thoughts not God's thoughts. And all these things of Jesus the Nazarene, and of ([[Muhammad]]) the [[Ishmael]]ite who stood after him&amp;nbsp;— there is no (purpose) but to straighten out the way for the King Messiah, and to restore all the world to serve God together. So that it is said, "Because then I will turn toward the nations (giving them) a clear lip, to call all of them in the name of God and to serve God (shoulder to shoulder as) one shoulder."{{Bibleref2c|Zeph.|3:9}} Look how all the world already becomes full of the things of the Messiah, and the things of the [[Torah]], and the things of the commandments! And these things spread among the far islands and among the many nations uncircumcised of heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/e511.htm Hilchot Malachim (laws concerning kings) (Hebrew)]", MechonMamre.org, Retrieved April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Bahá'í Faith==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] consider Jesus to be a [[manifestation of God]], who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.&lt;ref name="manifestation"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Juan | last = Cole | title = The Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá'í Writings| year = 1982 | journal = Bahá'í Studies | volume = monograph 9 | pages = 1–38 | url = http://bahai-library.com/cole_concept_manifestation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single [[progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive religion]] from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Progressive revelation |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manifestations of God are taught to be "one and the same", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. [[Bahá'u'lláh]] wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual "return" of all the previous Manifestations of God.&lt;ref name="manifestation" /&gt; In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.

==Other==
Traditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and [[Buddhism and Christianity]] have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Jesus]]. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 BCE in many of the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began.&lt;ref&gt;Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times" by Jerry H.Bentley (Oxford University Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-19-507639-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of [[gnosis]] by various [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sects, such as the extinct [[Manichaeism]]. In the [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|Ahmadiyya Islamic view]], Jesus survived the crucifixion and later travelled to [[India]], where he lived as a prophet (and died) under the name of [[Yuz Asaf]].

In [[Jesus in Scientology|Scientology]], the teachings of Jesus are included among belief systems comprising those "earlier forms".&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book | last =Rhodes | first =Ron | title =The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions: The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response | publisher =Zondervan | year =2001 | pages =155, 164 | isbn = 0-310-23217-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is classified as below the level of [[Operating Thetan]], but as a "shade above" the Scientology state of "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

{{cite book

  | year=2002
  | publisher=Church of the Saviour
  | author=Ched Myers
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is an application of the economic aspects of [[Biblical Sabbath]] to modern [[socioeconomics]]. In the introduction of his book introducing this model, Myers states that "God's people are instructed to dismantle, on a regular basis, the fundamental patterns and structures of stratified wealth and power, so that there is 'enough for everyone.' " This statement contains two of the core principles of Myer's socioeconomic vision:
# The focus on voluntary [[redistribution of wealth]]
# A foundation of [[:wikt:abundance|abundance]] as opposed to [[scarcity]] in other modern economic models.&lt;ref&gt;

The Biblical concepts from which Sabbath economics draws are:{{cn|date=August 2016}}
* [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath day]], particularly during the journey through the wilderness as described in [[Book of Exodus#The journey through the wilderness to Mount Sinai (13-18)|Exodus 15-17]]
* [[Sabbath year]], described in [[Book of Exodus#The Covenant and its Laws (19-24)|Exodus 23]],  where the land was not cultivated, and Israelite slaves were released every seventh year
* [[Jubilee (biblical)|Year of Jubilee]] every 50th year, when all debts were cancelled and all property returned to the original owners

Others have since sought to explore the ideas of a Sabbath economy in practical ways.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sarpa Kavu''' (meaning ''Abode of Snakes'') is a traditional natural sacred space seen near traditional homes in [[Kerala]] state of [[South India]]. The site is believed to be inhabited by snakes, and the area usually contains a representation of ''Naga Raja'' (''King of the Snakes'') and other ''Naga Devatas'' (''snake deities''), where offerings and rites are performed during special ceremonies. This is a Hindu ritual performed by the sects like the [[Bunt (community)|Bunt]]s and [[Nair]]s, and all castes hold the Sarpa Kavu in reverence, with access forbidden to the area unless for due ceremonies.

==Origin==
Mythology says that Kerala was created from the Arabian Sea and given to the Brahmins (Namboothiris) as a "donation" by Parasurama to save himself from the sins of killing numerous kshathriya kings. The land was full of forests and poisonous snakes were found in plenty. So the Brahmins refused to stay there. Parasurama requested Lord Shiva to provide a solution. Shiva told Parasurama to start worshipping Anantha and vasuki  the kings of snakes. Parasurama did so and Anantha advised him to start snake worship in Kerala and provide some forest especially for snakes in the form of Sarppakkavu (Snake forests). Parasurama later installed the idols of Anantha and Vasuki at Vettikkottu (near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district) and Mannarassala(near Harippadu in Alappuzha district) and started worshipping them. The Brahmins also worshipped Anantha and Vasuki and the pleased snake gods made Kerala suitable for living.

==Other usage==
Sarpa Kavus even help in soil and water conservation besides preserving its rich biological wealth. The ponds and streams adjoining the groves are perennial water sources. These are the last resorts to many of the animals and birds for their water requirements, especially during summer. Sacred groves also enrich the soil through its rich litter composition. The nutrients generated thus are not only recycled within the sacred grove ecosystem but also find their way into the adjoining agroeco systems.

[[Image:Cups07.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Seven of Cups from the [[Rider-Waite|Rider-Waite Tarot deck]]]]
'''Seven of Cups''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card of the suit of [[The Suit of Cups|Cups]].

==Rider-Waite symbolism==
Generally speaking, [[Arthur Edward Waite|Waite]] describes these cups as ''strange chalices of vision''. They are all up on a [[cloud]], which may reflect their ungrounded, impractical or transient nature and the over-[[imagination]] or confusion of the figure conjuring them. Accordingly, they have been associated with [[wishful thinking]].

There is some dispute as to what the 7 symbols in the cups mean, but tarotologists have some speculation as to the meanings. The exact elements of this vision may be less important than the very act of conjuring them. 

According to some, this Card represents self-delusion, while others emphasize choice or temptation. Under rare and extreme circumstances, it may indicate the revelation of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] spiritual truth(s).


The cups seem to offer:
* A human head - may represent a potential companion to the seeker ([[love]]).
* A shrouded, glowing figurine - may represent the burning need for the conjurer's self-illumination.
* A [[snake]] - may represent animal passion and desire. Alternatively, some consider the snake to represent powerful transformative knowledge. The snake around [[The Magician (Tarot)|The Magician]]'s waist may offer insight into Waite's intention with this inclusion herein.
* A [[castle]] or [[tower]] - may represent power and stability, or one's native land. (contrast with [[The Tower (Tarot card)|The Tower]])
* A treasure hoard - probably represents [[wealth]] and abundance.
* A [[laurel wreath]] - most likely represents victory, honor and status. Note the [[Human skull|skull]] like shadow on the cup itself, which may point to the great dangers of [[vanity]] and pride (a [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]]).
* A [[dragon]] - in keeping with the Christian imagery of the deck, it is more likely a symbol of evil, anger and envy, calamity. Today, dragons are mostly associated with [[fantasy]], the supernatural, magic.

==Reversed==
A period of ''clarity'' after a time of confusion. It can also indicate that long-held dreams or ambitions are being overturned, either for good or ill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5110">'''Sharan Kaur Pabla''' was a [[Sikh]] martyr who was slain in 1705 by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] soldiers while cremating the bodies two older sons of [[Guru Gobind Singh]], the 10th Sikh Guru, after the [[Battle of Chamkaur]]. She was from the village Raipur Rani which is 2&amp;nbsp;km from the famous town of [[Chamkaur]].&lt;ref name ="DK Varma"&gt;The Battle of Chamkaur (22 December 1705), The Panjab past and present, Volume 20, pp 276, Devinder Kumar Varma, Punjabi University. Dept. of Punjab Historical Studies, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nanuan"&gt;Saini jagata utapati ate wikasa , pp 50, pp 72 , pp 101, Surajita Singha Nanua, Patiala : Manajota Prakashana, ਪਟਿਆਲਾ : ਮਨਜੋਤ ਪ੍ਰਕਾਸ਼ਨ, 2008, DK Agencies DKPAN-5413 ( HBD )&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Gobind Singh escaped the fort of Chamkaur on the night of December 22, 1705. He briefly stopped at Raipur on his way to [[Machhiwara]]. Here he asked a lady by the name of Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla to perform the last rites of the martyred Sikhs, which included two of Guru Gobind Singh's own sons, [[Sahibzada Ajit Singh]] and  [[Sahibzada Jujhar Singh]] . [[Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla]] performed the last rites of the two elder Sahibzadas and other Sikh warriors who had laid down their lives in the battle. According to one account, Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla was so grief-stricken that she herself jumped in the funeral pyre and ended her life. According to another view she did not self-immolate but was slain by Moghul soldiers and thrown in the funeral pyre of Sahibzadas, when she and her other accomplices from Raipur, were caught cremating the bodies of Sahibzadas.&lt;ref name ="DK Varma"/&gt;

A third account says that she indeed jump into funeral pyre in a [[Jauhar]] style self-immolation. Her own husband Bhai Pritam Singh, who was one of Guru Gobind Singh's warriors, was with the 10th Guru inside the Chamkaur fort resisting the Moghul attack. She discovered her husband among the dead. In total she is said to have collected bodies of thirty two  stormtroopers of the Guru, including two Sahibzadas. She tried to cremate them in a single funeral pyre. As soon as the funeral pyre was lit she was discovered by [[Moghul]] and [[Ranghar]] soldiers who wanted the bodies of the soldiers - martyrs according to Sikh tradition-  to rot in open air in order to  terrorise non-Muslim population who refused to apostasize or give out the whereabouts of Guru Gobind Singh. It is said that understanding the intentions of the Moghul soldiers to outrage her modesty, she jumped into the funeral pyre of Sikh warriors, which included her own husband, to save her honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajkaregakhalsa.com/Bibi-Sharan-Kaur-Jee.htm Bibi Sharan Kaur's martyrdom as per Sikh accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharan Kaur was a [[Saini]] and Raipur has considerable [[Saini]] population. She is also sometimes linked as a possible ancestor with Sikh nobleman of Phulkiyan, Sardar [[Nanu Singh Saini]], whose family later owned sizeable land in the village Raipur.&lt;ref name = "Nanuan"/&gt; This village also has the funerary shrines or 'smadhs' of the following Sikh martyrs: Jathedar Naunihal Singh, Mastan Singh, Santokh Singh and Malkiat Singh. In 1945 a Gurudwara was built in village Raipur to commemorate Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla.&lt;ref name = "Nanuan"/&gt;

==Jamrud and Lahore Espionage==
Once she was sent to find out the strength of the Pathan forces that were conspiring to ambush  Jamrud. She kept a concealed identity. She had some very secret information regarding the attack for the Pathan chief and was arranging a meeting in which she explained him the conspiracy and her brother brutal killing. The chief thanked her and assured her against the Sikhs. She managed to use her handkerchief to press it to his nose. She killed him with dagger  very silently and managed to escape from the sword of soldiers.

Hari Singh Nalwa, the Sikh ruler, became serious due to ailment at Jamrud. Pathans took advantage of the situation and revolted and surrounded the fort to attack. It was pretended that he was healing and taken to fort top where he was shown walking to demoralise the rebels. But on 30 April 1837, he died. His demise was still a secret. Sharan Kaur showed her bravery by disguising herself as a Pathan woman and got to Pashawar to inform Maharaja Ranjit Singh about this incident.

By her such information Maharaja Ranjit Singh took hold of the situation and squelched the rebel with his large force. She saved the fort.
Sharan Kaur was later awarded and thanked for her bravery. She will always be remembered for her selfless service and excellent espionage in the pages of history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allaboutsikhs.com/great-sikh-women/bibi-sharan-kaur&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Inari-Jogyo-ji.jpg|thumb|[[Kitsune|Foxes]] sacred to Shinto kami [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]], a ''[[torii]]'', a Buddhist [[tō|stone pagoda]], and Buddhist figures together at Jōgyō-ji, [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]]]
'''''Shinbutsu-shūgō''''' ({{lang|ja|神仏習合}}, "syncretism of kami and buddhas"), also called '''Shinbutsu-konkō''' ({{lang|ja|神仏混淆}}, "jumbling up" or "contamination of kami and buddhas"), is the [[syncretism]] of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] and [[kami]] worship that was Japan's only organized religion up until the [[Meiji period]]. Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Shinbutsu bunri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Buddhism was introduced from [[China]] in the [[Asuka period]] (6th century), rather than discarding the old belief system, the Japanese tried to reconcile the two, assuming both were true. As a consequence, [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] ({{lang|ja|寺}}, ''tera'') were [[Jingū-ji|attached]] to local [[Shinto shrine]]s ({{lang|ja|神社}}, ''jinja'') and vice versa and devoted to both [[kami]] and [[buddhahood|buddhas]]. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never quite fused, but remained however inextricably linked all the way to the present day, always interacting. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen for example in the fact that much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines we see today, with a large worship hall and religious images, are themselves of Buddhist origin.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the article [[Shinto architecture]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tamura21"&gt;Tamura, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; The formal [[Shinbutsu bunri|separation of Buddhism from Shinto]] took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.&lt;ref name="sueki2"/&gt;

The term ''shinbutsu shūgō'' itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and ''buddhas'' in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ryōbu Shintō and Sannō Shintō.&lt;ref name=inoue&gt;Inoue (2004:67-68)&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness.&lt;ref&gt;Teeuwen &amp; Rambelli (2002:49)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assimilation of Buddhism==

===Debate over the nature of Shinto===
There is no agreement among specialists as to the exact extent of fusion between the two religions.&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt;

According to some scholars, for example Hirai Naofusa, in Japan, and [[Joseph Kitagawa]], in the US, Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, has existed as such continuously since pre-history, and consists of all the peculiarly Japanese rituals and beliefs shaped by Japanese history from prehistory to the present.&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt; The term "Shinto" itself was coined in the 6th century to differentiate the loosely organized local religion from imported Buddhism.&lt;ref name="KG139"&gt;Kitagawa (1987:139)&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposing view belongs to Japanese historian [[Toshio Kuroda]] (and his supporters) who, in a famous article ("Shinto in the History of Japanese Religion," published in English in 1981&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/k/images/0/03/Kuroda_1981.pdf  KURODA TOSHIO, Shinto in the History of Japanese Religion, Translated by JAMES C. DOBBINS and SUZANNE GAY, Journal of Japanese Studies, 7-1, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;), has argued that Shinto as an independent religion was born only in the modern period after emerging in the Middle Ages as an offshoot of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="BT4"&gt;Breen and Teeuwen in ''Breen and Teeuwen'' (2000:4-5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rambelli"&gt;Rambelli (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Kuroda's main argument is that Shinto as a distinct religion is a Meiji era invention of Japanese nationalist ideologues (see the section [[#Buddhism_and_Shinto_after_the_Separation_Order|The two religions after the Separation Order]] below).&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt; He points out how the state formalization of ''[[kami]]'' rituals and the state ranking of shrines during the [[Heian period]] were not the emergence of Shinto as an independent religion, but an effort to explain local beliefs in Buddhist terms.&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt; He also says that, while it is true that the two characters for "Shinto" appear very early in the historical record, for example in the [[Nihon Shoki]], this does not mean today's Shinto already existed as a religion because they were originally used as a name for [[Taoism]] or even for religion in general.&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt; Indeed, according to Kuroda, many features of Shinto, for example the worshiping of mirrors and swords or the very structure of the [[Ise Shrine]] (Shinto's holiest and most important site) are typical of Taoism.&lt;ref name="BT4"/&gt; The term Shinto in old texts therefore does not necessarily indicate something uniquely Japanese.

Still according to this view, Shinto's rise as an autonomous religion was gradual and started to become evident with the emergence of  [[Yoshida Kanetomo]]'s [[Yoshida Shintō]]. The term Shinto started to be used with today's meaning of ''kami'' worship only later during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="Grundbegriffe:Shinto"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Bernhard Scheid|Scheid, Bernhard]]|title=Trennung von Shinto und Buddhismus|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/rel_jap/an/Grundbegriffe:Shinto|work=Grundbegriffe:Shinto|publisher=University of Vienna|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same era, [[Kokugaku]] theorists like [[Motoori Norinaga]] tried to separate it intellectually from Buddhism, preparing the ground for the final schism of the [[Meiji Restoration]].

According to the first view, then, the two religions were at the time of their first meeting already formed and independent and thereafter just coexisted with non-essential exchanges. According to the second, Buddhism, meeting local kami beliefs in Japan, actually produced today's Shinto.&lt;ref name="sueki2"&gt;Sueki (2007:2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rambelli"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kur7"&gt;Kuroda (1981:7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANHS"&gt;{{cite book|last=John Breen|first=Mark Teeuwen|title=A new History of Shinto|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-5516-8|pages=221|url=https://www.amazon.com/History-Shinto-Blackwell-Histories-Religion/dp/1405155167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assimilation process===
The fusion of Buddhism with the local kami worship started as soon as the first arrived in Japan. [[Mononobe clan|Mononobe]] no Okoshi wrote, "The kami of our land will be offended if we worship a foreign kami."&lt;ref name="Tamura"&gt;Tamura, pages 26 to 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Mononobe saw [[Gautama Buddha]] as just another kami.&lt;ref name="Tamura"/&gt; Foreign kami were called {{nihongo|''banshin''|蕃神|"barbarian gods"}} or {{nihongo|''busshin''|仏神|"Buddhist gods"}}, and understood to be more or less like local ones.&lt;ref name="coka"/&gt; Initially, therefore, the conflict between the two religions was political, and not religious, in nature, a struggle between the progressive [[Soga clan]], that wanted a more international outlook for the country, and the conservative [[Mononobe clan]], that wanted the contrary.&lt;ref name="Tamura"/&gt;

Buddhism was not passive in the assimilation process, but was itself ready to assimilate and be assimilated. By the time it entered Japan it was already syncretic, having adapted to and amalgamated with other religions and cultures in India, China, and the [[Korean Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="coka"&gt;Encyclopedia of Shinto, [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=190 Combinatory Kami], accessed on October 13, 2008. Quotation: "Buddhism was already product of a complex process of adaptation and amalgamation with other belief systems in India, China, and the Korean peninsula."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, already while in India, it had absorbed Hindu divinities like [[Brahma]] (''Bonten'' in Japanese) and [[Indra]] (''Taishakuten'').&lt;ref name="coka"/&gt; When it arrived in Japan, it already had a disposition towards producing the combinatory gods that the Japanese would call {{nihongo|shūgōshin|習合神|syncretic gods}}.&lt;ref name="coka"/&gt; Searching for the origins of a kami in Buddhist scriptures was felt to be nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="coka"/&gt;

However, if monks didn't doubt the existence of kami, they certainly saw them as inferior to their buddhas.&lt;ref name="sheid"&gt;Bernhard Scheid&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu gods had already been treated analogously: they had been thought of as un-illuminated and prisoners of ''[[saṃsāra]]''.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; Buddhist claims of superiority encountered resistance, and monks tried to overcome them by deliberately integrating kami into their system.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; Several strategies to do this were developed and deployed.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt;

The process of amalgamation is usually divided into three stages.&lt;ref name="BT95"&gt;Mark Teeuwen in ''Breen and Teeuwen'' (2000:95-96)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first articulation of the difference between Japanese religious ideas and Buddhism, and the first effort to reconcile the two is attributed to [[Prince Shōtoku]] (574 - 622), and the first signs that the differences between the two world views were beginning to become manifest to the Japanese in general appear at the time of [[Emperor Tenmu]] (673 - 86).&lt;ref name="Tamura"/&gt; Accordingly, one of the first efforts to reconcile Shinto and Buddhism was made in the 8th century during the [[Nara period]] founding so-called {{nihongo|''[[jingū-ji]]''|神宮寺}}, that is ''shrine-temples'', complexes comprising both a shrine and a temple.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoS"&gt;Satō Makoto&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the inclusion in a [[Shinto shrine]] of Buddhist religious objects was the idea that the kami were [[Deva (Buddhism)|lost beings in need of liberation]] through Buddhism like any other [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]].&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt; Kami were thought to be subject to [[karma]] and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; To improve the kami's karma through rites and the reading of [[sutra]]s, [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] would build temples next to kami shrines.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; Such groupings had been created by the 7th century, for example at [[Usa Jingū]] in [[Kyushu|Kyūshū]],&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; where [[Hachiman]] was worshiped together with [[Maitreya]]. The building of temples at shrines produced [[Jingū-ji|shrine-temple]] complexes, which in turn accelerated the amalgamation process.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt; As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had until then been just an open-air site became Buddhist style groupings of buildings.&lt;ref name="NHoS"&gt;{{cite book|last=Breen, Teeuwen|title=A New History of Shinto|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-5516-8|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the same century, in what is considered the second stage of the amalgamation, the kami Hachiman was declared a [[dharmapala]] and, later, a [[bodhisattva]].&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt; Shrines for him started to be built at temples (the so-called "[[Chinjusha|temple-shrines]]"), marking an important step ahead in the process of amalgamation of kami and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt; When the great buddha at [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] was built, there was also erected within the temple grounds a shrine for Hachiman – according to the legend because of a wish expressed by the kami himself.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; Hachiman considered this his reward for having helped the temple find the gold and copper mines from which the metal for the great statue had come.&lt;ref name="sheid"/&gt; After this, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary [[kami]] ({{nihongo|chinju|鎮守/鎮主}}.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt;

===''Honji suijaku'' theory===
{{main article|Honji suijaku}}
The third and final stage of the fusion took place in the 9th century with the development of the {{nihongo|''[[honji suijaku]]''|本地垂迹}} theory according to which Japanese kami are emanations of [[buddhahood|buddha]]s, ''bodhisattvas'' or [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s who mingle with human beings to lead them to the Buddhist Way.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt; This theory was the keystone of the whole ''shinbutsu shūgō'' edifice and therefore the foundation of Japanese religion for many centuries. Because of it, most kami changed from potentially dangerous spirits to be improved through contact with the Buddhist law to local emanations of buddhas and bodhisattvas which possess a wisdom of their own.&lt;ref name="BT95"/&gt; Buddhas and kami were now indivisible twins.&lt;ref name="EoS"/&gt;

The status of kami however changed dramatically according to the sect. At one extreme one was [[Shingon Buddhism]]'s [[Muromachi period#Shinto|Ryōbu Shintō]] thinkers, who considered kami and buddhas equivalent in power and dignity.&lt;ref name="scheid2"&gt;Scheid, Shinto im Mittelalter&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all kami were emanations of some buddha. Some, often called {{nihongo|''jitsu no kami''|実神|true kami}}, usually dangerous and angry, had no Buddhist counterpart. Among them were the ''[[tengu]]'',  or animals possessing magic, as  the [[fox]] (''[[kitsune]]'')  or {{nihongo|[[Japanese raccoon dog#In folklore and tradition|Japanese raccoon dog]]|狸|tanuki}}. Even these unholy and inferior "true kami" however attracted the attention of Ryōbu Shinto thinkers, which resulted in theories which declared them to be manifestations of [[Vairocana]] and [[Amaterasu]].&lt;ref name="scheid2"/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Pure Land Buddhism]] was somewhat different because it at first renounced kami-worship due to the notion that kami were inferior to the buddhas. &lt;ref name="scheid2"/&gt; However, the largest Pure Land branch, Jōdo Shinshū, still encouraged the worship of kami despite the fact that faith in Amida Buddha should be the primary practice. Furthermore, under the influence of Rennyo and other leaders, Jōdo Shinshū accepted the mainstream honji suijaku beliefs and the spiritual relationship between kami and the buddhas and bodhisattvas. &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Doo Lee (2007), ''The Prince and the Monk: Shotoku Worship in Shinran's Buddhism''; James C. Dobbins (1989), ''Jodo Shinshu: Shin Buddhism in Medieval Japan'', pp. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shinbutsu kakuri===
{{main article|Shinbutsu kakuri}}

The two religions however never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity within a difficult, largely un-systematized and tense relationship.&lt;ref name="sueki7"&gt;Sueki (2007:7-8)&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship existed, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas.&lt;ref name="sueki7"/&gt; The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Besides ''shinbutsu shūgō'' there was always the other side of the coin of continued separation.&lt;ref name="sueki7"/&gt;

In fact, the term {{nihongo|''shinbutsu kakuri''|神仏隔離|isolation of "[[kami]]" from [[Buddhism]]}} in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency that existed in Japan to keep some kami separate from Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"&gt;Rambelli and Teeuwen (2002:21-22)&lt;/ref&gt; While some kami were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same kami in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; It must not be confused with ''[[shinbutsu bunri]]'' ("separation of kami and buddhas") or with ''[[haibutsu kishaku]]'' ("abolish buddhas and destroy Shākyamuni"), which are phenomena recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.

The practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of kami practices into Buddhism.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt; Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and [[Kamo Shrine]]s allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of kami.&lt;ref name="ramte"/&gt;

== Buddhism and Shinto after the Separation Order ==
{{main article|Shinbutsu bunri}}
During the ''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]'', the attempt to separate Shinto from Buddhism, temples and shrines were forcefully separated by law with the {{nihongo|"Kami and Buddhism Separation Order"|神仏判然令|Shinbutsu Hanzenrei}} of 1868.

However, in spite of more than a century of formal separation of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist [[Inari shrine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyokawa-map.net/eng/inari.html Toyokawa Inari] accessed on June 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, [[Jingū-ji|shrine-temples]] (''jingū-ji'') were destroyed while [[Chinjusha|temple-shrines]] (''chinjusha'') were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is [[Seiganto-ji]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jungūji|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1126|publisher=Encyclopedia of Shinto|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least a small one.&lt;ref name="BT7"&gt;Breen and Teeuwen in ''Breen and Teeuwen'' (2000:7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent religious institutions in both camps still give evidence of integration of the two religions. The great [[Kenchō-ji]] temple, number one of the [[Kamakura]]'s great [[Zen]] temples (the [[Five Mountain System]]) includes two shrines. One of the islands in the right-side pond of [[Tsurugaoka Hachimangū]] in Kamakura hosts a subshrine dedicated to goddess [[Benzaiten]], a form of [[Saraswati]].&lt;ref name="Kamiya18"/&gt; For this reason, the sub-shrine was removed in 1868 at the time of the ''Shinbutsu Bunri'', but rebuilt in 1956.&lt;ref name="Kamiya18"&gt;Kamiya (2008: 18 - 19)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shinto and Buddhism still have a symbiotic relationship of interdependence, particularly concerning funeral rites (entrusted to Buddhism) and [[Marriage in Japan|weddings]] (usually left to Shinto or sometimes Christianity). The separation of the two religions is therefore considered only superficial, and ''shinbutsu shūgō'' is still an accepted practice.

Still, the separation of the two religions is felt to be real by the public. Scholar Karen Smyers comments, "The surprise of many of my informants regarding the existence of Buddhist Inari temples shows the success of the government's attempt to create separate conceptual categories regarding sites and certain identities, although practice remains multiple and nonexclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Smyers, pag. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Snake Temple''' ({{zh|s=蛇庙|p=Shé Miào|poj=Tsuâ-biō}},Tamil:நாக ஆலயம்,
Nāka ālayam) is situated in [[Sungai Kluang]], [[Bayan Lepas]], [[Southwest Penang Island]], [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] and is perhaps the only [[temple]] of its kind in the world. The temple is filled with the smoke of burning [[incense]] and a variety of [[pit viper]]s. The [[Viperidae|viper]]s are believed to be rendered harmless by the sacred smoke, but as a safety precaution, the [[snakes]] have also been de-venomed but still have their [[fangs]] intact. Visitors are warned against picking up the [[reptiles]] and placing them on their bodies to take pictures. Local devotees believe the temple's snake population comes there of its own accord.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysiasite.nl/snaketempleng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penang.ws/penang-attractions/penang-snake-temple.htm#|title=Penang Snake Temple|work=penang.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple was built about 1850 in memory of [[Qingshui (monk)|Chor Soo Kong]] (祖師公), by a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monk]]. Chor Soo Kong (also known as Qingshui) was born in China with the surname Tan (陳昭應 or Tan Chhiau-eng) in China during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). He was serious about seeking spiritual attainment and was ordained at an early age. According to legend, Chor Soo Kong was also a healer and sometimes gave shelter to the snakes of jungle. When he died at age 65 after a lifetime of good deeds, he was awarded the honorific title Chor Soo, that of an eminent figure revered generation after generation. After the construction of the temple, snakes reportedly appeared by themselves. The temple was originally called the "Temple of the Azure Cloud" in honor of the beauty of Penang's sky.

Believers from as far away as [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]] come to pray in the temple on Chor Soo Kong's birthday (the sixth day of the first lunar month).

The temple was featured during the 8th leg of [[The Amazing Race 16]].

The temple is a location in Tan Twan Eng's novel "The Gift of Rain" (book 1, chapter 4).

In some historic and modern military organizations, it may be used as a disciplinary measure; e.g. In the 35 Canons of [[John IV of Constantinople|Saint John the Faster]], the penance for any monk caught in homosexual acts includes a xerophagic diet for three years along with other punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/A-Christian-Understanding-of-Homosexuality.pdf|title=A Christian Understanding of Homosexuality|last=|first=|date=2017|website=orthodoxinfo.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Édouard Dujardin''' (10 November 1861 – 31 October 1949) was a French writer, one of the early users of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] literary technique, exemplified by his 1888 novel ''[[Les Lauriers sont coupés]].''

==Biography==
Édouard Émile Louis Dujardin was born in [[Saint-Gervais-la-Forêt]], Loir-et-Cher, and was the only child of Alphonse Dujardin, a sea captain. [[Stephane Mallarmé]] described him as "the offspring of an old sea-dog and a Brittany cow".&lt;ref name=ELS&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 58. {{ISBN|0500201250}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the ''[[Lycée Pierre Corneille (Rouen)|Lycée Pierre Corneille]]'' in Rouen.&lt;ref name="LyCo6"&gt;[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 Lycée Pierre Corneille de Rouen – History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dujardin became editor of the journal ''Revue Indépendente'' in 1886, and it was in this journal that his first works were published. His association with this journal resulted in it being termed an "important voice for the symbolists" ([[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]] 2004).

When his parents died, Dujardin was the sole heir to their fortune, and he used some of this money to finance the plays ''Antonia'' in 1891 and ''Le Chevalier Du Passé'' in 1882.

His literary works are extensive and include numerous plays, poems and novels. Dujardin also produced works of literary and social criticism and reminiscence. [[James Joyce]] claimed his style of interior monologue owed its influence to works by Dujardin. He continued his involvement with journalism throughout his life and this resulted in numerous disputes with authorities, including charges of treason, though he was never convicted.

Dujardin had expensive and lavish tastes for clothing which was deemed "dandyish" for his time, and was known to frequent Parisian night life. His many dalliances with women were noted and he had had numerous relationships with actresses, models and other glamorous women. Dujardin was also known to have many female friends involved in the arts and he supported some of them financially.

His frivolous lifestyle eventually reduced his finances so he began numerous financial ventures, including gambling and real estate. He also offered his services to periodicals for marketing and advertising campaigns. It was here that the police noticed an article compiled by Dujardin which resulted in a jail sentence, though it was later remitted.

In 1885 Dujardin and [[Téodor de Wyzewa]]&lt;ref&gt;'Téodor de Wyzewa' was the adopted name of Polish-born Theodore Etienne Wyzewski, Harrison C, Wood P., Gaiger J. ''Art in Theory 1815–1900'' Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-20066-5}}-page 1003.&lt;/ref&gt; initiated the ''[[Revue Wagnérienne]]'', imitating [[Félix Fénéon]] and his ''[[Revue Indépendante]]'' which had first been published the year before. This annual journal, dedicated to the work of the German composer [[Richard Wagner]], ran for three issues, from 1885 to 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32861731q/date.r=la+revue+wagn%C3%A9rienne.langFR|title=Revue wagnérienne / [directeur-gérant : Édouard Dujardin] - 3 Years available - Gallica|website=gallica.bnf.fr|language=EN|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 Dujardin and Fénéon joined forces under the banner of a new improved ''Revue Indépendante''. One of the innovations at this time was that the ''Revue'' started having small exhibitions in its rooms.

Dujardin married a woman named Germaine in 1893 and they later separated in 1901. They did not divorce until 1924 when he married Marie Chenou, a woman thirty years his junior. 

In May 1922 he attended the [[International Congress of Progressive Artists]] and signed the "Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists".&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=van Doesburg |first1=Theo |title=De Stijl, “A Short Review of the Proceedings [of the Congress of International Progressive Artists], Followed by the Statements Made by the Artists’ Groups” (1922) |url=https://modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/de-stijl-%E2%80%9Ca-short-review-of-the-proceedings-of-the-congress-of-international-progressive-artists-followed-by-the-statements-made-by-the-artists%E2%80%99-groups%E2%80%9D-1922/ |website=modernistarchitecture.wordpress.com |publisher=Ross Lawrence Wolfe |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
