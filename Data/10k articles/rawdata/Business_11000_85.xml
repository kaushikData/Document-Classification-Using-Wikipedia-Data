== History ==
The Association for Project Management was founded in 1972 as the UK branch of INTERNET, now the International Project Management Association. Weaver (2007) recalled, that: 
:"The UK branch of INTERNET (now the APM), was originated by the ‘pioneering seven’ whose meeting at an INTERNET (later IPMA) expert seminar in Zurich in 1971 inspired them to start a UK branch, which held its first meeting in London in May 1972. The first executive meeting on  INTERNET(UK) was held in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel, Stockholm on 13 May 1972 during the 3rd annual world congress of INTERNET. Jack Grimshaw was the original chairman, others in the founding group included Dr Jim Gordon and Dennis Gower. Annual membership fees were set at ₤1, and within a month membership had reached 78 (PMI at the time were charging ₤7).&lt;ref name="PW 2007"&gt;Patrick Weaver (2007), ''[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF_Papers/P050_Origins_of_Modern_PM.pdf The origins of Modern Project Management].''  p. 22-23 footnote&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the emergence of the [[internet]] in the 1990s, the global project management association INTERNET was renamed International Project Management Association (IPMA) and the UK Branch Association for Project Management (APM).&lt;ref name="PW 2007"/&gt;

APM received its Royal Charter on 6 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Owain. "[https://www.apm.org.uk/news/apm-receives-its-royal-charter/ APM receives its Royal Charter], at ''apm.org.uk.'' Posted on 6 Jan 2017. Accessed 26.06.2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
=== Qualifications ===

APM Qualifications are designed with the intention of demonstrating to employers, clients and suppliers that the recipient is a skilled and committed project professional. Through alignment with the four level certification programme of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) they also aim to provide international recognition. Membership grades and Qualifications are not automatically linked.

The 4-level certification programme comprises:
* Project Fundamentals Qualification, or PFQ (formerly known as Introductory Certificate), to assess fundamental knowledge of project management and professional practice. This is assessed by a multiple-choice test.
* Project Management Qualification, PMQ (formerly APMP), at SCQF Level 7, testing a broader range of knowledge, comprehension and basic skills. This is comparable to, though not equivalent to the [[PRINCE2]] qualification.  The qualification is assessed by means of a written paper.
* Project Professional Qualification, PPQ (was Practitioner Qualification) at IPMA Level C.  There are two pathways to this, one involving interviews and workshops; the other by classroom (or equivalent study) and a series of assessments against the various PPQ (subject area) modules.
* Registered Project Professional (previously Certificated Project Manager), at IPMA Level B, providing recognition to qualified and experienced project managers.

The qualifications were rebranded in 2016.

=== Risk Certificate ===

The APM Project Management Risk Single Subject Certificate, also known as the Risk Certificate, is a two level qualification which focuses on the project management subject of risk management. Level 1 assesses knowledge of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to contribute to [[project risk management]]; Level 2 additionally assess understanding and capability of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to formally undertake project risk management.

Level 1 is assessed by a one-hour-long, 60 question, multiple-choice examination. Level 2 is assessed by a 3-hour and 15 minute written examination, consisting of three questions: one compulsory question and two questions selected from four optional questions. Level 1 is not a pre-requisite for Level 2, and the Level 2 certificate can be obtained without having the Level 1 certificate. However, the Level 2 certificate examination assumes that the candidate has the prior knowledge required to pass the Level 1 certificate examination.

Registered training providers offer training as well as the opportunity to sit both levels of the exam. An Open Exam for either level may also be taken directly with the APM.

=== APM Body of Knowledge + ===
The APM Body of Knowledge defines the breadth of the project, programme and portfolio management profession. It makes up one of the  FIVE Dimensions of Professionalism. APM has created a unique online resource that allows its users to contribute to the organic growth of the APM Body of Knowledge. This is a growing resource from the Association for Project Management featuring definitions, discussions, case studies and articles on all areas of projects, programmes and portfolios.

=== Award ===
The APM Project Management Awards recognise what people can achieve through project management and have been celebrating excellence in the profession for over 20 years. The robust judging criteria recognise the broadening range of possibilities within project management. With a focus on achievement; the judging criteria put an emphasis on the outputs and outcomes of projects; what they aim to achieve and what their success gives back to the profession.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">The '''Association of American Publishers''' ('''AAP''') is the national trade association of the American [[book publishing]] industry. AAP represents the leading book, journal, and education publishers in the United States on matters of law and policy, advocating for outcomes that incentivize the publication of creative expression, professional content, and learning solutions. AAP members include most of the major commercial publishers in the [[United States]], as well as smaller and non-profit publishers, university presses and scholarly societies.

Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. congresswoman]] [[Patricia Schroeder]] served as the association's [[CEO]] from 1997 until 2009, taking over the role from two time U.S. [[Ambassador]] and Assistant Secretary of State [[Nicholas A. Veliotes]]. On May 1, 2009, former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. congressman]] [[Tom Allen]] took over as president and CEO. In January 2017, Maria A. Pallante became President and CEO of the organization.[http://newsroom.publishers.org/the-association-of-american-publishers-aap-names-maria-a-pallante-as-president-and-ceo/]

==Activities==

AAP members publish hardcover and paperback books in every field, educational materials for the elementary, secondary, postsecondary, and professional markets, scholarly journals, computer software, and electronic products and services.

The association's core programs deal with advocacy and supporting laws and regulations that “incentivize the publication of creative expression, professional content, and learning solutions,” according to the Chair at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Other current and previous focus are: [[intellectual property]]; new technology and digital issues of concern to publishers; the freedom to read, [[censorship]] and [[libel]]; the freedom to publish; funding for [[education]] and [[libraries]]; postal rates and regulations; tax and trade policy; and international [[copyright]] enforcement.

The association tracks publisher revenue on a monthly and annual basis with its StatShot Monthly and StatShot Annual programs. AAP also produces the comprehensive statistical surveys for the education sectors (prek-12 and higher education).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publishers.org/industry-stats/overview|title=Overview {{!}} AAP|website=publishers.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AAP also honors the very best in professional and scholarly publishing with PROSE Awards, which draws attention to distinguished books, journals, and electronic content. The awards have been judged by peer publishers, librarians, and medical professionals since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://proseawards.com/|title=Home - PROSE Awards|website=PROSE Awards|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

AAP was criticized after it contracted [[Eric Dezenhall]]'s [[crisis management]] firm to promote its position regarding the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement.&lt;ref name="giles2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070122/full/445347a.html |title=PR's 'pit bull' takes on open access.

'''Business process mapping''' refers to activities involved in defining what a [[business entity]] does, who is responsible, to what standard a [[business process]] should be completed, and how the success of a business process can be determined.

The main purpose behind business process mapping is to assist organizations in becoming more effective. A clear and detailed business process map or diagram allows outside firms to come in and look at whether or not improvements can be made to the current process.

Business process mapping takes a specific objective and helps to measure and compare that objective alongside the entire organization's objectives to make sure that all processes are aligned with the company's values and capabilities.

International Organization for Standardization or [[ISO 9001]] : 2015 encourages a process approach to quality management.   It is important to understand how each process relates to other processes within the organization and how those interactions impact [[Quality Management]].&lt;ref&gt;Dias, S., &amp; Saraiva, P. M. (2004). Use Basic Quality Tools To Manage Your Processes. Quality Progress, 37(8), 47-53. Retrieved from http://sharpthinkers.info/articles/Basic_Tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early history===
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the [[flow process chart]], was introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.  Gilbreth's tools were quickly integrated into [[industrial engineering]] curricula.  In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began training business people by using these tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their work simplification program called the Deliberate Methods Change Program.  Another 1944 graduate, [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships.  In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the ASME Standard for Process Charts.

Business process mapping, also known as process charts, has become much more prevalent and understood in the business world in recent years. Process maps can be used in every section of life or business.
 
The Major Steps of Process Improvement using Process Mapping	
# Process identification - identify objectives, scope, players and work areas. 
# Information gathering - gather process facts (what, who, where, when) from the people who do the work.
# Process Mapping - convert facts into a process map.
# Analysis - work through the map, challenging each step (what-why?, who-why?, where-why?, when-why?, how-why?) 
# Develop/Install New Methods - eliminate unnecessary work, combine steps, rearrange steps, add new steps where necessary
# Manage process - maintain process map in library, review routinely, and monitor process for changes 

Process mapping is capable of supporting several important business goals:

*Business process improvement
*Training
*Process / workflow clarification
*Regulatory compliance
*Internal audit
*Role clarity ([[Responsibility assignment matrix|RACI]])

===Recent developments===
Process mapping has overlapped with software development incorporating tools that can attach metadata to activities, drivers and triggers to provide some automation of software process coding.

Quality improvement practitioners have noted that various graphical descriptions of processes can be useful. These include: detailed flow-charts, work flow diagrams and value stream maps. Each map is helpful depending on the process questions and theories being considered. In these situations process map implies the use of process flow and the current understanding of the causal structure.

[[Six Sigma]] practitioners use the term Business Process Architecture to describe the mapping of business processes as series of cross-functional flowcharts.  Under this school of thought, each flowchart is of a certain level (between 0 and 4) based on the amount of detail the flowchart contains.  A level 0 flowchart represents the least amount of detail, and usually contains one or two steps.  A level 4 flowchart represents the most amount of detail, and can include hundreds of steps.  At this level every task, however minor, is represented.

===Primary example===

[[File:Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure.png|thumb|Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure]]

Flowchart is a primary type of business process mapping. It consists of some symbols such as arrows, circles, diamonds, boxes, ovals, or rectangles. The type of Flowchart just described is sometimes referred to as a "detailed" flowchart because it includes in detail, the inputs, activities, decision points, and outputs of any process.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The example is Proposed Patient Appointment Procedure. It starts with "preparation of appointment book" followed by a decision whether the appointment is shore or fleet. If the appointment is fleet, inform patient they can call 1500 to make own appointments for next few days, if the appointment is shore, confirm 24 hours prior to appointment. Next confirm that the patient confirmed. If a patient did not call, the appointment is canceled, otherwise the patient is given a confirmation number. Finally confirm that the patient showed for the appointment. If not, a standby patient is placed in the appointment slot, the appointment book is marked "Failure" and a failure report is submitted from front desk to fleet liaison. If a patient showed for appointment, put "Patient showed" in appointment book.

===Example===

An easy example to follow is making breakfast:

[[File:Makebreakfast.gif|Making Breakfast Example]]

We must first understand that making breakfast is a process. The ingredients are the inputs and the final breakfast ready to be served is the output. This graph shows the breakdown of each process vertically and horizontally. For instance, cooking ingredients is broken down into all of the different tasks that need to be done: cook bacon, cook eggs, toast bread, and fry potatoes. These tasks are then broken down further below.  In order to cook eggs, one must first heat the pan, pour the mixture, stir mixture, add pepper, and remove eggs. This is a prime example of how process mapping can be used in any situation/process in order to understand all of the different parts so that we can complete the process with a better understanding for more efficiency.
Although this is just a simple example, many aspects of business, including supply chain, operations, marketing, finance, and accounting, use similar process mapping activities to improve efficiency.

'''Business war gaming''' (Corporate war gaming) or business wargaming is an adaptation of the art of simulating moves and counter-moves in a commercial setting. Unlike [[Military simulation|military war games]], or [[Wargaming|fantasy war games]] which can be set hundreds of years in the past,  business war games are usually set in the present and are a relatively recent development, but they are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9257879 "Shall We Play a Game?"] ''[[The Economist]]'', June 2, 2007, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale for running a business [[wargaming|war game]] is that it is a tool of particular value when the competitive environment is undergoing a process of change, as it allows decision makers to consider proactively how different players can react to the change, and to each other. The benefit of teams role playing competitors and developing more robust strategies is especially notable, and can be inferred from a quote such as the one below from Richard Clark, CEO of [[Merck and Co.]], who in an interview to [[USA Today]] said: "''I am a strong believer in if you’re going to develop a vision or a strategic plan for the future of a company that you have to engage the organization in doing that…it can’t be just the CEO or top 10 executives sitting in a sterile conference room.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2006-02-26-merck-cover-usat_x.htm USA Today, "Merck CEO sets sight on change", February 27, 2006, p. B1]&lt;/ref&gt;".

At the Paul Merage School Of Business at [[University of California, Irvine]] the final exam for the [[competitive intelligence]] class is a war game in which the students role play various companies to try to win in the marketplace. Each year student teams have developed strategies - some of which have actually happened in the market place indicating that a war game is a very powerful predictive tool for businesss when planned properly.

== Methodologies ==

=== Market level ===
Currently there are three schools of thought about business [[wargaming|war game]], depending on the underlying philosophy of their creators: "Business is War" war games, "Business is a Game" war games, and "Business is Business" war games. The three types have accordingly, different strengths and weaknesses, and are useful for different applications throughout business.

==== "Business is War" ====
Sometimes abbreviated as 'BIW' war games, 'Business is War' games are a direct adaptation from the military [[wargaming|war games]], and envision competitors as the "enemy" and the goal as "victory" in a market "battle". These games are based on mathematical modeling of contestable markets, including [[chaos theory]], random variable generation ([[Monte Carlo simulations]]), and [[econometric model]]ing of demand and supply conditions. Participants’ generated moves are fed into computer program which generates optimal solutions in the mathematical space. Not surprisingly these games come with a high price tag, and are advocated by large consulting firms which tend to work with the US military establishment.

==== "Business is a Game" ====
'BIG' war games regard business transactions as a game between participants with potentially conflicting goals. BIG advocates apply [[game theory]], a branch of mathematics to business situations with the goal of finding an equilibrium, or "stable" solution (so called [[Nash equilibrium]]) whereby no one can further improve on the outcome. The solution can be computed over a large space of all possible (hypothetical) moves of the players. A leading proponent of this type of war games is Niall Fraser, a game theorist and the founder of a consultancy called [[Open Options]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, N.M. and K.W. Hipel (1984). Conflict Analysis: Models and Resolutions. New York: North-Holland&lt;/ref&gt; A variant on BIG is computer simulations’ games using simultaneous equations to solve for demand and supply equilibrium (not a game theory solution). Participants input numerical values for decisions on a wide range of business investments (in production, sales force, advertising, etc.), and receive a computer output of the equilibrium results.

==== "Business is Business"  ====
Also referred to as 'BIB' regard business as neither a war nor a game.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben. "Neither a War Nor a Game", CI Magazine, 9(6), Nov.-Dec. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The goals and tactics of war are incompatible with business goals; competitors do not aim to defeat each other but to satisfy customers’ preferences better than others. Government precludes total victories and cooperation is as prevalent as competition. Similarly, BIB criticizes "Business is Game" thinking on the ground that hypothetical or generic moves are irrelevant or trivial, stable solutions are not a substitute for specific, real life practical and innovative strategies for management, and computer/mathematical simulations do not approach the complexity of competitive dynamics in real markets. Instead, BIB advocates using state-of-the-art [[competitor analysis]] techniques and real life [[competitive intelligence]] to generate an in-depth profiling of competitors through role playing. The goal of BIB is predicting most likely moves by most significant competitors or other third parties (customers, regulators) so that strategy can be pressure–tested in the most realistic setting. The creator of BIB games is [[Benjamin Gilad]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilad, Ben (2008). Business War Games. NJ: [[Career Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; A variation combines BIB war gaming with computer simulations. This approach, used by Mark Chussil, founder of Advanced Competitive Strategies, uses simulations to estimate the likely outcomes from moves made by a business, its competitors, and other relevant actors, across multiple scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ACS-Business-War-Gaming-Bibliography-1-12.pdf|title=ACS Business War Gaming Bibliography|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allows for both competitive dynamics and quantitative analysis, at the cost of additional time to set up the war game.

=== Negotiation level ===
In contrast to the often larger “Business is War”, “Business is a Game” and “Business is Business” war games, which all primarily deal with market level issues, Negotiation War Games are smaller in scope and only deal with business related negotiations. Even though the US military have long referred to the practice of ”War Gaming a negotiation”, the term ”Negotiation War Game” was first coined by Soren Malmborg in 2010.

==== Negotiation War Games (aka. NWG) ====

A "NWG" is a Business War Game conducted at negotiation level. I.e. A structured framework for conducting a preparatory Negotiation Simulation&lt;ref&gt;Shell, G. Richard (2006). "Bargaining for Advantage". Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; on a specific, upcoming negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Henry S. (2001). “Game, set, match: winning the negotiations game”. ALM Publishing/ALM Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt;

A Negotiation War Game is most often divided into three steps:
1/ Gather Intelligence
2/ Simulate Upcoming Negotiation
3/ Debrief and calibrate negotiation strategy.

By adding Competitive Intelligence to the simulation, Negotiation War Gaming differentiates itself from normal mock negotiations and other training exercises. The act of gathering and including Competitive Intelligence on the forthcoming negotiation and its parties, lets participants in the Negotiation War Game gain an in-depth understanding of the negotiation itself and the negotiation parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Playing_war_games_to_win_2757&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of doing a Negotiation War Game is threefold; 
1/ Predicting your opponents' next move 
2/ Revealing opportunities, threats and issues 
3/ Developing and testing a calibrated negotiation strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghauri, Pervez N., Jean-Claude Usunier (2003). “International business negotiations”. Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==== Role-Play ====

Even though software applications can play an important role in the facilitation of a Role-Play Negotiation War Game, the method is inherently focused on role-play simulation. War Games can be used to prepare for virtually all two or three party negotiations. By gathering Competitive Intelligence on the actual negotiation (as well as the individuals involved) an accurate simulation can be created. A client’s employees will then become involved in the actual War Game by acting partly as the company itself, partly as the other negotiating party. Through a series of structured simulations, a tailor-made strategy can then be developed and calibrated.

Role-Play Negotiation War Games are especially effective when preparing for Sales- and Procurement negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.holdenadvisors.com/news/1112.html&lt;/ref&gt; Through more than 30 years of business usage and scientific research, the method has been shown to generate significantly better negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods. (Please see Application section below for references).In 2010, 64,7% of young US Sales-Managers Role-Played their upcoming negotiations, making "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Gaming one of the most used negotiation preparation techniques in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmaglobal.org/MMJ-Archive/Spring2010/47035-1MMA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
A leading proponent and provider of these types of War Games is Outcome Simulations ApS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outcomesimulations.com&lt;/ref&gt; led by Soren Malmborg.&lt;ref&gt;"Krigsspil kan hjælpe erhvervschefer". Dagbladet Børsen 26.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Outcome's Negotiation War Gaming method is taught in MBA courses on negotiation at [[Columbia Business School]] and [[NYU Stern School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;http://m.business.dk/?article=25236318-Ivaerksaetter-vil-saelge-%C2%BBkrigsspil%C2%AB-til-amerikanerne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/46460/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== BIW ===
Given the high budget requirements and long preparations time, BIW games are more appropriate for big companies' big decisions and large budgets, such as corporate games, involving top executives with considerable staff and consultant support. Corporate games are played over major portfolio decisions such as diversification and/or divestiture moves of the parent company (i.e., which acquisitions to go for, which business to get rid of), and over longer term horizons. BIW games are less appropriate for business units,  or ''business'' strategy decisions, as their high price tag and extensive time required from top executives are no match for small scale games with more tailored application and flexible format.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff, David. "War Games Help Businesses Prepare For Anything". Wall Street Journal (Eastern edition), Newswire: Dow Jones,5/3/02&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the difference between corporate games played over corporate strategy (portfolio management) and business games played over business strategy (competitive strategy), read Michael Porter’s articles.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Michael E. ["From Competitive Advantage to Corporate Strategy". ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', May–June, 1987 pp. 43-59 and "What is Strategy", ''Harvard Business Review'', Nov-Dec. 1996, pp. 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BIG ===
Game theory and computer simulation games are appropriate for planning and decision support in industries in relatively stable state, known distributions of outcomes, and predictable competitors, as they are best suited for finding equilibrium solutions among a relatively large set of known variables (payoffs and moves). On the other hand, BIG games are handicapped in rapidly changing industries, markets where surprise moves by new players is a possibility, situations requiring innovative and creative approaches, and in decisions calling for specific practical ideas rather than more generic moves (such as raise, stay or lower prices by x%). Decision makers looking at war gaming should also be minded of game theory’s own lack of empirical support, as people seem to irrationally follow behaviors that do not result in their best outcome.

=== BIB ===
Business war games employing role-playing and competitor analytical techniques are most beneficial in business strategy at the business unit, market, brands, product and project levels. BIB games have been applied with great success to new product launches, offensive and defensive moves against specific competitors (whose response is analyzed using the advanced competitor analysis techniques), in organizational development’s (training the next generation executive cadre) "competitive landscape" games, and in brand revival and new market entry situations. According to participants, BIB games provide touch reality-based challenge to strategies and plans that helps companies cope with uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Woodruff (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; They are less useful in conglomerate strategy as they apply to business strategy and not across unrelated industries. BIB are also more culture sensitive, and should be applied with caution in cultures where honest discussion of blindspots is less than appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Gilad (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The methodological superiority of BIB games over other techniques received strong empirical support from a meta study on the effectivenes of predictions of competitive outcomes using "role playing".&lt;ref&gt;Kesten C. Green, “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts: Further evidence”, International Journal of Forecasting 21 (2005) 463– 472&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWG (Pure Role-Play) ===
"Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have shown to generate significantly better predictions of negotiation outcomes compared to other popular methods.&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. C. (2005), “Game theory, simulated interaction, and unaided judgment for forecasting decisions in conflicts,” International Journal of Forecasting, 21, 463-472&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" Negotiation War Games have also been shown to ensure significantly lower prices in procurement negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Robert J. (1991),“Simulated Negotiations: A Measure of their Effectiveness on Negotiated Outcome”. Naval Postgraduate School&lt;/ref&gt; and greater writedowns in auditor vs. client negotiations concerning obsolete inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Trotman, Ken T. (2005),“Auditor negotiations: An examination of the efficacy of intervention methods”.The Accounting Review, Vol. 80, No. 1. pp. 349-367&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games have been used extensively in business negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Stuart (2010). ” Getting More: How to Negotiate to Achieve Your Goals in the Real World”. Crown Business&lt;/ref&gt; "Pure Role-Play" War Games are furthermore often used in politics. Negotiation War Gaming was used to prepare President Ronald Reagan for his negotiations with Gorbachev in Reykevik and Geneva in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Matlock, J.F. Jr. (2004). Reagan and Gorbachev: How the cold war ended. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential candidate John Kerry used a Negotiation War Game to prepare for his first TV-duel with George W. Bush in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Wilgoren, J. &amp; Stevenson, R.W.  (2004). The 2004 campaign: Strategy; day after debate, campaigns assess the performances. The New York Times, October 2, Later edition – final, Section A, p. 10 column 1&lt;/ref&gt; Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney used the method prior to the 2012 presidential TV-duels. The NTC (National Training Center, Fort Irwin. Ca.) recommend that all U.S. and Canadian Army officers be trained in the method before deployment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlisle.army.mil/DIME/documents/PUB792.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board Games ===
Board games can be used for business war games. In this case, they are [[wargaming|war games]] for civilians applied with a [[marketing warfare]] analogy to a market situation.&lt;ref&gt;Goria, S. [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00584200/fr/ Information display from board wargame for marketing strategy identification], International Competitive Intelligence Conference: Delivering excellence in Competitive Intelligence thinking and practice in a challenging environment, Bad Nauheim, Germany, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, these authors talk about [[creative competitive intelligence]].

== The war metaphor ==
To some, the war metaphor implicit in "business war game" is an accurate or useful depiction of business and competitive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/55076/business-war|title=Business As War|last=Fuller|first=Mark B.|date=October 31, 1993|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-2015-2|title='Shark Tank' investor Kevin O'Leary explains why business is war|last=Feloni|first=Richard|date=February 5, 2015|website=Business Insider|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others find the war metaphor potentially counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatifyourstrategy.com/2010/08/18/the-war-game-metaphor/|title=The War (Game) Metaphor|last=Chussil|first=Mark|date=August 18, 2010|website=|publisher=Advanced Competitive Strategies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/debunking-the-myth-that-business-is-war/|title=Debunking the Myth that Business is 'War'|last=Heffernan|first=Margaret|date=January 24, 2011|website=|publisher=CBS Moneywatch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies play up the war metaphor simply to encourage out-of-the-box thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/27580/business-war-so-lets-have-war-game|title=Business is War - So Let's Have a War Game|last=Diamond|first=David|date=December 31, 1996|website=|publisher=Fast Company|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others downplay it with terms such as "strategy game."

'''Central Santo Domingo''' or better known as '''Polígono Central''' ({{lang-en|Central Polygon}}) is a term used to group several neighborhoods located in central [[Santo Domingo]], [[Distrito Nacional]], [[Dominican Republic]] defined as the area delineated by ''John F Kennedy'' Avenue (also known as [[DR-1]]) on the north, on the west by ''Winston Churchill'' avenue, on the east by ''Maximo Gomez'' avenue, and on the south by ''27 de Febrero'' avenue (also known as [[DR-3]]).

The centric area forms the core of the city of Santo Domingo which includes the neighborhoods of [[Ensanche Naco|Naco]], [[Piantini]], [[Paraíso, Distrito Nacional|Paraíso]], and [[Yolanda Morales]]. This central polygon, as the name implies, serves as the main economic and business center of the city. The neighborhoods within the bounds of Downtown are granted higher-desinty zoning by the ''Ayuntamiento del Distrito Nacional''. Some of the most affluent neighborhoods of [[Santo Domingo]] are located within the downtown even as growth has overflowed to other locations outside the area. Piantini, Naco, &amp; Paraiso all experience high levels of urbanization and better than average quality of life. The area is mostly composed of mixed-development zoning having most of the commercial zoning on the main avenues while having mostly residential zoning in the inner streets.

Some of the most important avenues of the city are located in the Polígono Central including ''Wiston Churchill'' avenue with very high banking and commercial activity, and ''Abraham Lincoln'' avenue serving as the main thoroughfare of the city-center. Since the late 1990s a general trend of vertical growth has been experienced throughout the area creating complications of traffic and lack of appropriate infrastructure to handle the higher density levels. Most of Downtown Santo Domingo does not have the adequate infrastructure to handle high-density office and residential buildings and until the late 1990s it was mostly composed of large family homes and low-rise buildings. Rapid urbanization has led to solutions like the new [[Santo Domingo Metro]] and the creation of two express urban corridors to the north and south of Downtown.

*'''Paraiso''' is located in the northwest corner of Downtown Santo Domingo bounded by [[DR-1#Expreso John F Kennedy|Expreso Kennedy]], ''Wiston Churchill'', Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln avenues North, West, South, and East respectively. The neighborhood has experienced increased development with the construction of mid and high-rise residential apartment. Some locations of interest are the Club Paraiso, Colegio Claret, the headquarters of INDOTEL, and Plaza Paraiso.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Santo Domingo1.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The neighborhoods of Yolanda Morales and Piantini (background) along Calle Federico Geraldino]] --&gt;
*'''Yolanda Morales''' is a neighborhood sandwiched between Paraiso to the north and the more upscale neighborhood Piantini to the south. It is bounded to the west Wiston Churchill avenue and to the east by Abraham Lincoln. In recent years, like the rest of Central Santo Domingo the neighborhood has seen increased vertical development with the construction of mid and high-rise development. Blue Mall is set to open its door by 2011 making the newest addition to the neighborhood.
*'''Piantini''' is located in the southwest corner of Downtown Santo Domingo directly below Yolanda Morales. Piantini has been for the past decades one of the most affluent neighborhoods of [[Santo Domingo]] composed of mostly the upper class citizens. It has undergone a transformation from a low-density neighborhood to a present one with high levels of urbanization which has made Piantini one of the most dense neighborhoods of the city with impressive land value when compared to the city's average. Bounded by Wiston Churchill avenue to the west it is home to Citibank Tower/Acropolis Mall, Plaza Central, Banco de Reservas, Plaza de Las Americas, and Scotiabank. To the south it is bounded by [[DR-3#Expreso 27 de Febrero/Expreso de las Americas|Expreso 27 de Febrero]] avenue which serves as the main corridor of the city. To the east it is bounded by the Abraham Lincoln avenue the main artery across Downtown Santo Domingo. Along this avenue there is a high concentration plaza,  and finance towers the most important being Plaza La Francesa, Unicentro Plaza, Torre Piantini, Novocentro. Piantini has grown in a way in which all commercial activity are mostly found in the avenues that bound it while it center is densely residential causing a lot of traffic and infrastructure problems for a neighborhood that wasn't originally planned to withstand such density.
*'''Serralles''' is a neighborhood located in the North of the polígono central roughly bounded by ''John F Kennedy'' Avenue ([[DR-1]]) to the North, ''[[Abraham Lincoln]]'' Avenue to the west, ''Gustavo Mejia Ricart'' avenue to the south and ''[[Lope De Vega]]'' Avenue to the east.
*'''Naco''' is located in the south-central section of Downtown Santo Domingo. It is bounded by Expreso 27 de Febrero to the south, Gustavo Mejia Ricart to the North, Abraham Lincoln to the west, Lope de Vega to the Northwest, and Tiradente avenue to the East. A very affluent neighborhood like Piantini it has many plaza, office buildings, and mid-rise residencies. The particular neighborhood is also notable because it has a small 3x3 block area of informal settlement (named La Yuca) contrasting the rest of the affluent neighborhood a primary example of the unequal distribution of wealth that affects the city.
*'''Arboleda''' is a small neighborhood located in the southeast corner of Downtown Santo Domingo in between what is Naco and Centro Olimpico Juan Pablo Duarte. Sometimes it is also grouped together as part of Naco due to its small sized and for Naco being a more upscale neighborhood. Its boundary are roughly defined as everything south of the ''Gustavo Mejia Recart'' avenue ending at the ''27 de Febrero'' corridor. Its eastern border is ''Jose Ortega y Gasset'' Avenue and  the COJPD complex while its western border lies at the ''Tiradentes'' avenue.

==War==
As a Quaker, 18-year-old Chris Barber, was opposed to war and chose to join the [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] before he was called up. He faced a [[Conscientious Objector]] Tribunal, refusing to seek favourable treatment by declaring himself a Quaker. He was, however, permitted to join the FAU, with whom he worked until 1947. His service included a period of war relief work in China.&lt;ref&gt;China: ''See'' items in list of Chris Barber's writings concerning China. ''See also'' [http://www.fauchinaconvoy.org FAU China Convoy Reunion Group website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Biscuits business==
When he returned, he trained as an accountant and joined the family firm, [[Jacob's|Jacob's Biscuits]], in 1949. By innovations, mergers and acquisitions, the firm grew to become [[Huntley &amp; Palmer]] then Associated Biscuits and he rose to be Finance Director.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Barber's employer, Associated Biscuits, is now called [[United Biscuits]]&lt;/ref&gt; He retired in 1980.

==Famine relief==
In 1980, he had joined the Board of Trustees of Oxfam. In 1983, he became its Chair, in which role, he served until 1989. "Oxfam grew dramatically&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/history-of-oxfam Oxfam History timeline for the decade 1980 – 1989]

*1982. ''Bitter Pills'' published: We publish a new report on the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and poverty. It’s the latest in a series of books that helps bolster Oxfam’s reputation as a wide-ranging expert on development issues. (by [[Dianna Melrose]])
*1984. [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Famine in Ethiopia]]: Harrowing TV footage prompts unprecedented public support and a surge of interest in the crisis in Africa. Initiatives like [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] contribute to Oxfam's response, and our income doubles in a single year – to £51 million.
*1984. 'Hungry for Change': [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], [[Roy Hattersley]], [[Edward Heath|Ted Heath]] and [[Joanna Lumley]] help launch an initiative to raise funds and awareness for Oxfam's food work. Within a year, Oxfam has a network of more than 300 groups nationwide
*1985. Giant march on House of Commons: 20,000 supporters of Oxfam and other charities join the biggest ever lobby (at the time) on parliament to call for more aid, especially to Africa. One million people sign a petition in support. (For a contemporary account, ''see'' “Lobbyists attack aid record” by Seumas Milne in ''The Guardian'' (1959–2003); 23 October 1985; pg. 2.)
*1986. GADU gets going: It might not have the most glamorous name, but the launch of the Gender and Development Unit (or GADU) is definitely a landmark moment. GADU focuses money and attention on women’s development – a key element of Oxfam’s work to this day.
*1988. First [[Comic Relief|Red Nose Day]]: Oxfam sells the plastic noses that quickly become synonymous with the biannual festival of life-changing comedy. We've been closely linked with Comic Relief since it was born in 1985 – and we still proudly stock their superlative scarlet snouts.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in his role as chairman, Chris was keen to ensure that the extra donations were used well, not just to tackle famine but to ensure sustainable development thereafter. His was a wise and compassionate hand on the tiller.&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/news.php?id=1140260 |title=Henley on Thames – Quaker company director who became Oxfam chairman |publisher=Henleystandard.co.uk |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203223918/http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/news.php?id=1140260 |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

He was a "hands-on" Chair and was deeply concerned with Oxfam's decision, in November 1985, to close its bank account at [[Barclays Bank]] because of Barclays involvement with the South African [[Apartheid]] regime. He travelled to South America, India and Sudan and sorted out a diplomatic disaster in Cambodia.&lt;ref name="TimesObit"&gt;''The Times'' Obituary- Cited above – Sources&lt;/ref&gt; Long after his retirement, he could be found, helping out, at the Oxfam bookshop in [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]].&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"/&gt;

Anne lived 1 January 1923 to 12 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; had met at their Quaker schools in York.&lt;ref&gt;"Quaker schools in York" : presumably [[The Mount School, York]] (girls) and [[Bootham School]] (boys).&lt;/ref&gt; They married in January 1952.  Both were active in local, regional and national Quaker activities. Chris, among other roles, was Chairman of the Social Responsibility Council, 1970 – 1972; Clerk of Quaker Social Responsibility and education, 1979 – 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Description of contributors to ''A Quaker miscellany for Edward H.

==Other activities==
The obituary in ''The Henley Standard'' said:&lt;blockquote&gt; ". . . he was known for organising treasure hunts on and around [[Rotherfield Peppard|Peppard Common]] and many other activities involving local families.

For several years he organised a [[hockey]] match at New Year on a field near the Dog in Peppard with 20 or 30 people, from small children to ageing grandparents, on each side and no referee! Fortunately, the games were all played in good spirit and there were no injuries. On one occasion, the match was played in deep snow.".&lt;ref name="HenleyStd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dog, mentioned in relation to the hockey game, is a [[public house]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Donald N. Pritzker''' (October 31, 1932&amp;nbsp;– May 6, 1972) was an [[Americans|American]] [[entrepreneur]], businessman, and member of the wealthy [[Pritzker family]].

==Early life and education==
Pritzker was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/184547 The Economist: "Jay Pritzker, pioneer of the modern hotel chain, died on January 23rd, aged 76"] January 28, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the son of Fanny (née Doppelt) and [[Abram Nicholas Pritzker|A. N. Pritzker]]. He had two older brothers: [[Jay Pritzker]] (1922 - 1999) and [[Robert Pritzker]] (1926 - 2011).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/25/business/jay-pritzker-who-built-chain-of-hyatt-hotels-is-dead-at-76.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm New York Times: "Jay Pritzker, Who Built Chain Of Hyatt Hotels, Is Dead at 76" By ANTHONY RAMIREZ] January 25, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Pritzker studied at the [[Francis W. Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]] and graduated with a B.A. from [[Harvard University]] and a J.D. from the law school at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=ChicagoMagTremors&gt;[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2002/Tremors-in-the-Empire/ Chicago Magazine: "Tremors in the Empire" By Shane Tritsch] December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1961, after he graduated from law school, he went to work for the family company, the [[Marmon Group]].&lt;ref name=LATimesRoomsWithAView&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-24/business/fi-24332_1_pritzker-family Los Angeles Times: "Rooms With a View : Chance Encounter Led to Creation of Rapidly Expanding Hyatt Hotels Chain' by NANCY RIVERA BROOKS] November 24, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother [[Jay Pritzker]] assigned him the task of managing the [[Hyatt|Hyatt Hotel chain]].&lt;ref name=LATimesRoomsWithAView /&gt; Donald moved to [[Atherton, California]] and went about developing the chain and soon became Hyatt's president. In 1967, the Pritzkers bought a newly built hotel in downtown Atlanta out of bankruptcy which had an unusual design consisting of a 21-story atrium lobby with external glass elevators, fountains, and caged tropical birds. Donald renamed it the ''Hyatt Regency Atlanta''; it became an instant success and served as the architectural model for all future Hyatt hotels.&lt;ref name=LATimesRoomsWithAView /&gt;

Donald was credited with "setting the tone for the culture and philosophy at Hyatt" and presided over its growth from a six hotel chain to the 5th largest hotel chain in the world at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=LATimesRoomsWithAView /&gt;

'''FinTech Awards''' are several award ceremonies, most of them unrelated, which are held all over the world to recognize excellence in [[financial technology]] as assessed by public vote and panels of judges. As a rule, there are many categories and prizes. Hundreds of companies, mostly [[startup company|startups]], participate as candidates.

As of 2016, major fintech awards ceremonies are held in [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]]. Two ceremonies are not national but continental: the African FinTech Awards and Conference, and the European Fintech Awards.

==Awards by country and continent==

===Africa===

The first ''African FinTech Awards and Conference'' will be held within the Finance Indaba Africa conference and expo in [[Johannesburg]] in October 2016. It will gather [[Africa]]'s leading FinTech entrepreneurs, bankers, investors and advisors.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fintechafrica.co.za/awards.html |title = FinTech Awards &amp; Conference Africa: Meet the African FinTech 100 |publisher = FinTech Africa |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

The 1st ''Annual Australian FinTech Awards'' will be held on 23 June 2016. The awards will be given in thirteen categories. The project, product, research paper, campaign, or activity that is entered must have been created, developed or released in the 18 months before the awards to be a valid entry.&lt;ref name=Fintech&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fintechawards.net/ |title = 1st Annual Australian FinTech Awards 2016 |publisher = FinTech Awards |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Glen Frost, the founder of  FinTech Summit, and sponsored by [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst]], the awards celebrate the achievements of the people and businesses comprising the [[fintech]] sector.&lt;ref name=Leader&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thoughtleadership.grantthornton.com.au/post/102dbdl/recognising-the-achievements-of-the-fintech-sector |title = Recognising the achievements of the Fintech sector! |author = Madeleine Mattera |publisher = Thought Leadership |date = 19 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Summit&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fintechsummit.com.au/ |title = FinTech Summit 2016 |publisher = FinTech Summit |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Meetup&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/FinTech-Sydney/messages/boards/thread/49813040 |title = FinTech Awards 2016: now FREE to enter |author = Glen Frost |publisher = FinTech Sydney |date = 4 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian FinTech Awards were created in 2014 by the Digital Finance Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|title=Digital Finance Institute|website=www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent global think tank for FinTech created in 2013, that has helped build the Canadian FinTech ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org/?page_id=330|title=FinTech – Digital Finance Institute|website=www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Canadian FinTech Awards were held on October 19 2015, in Toronto as part of the  Digital Finance Institute's Annual National Conference in [[Toronto]].

===Europe===

The ''European FinTech Awards'' is an organization that aims to disrupt traditional financial intuitions by providing a platform for fintech [[entrepreneur]]s to collaborate with one another.&lt;ref name=Week&gt;{{cite web |url = http://paymentweek.com/2016-5-5-blockchain-firm-wins-eu-fintech-award-10432/ |title = Blockchain Firm Wins EU Fintech Award |author = Ryan Kennedy |publisher = Payment Week |date = 5 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Dutch and African awards, the European awards are the result of an initiative of Alex van Groningen BV, a Dutch financial publisher.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hollandfintech.com/dutch-isnt-holland-fintech/ |title = Why Dutch isn’t the same as Holland in FinTech |publisher = Holland Fintech |date = 5 December 2015 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards start with the ''European FinTech 100'', a selection of innovative companies with ground-breaking ideas and technologies. The wide batch is chosen by the vote of more than 55,000 fintech enthusiasts from all over Europe (as of 2016). Then a panel of fintech experts reduces the selection to one hundred companies. The one hundred, in turn, are the pool from which the finalists are chosen. The finalists have the opportunity to pitch during the conference.&lt;ref name=Egg&gt;{{cite web |url = https://eggsplore.eu/en/blog/2016/04/european-fintech-awards-conference-2016 |title = European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference 2016 |publisher = Eggsplore |date = 5 April 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Euro&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fintech.nl/videos-european-fintech-awards--conference-14-april-2016.html |title = Videos European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference |publisher = European FinTech Awards |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference was held in [[Amsterdam]] on 14 April 2016. 413 companies from 34 European countries were nominated. 30% of all nominees were from [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Baltic&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/good_for_business/?doc=120075 |title = For the first time, Latvian agency enters European Fintech Awards as TOP3 Innovative Banking company |publisher = The Baltic Course |date = 28 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bilan&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bilan.ch/techno-plus-de-redaction/meilleures-startups-de-scene-fintech-europe |title = Quelles sont les meilleures start-up de la scène fintech en Europe? |publisher = Bilan |language = french |date = 15 March 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7747">The '''Frasch process''' is a method to extract [[sulfur]] from underground deposits. It is the only industrial method of recovering sulfur from elemental deposits.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt; Most of the world's sulfur was obtained this way until the late 20th century, when sulfur recovered from petroleum and gas sources became more commonplace (see [[Claus process]]).

In the Frasch process, [[superheated water]] is pumped into the sulfur deposit; the sulfur melts and is extracted. The Frasch process is able to produce high purity sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulphurinstitute.org/learnmore/sulphur101.cfm The Sulphur Institute. "An Introduction to Sulphur."], accessed 17 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Frasch Process used on a salt dome.png|thumb|400px|Illustration that shows the structure of a sulfur-containing salt dome and the details of the Frasch pump used to extract the sulfur from underground formations. Superheated water is pumped into the formation to melt the sulfur. The molten sulfur is lifted to the surface with compressed air.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haynes/&gt;]]
The Frasch sulfur process works best on either salt domes or bedded evaporite deposits, where sulfur is found in [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] rock layers trapped in between impermeable layers. Bacterial alteration of anhydrite or gypsum, in the presence of hydrocarbons, produces limestone and [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the [[sulfur cycle]]. The hydrogen sulfide then oxidizes into sulfur, from percolating water, or through the action of anaerobic, sulfur-reducing bacteria &lt;ref name=Ober&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ober |first1=Joyce |title=MATERIALS FLOW OF SULFUR, USGS Open-File Report 02-298 |date=2002 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Interior, USGS |pages=12-13 |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-298/of02-298.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haynes&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haynes |first1=Williams |title=Brimstone, The Stone that Burns |date=1959 |publisher=D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc. |location=Princeton |pages=4-5,54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, miners discovered [[sulfur]] in the [[caprock]] of a [[salt dome]] in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana]], but it was beneath [[quicksand]], which prevented mining. In 1894 the German-born American chemist, [[Herman Frasch]] (1852–1914), devised his Frasch method of sulfur removal using pipes to bypass the quicksand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  | title = Obituaries - Herman Frasch, Paul L. V. Héroult | journal = Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry  | year = 1914 | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 505–507 | doi = 10.1021/ie50066a024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process proved successful, on December 24, 1894, when the first molten sulfur was brought to the surface.  The [[Union Sulphur Company]] was incorporated in 1896 to utilize the process.  However, the high cost of fuel needed to heat the water made the process uneconomic until the 1901 discovery of the [[Spindletop]] oil field in Texas provided cheap fuel oil to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DsSmPKEOWDcC&amp;pg=PA1512 | author = D'Arcy Shock | year = 1992 | chapter = Frasch sulfur mining | title = SME Mining Engineering Handbook | publisher = Society for Mining Metallurgy and Exploration | pages = 1512 | format = [[Google Books]] excerpt| isbn = 9780873351003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Frasch process began economic production at [[Sulphur, Louisiana|Sulphur Mines, Louisiana]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;

When Frasch's patent expired, the process was widely applied to similar salt-dome sulfur deposits along the [[Gulf Coast]] of the United States.  The second Frasch-process mine opened in 1912 in [[Brazoria County, Texas]].  The Gulf Coast came to dominate world sulfur production in the early and middle 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dks04 Handbook of Texas Online: ''Sulfur industry''], accessed 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, starting in the 1970s, byproduct sulfur recovery from oil and natural gas lowered the price of sulfur and drove many Frasch-process mines out of business.  The last United States Frasch sulfur mine closed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-298/of02-298.pdf Joyce A. Ober (2002) ''Materials Flow of Sulfur'', US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 02-298], p.12, PDF file, retrieved 20 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A Frasch mine in Iraq closed in 2003 due to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

The Frasch process is still used to work sulfur deposits in Mexico and Poland.

==Process==
[[File:Frasch Process.png|400px|right]]
In the Frasch process, three concentric tubes are introduced into the sulfur deposit. [[Superheated water]] (165&amp;nbsp;°C, 2.5-3 MPa) is injected into the deposit via the outermost tube. Sulfur (m.p.&amp;nbsp;115&amp;nbsp;°C) melts and flows into the middle tube. Water pressure alone is unable to force the sulfur into the surface due to the molten sulfur's greater density, so hot air is introduced via the innermost tube to froth the sulfur, making it less dense, and pushing it to the surface.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

The sulfur obtained can be very pure (99.7 - 99.8%). In this form, it is light yellow in color. If contaminated by organic compounds, it can be dark-colored; further purification is not economic, and usually unnecessary. Using this method, the United States produced 3.89 million tons of sulfur in 1989, and Mexico produced 1.02 million tons of sulfur in 1991.

{{nihongo|'''Galápagos syndrome'''|ガラパゴス化|Garapagosu-ka|/ Galápagos effect}} is a term of Japanese origin, which refers to an isolated development branch of a globally available product. The term is used as an analogy to a part of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.  Darwin encountered in the [[Galápagos Islands]] isolated flora and fauna, which had undergone evolutionary changes independently from the mainland. This phenomenon was a key to the development of [[evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Darwin stated that in the biological isolation species have evolved to develop different characteristics, allowing adaptation making them more viable in the local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Darwin in Galapagos |publisher=Galapagos Islands |url = http://www.galapagosislands.com/galapagos-history/galapagos-charles-darwin.html|website = www.galapagosislands.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a development of goods "in relative isolation from the rest of the world because of a focus on the local market"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Because of "Galapagos syndrome," most of Japan’s cash machines are useless to foreigners|url = http://qz.com/411905/because-of-galapagos-syndrome-most-of-japans-cash-machines-are-useless-to-foreigners/|website = Quartz|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; can lead to similarly differing products.

The term "Galápagos syndrome" has been used as a [[metaphor]] outside the field of business jargon. The term "Galápagosization", referring to the process of the isolation of Japanese "Galápagos-thinking", links this process to the Japanese [[island mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hugh Ashton "Japan’s Galapagos Effect" {{!}} ACCJ Journal (Journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan) on January 15, 2011|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = ACCJ Journal, reproduced by kind permission of ACCJ at: Eurotechnology Japan KK|accessdate =2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is 'Galapagos-thinking' Japan back at its evolutionary dead end?|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2011/01/23/commentary/is-galapagos-thinking-japan-back-at-its-evolutionary-dead-end/#.VjevCK4vdE4|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = island mentality - The Japan Times|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/island-mentality/|website = The Japan Times|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in Japan ==

=== Technology ===

==== Mobile phones ====
The term "Galápagos syndrome" was originally coined to refer to Japanese 3G [[mobile phones]], which had developed a large number of specialized [[Japanese mobile phone culture#Features|features]] that were widely adopted in the Japanese market, but were unsuccessful abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Jargon Watch |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/st_jw/ |quote=Galápagos syndrome n. The scourge of Japanese mobile companies, whose superadvanced 3G handsets won't work on foreign cell networks. It's named for the birds of the Galápagos, whose specialized beaks don't cut it on the mainland. |work=[[Wired magazine]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Devin Stewart]] |coauthors= |title=Slowing Japan's Galapagos Syndrome |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/devin-stewart/slowing-japans-galapagos_b_557446.html |quote='Galapagos syndrome', a phrase originally coined to describe Japanese cell phones that were so advanced they had little in common with devices used in the rest of the world, could potentially spread to other parts of society. Indeed signs suggest it is happening already. |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the original usage of the term was to describe highly advanced phones that were incompatible outside of Japanese networks, as the mobile phone industry underwent drastic changes globally, the term was used to emphasize the associated anxiety about how the development of Japanese mobile phones and those in the worldwide economy went along different paths. A derived term is {{nihongo|Gara-phone|ガラケー|gara-kei}}, blending with {{nihongo|"mobile phone"|携帯|keitai}}, used to refer to Japanese [[feature phone]]s, by contrast with newer [[smart phone]]s.
* "Japan's cellphones are like the endemic species that Darwin encountered on the Galápagos Islands—fantastically evolved and divergent from their mainland cousins—explains Takeshi Natsuno, professor at Tokyo's Keio University."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |first= Hiroko|last= Tabuchi|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why Japan’s Cellphones Haven’t Gone Global  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/technology/20cell.html?em |quote=The Japanese have a name for their problem: Galápagos syndrome.

* The term has since been used for similar phenomena in other markets.{{examples|date=August 2016}}

==== Cash machines ====
Across Japan, the majority of the 190,000 [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] do not accept bank and credit cards that have been issued outside of the country. Currently, only about 20,000 post offices and convenience stores allow retrieving cash using non-Japanese bank cards. Due to pressure from the Japanese government concerning this issue, by 2020 the number of ATMs that accept cards issued outside Japan is estimated to increase from 48,000 to 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ATMs in Japan|url = http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html|website = www.japan-guide.com|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing numbers of international tourists in Japan, the country still attracts relatively few tourists according to the [[United Nations World Tourism Organization]], which ranked Japan 27th in the list of most visited countries 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Japanese Banks to Ease Tourists’ ATM Frustrations|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/japanese-banks-to-link-more-atms-to-global-grid-1426218340|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-02|issn = 0099-9660|first = Atsuko|last = Fukase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wallet phone ====
In 2004 the wallet phone was introduced in Japan as a means to allow [[mobile payment]] alongside numerous other applications. In some ways the wallet phone can be seen as a predecessor of mobile payment tools that were later released on the global market such as [[Apple Pay]] or [[Google Wallet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wallet phone Japan and the mobile payment ecosystem|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/store/walletphone/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete integration of multiple tools served to make the classical wallet redundant as the phone allows all types of payments, having train tickets or other everyday needs to be organized on the phone. In many ways the Japanese contactless infrastructure has been and is superior as compared to the current state in rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Apple Pay? No big deal in Japan where mobile payment is years ahead|url = http://www.themalaymailonline.com/tech-gadgets/article/apple-pay-no-big-deal-in-japan-where-mobile-payment-is-years-ahead|website = www.themalaymailonline.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Japanese car market ===

==== Kei cars (軽自動車) ====
[[Kei car|Kei Cars]] ("light cars") are small four-wheeled vehicles/cars that have an engine of less than 660cc and enjoy preferential treatment in the form of tax advantages and lower insurance cost. Originally the Japanese government encouraged the use of those "light cars". This category of cars features a number of different car types including sport cars, minivans and commercial vehicles. However, Kei cars are not seen as profitable in export markets and therefore are only part of the Japanese automobile market.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Chris (1995). ''Microcar Mania''. Minster Lovell &amp; New Yatt, Oxfordshire, UK: Bookmarque Publishing. {{ISBN|1-870519-18-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite no significant global success, major Japanese car manufacturers such as Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu and Honda still produce models belonging into the Kei car category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Galapagos effect – how can Japan capture global value?|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/insights/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Kei car has a significant portion of Japanese car market, Japanese auto makers cannot ignore them.  Although the regulatory differences between Kei cars and 1L cars are quite small, the tax benefit of Kei cars is considerable. Until the tax reform in 2013, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate was a quarter of that of 1L cars (¥7200 to ¥29500). This significantly lower tax rate gathered much criticism from European and US auto makers, and as such the EU, the US and Toyota do not make Kei cars. In 2013, the Japanese government revised the vehicle tax law. The new vehicle tax law became effective in 2015. With new vehicle tax law, the Kei car's vehicle tax rate is about 36% of that of 1L cars (¥10800 to ¥29500).

== Handling the Japanese Galápagos syndrome ==
There are many associated issues with the inability to compete on the international export market. In order to revive the parts of the Japanese economy that have suffered from the "Galápagosization", affected businesses had to find the reasons responsible for the development.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Galápagosization of Japan continues. According to a survey released today, a shocking two-thirds of the country’s white-collar workers said they didn’t want to work abroad ... ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mariko | last = Sanchanta | title = Japan’s Workers: Please Don’t Send Me Abroad. Ever. | date = 2010-09-16 | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2010/09/16/japans-workers-please-dont-send-me-abroad-ever/ | work = The Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Reasons for the issue and associated implications for businesses ===
Furthermore, this has led a number of Japanese companies to adapt their business strategies. [[Hiroshi Mikitani]], CEO of e-commerce company [[Rakuten]], sees the exclusive use of Japanese in workplaces at the centre of the problem. Following his belief that "a language will open your eyes to the 'global', and you will break free from this conventional wisdom of a pure Japan",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hiroshi Mikitani|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/724b144e-b538-11e1-ad93-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0307-1766|first = David|last = Pilling}}&lt;/ref&gt; the co-founder and CEO of [[Rakuten]] made English the main language to be spoken in the company. Dr. Gerhard Fasol, the only European member of Euro Technology Japan's "Galapagos study group", stated that another reason for the non-success of some innovative Japanese products is Europe's conservative standpoint when it comes to certain standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan Galapagos effect. How to capture global value for Japan|url = http://www.eurotechnology.com/2013/10/07/galapagos/|website = Eurotechnology Japan|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the belief that it will improve international competitiveness [[Tadashi Yanai]], the founder and president of [[Fast Retailing]], has decided to change the way the firm works against classical Japanese business methods. A shift of the production of some textiles out of Japan to Southeast Asia was a move to the low-wage-labour market, that aimed to enable to price compete on the international textile market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globalisierung: Tabubruch|url = http://www.wiwo.de/erfolg/trends/globalisierung-tabubruch/6957128-2.html|website = www.wiwo.de|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor which [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] points out is the need for Japanese companies to adapt to stronger competition when entering global markets. This should be done by accepting to think in "new and unfamiliar ways about organization, marketing, and strategy", whilst the traditional practices that helped the companies to become a big player in the Japanese market shall be discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan’s globalization imperative|url = http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/japans_globalization_imperative|website = www.mckinsey.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that companies have started to address the issue, which ''could'' have a link to the total value of exports increasing over the past five years, there are concerns about the future Galápagosization of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trade Statistics of Japan  Ministry of Finance|url = http://www.customs.go.jp/toukei/suii/html/nenbet_e.htm|website = www.customs.go.jp|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future threats ===
With the aging and shrinking Japanese population, the fact that fewer and fewer students study abroad to acquire a more internationally oriented university education is reason for concerns over the future of the Japanese economy. Furthermore, there is a conception that the younger generation could enhance the Galápagos effect due to a lack of interest in international education and work placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who will look after Japan's elderly?|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31901943|website = BBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-02|first = Mariko Oi BBC|last = News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiyoshi Takeuchi, sociology professor at the Sophia university, describes the young generation to have less "ambition and motivation" as a result from the fear that a wrong move could have negative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Children fear that in a society with a widening gap between the rich and the poor, making a big mistake will prevent them from moving up in the world, which diminishes their ambition and motivation.|url = http://www.japantoday.com/category/quote-of-the-day/view/children-fear-that-in-a-society-with-a-widening-gap-between-the-rich-and-the-poor-making-a-big-mistake-will-prevent-them-from-moving-up-in-the-world-which-diminishes-their-ambition-and-motivation|website = Japan Today|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term referring to instances outside Japan==

=== China ===
* Stephen Ezell and [[Robert D. Atkinson]] describe a similar phenomenon pointing out associated threats this could mean for the Chinese economy. The selling of a product in China could become more expensive for foreign producers due to the fact that they now have to incorporate the Chinese technology standards into their firm. In theory, this could be beneficial for domestic producers. However, this could also lead to an isolation of the respective domestic producers due to less international competitiveness. "China has made the development of indigenous technology standards ... a core component of its industrial development strategy. ... But, by using indigenous rather than global technology standards for ICT products, China risks engendering a 'Galapagos Island' effect that isolates Chinese ICT products, technologies, and markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Middle Kingdom Galapagos Island Syndrome: The Cul-De-Sac of Chinese Technology Standards {{!}} ITIF|url = https://itif.org/publications/2014/12/15/middle-kingdom-galapagos-island-syndrome-cul-de-sac-chinese-technology|website = itif.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chinese tech firms can avoid the Galapagos effect that got Japan{{!}}Chris Davis{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|url = http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2014-12/17/content_19111144.htm|website = usa.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
* [[Mark Leonard (director)|Mark Leonard]] describes threats of how, against the predictions he made in 2005 in his book ''Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century'', the political development of the [[European Union]] happened isolated and differently than in any other political system in the world. "Europe might now be facing its own 'Galápagos moment.' ...  It may be that Europe’s postmodern order has become so advanced and particular to its environment that it is impossible for others to follow. It evolved in a protective ecosystem, shielded from the more muscular, "modern" world where most people live."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Europe’s Galápagos moment|url = http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_europes_galapagos_moment|website = www.ecfr.eu|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
* The United States was slow to adopt the [[EMV]] standard for credit and debit cards (as opposed to swiped [[magnetic stripe card]]s), which have been widely-adopted elsewhere, with merchants citing the cost of upgrading hardware and other systems to support it. Work to encourage transition began in 2015 following a series of high-profile retail data breaches involving credit card data. Payment providers implemented deadlines under which liability for fraud would shift to merchants if they did not begin accepting EMV payments by a specific date. As of April 2016, 70% of U.S. consumers had EMV cards, and around half of merchants were EMV compliant as of December 2016. However, the rollout has faced challenges, including merchants with EMV-compatible hardware that do not support EMV transactions due to a lack of certification or software support, and complaints that chip-based transactions took more time to process than swipe cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3182785/retail/is-the-rocky-road-to-emv-retail-adoption-getting-smoother.html|title=Is the rocky road to EMV retail adoption getting smoother?|first=Sharon|last=Goldman|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/02/in-2015-chip-cards-were-rare-in-the-us-three-years-later-slow-progress/|title=What happened after the US moved to chip-embedded payment cards?|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/717876/the-chip-card-transition-in-the-us-has-been-a-disaster/|title=The EMV chip credit card transition in the US has been a disaster|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/the-plan-to-make-chip-credit-cards-less-annoying|title=The Plan to Make Chip Credit Cards Less Annoying|date=2017-07-17|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5888">'''Jean Baptiste August "Guus" Kessler Jr.''' ([[The Hague]] 16 June 1888 &amp;ndash; [[The Hague]] 5 November 1972) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] industrialist. Kessler also played tennis for the Netherlands in the [[1906 Olympics]] in Athens, losing his first match to future Olympic champion [[Max Decugis]]. 

Kessler was born in a very wealthy family from [[The Hague]], the second son of six children. His  father [[Jean Baptiste August Kessler]] (1853–1900) was the first director of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Petroleum Maatschappij (''Royal Dutch Petroleum Company''), now named [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. Guus studied engineering at [[Delft University]].

Both Guus and his older brother [[Geldolph Adriaan Kessler]] were considered the "crown princes" of the Royal Dutch, but after their father died unexpectedly they had to work under their father's domineering successor, [[Henri Deterding]]. Dolf eventually left, at the urging of his fiance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=357, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped create and lead the Dutch steel company [[Hoogovens]]. Guus, by contrast, seemed to get along better with Deterding. "The brothers were also strong willed but only Guus, the younger son, succeeded in controlling his emotions and avoiding coming into conflict with Deterding, in order to reach his ultimate goal," wrote Joost Junker and Jan Luiten van Zandem in their history of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=356, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two brothers, as leading figures in two major Dutch business concerns, at one point formed a joint venture between the Hoogovens and Royal Dutch Shell to combat a threat to the oil business by [[IG Farben]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buchanan|2006|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guus, who became a director of Royal Dutch in 1923, was instrumental in leading Shell into the petroleum-based chemicals business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buchanan|2006|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Guus was the "obvious candidate" to lead Royal Dutch Shell after Deterding was forced out in 1936, but instead he was passed over in favor of a compromise choice. "It must have been a huge disappointment to Kessler to see his life's ambition thwarted with fulfillment so near."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jonker|2007|p=487, Vol. 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually achieved his dream and became director-general of Royal Dutch Shell in the years 1947-1949, retiring at age 60. For the next 12 years, he served as president-commissioner of the company. 

Guus and his first wife, Anna Francoise "Ans" Kessler-Stoop (1889–1983), had five daughters and one son. In 1932, they commissioned the noted [[French people|French]] [[Fauvist]] [[Raoul Dufy]] to paint a portrait of the family on their horses, a work that now hangs in the [[Tate Collection]] in [[London]]. Ans was a noted collector of modern art, advised by her uncle C. Frank Stoop, and donated to the Tate Collection a substantial portfolio that included works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Edgar Degas]]. She purchased a [[Vincent van Gogh]] painting on paper in 1930 and it was sold at auction for 8.8 million British pounds in 1997 by a family trust. 

The marriage of Guus and Ans ended in divorce. He married Thalia "Lia" de Kempenaer (1917–2000) in 1948.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Illegal ''per se''}}
In [[US law]], the term '''illegal ''per se''''' means that the act is inherently illegal. Thus, an act is illegal without extrinsic proof of any surrounding circumstances such as lack of ''[[scienter]]'' (knowledge) or other defenses. Acts are made illegal ''per se'' by [[statute]], [[constitution]] or [[case law]].

==Drunk driving==
Many [[drunk driving]] laws make driving with a [[blood alcohol content]] over a certain limit (such as 0.05% or 0.08%) an act which is illegal ''per se''.

==Antitrust==
In the [[United States]], illegal ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' often refers to categories of [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]] in [[antitrust]] [[law]] conclusively presumed to be an "unreasonable restraint on trade" and thus anti competitive.  The [[United States Supreme Court]] has, in the past, determined activities such as [[price fixing]], geographic [[market division]], and [[group boycott]] to be illegal ''per se'' regardless of the reasonableness of such actions. Traditionally, illegal ''per se'' anti-trust acts describe [[horizontal market]] arrangements among [[Competition (economics)|competitor]]s.

The illegal ''per se'' category can trace its origins in the 1898 Supreme Court case ''[[Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. U.S.]]'', [[Case citation|175 U.S. 211]] (1898).

A number of cases have subsequently raised doubts about the validity of the illegal ''per se'' rule.  Under modern Antitrust theories, the traditionally illegal ''per se'' categories create more of a [[presumption]] of unreasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', 441 U.S. 1 (1979); ''[[Nat's Collegiate Athletic Assn v. Board of Regents]]'', 468 U.S. 85, 98 (1984); ''[[Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co.]]'', 472 U.S. 284, 289 (1985); and ''[[FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists]]'', 476 U.S. 447 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court carefully narrowed the ''per se'' treatment and began issuing guidelines.  Courts and agencies seeking to apply the ''per se'' rule must:
# show "the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output";
# show that the practice is not "one designed to 'increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive'";
# carefully examine market conditions; and
# absent good evidence of competitiveness behavior, avoid broadening ''per se'' treatment to new or innovative business relationships.

[[File:Nienhuys, J, (1836-1928).jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Willem Maris]] (1872–1929) of Jacob Nienhuys]]

'''Jacob Nienhuys''' (born July 15, 1836 in [[Rhenen]] - died July 27, 1927 in [[Bloemendaal]]) was the founder of [[tobacco]] producer [[Deli Company]] (Deli Maatschappij) on a [[plantation]] established on a land concession from the [[Sultanate of Deli]] in [[Sumatra]] during the era of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. He returned to the [[Netherlands]] after he was indicted over the death of 7 plantation workers.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Life/Battle-to-preserve-North-Sumatra-s-smoking-past?page=2 Battle to preserve North Sumatra's smoking past] Peter Janssen April 1, 2015 Nikkei Asian Review&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]] took over administration of the company and Nienhuys maintained a role at the company becoming a very wealthy man as the company grew and its stock price increased.

[[File:Herengracht 380.jpg|thumb|Herengracht 380, built by Jacob Nienhaus in 1890]]
Nienhuys commissioned the [[Amsterdam]] city castle Herengracht 380-382 by the architect [[Abraham Salm GBzn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herengracht 380-382|url=http://www.amsterdamsegrachtenhuizen.info/gracht/hge/hge400/hg14380/|publisher=Amsterdamsegrachtenhuizen|accessdate=19 August 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; with virtually every room in a different style. The NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies now uses the building. He helped fund the Society for Folk Houses in Amsterdam. He was also involved in property development projects including the Villa Medan built in 1884 and named for the emerging city in Sumatra where the company established its headquarters. This was named after the city [[Medan]] on Sumatra.

'''Jassem Al-Kharafi''', ({{lang-ar|جاسم محمد عبدالمحسن الخرافي}}), (1940 – May 21, 2015) was a Kuwaiti [[billionaire]] businessman who was the speaker of the [[National Assembly of Kuwait|Kuwaiti National Assembly]] from 1999 to 2011.  Al-Kharafi studied Business Administration at the Manchester Trade Faculty in Kuwait and was director of [[M. A. Kharafi &amp; Sons]] before being elected to the National Assembly in 1975.  He affiliated with the [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies and was regarded as a pro-government liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~polmfh/database/families.htm#81|title=العائلات|work=Gsu.edu|accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al-Kharafi has broken with the royal family on occasion.  He criticized the ruling [[Al-Sabah|Al-Sabah family]], and in July 2006 vigorously denounced the Israeli attacks on [[Lebanon]] saying that the war would "turn us all into terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16444|title=Articles / Security Watch / ISN|author=ISN Editors|work=Ethz.ch|accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/mobile/inside.asp?xfile=/data/middleeast/2015/May/middleeast_May234.xml&amp;section=middleeast |title=Kuwait magnate Jassem Al Kharafi dies at 75 |publisher=Khaleej Times |date= |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Kharafi's family is wealthy. His brother [[Nasser Al-Kharafi|Nasser]] was listed by Forbes as one of the richest people in the world. His sister, [[Faiza Al-Kharafi|Faiza]], was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Kuwait University]]. The [[University of Tirana]] on 7 October 2011 gave him an ''Honoris Causa'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.com.al/lajmi-i-fundit/ut-i-jep-honoris-causa-mohammad-al-kharaf|title=UT i jep “Honoris Causa” Mohammad Al-Kharaf|work=Gazeta Panorama Online|accessdate=2015-11-19}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jassem Al-Kharafi was born in [[Kuwait City]] in 1940, the son of Mohammed Abdul Mohsen Al-Kharafi, the founder of [[M. A. Kharafi &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name=Dhow&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuwaiti billioanire Jassim Al-Kharafi dies at 75|url=http://dhow.com/2015/05/22/kuwaiti-billionaire-jassim-al-kharafi-dies-at-75/|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=Dhow News|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public dispute with Prime Minister Nasser ==
On November 3, 2007, Al-Kharafi told the pan-Arab Arabiya television in an interview that he had "question marks" about Prime Minister [[Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah]]'s decisions. A transcript of the interview was published in Alrai daily, which included Al-Kharafi's comment that too many reshuffles necessitate "a review and an evaluation of what measures should be taken."  Al-Kharafi said the reshuffle should not have been put off for the whole summer and that it indicated a "policy of patching" up problems, rather than solving them.

In response, Prime Minister Nasser issued a statement about Al-Kharafi to the state-owned Kuwait News Agency, which was splashed on the front pages of daily newspapers.  In the statement, PM Nasser said that Al-Kharafi was overstepping in bounds in trying to influence cabinet selections:  "I have no doubt that .... the speaker realizes that his attempts to interfere in forming the Cabinet and affecting its decisions is overstretching his constitutional mandate."

The back-and-forth marked the first such public tensions between a speaker and a prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/04/africa/ME-GEN-Kuwait-Politics.php ]{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on Iran ==
On July 13, 2008, Al-Kharafi publicly accused the West of provoking [[Iran]] on the nuclear issue.  In his interview with state-owned [[Kuwait Television|Kuwait TV]], Al-Kharafi said, "What is happening is that there are provocative Western statements, and Iran responds in the same way...  I believe that a matter this sensitive needs dialogue not escalation, and it shouldn't be dealt with as if Iran were one of America's states." &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908233750/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/14/africa/ME-Kuwait-Iran-Nuclear.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Human Right Committee's neglect of protocol ==
On July 1, 2008, Al-Kharafi criticized the assembly's human rights committee for holding a meeting with US embassy officials without asking permission from the speaker in accordance with protocol rules.  Khorafi blamed the US embassy for committing a "procedural mistake" by accepting an invitation by phone, insisting that "the embassy should have told the committee that such meetings could not be arranged through this way and should have followed the right diplomatic procedures."{{Cite quote| date=August 2013}}

The meeting occurred on June 30, 2008, to discuss the latest US State Department report that accorded Kuwait a tier three status on trafficking in people for its treatment of domestic helpers and foreign workers. Later, the head of the committee, Waleed Al-Tabtabai, said the meeting was held on the basis of a request by the embassy and that the committee has not "overstepped the authorities of the speaker or the foreign ministry," adding that the committee had received similar requests in the past.{{Cite quote| date=August 2013}}

The US embassy officials were reported to have refused to discuss the US decision to freeze the assets of the Revival of Islamic Heritage Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=Kuwait%3A+US+embassy+meeting+with+right+panel+angers+Khorafi+&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a|title=Kuwait: US embassy meeting with right panel angers Khorafi - Google Search|work=Google.com|accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speaker of Kuwaiti National Assembly ==
Al-Kharafi was elected Speaker of the [[National Assembly (Kuwait)|National Assembly]] in 1999. He was reelected as Speaker in all elections after until deciding that he would not stand for reelection in the [[Kuwaiti general election, February 2012|2012 National Assembly elections]]. This was due to Al-Kharafi wanting to focus on the family business after the death of his brother [[Nasser Al-Kharafi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Ahmed Al-Sadoun]] succeeded him as Speaker of the National Assembly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Wealth==
He had an estimated net worth of US$1.25 billion.&lt;ref name=therichest&gt;{{cite web|title=Jassim Al-Kharafi Net Worth|url=http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/jassim-al-kharafi-net-worth/|website=therichest|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major '''John 'Johnnie' Bigelow Dodge''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DSO|DSC|MC}} (15 May 1894 – 2 November 1960) also known as 'the Artful Dodger'&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 5&lt;/ref&gt; was an American-born [[British Army]] officer who fought in both world wars and became a notable [[prisoner of war]] during the [[Second World War]] and survived [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]].

==Early life==
Dodge's paternal great great grandfather was [[David Low Dodge]], a pacifist and founder of the New York Peace Society.  His great grandfather was [[William E. Dodge]], co-founder of [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps Dodge &amp; Co]]. His grandfather was [[Charles C. Dodge|Brigadier-General Charles Cleveland Dodge]], who fought in the American Civil War.  His parents, Charles Stuart Dodge and Flora Bigelow (daughter of [[John Bigelow]]) divorced in 1902.  Flora, who had custody of their two children, John and his sister [[Lucie Bigelow Rosen|Lucie]], remarried to Lionel George William Guest, a cousin of [[Winston Churchill]], and moved to live in Montreal, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodge|first1=Phyllis B.|title=Tales of the Phelps-Dodge Family|date=1987|publisher=New York Historical Society|location=New York|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His education included Fay School and [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], Southborough, Massachusetts and then [[McGill University]] in Canada.

==First World War==
It was through Churchill, who then was [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], that Dodge became commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Division]], arriving in England in August 1914.&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 57"&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 57&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[naturalized]] British Citizen in 1915.&lt;ref name="dodgefamily.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgefamily.org/Biographies/J/JohnBigelowDodge.shtml|title=Biographies|website=www.dodgefamily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge served in the 7th (Hood) Battalion of the [[Royal Naval Division]] first at [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Antwerp]], then at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].&lt;ref name="dodgefamily.org"/&gt; 
Together with [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Bernard Freyberg]] and two other officers, Dodge decided where [[Rupert Brooke]] was to be buried, and dug the grave on [[Skyros]], immediately before the Gallipoli assault.

While serving as a lieutenant he was wounded at Gallipoli, and awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] during this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/11/07/101570677.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His award was published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 8 November 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29358 |date=5 November 1915 |page=11029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transferring to the [[British Army]] in April 1916 with the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29547 |date=14 April 1916 |page=3921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29847 |date=1 December 1916 |supp=y |page=11832}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 10th Battalion [[Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment]] (the recently raised 'Battersea Battalion), with whom he served on the Western Front, taking part in the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]].&lt;ref name=dodger&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Tim|title=The Dodger, The Extraordinary Story of Churchill's Cousin and the Great Escape|year=2013|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|pages=61–62|isbn=978-1-780-57606-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to major on 22 Feb 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30593 |date=22 March 1918 |supp=y |page=3697}}&lt;/ref&gt; was wounded on more than one occasion, and ended the war as an acting [[lieutenant-colonel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31035 |date=26 November 1918 |supp=y |page=14052}}&lt;/ref&gt; commanding the 16th Battalion of the [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] fighting in [[Western Front (World War I)|France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31215 |date=4 March 1919 |supp=y |page=3120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was further decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Order]], this being gazetted on 3 June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31370 |date=30 May 1919 |page=6818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[demobilised]] on 18 December 1920, retaining the rank of major.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32167 |date=17 December 1920 |supp=y |page=12467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge's American cousin, [[John Bigelow, Jr.#Early life and family|Braxton Bigelow]], had also joined the British army to fight in World War I.  He was killed in Flanders in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class of 1909 Harvard College|date=1920|publisher=Harvard College|page=23|url=https://archive.org/stream/3rdreport1909harvuoft#page/n47/mode/2up|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter War Years==
He made several expeditions through these years, including visits to China and Burma,&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 57"/&gt; however on a visit in 1921 to the [[Caucasus]] he was arrested by the [[Russian secret police]] as a suspected spy.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/12/28/98779032.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After about two months of dreadful discomfort and narrowly avoiding execution, he was expelled from Russia with an order never to return there again. After this he changed his political view from [[socialist]] to [[conservative]].&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 57"/&gt;

He served on [[London County Council]] as member for [[Mile End]] (East London) from 1925–31. He failed in his bids to get into [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for the [[Mile End (UK Parliament constituency)|Mile End parliamentary constituency]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924]]&lt;ref name=dodger5&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dodger|pages=110–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general elections]].&lt;ref name=dodger6&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dodger|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his campaign for the [[London County Council]] election in 1926, Dodge engaged in a boxing [[exhibition match]] against a local professional and sustained a [[black eye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19260522.2.178?end_date=31-05-1926&amp;phrase=0&amp;query=Pillion&amp;start_date=21-05-1926&amp;type=ARTICLE|title=News from All Quarters.|date=22 May 1926|publisher=[[Auckland Star]]|pages=23|via=Papers Past}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[London Stock Exchange]] and took up the directorship of a New York bank.&lt;ref name="dodgefamily.org"/&gt;

Johnnie married divorcee Minerva Sherman (née Arrington) (1902–1980) in New York about 1929. She was born in North Carolina; her great grandparents included Governor [[Tod Robinson Caldwell]] and General [[William Thomas Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman III|first1=Charles Austin|title=Exciting Stories of my Personal Brushes with Greatness: memoirs of Another Time (1922–1956)|date=2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|page=Chapter "The Roaring Twenties"}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They had two sons, David born 1930 and Lionel (known as Tony) in 1934, both born in England.

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the war, Dodge re-enlisted into the [[British Army]], taking up the rank of major, serving with the [[Middlesex Regiment]] attached to the [[51st (Highland) Infantry Division]].

While awaiting action during the 'phoney war' stage, Johnnie secured adoption as prospective [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] parliamentary candidate for [[Gillingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Gillingham]] for the next general election which was postponed by hostilities.&lt;ref name=dodger4&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Tim|title=The Dodger|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the division surrendered at [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] in June 1940, Dodge attempted to evade capture, and swam out to sea in an attempt to board some ships he could see on the horizon. However the ships moved off before he could reach them, so he returned to land, covering approximately seven miles, before coming ashore.&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 57"/&gt; He was then captured by the Germans and became a [[Prisoner of War]].

==Prisoner of War==
Dodge, with many other [[POW]]s from the [[Battle of France|Allied defeat in France]], was forced to march towards Germany. During the march his bare feet became badly cut, and eventually he was put on a barge with other Army prisoners for transport to Germany. While on the [[River Scheldt]] he jumped overboard, but was handed over to a [[Luftwaffe]] officer by a frightened Dutch civilian.&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 58"&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 58&lt;/ref&gt; As he had become a captive of the Luftwaffe, he, with all Air Force POWs, was sent to the [[Dulag Luft]] reception and transit camp at [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]].

===Dulag Luft===
At [[Dulag Luft]] he met the Senior British Officer, [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Harry Day]], who with the agreement of the Camp Kommandant, Major Rumpel, was made part of the permanent British staff of the camp. Rumpel arranged for the records to show that he had been transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]],&lt;ref name="Wings Day page 58"/&gt; and from then on, he remained with the [[RAF]] POWs.

Escape always appealed to Dodge's mind, and here he was with good company. In addition to Day, also at the camp were the escape-obsessed [[Jimmy Buckley]] and [[Roger Bushell]].

It was from here that Dodge made his second escape attempt. A tunnel had been constructed by the permanent British staff, and in June 1941, Dodge, together with Day, Bushell and 14 others made their bid for freedom. None were successful, and all were recaptured. Dodge, and his travelling companion, were recaptured two days later walking along the [[autobahn]] a few miles south of [[Frankfurt]]. He was given a short period in solitary confinement before being transferred to [[Stalag Luft I]] at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]], with all the other recaptured escapers.&lt;ref&gt;WO208/3269 – Official Camp History – Dulag Luft (Oberersul) page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalag Luft I===
Dodge became good friends with [[Harry Day]] who had taken over the role of Senior British Officer, and he helped Day with the running of the camp and with escape matters.
He was transferred to [[Stalag Luft III]] at [[Żagań|Sagan]] in April 1942.

===Stalag Luft III (East Compound)===
Here Dodge again acted as deputy to Day. In November 1942, he was transferred again, this time to [[Oflag XXI-B]] at [[Schubin]] in [[occupied Poland]]. En route to that camp, he escaped from the train, but was immediately seen, shot at and quickly recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oflag XXI-B===
Here Dodge escaped with 34 others (including [[Harry Day]]) through a tunnel on 5 March 1943.&lt;ref&gt;'Stolen Journey' by [[Oliver Philpot]] page 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Under the Wire' by [[William Ash (pilot)|William Ash]] page 246&lt;/ref&gt; Again recaptured and after spending time in solitary, he was returned to [[Stalag Luft III]] in April 1943.

===Stalag Luft III (North Compound)===
Dodge became involved with the organisation of what became known as [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]]. Partly due to his large size, he did not help build the tunnels, but instead helped create diversions such as choir singing to help disguise the noise of the digging.&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by Tim Carroll page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge was given a place in tunnel 'Harry' and escaped at approximately 0100 on 25 March 1944 as part of [[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|The Great Escape]]. He travelled with [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[James Chrystall Wernham|James Wernham]] [[RCAF]] towards [[Czechoslovakia]]. They were caught during the afternoon of the same day at [[Hirschberg, Thuringia|Hirschberg]] main railway station.&lt;ref&gt;AIR40/2645 Official Camp History – Stalag Luft III (Section III North Compound)&lt;/ref&gt;
Taken to the [[Kriminalpolizei]] at Hirschberg they met other recaptured escapers, including [[Bertram James|Bertram 'Jimmy' James]].&lt;ref&gt;'Moonless Night' by [[Bertram James]] page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodge was the first to be removed from Hirschberg, and was sent to [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], where he was later joined by Jimmy James, [[Harry Day]] and [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Sydney Dowse]].
James Wernham, together with 49 other recaptured escapers, was murdered under [[Hitler]]'s orders.

===Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp===
The 'Great Escapers' were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agent [[Peter Churchill]], two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin.&lt;ref&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Later they were joined by [[British Commandos|British Commando]] [[Jack Churchill]].
Dowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dodge, James, Day, Dowse and Jack Churchill escaped.&lt;ref&gt;'Wings Day' by Sydney Smith page 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 236&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dodge, who travelled alone, was on the run for over a month, and after receiving help from some French slave labourers, was arrested by a German farmer and returned to Sachsenhausen.

He, with the other four, who had also been recaptured, was placed in solitary confinement and chained to the floor in the death cells at the camp. Mainly through [[Harry Day]]'s efforts all were spared execution.

===Peace Envoy===
In February 1945 he was released from solitary, and taken to Berlin where he was asked, by two senior German officials, to act as a peace envoy to the British government, with an offer of German surrender to the British and Americans, but not to the Russians. Dodge was asked to undertake this task because of his relationship to [[Winston Churchill]]&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 240-243&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Britain, after traveling to [[Dresden]], where he survived the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|RAF Air Raid on 14 February]], then [[Munich]] before crossing the border into Switzerland. He arrived in Britain in May 1945 and met Churchill and the US ambassador to Britain, [[John Gilbert Winant]] on 6 May 1945. He explained his adventures and the German peace proposal.&lt;ref&gt;'The Great Escape' by [[Paul Brickhill]] page 243&lt;/ref&gt; History records the offer was not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from Dodge to Churchill 29 April 1945|url=http://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/node?a=a;reference=CHAR%2020%2F197A%2F31|website=Churchill College Cambridge|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:John Bigelow Dodge.jpg|thumb|Memorial for John Bigelow Dodge, St Andrew's church, Ferring, West Sussex, Southern England.]]
Dodge was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his services as a [[POW]], this being recorded in the [[London Gazette]] on 18 April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37536 |date=16 April 1946 |supp=y |page=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8910">'''Mass finishing''' is a group of [[manufacturing]] processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously [[finishing (manufacturing)|finished]]. The goal of this type of finishing is to [[burnishing (metal)|burnish]], [[burr (metal)|deburr]], clean, radius, [[flash (manufacturing)|de-flash]], [[descaling|descale]], remove [[rust]], polish, brighten, [[surface harden]], prepare parts for further finishing, or break off [[die cast]] runners. The two main types of mass finishing are [[tumble finishing]], also known as barrel finishing, and [[vibratory finishing]].&lt;ref name="degarmo781,784"&gt;Degarmo, pp. 781–784.&lt;/ref&gt; Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid [[lubricant]]s, cleaners, or [[abrasive]]s, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10&amp;nbsp;minutes for [[nonferrous]] workpieces or as long as 2&amp;nbsp;hours for [[hardened steel]].&lt;ref name="degarmo781,784"/&gt;

Mass finishing processes can be configured as either batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed before the next batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter at one end and leave at the other end in the finished state. They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.&lt;ref name="degarmo784"&gt;Degarmo, p. 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
===Functions of Media===
Media are designed for four things:

;Cut: Media which cut can remove burrs and can smooth surfaces.  As a carrier of abrasive grain, the large medium pieces effectively increase the impact force of the abrasive on the metal part to be cut, thereby improving the efficiency of the abrasive.  Cutting media develop dull, [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] surfaces.

;[[Lustre (mineralogy)|Luster]]: Some grades of medium are designed to promote luster on the surface of metal parts.  These products are generally non-abrasive or have a very low degree of abrasiveness.  They deburr by [[peening]], rather than actually removing the burr.  Media selection, therefore, will control the degree of surface luster, making the part bright and shiny or developing a very matte, dull surface characterized by a completely random scratch pattern, or anything in between.

;Part separation: A very important function of the medium is to separate parts during the deburring, cutting, surface improving or burnishing operations.  The media:parts volume ratio is normally used to control the amount of part-on-part contact which will occur in a vibratory or tumble finishing operation.  At low ratios, considerable part-on-part contact occurs, while at higher ratios part-on-part contact is limited.

;Surface scrubbing: Media have the unique ability to scrub surfaces and physically assist compounds in their cleaning function.  Both abrasive and non-abrasive media are effective in this.  They can remove organic soils, scale, and other inorganic residues. Media come in a wide range of materials in order to fulfill various needs.

===Types of Media===

;Aluminum media: [[Aluminium]] media are typically [[casting|cast part]]s and are available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Aluminum scrubs parts and can work in conjunction with cleaning compounds to clean parts. Since aluminum is fairly nonabrasive it tends to remove surface impurities without affecting the part's surface qualities. Its cost is typically higher than other cast media. Wear rates are lower than [[ceramic]] but higher than steel media.

;Preformed ceramic media: Ceramic media are manufactured by mixing clay-like materials and water with abrasives, forming the mud into shapes, drying the shapes, and [[pottery firing|firing]] them at high temperatures to [[vitrify]] the binder.  Many of these binders are [[porcelain]]-like in nature.  Variability in these products occur both with the type of binder used, firing temperatures, the amount, size and type of abrasive grains they contain, and their uniformity of firing.  This type of media today is the general workhorse of mass finishing systems and is the type of medium generally used, because of its availability in a variety of shapes and sizes, low cost, and low wear rate.

;Preformed resin-bonded media: Plastic or [[resin]]-bonded media utilize a wider range of abrasive types and sizes than preformed ceramics.  The most popular grades are those using [[quartz]] as an abrasive.  [[Aluminum oxide]], [[silicon carbide]] and other abrasives are also used.  Usually, low-cost [[polyester]] resins are employed as the binder and the various shapes are produced by casting. Resin bonded media is good for preparing a metal surface for [[plating]].

;Steel: [[Case hardened]], stress-relieved steel preformed shapes are available in a variety of sizes and configurations.  Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used.  Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning.  Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods.

;Synthetic random-shaped media: The most popular synthetic random media is [[melting|fused]] aluminum oxide, which is available in a number of grades.  The more loosely bound, coarse-grained materials are characterized by fast cut and high depreciation rates.  Because of the dark color of fused aluminum oxide, the soil generated by this material is excessive in many applications.  Fine-grained fused aluminum oxide is generally employed for burnishing and in this respect is unexcelled in many applications with the possible exception of steel.  Where some light cutting is required, fine-grained aluminum oxide can develop a better luster on stainless steels and other hard surfaces than can be achieved with steel burnishing media.

;Natural random-shaped media: River rock, [[granite]], [[quartz]], [[limestone]], [[emery (mineral)|emery]] and other naturally occurring abrasive materials are also used in vibratory and tumble finishing applications.  In general, these media are not very efficient in vibratory equipment because of their high attrition rates.  

;Cobmeal, walnut-shell flour, and related materials: These are used for drying applications because of the natural ability of these materials to absorb water from metal surfaces.  These can also be blended with abrasives and used for fine-polishing applications in vibratory, barrel, or spindle finishing equipment.

;Other: [[Shoe peg]]s, leather, [[carpet tack]]s, and many other solid materials have been used at one time or another in tumble or vibratory finishing for certain applications.

==Compounds==
Compounds are added to mass finishing processes to assist in deburring, burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting [[corrosion]]. They may be liquids or dry powders. They are usually broken up into four types: deburring and finishing, burnishing, cleaning, and water stabilizing.&lt;ref name="degarmo784"/&gt;

;Deburring and finishing: These compounds are mainly designed to suspend the small particles created when deburring and abrading parts. They are also designed to keep workpieces clean and inhibit corrosion.
;Burnishing: Burnishing compounds are designed to enhance brightness and to develop certain colors after mass finishing.
;Cleaning: These compounds are usually dilute [[acid]]s or [[soap]]s designed to remove soil, grease, or oil from the incoming parts. They also provide corrosion resistance for ferrous and non-ferrous parts.
;Water stabilizers: These are used in conjunction with water to maintain a consistent [[water hardness]] and level of metal ions. This helps ensure consistent results from batch to batch.

In December 2013, NPI launched a website, ''Radix Journal'', which describes itself as "a periodical on culture, race, meta-politics, critical theory, and society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burghart|first1=Devin|title=Who is Richard Spencer?|url=http://www.irehr.org/2014/06/27/who-is-richard-spencer|accessdate=October 3, 2016|publisher=Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights|date=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPI received a grant from the [[Pioneer Fund]], a racist pseudo-scientific organization.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|issn=0042-6180|volume=52|issue=22|page=12|last=Tucker|first=Maria Luisa|title=Warp and Woof|journal=The Village Voice|date=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Twitter]] suspended the accounts of the NPI, its leader Richard Spencer and others under its [[terms of use]]. Spencer said that "digitally speaking, there has been execution squads across the alt-right"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Travis M.|last1=Andrews|date=November 16, 2016|title=Twitter suspends prominent alt-right accounts, including Richard Spencer's|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-twitter-alt-right-20161116-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused Twitter of "corporate Stalinism".&lt;ref name="Chokshi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Niraj Chokshi|date=December 12, 2016|title=Twitter Reinstates Richard Spencer, White Nationalist Leader|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/richard-spencer-twitter.html|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Twitter's suspension was not based on the content of Spencer's posts, but rather on Twitter's rule barring multiple accounts with overlapping uses.&lt;ref name="Chokshi"/&gt; Spencer's personal Twitter account was reinstated several weeks later; the NPI's remained suspended.&lt;ref name="Chokshi"/&gt;

Spencer was the headline speaker at a 2016 NPI conference held in Washington, D.C., and celebrated the election of [[Donald Trump]] as "the first step towards identity politics in the United States",&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Katie.

==Fundraising==
According to the [[Associated Press]], NPI "raised $442,482 in [[tax deduction|tax-deductible contributions]] from 2007 through 2012".&lt;ref name="enterprisemontanabased"&gt;{{cite news|title=White nationalists raise millions with tax-free charities|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/246584534/?terms=%22William%2BH.%2BRegnery%2BII%22|accessdate=October 24, 2017|work=Enterprise-Journal|location=McComb, Mississippi|date=December 22, 2016|page=A7|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes|quote=Spencer's group raised $442,482 in tax-deductible contributions from 2007 through 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NPI's [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt status]] was revoked in 2017 by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] for failing to file tax returns.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=IRS strips tax-exempt status from Richard Spencer's white nationalist nonprofit|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-richard-spencer-taxes-20170223-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had not filed a [[Form 990]] since 2013.&lt;ref name="NPQ"&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Wyland|title=Why Isn’t This White Supremacist Nonprofit Required to File 990 Returns?|work=Nonprofit Quarterly|date=December 6, 2016|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/12/06/isnt-white-supremacist-nonprofit-required-file-990-returns/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the [[Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] (VDACS), which regulates the operation of charities in Virginia, removed the NPI's entry from its public database of nonprofits and announced that it was reviewing the group's status.&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt; The NPI raised $50,000 in late 2016 and early 2017 from an online fundraising drive and has solicited donations to be sent to its Arlington, Virginia [[post office box]], but in February 2017 VDACS had listed the group as "not authorized to solicit in Virginia."&lt;ref name="Pearce"/&gt;

==Views==
NPI's website says that "the dispossession of White Americans will have catastrophic effects for the entire world, not just for our people". The organization has produced a series of reports on [[affirmative action]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[conservatism]], the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], and a report edited by [[VDARE]] contributor Nicholas Stix, ''The State of White America – 2007''. Stix's introduction to the report said it gave "a statistical and narrative portrait of the war on white America" and described the Supreme Court's 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' ruling outlawing school segregation as "arguably the worst decision in the Court's 216-year history".&lt;ref name="Baumann"/&gt;

The NPI has been described by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) as a white supremacist organization.&lt;ref&gt;Potok, Mark (April 8, 2008). [http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2008/04/08/immigration-report-being-released-today-linked-to-white-supremacists Immigration report being released today linked to white supremacists], ''Hatewatch'', Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Marilyn Mayo, the co-director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s Center on Extremism, said that the group "basically was founded to be kind of a white supremacist think tank".&lt;ref name="Baumann"/&gt;

The NPI is regarded as part of a group of white nationalist organizations that, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "try to take a more highbrow approach, couching white nationalist arguments as academic commentary on black inferiority, the immigration threat to whites and other racial issues."&lt;ref name="WinesSaul"&gt;Wines, Michael &amp; Stephanie Saul. [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/us/white-supremacists-extend-their-reach-through-websites.html "White Supremacists Extend Their Reach Through Websites"], nytimes.com, July 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups that advance similar strategies include the [[New Century Foundation]] (and its publication ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'',&lt;ref name=splc/&gt;&lt;ref name="WinesSaul"/&gt;) the [[Charles Martel]] Society (and its website the ''[[Occidental Observer]]''&lt;ref name=splc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WinesSaul"/&gt;), and the [[Pioneer Fund]], all of which have been described by the SPLC as playing leading roles in the promotion of "academic racism".&lt;ref name=splc/&gt;

'''Navin Maharaj''' (born 1939) is a [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] businessman, former mayor of [[Suva]] and member of the [[House of Representatives of Fiji]].

He is the son of one of the first three Indian members of the [[Legislative Council of Fiji]], [[James Ramchandar Maharaj]], and was born in [[Nadi]]. After working for 16 years for a well established construction company, he started his own company.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Fiji: Race and politics in an island state |year=1991 |publisher= UBC Press|location=Vancouver |isbn= 0-7748-0368-1 | pages =379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served two terms as Lord Mayor of Suva, first with the [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]], then with the [[National Federation Party]] (NFP) and finally as an independent.&lt;ref name=Howard/&gt;

He later rejoined the NFP, and in the [[Fijian general election, 1987|1987 general election]] was elected to the House of Representatives from the Suva National Constituency as a member of the National Federation Party - [[Fiji Labour Party]] coalition. He was the Minister for Trade, Industry and Tourism in the month-long [[Timoci Bavadra|Bavadra]] government deposed by [[Sitiveni Rabuka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawakibeqa.tripod.com/achievements.htm Achievements of FLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently joined the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (FLP) and served as its general secretary during the 1992 general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativenet.uthscsa.edu/archive/nl/9205/0098.html Fijian polls under disputed constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|2000 coup]], FLP leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] accused Maharaj of trying to split the FLP and he subsequently left the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijihosting.com/pcgov/hot_press/no1004.htm Chaudhry explains Baba's expulsion]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1849">'''Nikarete''' was a [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] from [[Corinth]], who lived in the 5th and 4th century BC. 

Nikarete operated a "bettering" establishment in Corinth, a city famous in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] for its [[prostitution]] trade. From Corinth and Greek literature comes the [[verb]] ''korinthiazein'', which loosely translated means "to fornicate". She bought young girls from the Corinth [[slave]] market and trained them as [[hetaera]], to let them make their own living.  Through this parental relationship Nikarete sought to increase the price her customers had to pay (free women were usually higher in demand). Nikarete's most famous hetaera was [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaira]], whom she bought along with six other girls and treated them as her own. There is a possibility that Nikarete was not a single individual or even a real person. The name ''Nikarete'' has either been attributed to artistic interpretation or to an error in referring to different individuals (Neaira or [[Nicarete of Megara]]).

==In fiction==
In Tom Holland's book "Persian Fire" he states: korinthiazein - 'to do a Corinthian' - means to fuck.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Holland "Persian Fire" Abacus 2005 (paperback edition) pg 333 {{ISBN|978-0385513111}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Aristophanes "Wealth" Chremylus says "They say that in Corinth the tarts there, when a customer come's in who's poor, they just ignore him, but a rich man gets instant admission - even by the back entrance!" &lt;ref&gt; Aristophanes "Wealth" page 276 Penguin Classics 1978 Translated by Alan H Sommerstein.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ole Kirk Christiansen''' (7 April 1891 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1958) was the founder of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[construction toy]] company [[The Lego Group]]. 

Christiansen was born in [[:da:Filskov|Filskov, South Jutland]], Denmark, the 10th son of an impoverished family in [[Jutland]]. {{cn|date=September 2017}} He trained as a [[carpenter]] and started making wooden toys in 1932 to make a living after having lost his job during the [[Great Depression]]. Soon after, his wife Kirstine died, leaving him to raise his four sons. Christiansen was inspired to construct a small wooden duck toy for his children. He never remarried. He soon learned his sons loved the new toy and decided to put the ducks into production, using the leftover wood from his old business.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In 1942, a fire broke out at the factory, forcing them to rebuild. Initially, he made miniature versions of the houses and furniture as he worked on as a carpenter, but in 1947 moved to using plastics, which were originally small plastic bears and rattles. By 1949 he had produced over 200 plastic and wooden toys.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Ole wanted a name for the group. In 1934 he launched a competition to name the company. The prize was a bottle of his own homemade wine. He won it himself.{{Failed verification|date=May 2018|reason=These sentences were probably lifted from some official Lego book rather than citing it, I've heard it before but its not in these citations}} Lego is a shortened form of the Danish words ''leg godt'', meaning "play well", and the company grew to become The Lego Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bllego.htm|title=Timeline: Lego Group|publisher=Inventors.about.com|author=Mary Bellis|date=1 May 1954|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 11 March 1958, Christiansen died from a heart attack at the age of 66,{{cn|date=May 2018}} and his third son [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen|Godtfred]] promptly took over the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/christiansen.html|title=Inventor of the Week: Ole Kirk Christiansen|publisher=Lemelson-MIT Program|date=December 2004|archivedate=27 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527123958/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/christiansen.html |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">'''Otto Torgersen''' (16 June 1910 – 12 December 2000) was a Norwegian architect and advertising executive.
[[File:Norges idrettshogskole rk 169127 IMG 0038.JPG|thumb|Norwegian School of Sport Sciences (1971)]]

Torgersen was born in [[Trondheim]], Norway. He studied advertising and  architecture at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] (1937–38). In 1947, he founded an advertisement and architectural firm, Pran og Torgersen AS,  which he operated jointly in partnership with  Christian Pran, who died in 1961.

Among his architectural designs were the [[Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology]] at [[Etterstad]] from 1960 and the [[Norwegian School of Sport Sciences]]  (''Norges idrettshøgskole'') at Sognsvann on Kringsjå in Oslo from 1971.&lt;ref name=g72&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Torgersen, Otto |first=Helge |last=Heiberg |encyclopedia=Gyldendals Store Konversasjonsleksikon |publisher=Gyldendal|location=Oslo |language=Norwegian | year=1972 |edition=3 |volume=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Norges_idrettsh%C3%B8gskole |title= Norges idrettshøgskole|publisher=  Store norske leksikon |author=    Rolf Bryhn|accessdate= September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Basin Development Council''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that was established in early 1980s by the [[governor]]s of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], and [[Hawaii]].  The Council is concerned with the  economic and social development of the [[Pacific Islands]], and conducts research and implements projects to that end.  The Pacific Basin Development Council is managed by a [[board of directors]].  

==Withdrawal of Hawaii==
In 1996, Governor [[Ben Cayetano]] withdrew Hawaii from the Pacific Basin Development Council as part of state [[budget]] cuts.  At that time, each of the four members of the Council paid [[annual dues]] of $63,000.

{{Property law}}
'''Practicing without a license''' is the act of working without the [[licensure]] offered for that occupation, in a particular [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Springhouse"&gt;Springhouse Corporation. (2004) ''Nurse's legal handbook.'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, {{ISBN|9781582552804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most activities that require licensure also have penalties for practicing without a valid, current license.&lt;ref name="Galaty"&gt;Galaty, Fillmore W. et al. (2001) ''Modern Real Estate Practice in Illinois.'' Dearborn Trade Publishing, {{ISBN|9780793142576}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, a license is offered but not required for some professions.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"&gt;[http://unlicensed-practitioner.com/69/ "Practicing Your Profession In Oregon Without a License, Legally and Ethically"] Oregon Unlicensed Practitioners, December 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

Fields where practicing without a license may carry civil or criminal penalties include [[lawyer]], [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], [[optometrist]], [[podiatry|podiatrist]], [[surgeon]], [[coroner]], [[medical examiner]], [[paramedic]], [[funeral director]], [[osteopath]], [[chiropractor]], [[dentist]], [[pharmacist]], [[engineer]], [[Aviator|pilot]], [[broadcasting]], [[nurse]], [[veterinarian]], [[midwife]], [[teacher]], [[psychologist]], [[surveying|surveyor]], [[detective]], [[social worker]], [[architect]], [[barber]], [[hairdresser]], [[electrologist]], [[tattooist]], [[cosmetologist]], [[real estate agent]], [[plumber]], [[florist]], [[accountant]], and [[masseuse]]. If a person offering their services is licensed in one of these professions, any member of the public has a right to know if that person is validly licensed or not by the licensing authority. Anyone who claims to have a license and refuses to identify themselves properly by first and last name can possibly lose any one or all of their licenses. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal for service providers to hide their identities for purposes of making it difficult to verify licensure and past disciplinary actions or license violations.

License requirements vary widely with jurisdiction, sometimes even within a single country. Practicing a professional discipline without a license may be legal in some jurisdictions. For example, nine U.S. states have passed  [[health freedom movement|health freedom laws]] that protect alternative practitioners such as herbalists from prosecution for "practicing medicine without a license."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhealthfreedom.org/InfoCenter/laws_passed.html "Health Freedom Laws Passed"] National Health Freedom Coalition, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of mental health, Oregon offers broad licensing exemptions for [[licensed professional counselor|professional counselors]] and [[Relationship counseling|marriage and family therapists]], allowing people to practice these professions either with or without a license.&lt;ref name="unlicensed-practitioner.com"/&gt; Colorado requires registration but not licensing for [[psychotherapy|psychotherapists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradopsychotherapists.com/page-1435658? "An Historical Overview of CAPS Legislative Activities"] Colorado Association of Psychotherapists, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other states also have exemptions or registration requirements instead of, or in addition to licensing for some professions.

===Other unlicensed activity===

Other occupations, such as operating a business or working as a [[professional driver]] or [[mariner]], may require specialized licensure as well. Operating a business without proper licenses can result in financial and sometimes criminal penalties. These licenses can include a general [[business license]], a [[liquor license]], a specialized [[drivers license]], and other types regulated by local, regional, state, or federal requirements. Certain occupations may require obtaining appropriate [[intellectual property]] licenses, such as [[music licensing]], [[brand licensing]], [[patent licensing]], [[software licensing]], and other permissions for use.

Non-professional activities may also require licenses for participation. These include [[driver's license]], [[amateur radio license]], [[dog license]], [[firearms license]], [[hunting license]], [[marriage license]], [[pilot license]]. Using certain products or services may also require obtaining a license, such as a [[software license]]. Operating without these licenses can lead to civil and criminal penalties.

Penalties vary depending on the severity of the infraction, but practicing without a valid, current license may be punishable by one or more methods, including [[community service]], [[fine (penalty)|fine]], [[restitution]], [[probation]] and temporary or permanent loss of the license. Criminal charges can lead to [[incarceration]], as they can range from a [[misdemeanor]] to a [[felony]], depending on the severity of the infraction.&lt;ref name="Circo"&gt;Circo, Carl J. [ed.] (2009) ''A State-by-state Guide to Construction &amp; Design Law: Current Statutes and Practices.'' [[American Bar Association]], {{ISBN|9781604425543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted incidents==
On July 6, 1885, [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[chemist]] who was a pioneer in [[microbiology]], treated [[Joseph Meister]] after the boy was mauled by a dog infected with [[rabies]] with a vaccination treatment that had thus far only been tested on animals. This was technically illegal considering Pasteur was not a licensed [[physician]], but he and his colleagues agreed that it was necessary considering his treatment seemed the only way to save the boy from a likely death. the treatment was successful, Pasteur was feted as a hero, and charges were never filed.&lt;ref name="murphy2004"&gt;Murphy, Timothy F. (2004) ''Case Studies Biomedical Research Ethics.'' MIT Press, {{ISBN|9780262632867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another more modern example is the case of [[Frank Abagnale]], who was accused of impersonating an airline pilot, lawyer, and [[teaching assistant]].

The "yogurt defense" was made famous by the trial of Carol Downer, one of the developers of [[menstrual extraction]]. She was arrested at her self-help group and charged with practicing medicine without a license, as she inserted yogurt into the vagina of another woman to treat a yeast condition.  Carol Downer was acquitted; the jury did not equate inserting yogurt with practicing medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Ruzek, Sheryl Burt. (1978) "The Women's Health Movement Feminist Alternatives to Medical Control," New York: Praeger Publishers. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]] is a Japanese comic book series created by [[Tezuka Osamu]] that is about the world's greatest surgeon, who chooses to remain unlicensed. This allows Black Jack to charge extortionate amounts of money instead of the standard fees agreed upon by the [[Japanese Medical Association]]. It also lets him perform extremely dangerous, often medically implausible or impossible operations, that are not legally allowed. Black Jack is often viewed as the Japanese equivalent to [[Batman]], in his willingness to routinely break laws to save lives for which he is frequently imprisoned by the police. It is notable that Black Jack actually completed his college medical education and carries a driver's license, though he encourages other unlicensed doctors who have no such formal training. Like many of Osamu's works, Black Jack is extraordinarily critical of the medical establishment, and is notable for raising Japanese public awareness of medical corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osamu Tezuka: Father of manga and scourge of the medical establishment|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/jul/21/medical-manga-osamu-tezuka|author=Cian O'Luanaigh|year=2010|accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of [[superhero]]es in comic books investigate crimes without detectives' licenses. In [[Detective Comics]], [[Question (comics)|The Question]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Detective Chimp]] [[John Constantine]] and John Jones/[[Martian Manhunter]] are all licensed detectives or police officers, while [[Wally West]], the third [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] is a professional crime scene investigator. [[Jonah Hex]] is a bounty hunter operating under the loose legal framework of the wild west. The [[Green Lantern]] Corps patrol the D.C. universe and enforce the ancient intergalactic laws of the guardians of Oa. In [[Marvel Comics]], [[Frank Castle]] used to be a policeman, but after his wife and child were shot to death, he left the force forever and became the mass murdering vigilante [[The Punisher]].

Batman is one of only three members of the Justice League with any medical training but is the only one who lacks an official doctorate and license to practice medicine. Nevertheless, he occasionally performs surgery on his teammates despite being the son of the doctor [[Thomas Wayne]]. In Marvel Comics, the former neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, in desperate search of a cure for his crippled hands, wasted all of his money on alternative medicine, which did not heal him. Homeless, [[Doctor Strange]] performed back alley surgeries for cash, barely able to hold the instruments.

[[Victor Frankenstein]], though often incorrectly referred to as a doctor, is only a medical student, and as such operated on his monster without a license. Prior to the monster's vivification, Frankenstein and his assistant Igor were also acting as unlicensed morticians.

The movie [[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]], among other historical inaccuracies, showed the title character practicing medicine without a license, and getting his equipment by stealing from a hospital.

The [[USA Network]] drama ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]''' protagonist, Michael "Mike" Ross, gets a high-flying job at the fictitious Pearson Hardman law firm without having the necessary license to practice law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2818">'''Remote service software''' is used by equipment manufacturers to remotely monitor, access and repair products in use at customer sites. It’s a secure, auditable gateway for service teams to troubleshoot problems, perform proactive maintenance, assist with user operations and monitor performance.  This technology is typically implemented in mission-critical environments like hospitals or IT data centers – where equipment downtime is intolerable.

==Benefits==
Remote service software helps to:
* Increase uptime, improve performance and extend the life of a device
* Control service costs by deploying patches and upgrades remotely, and ensure a first-time fix when an onsite visit is required
* Streamline administration of pay-per-use models, with automated usage monitoring
* Focus highly trained service teams on preventative maintenance, by diagnosing and repairing issues before they cause system failure
* Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty

Manufacturers are using aftermarket service a competitive differentiator.  Remote service software provides a platform for manufacturers to offer and meet stringent [[service level agreement]]s (SLAs) without increasing the size of their service team.

== Key characteristics of remote service software==
* '''Proactive:''' Remote monitoring of devices in use allows service teams to detect potential issues before they escalate, degrade performance or cause a system failure. This early warning system is a key component to issue avoidance and ability to meet more stringent [[key performance indicators|key performance indicator]] (KPIs) in SLAs. Once an issue is detected, service professionals can also use remote service technology gateways to push patches or resolve issues.
* '''Secure:''' Secure access is a core consideration of remote service.  Solutions should adhere to compliance guidelines and protect the remote connection between the manufacturer and the customer – ensuring that no data has been stolen and no outsiders have been granted access.
* '''Auditable:''' [ [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act|SOX]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[PCI DSS|PCI]] ] compliance regulations require businesses to keep track of who does what on their network.  Auditors require forensic logs to trace the steps of every interaction a remote service technician has with every device.

== Other names for remote service software==
* [[Intelligent device management|IDM: intelligent device management]]
* SSM: strategic service management
* RDM: remote device management

'''Sarah Jane Dawes Shedd''' (January 9, 1836 — 1921) was an American missionary teacher, serving [[Assyrian Christians]] at [[Urmia]] in Persia.

==Early life==
Sarah Jane "Jennie" Dawes was born in [[Malta, Ohio]], the daughter of Henry Dawes and Sarah Cutler Dawes. She attended [[Western Female Seminary]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]],&lt;ref name="Measure"&gt;Mary Lewis Shedd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y2xWIAgxXmsC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;ots=bal_Nyt8HP&amp;dq=Sarah%20Jane%20Dawes%20Shedd&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=Sarah%20Jane%20Dawes%20Shedd&amp;f=false ''The Measure of a Man: The Life of William Ambrose Shedd, Missionary to Persia''] (George H.

Another brother, [[Ephraim C. Dawes]], was a prominent historian of the [[American Civil War]]. Her nephews included [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient [[Charles G. Dawes]], Congressman [[Beman Gates Dawes]], and banker [[Henry M. Dawes]]. Among her maternal kin were [[Ephraim Cutler]], [[William P. Cutler]], and Rev. [[Manasseh Cutler (representative)|Manasseh Cutler]].

==Mission work==
Sarah Jane Dawes married the Rev. John Haskell Shedd (1833-1895) in 1859. They sailed for Persia soon after, as missionaries with the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM). They served Assyrian Christians of the Nestorian mission at [[Urmia]], which is in northwestern Iran. The Shedds took a furlough in the United States in 1870. While in America for several years, they worked among [[freedmen]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3cBUS1CMdcC&amp;q=Dawes+Shedd+Persia&amp;dq=Dawes+Shedd+Persia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbiIuR997eAhUpl1QKHRAbCpQQ6AEIRTAF ''Mission to the Freedmen: Sarah Jane Dawes Shedd and John Haskell Shedd in Charlotte, North Carolina, 1872-1878''] (undated report).&lt;/ref&gt; They returned to Persia in 1878.&lt;ref name="Measure" /&gt; Shedd wrote letters about her experiences in Persia, with the caveat, "I can not write much. My cares are very great, as I have the family stories, and the mission here, who need things; all must come to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y-47AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=Shedds%20Persia&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q=Shedds%20Persia&amp;f=false ''A History of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations with Persia''] (E.

'''Sinter plants''' [[agglomerate]] [[iron ore]] [[Iron ore#Beneficiation|fines]] (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature, to create a product that can be used in a [[blast furnace]]. The final product, a [[Sintering|sinter]], is a small, irregular nodule of [[iron]] mixed with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called [[sintering]], causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical properties of the ingredients. The purpose of sinter are to be used converting iron into steel.

Sinter plants, in combination with blast furnaces, are also used in non-ferrous [[smelting]]. About 70% of the world's primary [[lead]] production is still produced using the sinter plant–blast furnace combination,&lt;ref&gt;R J Sinclair, ''The Extractive Metallurgy of Lead'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2009), 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and this combination was formerly often used in copper smelting (at the [[Port Kembla, New South Wales#Industrial change|Electrolytic Refining and Smelting]] smelter in [[Wollongong]], [[New South Wales]], for example&lt;ref&gt;P J Wand, "Copper smelting at Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Ltd., Port Kembla, N.S.W.", in: '' Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia: The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 335–340.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==
[[File:Sinterplant1.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Sinter plant at [[JSW Ispat Steel Ltd]], [[India]].]]
Many countries, including [[India]], [[France]] and [[Germany]], have underground deposits of iron ore in dust form (blue dust). Such iron ore cannot be directly charged in a [[blast furnace]]. In the early 20th century, [[Sintering|sinter]] technology was developed for converting ore fines into lumpy material chargeable in blast furnaces. Sinter technology took 30 years to gain acceptance in the iron-making domain, but now plays an important role. Initially developed to generate steel, it is now a means of using metallurgical waste generated in steel plants to enhance blast furnace operation and reducing waste. The largest sinter plant is located in Chennai, India, and employs 10,000 people.
&lt;ref&gt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/1994/9312094.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
===Preparation of the ores===
Main feed into a sinter plant is base mix, which consists of iron ore fines, coke fines and flux (lime stone) fines. In addition to base mix, coke fines, flux fines, sinter fines, iron dust (collected from plant de-dusting system &amp; ESP) and plant waste are mixed in proportion (by weight) in a rotary drum, often called mixing and nodulizing drum. Calcined lime is used as binder of the mixed material along with water (all in particular proportion by weight) to form feed-sinter of about 5 to 7 mm in size. This sinter globules are fed to sintering machine and burnt there-in to produce blast furnace feed sinter.

===Sintering the material===
[[File:Sinterplant2.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Circle cooler for cooling hot sinter]]
Material is put on a sinter machine in two layers. The bottom layer may vary in thickness from {{convert|30|to|75|mm}}. A 12 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm sinter fraction is used, also referred to as the hearth layer. The second, covering layer consists of mixed materials, making for a total bed height of {{convert|350|to|660|mm}}. The mixed materials are applied with drum feeders and roll feeders, which distributes the nodules in certain depth throughout the sinterring machine . The upper layer is smoothed using a leveler. The material, also known as a charge, enters the ignition furnace into rows of multi-slit burners. In the case of one plant, the first (ignition) zone has eleven burners. The next (soaking/[[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) zone typically offers 12 burners. Air is sucked from the bottom of the bed of mixed material throughout the sintering machine. Fire penetrates the mixed material gradually, until it reaches the hearth layer. This end point of burning is called burn through point (BTP). The hearth layer, which is nothing but sinter in smaller size, restricts sticking of hot sinter with pallets. BTP is achieved in a certain zone of sinter machine, to optimize the process, by means of several temperature measuring instrument placed throughout the sinter machine. After completion of burning, the mix converts into sinter, which then breaks into smaller size by sinter breaker. After breaking into small sizes, it cools down in cooler (linear or circular) by means of forced air. At discharge of sinter cooler, temperature of sinter is maintained as low, so that the hot sinter can be transported by a conveyor belt made of rubber. Necessary precautions are taken to trace any existence of fire in the belt and necessary extinguishing is done by spraying water. Then this product is being passed through a jaw-crusher, where the size of sinter is further reduced (~ 50 mm) into smaller size. Then the complete mixture is being passed through two screens. Smallest sinter fines (&lt; 5 mm) are stored in proportioning bins and reused for preparing sinter again through mixing and nodulizing drum and fed to sinter machine for burning. A part of the smaller one ( 5 - 20 mm) is used for hearth layer in sinter machine and the rest is taken to the blast furnace along with the biggest sized sinters.   

The temperature is typically maintained between {{convert|1150|and|1250|C|F}} in the ignition zone and between 900 and 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in the soaking zone to prevent sudden quenching of the sintered layer. The top 5&amp;nbsp;mm from screens goes to the conveyor carrying the sinter for the blast furnace and, along with blast furnace grade sinter, either goes to sinter storage bunkers or to BF bunkers. Blast furnace-grade sinter consists of particles sized 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;mm as well as 20&amp;nbsp;mm and above.

==Advantages==
There are certain advantages of using sinters as opposed to using other materials which include recycling the fines and other waste products, to include flue dust, mill scale, lime dust and sludge. Processing sinter helps eliminate raw flux, which is a binding material used to agglomerate materials, which saves the heating material, coke, and improves furnace productivity. 

Improvements and efficiency can be gained from higher softening temperature and narrower softening in the melting zone, which increases the volume of the granular zone and shrinks the width of the cohesive zone. A lower silica content and higher hot metal temperature contributes to more sulphur removal.

==Criticism==

[[File:TerraCycle product.jpg|thumb|left|A TerraCycle music player with clearly visible branding]]

TerraCycle has also been accused of "[[greenwashing]]" (marketing with a false promise of eco-friendliness). One perceived problem is the missing incentive for companies to stop using non-recyclable packaging, since TerraCycle takes on the waste for free, whereas the companies would have had to pay for dumping it. This also discourages approaches of making companies fiscally responsible for their waste, similar to European [[extended producer responsibility]] (EPR) laws. TerraCycle spokesman, Albe Zakes, has said that the company thinks of itself as "a privatized version of EPR laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = The Guardian | title = Five sustainable boondoggles: greenwashing all the way to the bank | medium = Online article | date = 25 August 2014| url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/25/5-sustainability-greenwash-products-ecofriendly-boondoggles-design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TerraCycle also keeps the branding prominent on their recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website = minimizingentropy.com | title = My issues with TerraCycle | medium = Blog | date = 22 July 2010 | url = http://minimizingentropy.blogspot.de/2010/07/my-issues-with-terracycle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised concern that consumers could think of the brands themselves as "green" or "eco-friendly" while the product is probably only "upcyclable", not fully recyclable. TerraCycle products are not recyclable any further.

TerraCycle has been criticized by some people for the relatively small volume of material it collects for recycling in comparison to the total amount of such packaging that is produced by manufacturers each year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yoyo, Reco, TerraCycle… Complimentary or competitors? |url=https://dechets-infos.com/?s=TerraCycle |website=Dechets info |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while noting that in the US, after over 40 years of regulations requiring recycling of materials (glass, paper, rigid plastic and certain metals), recycling rates are under 35% where recycling is economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures |url=https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/advancing-sustainable-materials-management-0 |website=www.epa.gov |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate identity==

===Logo===
According to Tom Szaky, the name TerraCycle "came up at the beginning [as] the idea of 'earth' and 'cycle'."&lt;ref name=dukegarbagevideo&gt;{{cite AV media  | people = CEO Tom Szaky (Interviewee) | title =  The duke of rubbish | medium = News clip | publisher = Fortune Small Business| location =  | date =  22 December 2009| url = http://money.cnn.com/video/smallbusiness/2009/03/25/fsb.terracycle.trash.smb/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Szaky thought up the name with another [[Princeton University]] student during a road trip from [[New Jersey (state)|New Jersey]] to [[Florida (state)|Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXlkYGRQY7EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=revolution+in+a+bottle#v=onepage&amp;q=revolution%20in%20a%20bottle&amp;f=false | title=Revolution in a Bottle: How TerraCycle is Eliminating the Idea of Waste | publisher=Penguin Group | author=Szaky, Tom | year=2013 | location=New York, New York, USA | isbn=978-1-59184-595-9|page=28|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TerraCycle company [[logo]] is a green [[infinity]] symbol with two arrows pointed toward one another. Szaky designed the logo during a lecture at Princeton.&lt;ref name="financialtimesalchemy"/&gt;

===Television show===
TerraCycle was the subject of a [[National Geographic]] [[reality television]] series named ''Garbage Moguls''.&lt;ref name="businessinsiderphotoskim"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/terracycle-office-tour-2011-8?op=1 | title=PHOTOS: Inside TerraCycle's Incredible 99% Recycled Office | publisher=Business Insider.com | date= 25 August 2011| accessdate=6 April 2014 | author=Bhasin, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot premiered on [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2009.&lt;ref name="cnnmoneygarbagemogul2009"/&gt; The show featured the TerraCycle team searching for solutions to various waste streams.&lt;ref name="cnnmoneygarbagemogul2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewismogulmillions"/&gt;

In 2014,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3833240/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt&lt;/ref&gt; now defunct [[Pivot (TV network)|Pivot]] launched ''Human Resources'', a reality TV series providing a behind-the-scenes look at day-to-day operations at TerraCycle's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.takepart.com/pivot/human-resources&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web game===
{{see also|Trash Tycoon}}
TerraCycle partnered with game developer Guerillapps to make a [[Facebook]]-based [[Flash-game|flash game]] known as ''Trash Tycoon''.&lt;ref name="cnetLombardi2011" /&gt; The game was launched in 2011,&lt;ref name="cnntrashcashoctober"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/10/world/americas/terracycle-recycling-waste-szaky/ | title=Recycling the world's trash into cash | publisher=CNN | accessdate=10 April 2014|author=Allen, Natalie|author2=Knight, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it mimics TerraCycle's actual business model.&lt;ref name="cnetLombardi2011" /&gt; Major sponsors for the game include [[Carbonfund.org]] and [[Treehugger.com]].&lt;ref name="cnetLombardi2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/terracycle-launches-waste-to-profit-facebook-game/ | title=TerraCycle launches waste-to-profit Facebook game | publisher=CNET | date=7 September 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Lombardi, Candace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue is generated through the inclusion of brand logos within the game and the use of [[virtual currency]].&lt;ref name="Empson2011Crunchy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/multiplayer-facebook-game-trash-tycoon-trains-you-to-be-green-but-in-a-fun-way/ | title=Multiplayer Facebook Game Trash Tycoon Trains You To Be Green (But In A Fun Way) | publisher=Tech Crunch | date=8 June 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Empson, Rip}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraCycle receives 25% of the advertising revenue but none of the virtual currency revenue.&lt;ref name="njbiztrashtycoongame"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.njbiz.com/article/20110713/NJBIZ01/110719961/Terracycle-taps-Facebook-game-to-encourage-connection-with-consumers | title=Terracycle taps Facebook game to encourage connection with consumers | publisher=NJ Biz (Journal Multimedia) | date=13 July 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game donates 10% of its revenues to Carbonfund.org.&lt;ref name="cnetLombardi2011" /&gt;

===Finances===
As of 2013, TerraCycle maintains a one percent [[profit margin]].&lt;ref name="huffpostrecycleprofits"/&gt; Tom Szaky reported TerraCycle sales in 2004 as $77,000; 2005 as $500,000; 2006 as $1.6 million; 2007 as $3.3 million; 2008 as $6.6 million; 2009 as $7.3 million; and 2010 as $13.5 million. The company hit $19.3 million in 2016 and expects to surpass $20 million in 2017. In fall 2017, TerraCycle US Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of TerraCycle, Inc., announced it has filed for a [[Regulation A]] offering with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) that allows anyone the opportunity to invest in the recycling company’s U.S. subsidiary.&lt;ref name="blognytimeszakyoverproject"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/why-i-tend-to-project-a-little-high/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0 | title=Why I Tend to Project a Little High | quote=Our sales have grown from $77,000 in 2004 to $500,000 in 2005 to $1.6 million in 2006 to $3.3 million in 2007 to $6.6 million in 2008 to $7.3 million in 2009 and to $13.5 million in 2010. | publisher=The New York Times Company | website=You're the Boss Small Business Blogs | date=27 June 2011 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Szaky, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tor Ragnar Nessling''' [[diplomi-insinööri|MSc ''(diplomi-insinööri)'']] (6 September 1901 – 23 November 1971) was a leading Finnish industrialist, entrepreneur and engineer. For nearly four decades he was the general manager of the Finnish heavy vehicle producer [[Sisu Auto|Suomen Autoteollisuus]] (SAT). His contribution to national development was officially recognized by the Finnish President who appointed Nessling as a "[[Vuorineuvos]]".&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

Nessling became head of SAT in 1932, soon after the company's foundation. He developed the business in an era when only few believed in the possibility of a Finnish automotive industry, and a decade later had become the company's majority shareholder. Nessling took a patriarchal approach to his leadership of the company, which he built into a producer of trucks, bus chassis, rail vehicles and specialist [[Shunt truck|terminal tractors]]. Nessling lost his controlling shareholding following a merger in 1968, resigned in 1970 and died the following year.&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt;

== Studies and early career ==
Nessling's parents were engineer John Nessling and Greta née Grönholm. Nessling did his [[abitur]] at the Helsinki coeducational ([[Finland Swedish|Swedish language]]) [[:fi:Läroverket för gossar och flickor|grammar school]] in 1920. He continued his studies at the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]:  simultaneously he studied Geology at the [[University of Helsinki]] between  1922 and 1924. Nessling graduated as a diplomi-insinööri&lt;ref&gt;the Finnish equivalent of an MSc in Mechanical Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; in 1924. He traveled in Sweden, the UK, Germany and the USA, and between 1926 and 1928 Nessling worked successively for three Finnish automobile import companies Korpivaara &amp; Halla, Henry-Auto and Auto-Bil. He worked as manager in the auto-business with Munkkisaaren Autotalli ja Konepaja from 1928 to 1929 and then with Autovarikko between 1929 and 1930.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

== Formation of Suomen Autoteollisuus ==
In 1929 Nessling was appointed Technical Manager of the bus and coach builder [[Autoteollisuus-Bilindustri]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; Nessling wanted to develop a new branch of industry for his country and in the same year he became interested in starting a lorry and bus industry in Finland. Autoteollisuus–Bilindustri put together its activities with another coachbuilder [[Autokoritehdas|Osakeyhtiö Autokoritehdas]] in 1931. The name of the new company was Suomen Autoteollisuus (''Finnish Auto-industry'') and its first General Manager was John Hellsten.&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt; It is often claimed that Nessling was a founder of SAT: he was not. The operation was organised by Karl Arthur Nordgrén, Emil Anton Winckelmann and [[Lars Wilhelm Åberg]].&lt;ref name="Höyryvaunusta 10pyörään: Suuret suomalaiset"&gt;{{cite book |title= Höyryvaunusta kymppipyörään |last= Blomberg |first= Olli |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1991 |publisher= Tekninen Kustannusliike Oy |location= |language= Finnish |isbn= 951-9364-35-8 |page= 72 |pages= |chapter= Ne "suuret" suomalaiset |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the year after the company's creation Nessling was appointed General Manager of the SAT.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

Starting a vehicle construction business virtually from scratch in the middle of a recession seemed impossible, but under Nessling's determined leadership that is what was achieved. The vehicle brand selected was ''Sisu'', and the first 12 Sisu vehicles rolled out from the factory in 1932.&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt; Although the level of domestic content was just 20% at the beginning&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; Nessling was determined to increase this substantially. Famously, he liked to say : "A Finn is capable of making anything which a foreigner can make."&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt; By the end of the 1930s Sisu vehicles contained 40% local content. Nessling strongly lobbied the Finnish government about the growth potential of automotive industry, stressing the employment potential and also the strategic significance of Finnish controlled vehicle production for national defence. However, the government ignored his arguments and progressively cut the import tariffs on heavy vehicles during the 1930s, making competition for the domestic industry more intense. In addition, some of the owners of SAT began to doubt the prospects for domestic heavy vehicle production. Nessling offered to buy from Helsingin Osakepankki its shares in SAT in 1938. He obtained the shares cheaply, but to finance the bargain he nevertheless had to pledge his wife's entire property. Eventually, Nessling ended up owning 80% of SAT.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

== Second World War and Yhteissisu ==
[[File:Sisu S-22.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Sisu S-21|Sisu S-22]] made by [[Vanajan Autotehdas|Yhteissisu]] (ca 1947)]]
The [[Second World War]] brought new challenges to SAT because many foreign components became unobtainable. The degree of domestic content could be increased to 90%, though only with much effort. A big step forward came with the start of American [[Hercules Engine Company|Hercules]] engine production under licence.   Principle customers for SAT during the war were the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] and other government institutions.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; SAT started building a new factory in [[Karis]], where it would be less vulnerable to Soviet air raids than Helsinki. The production capacity was not adequate to meet the demand; in 1942 the Defence Forces estimated that they would need 7,000 lorries and buses in the next few years. Nessling suggested building the Karis factory larger than had originally been planned. However, SAT's economic and technical resources were limited, and influential heavy vehicle importers, supported by some political factions, suspected that SAT was exploiting the war to benefit unfairly and gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.&lt;ref name="YVSP: Yhteissisu"&gt;{{cite book |title= Yhteissisusta Vanajan ja Sisun kautta Patriaan |last= Blomberg |first= Olli |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= Patria Vehicles Oy |location= Hämeenlinna |language= Finnish |isbn= 952-91-5613-8 |pages= 12–41|chapter= 1943–1948 Oy Yhteissisu Ab |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government suggested an arrangement in which SAT would have become partly state owned.  Nessling ruled this option out, however: he did not want the state to be involved in SAT.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; The fall-back option was creation of another company with support of the state and some significant Finnish companies. Such a company, [[Vanajan Autotehdas|Yhteissisu]], was formed in 1943 and Tor Nessling, most reluctantly, found himself installed its General Manager. Yhteissisu started building Sisu lorries in [[Vanaja (Finland)|Vanaja]], some 100&amp;nbsp;km (63 miles) to the north of Helsinki.&lt;ref name="YVSP: Yhteissisu"/&gt; But war gave way to peace before Yhteissisu's capability to build military trucks had come fully on stream.  Nessling left his post with Yhteissisu in 1946, complaining of lack of support from the company owners. Yhteissisu lorry production was redirected to the civilian market, and in 1948 the company was renamed "[[Vanajan Autotehdas]]" (VAT).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

By now Nessling was becoming increasingly embittered with the Finnish government. First his ideas about domestic heavy vehicle production were ignored in the 1930s, and then the government had forced through the creation of a powerful competitor which had established itself by using technology developed by Nessling's company.  Disenchantment with the politicians was in evidence when the government offered Nessling beneficial funding opportunities in the 1960s: he replied that he had never requested, and would never ask for anything from the government.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

== Post-war growth of SAT ==
Production of SAT grew strongly in the 1950s and 1960s; the volumes quadrupled to 800 vehicles per year during the 1950s. In addition to producing lorries and bus chassis, the company provided trams and rail vehicles to the Finnish State Railways. SAT products were exported to four continents. The growing volumes both required and benefited from  investment in production facilities and sales and marketing campaigns. Unlike many contemporary industrialists, Nessling valued marketing, and he focused closely on identifying, understanding and satisfying customer needs.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

== Merger with VAT and resignation ==
SAT's leading domestic competitor, Vanajan Autotehdas, was in financial trouble by end of the 1960s. Nessling proposed a merger between Vanajan Autotehdas and SAT because he was afraid that a foreign competitor, such as [[Volvo]] or [[Scania AB|Scania]], would otherwise take over Vanajan Autotehdas. The companies came together in 1968. In the end, the merger led to a situation that Nessling had wanted to avoid: the state became a part-owner of the new SAT with a 17% shareholding and Nessling lost his controlling majority as his own holding fell to below 50%. SAT acquired an executive board of directors and a supervisory board. Although Nessling was still the company's principal shareholder, his influence was diminished:  he had very little recent experience of receiving orders or of operating with a board of directors, and he found adapting to the new situation difficult.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;

Relations between Nessling and the board got worse when Nessling fell ill: he recovered, but not sufficiently to be able to work as before, although he was keen to continue with his role in the company management. The board was not convinced and reorganised the company structure. Nessling resisted the transfer of marketing responsibilities to other hands but could not prevent it. Nessling's old business partner and friend, then head of [[British Leyland|British Leyland Motor Corporation]], [[Donald Stokes, Baron Stokes|Lord Stokes]], whom Nessling greatly respected, eventually persuaded him to step aside. Tor Nessling announced his resignation as General Manager of Suomen Autoteollisuus in June 1970, after leading the company for nearly four decades.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; [[Erik Gillberg]] was appointed the new General Manager in February 1971.&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt;

== Personal life and death ==
Nessling worked hard and shunned the limelight. He worked closely with a small number of trusted colleagues,&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt; but many colleagues and underlings remembered his leadership style as patriarchal and distant. He resisted delegating decisions. He is described as a brilliant businessman who had the ability to spot business opportunities, but he was also a quick tempered, and was found by some to be excessively risk-averse. The tough industrialist also had his softer side: he liked nature and animals, and he kept many pets at his home.&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt;

Nessling had married in 1926 Greta Maria "Maj" (née Kock) who stayed home as a housewife while supporting her husband in his career. The marriage was childless, and when Nessling died in 1971 his widow sold the family share in SAT. In 1972 she bequeathed their property to establish the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation. The foundation is a significant funder of environmental research in Finland.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Tor Nessling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sisuviesti: Näin syntyi Sisu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">A '''yūgen gaisha''' or  '''yūgen kaisha''' ({{nihongo|有限会社|"limited company," abbreviated in English as '''Y.K.''' or '''Co., Ltd.'''}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yahoo! JAPAN |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=co.&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=200075300000 |title=Yahoo! JAPAN dictionary entry for "Co., Ltd." |publisher=Dic.yahoo.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of business organization in [[Japan]].

Yūgen gaisha are based on the [[Germany|German]] [[GmbH]] and were implemented in Japan in the Limited Company Act (有限会社法) of 1940. The [[Law of Japan|Companies Act of Japan]], implemented on May 1, 2006, replaced the yūgen gaisha with a new form of company called [[gōdō gaisha]], based upon the American [[limited liability company]]. Following the implementation, no new YKs were allowed in Japan, but pre-existing YKs were allowed to continue their operations as [[kabushiki gaisha]] under special rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflr.com/Article/1978086/SPCs-under-company-law.html Japan: SPCs under company law] - Abolishment of YK Law&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the term is pronounced as  ''yūgen gaisha'' or ''yūgen kaisha'' is up to the local dialect or the company's preference when it is part of the company's name. While it is pronounced ''yūgen gaisha'' in standard Japanese, the alphabetic abbreviation is always Y.K. by standard.

==Structure==

As of 2005, a Y.K. can have up to 50 investors, called {{nihongo|members|社員|shain}}. The members were required to provide at least ¥3 million in capital contributions, with each {{nihongo|investment unit|持分|mochibun}} valued at no less than ¥50,000. The minimum capital amount was much more permissive than the ¥10 million minimum for a kabushiki gaisha. A Y.K. was also not required to issue certificates for investment units, whereas stock certificates were required for a K.K.

Unlike a K.K., a Y.K. does not need to have a board of directors or statutory auditors: the minimum requirement is one {{nihongo|director|取締役|torishimariyaku}}.

Because of its simplified structure and relatively lax incorporation requirements, the Y.K. form is associated with small businesses. However, some larger companies have used the form: [[ExxonMobil]]'s principal Japanese subsidiary, for instance, is a Y.K. with paid-in capital of ¥50 billion (US$420 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Legal-Office/20061018/1161193754 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330132959/http://d.hatena.ne.jp/Legal-Office/20061018/1161193754 |date=March 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to simplified [[corporate governance]], a Y.K. receives some tax benefits under foreign laws such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Code]].
