The '''Agape Lodge''' was a California-based chapter of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] founded in 1935 by [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]]. Following World War II, it was the sole surviving O.T.O. organization.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis ''Witchcraft Today'', p. 217, ABC-CLIO, 1999 {{ISBN|978-1-57607-134-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, jet fuel engineer [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]] was appointed head of the lodge, and the organization was headquartered out of Parson's mansion in Pasadena.   In 1946, Parsons lost a great deal of money in a business venture with [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sarah Northrup]], resulting in him selling the mansion.  In 1949, the Agape Lodge ceased to hold regular meetings. 

==Background==


The original O.T.O. was founded by the wealthy German industrialist [[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Carl Kellner]]. After Kellner's death in 1905, [[Theodor Reuss]] became Outer Head of the Order. After Reuss's death in 1923,  [[Aleister Crowley]] was elected Head of the Order in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczynski, Richard. (2002). "Perdurabo, The Life of Aleister Crowley," p. 332. New Falcon Publications {{ISBN|1-56184-170-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the lesser-known Agapé Lodge No. 1 of Vancouver, B.C. had been established.&lt;ref name="oto-usa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oto-usa.org/oto/history/|title=History – US Grand Lodge|author=|date=|website=oto-usa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hollywood: 1935&amp;ndash;1936==
In 1935, Wilfred Talbot Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 2, based at his Hollywood home, and brought in seven initiates to the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|Minerval level]] in September 1935.&lt;ref name="oto-usa.org"/&gt;{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=227}} Smith advertised the foundation of his group through an advert in ''American Astrology'' magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=227}} The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, as well as social events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=237}} 

In February 1936, the lodge held a Mass in honour of [[New Thought]] leader Wayne Walker who ran a group called "The Voice of Healing";  The Agape Lodge members hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=235&amp;ndash;236}}  Later in 1936, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=239&amp;ndash;241}} As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=246}}

==Hollywood: 1939- March 1940==
[[File:JackParsons3.jpg|right|thumb|Jack Parsons in 1938]]
In 1939, the group initiated  [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], a jet fuel engineer, and his wife Helen Parsons, who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass. {{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=252&amp;ndash;258}}  Smith wrote to Crowley that Parsons was "a really excellent man&amp;nbsp;... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself&amp;nbsp;... JP is going to be very valuable".{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=172}} The Parsons would help bring new members into the group; [[Grady McMurtry]] and his fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister [[Sara Northrup]].{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=266|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=169&amp;ndash;172}} 

[[File:Grady Louis McMurtry 1941.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Grady McMurtry was an early Lodge member. He later became head of the O.T.O..]]

; February 1939 
In February 1939 a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered; although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=258&amp;ndash;262}}

Crowley appointed [[Karl Germer]], a German Thelemite recently arrived in the US, to be his representative on the continent, and instructed Germer to oversee the payment of dues to himself. He also specified that it would now be Germer, and not Smith, who was his chosen successor.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=263&amp;ndash;264}} 

Kahl, who worked as a drama teacher, brought three of her interested students into the group, among them [[Phyllis Seckler]], and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. 

The Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=246&amp;ndash;252}} 

===Sarah Northrup joins, 1941===
[[File:Sara Northrup.jpg|thumb|right|Sarah Northrup, younger sister of Helen Parsons]]

Sarah Northrup joined the O.T.O. in 1941, at Parsons' urging, and was given the title of Soror [Sister] Cassap.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=254}}  She soon rose to the rank of a [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|second degree]] member, or "Magician", of the O.T.O.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Starr|Starr]], p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1941, at the age of seventeen, Northrup began a passionate affair with Parsons while her sister Helen was away on vacation. She made a striking impression on the other lodgers; &lt;ref name="Pendle203" /&gt; 

When Helen returned, she found Northrup wearing Helen's own clothes and calling herself Parsons' "new wife."  {{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 274|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 93–94|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 203–205|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 537}}  Such conduct was expressly permitted by the O.T.O., which followed Crowley's disdain of marriage as a "detestable institution" and accepted as commonplace the swapping of wives and partners between O.T.O. members.&lt;ref name="Pendle203"&gt;[[#Pendle|Pendle]], p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both were committed O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to conflict between the two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: "This is a fact that I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – we get on well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well."&lt;ref name="Pendle-204"/&gt; Some years later, addressing himself as "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]]: "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of [[Thelema]]."&lt;ref name="Pendle-204"&gt;[[#Pendle|Pendle]], p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1p = 274|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 203–205}} 

Northrup's hostility towards other members of the O.T.O. caused further tensions in the house, which Aleister Crowley heard about from communications from her housemates. He dubbed her "the alley-cat" after an unnamed mutual acquaintance told him that Parsons's attraction to her was like "a yellow pup bumming around with his snout glued to the rump of an alley-cat."&lt;ref name="Starr302-3" /&gt; Concluding that she was a vampire, which he defined as "an elemental or demon in the form of a woman" who sought to "lure the Candidate to his destruction," he warned that Northrup was a grave danger to Parsons and to the "Great Work" which the O.T.O. was carrying out in California.&lt;ref name="Starr302-3"&gt;[[#Starr|Starr]], pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concerns were expressed by other O.T.O. members. The O.T.O.'s US head, [[Karl Germer]], labeled her "an ordeal sent by the gods". Her disruptive behavior appalled Fred Gwynn, a new O.T.O. member living in the commune at 1003 South Orange Avenue: "Betty went to almost fantastical lengths to disrupt the meetings [of the O.T.O.] that Jack did get together. If she could not break it up by making social engagements with key personnel she, and her gang, would go out to a bar and keep calling in asking for certain people to come to the telephone."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pendle|Pendle]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation to Pasadena in June 1942 == 
In June 1942, a number of other Thelemites moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an [[American Craftsman|American Craftsman-style]] mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 271–273, 276|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 83–84|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 207–210|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 521}} Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the [[Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu|Stele of Revealing]], a statue of [[Pan (god)|Pan]], and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 84|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 209–210|3a1 = Miller|3y = 2014|3p = 117}}

Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article for an occultist [[fanzine]]: "In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 86}}

Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons' influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal ''Oriflamme'', in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressed{{mdash}}particularly due to Parsons' descriptions of drug use{{mdash}}and the project was soon shelved.{{sfn|Parsons|2008|pp = 217–219}} 

Although there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema. He gave almost all of his salary to the O.T.O. while actively seeking out new members{{mdash}}including Forman{{mdash}}and financially supported Crowley in London through Germer.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 212–213}} {{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=271&amp;ndash;273, 276|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=207&amp;ndash;210}} Parsons had begun a relationship with Sara Northrup, while Smith consoled Helen, who would become his partner for the rest of his life; nevertheless the four remained friends.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=274|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=93&amp;ndash;94|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=203&amp;ndash;205|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=537}} Although they had ceased to publicly perform the Gnostic Mass, membership of the lodge continued to grow.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=276&amp;ndash;277}}

A number of prominent members however left, among them Regina Kahl and Phyllis Seckler.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=279}}

===Law enforcement concerns===
Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the [[Pasadena Police Department (California)|Pasadena Police Department]] and the FBI.  Both had received allegations of a "[[black magic]] cult" involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire.  Karl Germer, now leader of the North American O.T.O., was German.  Neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security.{{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 283–285|2a1 = Carter|2y = 2004|2pp = 87–88|3a1 = Pendle|3y = 2005|3pp = 214–215|4a1 = Kaczynski|4y = 2010|4p = 525}}{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=283&amp;ndash;285|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=214&amp;ndash;215}}

===Parsons becomes head of the lodge ===

Crowley however had remained highly critical of Smith's leadership of the lodge, and ordered Wolfe to send him on a personal magical retreat; she felt conflicted, but eventually conceded to Crowley's demands.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=278, 280&amp;ndash;282}} Both Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith ousted permanently, believing that he had become a bad influence on the other lodge members; many of the members, including Jack and Helen Parsons, wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed head of the lodge.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=278, 280&amp;ndash;282|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=216&amp;ndash;217, 220}} {{sfnm|1a1 = Starr|1y = 2003|1pp = 278, 280–282|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 216–217, 220|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 524–525}} 

In New York Jack Parsons met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 198, 203}}

In December 1941, Smith announced a policy that all Lodge members now had to contribute 5% of their earnings as an "Emergency Fee" that went to Crowley.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=267}} 

In when,  Smith suffered a mild heart attack.  Smith retired at the age of 56 before undergoing an operation in February 1942.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=268&amp;ndash;270}}

Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used [[cocaine]], [[amphetamines]], [[peyote]], [[mescaline]], and [[opiate]]s as well.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 216}}&lt;ref name="Rasmussen"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=Life as Satanist Propelled Rocketeer|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/19/local/me-10501|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=March 19, 2000|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parson continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry's fiancee Claire. When Parsons paid for her to have an [[abortion]], McMurtry was angered and their friendship broke down.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p = 215}}

Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons &amp;ndash; who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict &amp;ndash; ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked "Would to God you knew your people better."{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=299&amp;ndash;300|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=222&amp;ndash;223}} 

Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=301&amp;ndash;302}}

===Parson family===
In April,  Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was named Kwan Lanval Parsons.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=88|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3p=221}} In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in [[Rainbow, California|Rainbow Valley]] with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=290&amp;ndash;291|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=92&amp;ndash;93|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221&amp;ndash;222}} Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained sceptical.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=294&amp;ndash;298|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=90&amp;ndash;91|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221&amp;ndash;222}} 

Helen was far less sanguine, writing in her diary of "the sore spot I carried where my heart should be",&lt;ref name="Pendle-204" /&gt; and had furious – sometimes violent – rows with both Parsons and Northrup. She began an affair with Wilfred Smith, Parsons' mentor in the O.T.O.&lt;ref name="Pendle-204" /&gt; and had a son in 1943 who bore Parsons' surname but who was almost certainly fathered by Smith.&lt;ref name="Pendle-204" /&gt; Northrup also became pregnant but had an abortion on April 1, 1943, arranged by Parsons and carried out by Dr. Zachary Taylor Malaby, a prominent Pasadena doctor and Democratic politician.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Starr|Starr]], p. 288 fn. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 248–249}}

==Arrival of L. Ron Hubbard in August 1945==
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|right|thumb|L. Ron Hubbard in 1950]]

Around August 1945, L. Ron Hubbard visited 1003 South Orange Avenue at the behest of Lou Goldstone, a well-known science fiction illustrator who resided there.&lt;ref name="Miller-116"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons took an immediate liking to Hubbard and invited him to stay in the house.&lt;ref name="Miller-116"/&gt; Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had "no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his [[Guardian Angel]].&amp;nbsp;... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles."{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 101–102|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 252–255}}

Hubbard became Parsons' "magical partner" for a [[sex magic]] ritual involving that was intended to summon an incarnation of a goddess.&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt;[[#Urban|Urban]], p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard soon began "affairs with one girl after another in the house."&lt;ref name="Wright43"&gt;[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, Nortrup became enamored with Hubbard.  Hubbard and Northrup made no secret of their relationship; another lodger at Parsons' house described how he saw Hubbard "living off Parsons' largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when the two of them were sitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible."&lt;ref name="Wright43" /&gt; 
Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 102|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2p = 256|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 537–538}}  Parsons was deeply dismayed but tried to put a brave face on the situation, informing Aleister Crowley:

{{quote|About three months ago I met Captain L. Ron Hubbard, a writer and explorer of whom I had known for some time … He is a gentleman; he has red hair, green eyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about two months ago, and although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her sexual affection to Ron.}}

{{quote|I think I have made a great gain and as Betty and I are the best of friends, there is little loss. I cared for her rather deeply but I have no desire to control her emotions, and I can, I hope, control my own. I need a magical partner. I have many experiments in mind.&lt;ref name="Miller-118"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Inspired by Crowley's novel ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a  "magical child" through [[immaculate conception]], which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working's completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 130–132|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 263–264|3a1 = Kansa|3y = 2011|3pp = 29, 35–37}}{{sfn|Urban|2006|p = 136–137}} To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was "a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time" facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's [[Aeon (Thelema)|Æon of Horus]].{{sfn|Metzger|2008|pp = 196–200}}  Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being "fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!"

Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that "our own Jack is enamored with [[Witchcraft]], the [[Hounfour|houmfort]], voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 257–262}} One ritual allegedly brought screaming [[banshee]]s to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 303}}  Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including [[poltergeist]] activity, sightings of [[Orb (optics)#Paranormal interpretation|orbs]] and ghostly apparitions, [[Alchemy|alchemical]] ([[sylph]]ic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. One modern scholar speculates that the voices were a prank by Hubbard and Sara.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|pp = 257–262}} 

In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on [[Enochian magic]] during which he [[masturbation|masturbated]] onto magical tablets, accompanied by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Prokofiev)|Second Violin Concerto]]. Describing this magical operation as the [[Babalon Working]], he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess [[Babalon]] onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 107–108, 116–117, 119–128|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 259–260}} As described by [[Richard Metzger]], "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" while Hubbard "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions."{{sfn|Metzger|2008|pp = 196–200}}
===Hubbard–Northrup–Parsons business venture of 1946===
Hubbard, Northrup and Parsons agreed at the start of 1946 that they would go into business together, buying yachts on the East Coast and sailing them to California to sell at a profit. They set up a business partnership on January 15, 1946 under the name of "Allied Enterprises", with Parsons putting up $20,000 of capital, Hubbard adding $1,200 and Northrup contributing nothing.&lt;ref name="Miller-120"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marjorie Cameron.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marjorie Cameron]] in the 1940s]]

When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a [[preternatural]] entity [[Automatic writing|psychographically]] provided him with ''Liber 49'', which represented a fourth part of Crowley's ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the ''Book of Babalon''.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 132–148, 150|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 264–265|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3p = 538|4a1 = Miller|4y = 2014|4pp = 121–125}} 

Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named [[Marjorie Cameron]]—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy [[WAVES|WAVE]]—had come to visit. Believing her to be the "[[elemental]]" woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing [[sex magic]] rituals with Cameron, who acted as his "[[Babalon#Office of the Scarlet Woman|Scarlet Woman]]", while Hubbard continued to participate as the [[amanuensis]]. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on."&lt;ref name="Hobbs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbs|first=Scott|title=Rocket Man|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-hobbs/rocket-man_2_b_1597713.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=March 30, 2014|date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p = 135}} 

[[File:L Ron and Sara Hubbard June 1946.jpg|right|thumb|Hubbard and Northrup aboard the schooner ''Blue Water II'' in Miami, Florida, June 1946. ]]

In April 1946, Hubbard and Northrup left for [[Florida]], taking with him $10,000 drawn from the Allied Enterprises account to fund the purchase of the partnership's first yacht. Weeks passed without word from Hubbard. Louis Culling, another O.T.O. member, wrote to Karl Germer to explain the situation:

{{quote|As you may know by this time, Brother John signed a partnership agreement with this Ron and Betty whereby all money earned by the three for life is equally divided between the three. As far as I can ascertain, Brother John has put in all of his money ... Meanwhile, Ron and Betty have bought a boat for themselves in Miami for about $10,000 and are living the life of Riley, while Brother John is living at Rock Bottom, and I mean ''Rock Bottom''. It appears that originally they never secretly intended to bring this boat around to the California coast to sell at a profit, as they told Jack, but rather to have a good time on it on the east coast.&lt;ref name="Miller-126"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crowley wrote to opine: "It seems to me on the information of our brethren in California that Parsons has got an illumination in which he has lost all his personal independence. From our brother's account he has given away both his girl and his money. Apparently it is the ordinary confidence trick." &lt;ref name="Miller-126" /&gt;

Left "flat broke" by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a "weak fool" and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in [[MacArthur Causeway|County Causeway]], Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a [[lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram]] containing an astrological, [[Geomantic figures|geomantic]] invocation of [[Geomantic figures#The geomantic figures|Bartzabel]]{{mdash}}a vengeful spirit of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Parsons initially attempted to obtain redress through magical means, carrying out a "Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram" to curse Hubbard and Northrup. He credited it with causing the couple to abort an attempt to evade him:

{{quote|Hubbard attempted to escape me by sailing at 5 P.M., and I performed a full evocation to Bartzabel [the spirit of Mars or War] within the circle at 8 P.M. At the same time, so far as I can check, his ship was struck by a sudden squall off the coast, which ripped off his sails and forced him back to port, where I took the boat in custody... Here I am in Miami pursuing the children of my folly; they cannot move without going to jail. However I am afraid that most of the money has already been dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Corydon|Corydon]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parsons subsequently resorted to more conventional means of obtaining redress and sued the couple on July 1 in the Circuit Court for [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]. His lawsuit accused Hubbard and Northrup of breaking the terms of their partnership, dissipating the assets and attempting to abscond. The case was settled out of court eleven days later, with Hubbard and Northrup agreeing to refund some of Parsons' money while keeping a yacht, the ''Harpoon'', for themselves.&lt;ref name="Miller-127"&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Northrup was able to dissuade Parsons from pressing his case by threatening to expose their past relationship, which had begun when she was under the legal age of consent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pendle|Pendle]], p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's relationship with Northrup, while legal, had already caused alarm among those who knew him; Virginia Heinlein, the wife of the science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]], regarded Hubbard as "a very sad case of post-war breakdown" and Northrup as his "latest Man-Eating Tigress".&lt;ref name="Wright48"&gt;[[#Wright|Wright]], p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to [[Margaret Grubb]], [[Bigamy|bigamously]] married Sara and went on to found [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]].{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1pp = 155–157|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 267–269, 272–273|3a1 = Kaczynski|3y = 2010|3pp = 538–539|4a1 = Miller|4y = 2014|4pp = 127–130}}

==End of the Agape lodge==
Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house. Parsons appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.{{sfnm|1a1 = Carter|1y = 2004|1p = 150|2a1 = Pendle|2y = 2005|2pp = 266–267}}   Agapé Lodge continued in Southern California until 1949, after which the Lodge ceased to hold regular meetings. &lt;ref name="oto-usa.org"/&gt;

[[File:Sikh wedding.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Laavan|A Sikh couple taking ''[[Laavaan]]'' during the ceremony]]

'''Anand Karaj''' ({{lang-pa|anand kāraj}}) is the [[Sikh]] [[wedding ceremony|marriage ceremony]], meaning "Blissful Union" or "Joyful Union", that was introduced by [[Guru Amar Das]]. The four ''[[laavaan]]'' (hymns which take place during the ceremony) were composed by his successor, [[Guru Ram Das]]. It was originally legalised in India through the passage of the Anand Marriage Act of 1909, but is now governed by the [[Sikh Reht Maryada]] (Sikh code of conduct and conventions) that was issued by the [[Shiromani Gurudwara  Prabandhak Committee]] (SGPC). 

In a recent verdict of the Sri [[Akal Takht]] Sahib, i.e. a, Anand Karaj can only take place in a [[Gurudwara]] (temple). Any [[Khalsa#Modern_status|Amritdhari]] (baptized) Sikh may perform the marriage ceremony.

In 2012, India passed The Anand Marriage (Amendment) Bill, after which Sikhs are able to register their marriages under the Anand Marriage Act instead of the [[Hindu Marriage Act]], with President Pratibha Patil giving her assent to a bill passed by Parliament on 7 June 2012 in the budget session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Punjab/Chandigarh/Bill-to-amend-Anand-Marriage-Act-introduced/SP-Article1-852440.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031022207/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Punjab/Chandigarh/Bill-to-amend-Anand-Marriage-Act-introduced/SP-Article1-852440.aspx |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan declared that it would pass the Sikh Anand Marriage Act in 2007 and a Draft was prepared, but this Draft Act was never passed. In 2018, Pakistani's Punjab Provincial Assembly passed the Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018&lt;ref&gt;Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Important features==
[[File:Onkarsingh.jpg|thumb|right|A Sikh Wedding]]
The following are other important points that must be adhered to by the [[Sikh]] couple and their families:

*Marriage is a partnership of equals.
*No consideration is to be given to caste, social status, race or lineage.
*No dowry is allowed.
*No day is considered holier above any other, hence no astrological considerations are to be made and no superstitions are to be observed in fixing the date of the wedding.
*The religious ceremony is to take place only in a gurdwara.
*The cost of the wedding is to be shared between the two sides as equally as possible.

The Anand Karaj ceremony is a joyous and festive event in which families and friends from both sides are heavily involved. Most Sikh weddings take place in the morning and are completed before noon. Following the ceremony is a langar or a formal lunch. The wedding event can last for the whole day and may spill into the next day. 

Most families combine the wedding ceremony with the engagement ceremony called the "kurmai", which is held just before the wedding vows or [[laavan]]. The engagement ceremony can also be held as a separate event on a different day. It is usually conducted in the [[gurdwara]] or at the home of the groom-to-be. It involves [[ardas]], [[kirtan]], sagun (exchange of gifts) and [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]]. In the "sagan" ceremony, the groom is presented with a karar, kirrpan, Indian sweets, fresh fruits, dried fruits and nuts. The bride-to-be's family in turn are presented with garments and sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indian-wedding.co.uk/?p=4 |title=Sikh Wedding or Anand Karaj |date= 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardsfusion.com/sikh-wedding-cards Punjabi/Sikh wedding invitations samples with its symbols ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed analysis==

"Anand Karaj", literally, "joyful ceremonial occasion or proceedings" is the name given to the Sikh marriage ceremony. For Sikhs, married status is the norm and the ideal; through it, according to their belief, come the best opportunities for serving God's purpose and the well being of humanity, and it affords the best means of fulfillment of individuality and attainment of bliss. Sikhism does not repudiate vows of celibacy, renunciation or the sannyasin state, but it does discourage it and advocates marital life as the best way of living.

Historically, most marriages among Sikhs, as also in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] as a whole, have been arranged. It is regarded as a duty for the parents to arrange for, and actively contribute towards, the marriage of their offspring. Prem Sumarag, an eighteenth-century work on the Sikh social code, lays down: When a girl attains maturity, it is incumbent upon her parents to look for a suitable match for her. It is neither desirable nor proper to marry a young girl. The daughter of a Sikh should be given in marriage to a Sikh. If a man is a believer in Sikhism, is humble by nature, and earns by honest means, with him matrimony may be contracted without a question and without consideration for wealth and riches.

Today, it is accepted that Sikhs marry someone they choose themselves. To show respect to their parents, seeking their approval is common. Traditionally, the parents of the man ask the parents of the woman for their daughter's hand in marriage.

==History of Anand Karaj==

The history of the Anand marriage ceremony is traced back to the time of Guru Amar Das (1479–1574), who composed the long 40-stanza hymn "Anand", in the Ramkali measure, suitable to be sung or recited on all occasions of religious importance. His successor, Guru Ram Das, composed a four-stanza hymn, "Lavan", which is recited and sung to solemnize nuptials. During the time of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his successors, however, this ceremony fell into partial disuse under the renewed Brahmanical influence at court as well as in society. 

The Namdhari reform movement of the mid-19th century made the practice of Anand ceremony a vital plank in its programme as did the later, more widely influential Singh Sabha. But there was opposition from the Arya Samajis and priestly classes; the former due to their position that Sikh faith was a sect within the larger umbrella of Hinduism and hence subject to [[Hindu Marriage Act]]. The Sikh form of wedding ceremonial eventually received legal sanction through the Anand Marriage Act which was adopted in 1909. 

The core of the Anand Karaj (the 'blissful ceremony') is the 'lavan', wherein shabads are sung with the bride and groom circumambulating the Guru Granth Sahib. The ceremony serves to provide  the foundational principles towards a successful marriage and also places the marriage within the context of unity with God. Guru Ram Das Ji composed the four stanzas of Lavan to be sung and recited as the core of the Anand Karaj.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.sikhnet.com/news/anand-karaj-and-lavan | author = SikhNet | title='Anand Karaj and the Lavan'| date=Aug 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1579, the fifth Guru, [[Guru Arjan Sahib]] Ji and Mata Ganga were the first couple to be married through the Anand Karaj ceremony.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The ceremony is now universally observed by the Sikhs.

==The Anand Marriage (Amendment) Act, 2012 (India)==
The Assent of the President of India was received to the Anand Marriage Amendment Act 2012 on 7th June 2012. The Act paved the way for the validation of Sikh traditional marriages, amending the Anand Marriage Act of 1909, thus providing for compulsory registration of "Anand Karaj" marriages.

Anand Karaj is not recognized in the UK, and a legal English marriage is mandatory.

==Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018 (Pakistan)==

In 2018, Pakistani's Punjab Provincial Assembly passed the Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018&lt;ref&gt;Punjab Sikh Anand Karaj Marriage Act 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Marriage of a Sikh and a non-Sikh==
In 2014 the Sikh Council in UK developed a consistent approach towards marriages in Gurdwaras where one partner is not of Sikh origin, following a two-year consultation with Gurdwara Sahib Committees, Sikh Organisations and individuals. The resulting guidelines were approved by the General Assembly of Sikh Council UK on 11 October 2014, and state that Gurdwaras are encouraged to ensure that both parties to an Anand Karaj wedding are Sikhs, but that where a couple chooses to undertake a civil marriage they should be offered the opportunity to hold an ''Ardas'', ''Sukhmani Sahib Path'', ''Akhand Path'', or other service to celebrate their marriage in the presence of family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sikh24.com/2014/10/25/sikh-council-uk-develops-guidelines-of-approach-to-inter-faith-marriages-in-gurdwaras/ |title=Sikh Council UK Develops Guidelines of Approach to Inter-Faith Marriages in Gurdwaras |website=Sikh24.com|date= 25 October 2014|author=Sikh Council UK|accessdate= 11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gurdwara Sahib Leamington and Warwick#Conflict|Some gurdwaras]] permit mixed marriages, which has led to controversy.

== Married life ==

Sikhs practise [[monogamy]] in marriage. Husband and wife are seen as being equal.  Any Sikh widow or widower is allowed to marry another person (this also includes divorcees).

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

'''Ancient Greek religion''' encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and [[Greek mythology|mythology]] originating in [[ancient Greece]] in the form of both popular public religion and [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practices]]. These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or "cults" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.

Most ancient Greeks recognized the  [[Twelve Olympians|twelve major Olympian gods and goddesses]]: ([[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Athena]], [[Ares]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Hermes]], and either [[Hestia]] or [[Dionysus]]), although philosophies such as [[Stoicism]] and some forms of [[Platonism]] used language that seems to assume a single [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent deity]].  The worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the Greek world, though they often have different [[epithet]]s that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme.

The religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of [[Ionia]] in [[Asia Minor]], to [[Magna Graecia]] (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as [[Marseille|Massalia]] (Marseille).  Early Italian religions such as [[Etruscan mythology|the Etruscan]] were influenced by Greek religion in forming much of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].

==Beliefs==
[[File:7323 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - Artemis - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|The (first) [[Piraeus Artemis]], probably the [[cult image]] from a temple, 4th century BC]]
While there were few concepts universal to all the Greek peoples, there were common beliefs shared by many.

===Theology===
Ancient Greek [[theology]] was [[polytheism|polytheistic]], based on the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses, as well as a range of lesser supernatural beings of various types. There was a hierarchy of deities, with [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not almighty. Some deities had dominion over certain aspects of [[nature]]. For instance, Zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, [[Poseidon]] ruled over the [[sea]] and [[earthquakes]], [[Hades]] projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the [[Greek Underworld|Underworld]], and [[Helios]] controlled the [[sun]]. Other deities ruled over abstract concepts; for instance [[Aphrodite]] controlled [[love]].  All significant deities were visualized as "human" in form, although often able to transform themselves into animals or natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), 2:1:4&lt;/ref&gt;

While being immortal, the gods were certainly not [[Omnibenevolence|all-good]] or even [[omnipotence|all-powerful]]. They had to obey [[destiny|fate]], known to Greek mythology as the [[Moirai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Religion|last=Burkert|first=Walter|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=129|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which overrode any of their divine powers or wills. For instance, in mythology, it was [[Odysseus]]' fate to return home to [[Ithaca]] after the [[Trojan War]], and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, but they could not stop him.
[[File:Aphrodite swan BM D2.jpg|thumb|Aphrodite riding a swan: Attic white-ground red-figured ''[[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'', ca. 460, found at Kameiros (Rhodes)]]

The gods acted like humans and had human [[vice]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Homeric Gods: The Spiritual Significance of Greek Religion|last=Otto|first=W.F.|publisher=Pantheon|year=1954|isbn=|location=New York|pages=131|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would interact with humans, sometimes even spawning children with them. At times certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other. In the ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Aphrodite]], [[Ares]] and [[Apollo]] support the Trojan side in the Trojan War, while [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and Poseidon support the Greeks (see [[theomachy]]).

Some gods were specifically associated with a certain city. Athena was associated with the city of [[Athens]], Apollo with [[Delphi]] and [[Delos]], Zeus with [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and Aphrodite with [[Corinth]]. But other gods were also worshipped in these cities. Other deities were associated with nations outside of Greece; Poseidon was associated with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Troy]], and Ares with [[Thrace]].

Identity of names was not a guarantee of a similar [[cult]]us; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at [[Sparta]], the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted [[fertility rite|fertility goddess]] at [[Ephesus]]. Though the worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities boasted temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end.

===Afterlife===
{{further information|Greek Underworld}}
The Greeks believed in an [[underworld]] where the spirits of the dead went after death. One of the most widespread areas of this underworld was ruled over by Hades, a brother of Zeus, and was known as [[Hades]] (originally called 'the place of Hades'). Other well known realms are [[Tartarus]], a place of torment for the damned, and [[Elysium]], a place of pleasures for the virtuous. In the early Mycenean religion all the dead went to Hades, but the rise of mystery cults in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic age]] led to the development of places such as Tartarus and Elysium.

A few Greeks, like [[Achilles]], [[Alcmene]], [[Amphiaraus]] [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Melicertes]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean, or beneath the ground. Such beliefs are found in the most ancient of Greek sources, such as [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. This belief remained strong even into the Christian era. For most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Rohde]] ''Psyche: The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks''. New York: Harper &amp; Row 1925 [1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Greeks, such as the philosophers [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]], also embraced the idea of [[reincarnation]], though this was only accepted by a few. [[Epicurus]] taught that the soul was simply atoms which dissolved at death, so there was no existence after death.

===Mythology===
{{further information|Greek mythology}}

[[File:Rubens - Judgement of Paris.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|''The Judgment of Paris'' by Peter Paul Rubens]], depicting the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Athena]], in a competition that causes the [[Trojan War]]. This Baroque painting shows the continuing fascination with Greek mythology]]

Greek religion had an extensive [[mythology]]. It consisted largely of stories of the gods and how they interacted with humans. Myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as [[Heracles]] and his [[Twelve Labors|twelve labors]], [[Odysseus]] and his voyage home, [[Jason]] and the quest for the [[Golden Fleece]] and [[Theseus]] and the [[Minotaur]].

Many species existed in Greek mythology. Chief among these were the gods and humans, though the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (who predated the Olympian gods) also frequently appeared in Greek myths. Lesser species included the half-man-half-horse [[centaur]]s, the nature based [[nymph]]s (tree nymphs were [[dryad]]s, sea nymphs were [[Nereid]]s) and the half man, half goat [[satyr]]s. Some creatures in Greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], the sea beast [[Scylla]], whirlpool [[Charybdis]], Gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull [[Minotaur]].

There was not a set Greek [[cosmogony]], or creation myth. Different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways. One Greek creation myth was told in Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]''. It stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], who gave birth to various other primordial gods, such as Gaia, Tartarus and Eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the Titans, who then gave birth to the first Olympians.

The mythology largely survived and was added to in order to form the later [[Roman mythology]]. The Greeks and Romans had been literate societies, and much mythology, although initially shared orally, was written down in the forms of [[epic poetry]] (such as the ''Iliad'', the ''Odyssey'' and the ''[[Argonautica]]'') and plays (such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Frogs]]''). The mythology became popular in Christian post-[[Renaissance]] Europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like [[Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Rubens]].

===Morality===
One of the most important moral concepts to the Greeks was the fear of committing [[hubris]]. Hubris constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse,&lt;ref&gt;Omitowoju {which book?}, p. 36; Cartledge, Millet &amp; Todd, ''Nomos: Essays in Athenian Law, Politics and Society'', 1990, Cambridge UP, p 126&lt;/ref&gt; and was a crime in the city-state of Athens. Although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the Greeks emphasized moderation. Pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. The same was thought of eating and drinking. Anything done to excess was not considered proper. Ancient Greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally. In fact many of their competitions included both. Pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others.

===Sacred texts===
The Greeks had no [[religious text]]s they regarded as "revealed" scriptures of sacred origin, but very old texts including [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'', and the [[Homeric hymns]] (regarded as later productions today), Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' and ''[[Works and Days]]'', and [[Pindar]]'s [[Ode]]s were regarded as having authority&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985),Introduction:2; [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&amp;pg=PA634 Religions of the ancient world: a guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps being inspired; they   usually begin with an invocation to the [[Muse]]s for inspiration.  [[Plato]] even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' because of their low moral tone.

While some traditions, such as Mystery cults, did uphold certain texts as canonic within their own cult praxis, such texts were respected but not necessarily accepted as canonic outside their circle. In this field, of particular importance are certain texts referring to [[Orphic cults]]: multiple copies, ranging from 450 [[Before Christ|BC]] to 250 [[AD]], have been found in various locations of the Greek world. Even the words of the oracles never turned into a sacred text. Other texts were specially composed for religious events, and some have survived within the lyric tradition; although they had a cult function, they were bound to performance and never developed into a common, standard prayer form comparable to the Christian [[Pater Noster]]. An exception to this rule were the already named Orphic and Mystery rituals, which, in this, set themselves aside from the rest of the Greek religious system. Finally, some texts called ''hieroi logoi'' ({{lang-el|ιεροί λόγοι}}) (sacred texts) by the ancient sources, originated from outside the Greek world, or were supposedly adopted in remote times, representing yet more different traditions within the Greek belief system.

==Practices==
[[File:Tempio di Atena o tempio di Cerere.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Athena (Paestum)|Temple of Athena, Paestum]]]]

===Ceremonies===
The lack of a unified priestly class meant that a unified, [[Canon of Scripture|canonic]] form of the religious texts or practices never existed; just as there was no unified, common sacred text for the Greek belief system, there was no standardization of practices. Instead, religious practices were organized on local levels, with priests normally being [[magistrates]] for the city or village, or gaining authority from one of the many sanctuaries. Some priestly functions, like the care for a particular local festival, could be given by tradition to a certain family.  To a large extent, in the absence of "scriptural" sacred texts, religious practices derived their authority from tradition, and "every omission or deviation arouses deep anxiety and calls forth sanctions".&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), Introduction:3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ceremonies of ancient Greece|Greek ceremonies]] and rituals were mainly performed at [[altar]]s. These were typically devoted to one or a few gods, and supported a statue of the particular deity. [[Votive deposit]]s would be left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects. Sometimes [[animal sacrifice]]s would be performed here, with most of the flesh eaten, and the [[offal]] burnt as an offering to the gods. [[Libations]], often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a [[symposium]].

One ceremony was [[pharmakos]], a ritual involving expelling a symbolic [[scapegoat]] such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship. It was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it.

===Sacrifice===
[[File:Sacrifice to Athena, Amphora from Vulci, 550-540 BC, Berlin F 1686, 141662.jpg|thumb|left|A bull is led to the altar of [[Athena]], whose image is at right.  Vase, c. 545 BC.]]
Worship in Greece typically consisted of [[animal sacrifice|sacrificing domestic animals]] at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, is decorated with garlands and the like, and led in procession to the altar, a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife leading the way.  After various rituals the animal is slaughtered over the altar, as it falls all the women present "must cry out in high, shrill tones".  Its blood is collected and poured over the altar. It is butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity's portion of the offering, while the meat is removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasting it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin, to sell to tanners. That the humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity had not escaped the Greeks, and is often the subject of humour in [[Greek comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), 2:1:1, 2:1:2.  For more exotic local forms of sacrifice, see the [[Laphria (festival)]], [[Xanthika]], and [[Lykaia]].  The advantageous division of the animal was supposed to go back to [[Prometheus]]'s trick on Zeus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The animals used are, in order of preference, bull or ox, cow, sheep (the most common), goat, pig (with piglet the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish).&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:1; to some extent different animals were thought appropriate for different deities, from bulls for Zeus and Poseidon to doves for Aphrodite, Burkert (1985): 2:1:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Horses and asses are seen on some [[Pottery of ancient Greece#Geometric style|vases in the Geometric style]] (900-750 BC), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter go very far back.  The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviours as showing this. [[Divination]] by examining parts of the sacrificed animal was much less important than in Roman or [[Etruscan religion]], or Near Eastern religions, but [[Greek divination|was practiced]], especially of the liver, and as part of the cult of Apollo. Generally, the Greeks put more faith in observing the behaviour of birds.&lt;ref&gt;Struck, P.T. (2014). "Animals and Divination", In Campbell, G.L. (Ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life'', 2014, Oxford University Press. DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199589425.013.019, [https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=classics_papers online]&lt;/ref&gt;  

For a smaller and simpler offering, a grain of [[incense]] could be thrown on the sacred fire,&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; and outside the cities farmers made simple sacrificial gifts of plant produce as the "first fruits" were harvested.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 2:1:4&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Libation#Ancient Greece|libation]], a ritual pouring of fluid, was part of everyday life, and libations with a prayer were often made at home whenever wine was drunk, with just a part of the cup's contents, the rest being drunk. More formal ones might be made onto altars at temples, and other fluids such as [[olive oil]] and honey might be used.  Although the grand form of sacrifice called the [[hecatomb]] (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands.
[[File:Greekreligion-animalsacrifice-corinth-6C-BCE.jpg|thumb|Sacrifice of a lamb on [[Pitsa panels|a Pitsa Panel]], [[Corinth]], 540–530 BC]]

The evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in [[Homer]]'s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' [[Eumaeus]] sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. However, in Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hitch, ''King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the Iliad'', [https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/6164.1-defining-homeric-sacrifice online at] Harvard University's Center for Hellenic Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

These sacrificial practices share much with recorded forms of sacrificial rituals known from later. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer's epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Meuli, ''Griechische Opferbräuche'', 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[Chthonic]] deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Hellenic]] religion and that many of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] in the late third millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Chadwick|first1=John|title=The Mycenaean World|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
Various religious festivals were held in ancient Greece. Many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state. For example, the festival of [[Lykaia]] was celebrated in [[Arcadia]] in Greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].  Like the other [[Panhellenic Games]], the [[ancient Olympic Games]] were a religious festival, held at the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].  Other festivals centred on [[Greek theatre]], of which the [[Dionysia]] in Athens was the most important.  More typical festivals featured a procession, large sacrifices and a feast to eat the offerings, and many included entertainments and customs such as visiting friends, wearing fancy dress and unusual behaviour in the streets, sometimes risky for bystanders in various ways.  Altogether the [[Attic calendar|year in Athens]] included some 140 days that were religious festivals of some sort, though varying greatly in importance.

===Rites of passage===
One [[rite of passage]] was the [[amphidromia]], celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child. Childbirth was extremely significant to Athenians, especially if the baby was a boy.

==Sanctuaries and temples==
[[File:Athena Parthenos LeQuire.jpg|thumb|right|Reproduction of the ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' cult image at the original size in the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]], Tennessee.]]
{{main|Ancient Greek temple}}
The main [[Ancient Greek temple|Greek temple]] building sat within a larger precinct or [[temenos]], usually surrounded by a [[peribolos]] fence or wall; the whole is usually called a "sanctuary". The [[Acropolis of Athens]] is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there.  The tenemos might include many subsidiary buildings, [[sacred grove]]s or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Miles,  219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial.  A typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings.  Many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities.  This process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Theories are discussed in chapter 1 of ''Greek Sanctuaries: New Approaches'', Eds. Robin Hagg and Nanno Marinatos, 2002, Routledge, {{ISBN|113480167X}}, 9781134801671, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WvSHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the [[ritual sacrifice|sacrifice]]s and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, at altars within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large.  As the centuries past both the inside of popular temples and the area surrounding them accumulated statues and small shrines or other buildings as gifts, and military trophies, paintings and items in precious metals, effectively turning them into a type of museum.

Some sanctuaries offered [[oracle]]s, people who were believed to receive divine inspiration in answering questions put by pilgrims.  The most famous of these by far was the female priestess called the [[Pythia]] at the Temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]], and that of Zeus at [[Dodona]], but there were many others.  Some dealt only with medical, agricultural or other specialized matters, and not all represented gods, like that of the hero [[Trophonius]] at [[Livadeia]].

===Cult images===
[[File:Delphi chryselephantine.jpg|thumb|left|Gold and fire-blackened ivory fragments of a burnt Archaic [[chryselephantine statue]] - [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]]]
The temple was the house of the deity it was dedicated to, who in some sense resided in the [[cult image]] in the ''[[cella]]'' or main room inside, normally facing the only door. The cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size. In early days these were in wood, marble or [[terracotta]], or in the specially prestigious form of a [[Chryselephantine sculpture|chryselephantine statue]] using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework.  The most famous Greek cult images were of this type, including the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]], and [[Phidias]]'s [[Athena Parthenos]] in the [[Parthenon]] in Athens, both colossal statues, now completely lost. Fragments of two chryselephantine statues from [[Delphi]] have been excavated. Bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until Hellenistic times.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Early images seem often to have been dressed in real clothes, and at all periods images might wear real jewellery donated by devotees.

The [[acrolith]] was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body.  A [[xoanon]] was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the Hindu [[lingam]]; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity, even when a new statue was the main cult image.  Xoana had the advantage that they were easy to carry in processions at festivals.  Many of the Greek statues well known from Roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the [[Apollo Barberini]], can be credibly identified.  A very few actual originals survive, for example, the bronze [[Piraeus Athena]] ({{convert|2.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, including a helmet).  The image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs.

It used to be thought that access to the ''cella'' of a Greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions. In recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century AD who declares that the special intention of his travels around Greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 212-213, 220&lt;/ref&gt;

It was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender (with either men or women forbidden), or even more tightly. Garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity. In some places visitors were asked to show they spoke Greek; elsewhere [[Dorians]] were not allowed entry. Some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. Some temples are said never to be opened at all. But generally Greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the ''cella''. Once inside the ''cella'' it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; Cicero saw a bronze image of Heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, 48-50; Miles, 212-213, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Famous cult images such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]] functioned as significant visitor attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mystery religions==
Those who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] which operated as [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets.

Here, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the [[afterlife]], a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship.

Some of these mysteries, like the mysteries of [[Eleusis]] and [[Samothrace]], were ancient and local. Others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of [[Dionysus]]. During the [[Hellenistic]] period and the [[Roman Empire]], exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in Greece, but all across the empire. Some of these were new creations, such as [[Mithras]], while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the Egyptian mysteries of [[Osiris]].

==History==
[[File:7262 - Piraeus Arch. Museum, Athens - The Piraeus Apollo - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Piraeus Apollo]], c. 525 BC]]

===Origins===
Mainstream Greek religion appears to have developed out of [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and although very little is known about the earliest periods there are suggestive hints that some local elements go back even further than the [[Bronze Age]] or [[Helladic chronology|Helladic period]] to the farmers of [[Neolithic Greece]].  There was also clearly [[cultural evolution]] from the Late Helladic [[Mycenaean religion]] of the [[Mycenaean civilization]]. Both the literary settings of some important myths and many important sanctuaries relate to locations that were important Helladic centres that had become otherwise unimportant by Greek times.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:1, 1:2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mycenaeans perhaps treated Poseidon, to them a god of earthquakes as well as the sea, as their chief deity, and forms of his name along with several other Olympians are recognisable in records in [[Linear B]], although Apollo and Aphrodite are absent.  Only about half of the Mycenaean pantheon seem to survive the [[Greek Dark Ages]] though.  The archaeological evidence for continuity in religion is far clearer for Crete and [[Cyprus]] than the Greek mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:3:6&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek religious concepts may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as [[Minoan religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:3:1&lt;/ref&gt; and other influences came from the Near East, especially via Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:3:6&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BCE, traced many Greek religious practices to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].

The [[Great Goddess hypothesis]], that a Stone Age religion dominated by a female Great Goddess was displaced by a male-dominated Indo-European hierarchy, has been proposed for Greece as for Minoan [[Crete]] and other regions, but has not been in favour with specialists for some decades, though the question remains too poorly-evidenced for a clear conclusion; at the least the evidence from [[Minoan art]] shows more goddesses than gods.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:3:5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Twelve Olympians]], with Zeus as [[sky father]], certainly have a strong Indo-European flavour;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985): 1:2&lt;/ref&gt; by the epic works of Homer all are well-established, except for [[Dionysus]].  However, several of the [[Homeric hymns]], probably composed slightly later, are dedicated to him.

===Archaic and classical periods===
[[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]] saw the development of [[List of ancient Greek cities|flourishing cities]] and of stone-built temples to the gods, which were rather consistent in design across the Greek world.  Religion was closely tied to civic life, and priests were mostly drawn from the local elite.  Religious works led the development of [[Greek sculpture]], though apparently not the now-vanished Greek painting.  While much religious practice was, as well as personal, aimed at developing solidarity within the ''[[polis]]'', a number of important sanctuaries developed a "Panhellenic" status, drawing visitors from all over the Greek world. These served as an essential component in the growth and self-consciousness of Greek nationalism.&lt;ref name=Burckhardt&gt;{{harvnb|Burckhardt|1999|loc=p. 168: "The establishment of these Panhellenic sites, which yet remained exclusively Hellenic, was a very important element in the growth and self-consciousness of Hellenic nationalism; it was uniquely decisive in breaking down enmity between tribes, and remained the most powerful obstacle to fragmentation into mutually hostile ''poleis''."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The mainstream religion of the Greeks did not go unchallenged within Greece. As [[Greek philosophy]] developed its ideas about [[ethics]], the Olympians were bound to be found wanting.  Several notable philosophers criticised a belief in the gods. The earliest of these was [[Xenophanes]], who chastised the human vices of the gods as well as their anthropomorphic depiction. [[Plato]] wrote that there was one supreme god, whom he called the "[[Form of the Good]]", and which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe. Plato's disciple, [[Aristotle]], also disagreed that polytheistic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it. He believed in a [[Primum movens|Prime Mover]], which had set creation going, but was not connected to or interested in the universe.

===Hellenistic period===
[[File:Egyptian - Pendant with Image of Sarapis - Walters 571524 - Front View B (cropped).jpg|thumb|Pendant with [[Serapis]], Eygpt, 2nd century BC]]  
{{main|Hellenistic religion}}
In the [[Hellenistic period]] between the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC and the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] (146 BC) Greek religion developed in various ways, including expanding over at least some of Alexander's conquests.  The new dynasties of [[diadochi]], kings and tyrants often spent lavishly on temples, often following Alexander in trying to insinuate themselves into religious cult; this was much easier for the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt, where the traditional [[ancient Egyptian religion]] had long had deified monarchs.  The enormous raised [[Pergamon Altar]] (now in Berlin) and the [[Altar of Hieron]] in [[Sicily]] are examples of unprecedentedly large constructions of the period.

New cults of imported deities such as [[Isis#In the Greco-Roman world|Isis from Egypt]], [[Atargatis]] from Syria, and [[Cybele]] from Anatolia became increasingly important, as well as [[Hellenistic philosophy|several philosophical movements]] such as [[Platonism]], [[stoicism]], and [[Epicureanism]]; both tended to detract from the traditional religion, although many Greeks were able to hold beliefs from more than one of these groups.  [[Serapis]] was essentially a Hellenistic creation, if not devised then spread in Eygpt for political reasons by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] as a hybrid of Greek and local styles of deity.  Various philosophical movements, including the [[Orphics]] and [[Pythagoreans]], began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice, and whether the gods really appreciated it; from the surviving texts [[Empedocles]] and [[Theophrastus]] (both vegetarians) were notable critics.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1972), 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic astrology]] developed late in the period, as another distraction from the traditional practices.  Although the traditional myths, festivals and beliefs all continued, these trends probably reduced the grip on the imagination of the traditional pantheon, especially among the educated, but probably more widely in the general population.

===Roman Empire===
When the [[Roman Republic]] conquered Greece in 146 BC, it took much of Greek religion (along with many other aspects of [[Greek culture]] such as literary and architectural styles) and incorporated it into its own. The Greek gods were equated with the ancient Roman deities; Zeus with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], Hera with [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Poseidon with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], Aphrodite with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], Ares with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Artemis with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], Athena with [[Minerva]], Hermes with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], Hephaestus with [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Hestia with [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], Demeter with [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], Hades with [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], Tyche with [[Fortuna]], and Pan with [[Faunus]]. Some of the gods, such as Apollo and [[Bacchus]], had earlier been adopted by the Romans. There were also many deities that existed in the Roman religion before its interaction with Greece that were not associated with a Greek deity, including [[Janus]] and [[Quirinus]].

The Romans generally did not spend much on new temples in Greece, other that those for [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|their Imperial cult]], which were placed in all important cities.  Exceptions include [[Antoninus Pius]] (r. 138-161 AD), whose commissions include the [[Baalbec]] [[Temple of Bacchus]], arguably the most impressive survival from the imperial period (though the Temple of Jupiter-[[Baal]] next to it was larger).  It could be said the Greek world was by this time well furnished with sanctuaries. Roman governors and emperors often pilfered famous statues from sanctuaries, sometimes leaving contemporary reproductions in their place. [[Verres]], governor of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] from 73 to 70 BC, was an early example who, unusually, was prosecuted after his departure.

After the huge Roman conquests beyond Greece, new cults from Egypt and Asia became popular in Greece as well as the western empire, and a [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] becomes evident from the 2nd century AD, that was as much a cause as a result of the rise of [[Early Christianity]].  The [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|edicts of the Christian Emperor Theodosius I]] from 380 onwards finally outlawed most public religious practices of the old religion, such as sacrifices; the last Olympic Games were held in 393 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1985), Introduction:3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenism's revivals===
[[File:Hellen priest (1).png|thumb|right|Priest performing ritual.]]
{{Main article|Hellenism (religion)}}
Greek religion and [[Hellenistic philosophy|philosophy]] have experienced a number of revivals, most notably in the arts, humanities and spirituality of the [[Renaissance]]. More recently, a revival has begun with the contemporary [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], as it is often called (a term first used by the last pagan Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]). In Greece, the term used is Hellene ethnic religion (Greek:  Ελληνική Εθνική Θρησκεία).

Modern Hellenism reflects [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]]/Platonic speculation (which is represented in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Libanius]], [[Proclus]], and [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]), as well as classical cult practice. However, there are many fewer followers than [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Christianity]]. According to estimates reported by the [[U.S. State Department]], there are perhaps as many as 2,000 followers of the ancient Greek religion out of a total Greek population of 11 million;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm Greece]. State.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Hellenism's leaders place that figure at 100,000 followers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=617qc8gmta8 Hellenic Religion today: Polytheism in modern Greece].

'''Angra Mainyu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ŋ|r|ə|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|nj|uː}}; [[Avestan language|Avestan]]: ''𐬀𐬢𐬭𐬀⸱𐬨𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬌𐬌𐬎‎'' ''Aŋra Mainiiu'') is the [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] name of [[Zoroastrianism]]'s [[Hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] of the "destructive spirit". The [[Middle Persian]] equivalent is '''Ahriman''' 𐭠𐭧𐭫𐭬𐭭𐭩‎ (Anglicised pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|ɪ|m|ə|n}}). Angra Mainyu is omnimalevolent. Angra Mainyu is [[Ahura Mazda]]’s adversary.

==In the Avesta==

===In Zoroaster's revelation===
Avestan ''angra mainyu''&lt;!-- lower case when in Gathic context --&gt; "seems to have been an original conception of [[Zoroaster]]'s."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673"&gt;{{citation|chapter=Ahriman|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|location=New York|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1982|volume=1|pages=670–673|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ahriman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gathas]], which are the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and are attributed to the prophet himself, ''angra mainyu'' is not yet a proper name.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Proper names are altogether rare in the Gathas. In these texts, even [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Amesha Spenta]] are not yet proper names.&lt;/ref&gt; In the one instance in these hymns where the two words appear together, the concept spoken of is that of a ''mainyu'' ("mind", "spirit" or otherwise an abstract energy etc.)&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The translation of ''mainyu'' as "spirit" is the common approximation. The stem of ''mainyu'' is "man", "thought", and "spirit" is here meant in the sense of 'mind'.&lt;/ref&gt; that is ''angra'' ("destructive", "chaotic", "disorderly", "inhibitive", "malign" etc, of which a manifestation can be [[anger]]). In this single instance—in ''[[Yasna]]'' 45.2—the "more bounteous of the spirits twain" declares ''angra mainyu'' to be its "absolute antithesis".&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

A similar statement occurs in ''Yasna'' 30.3, where the antithesis is however ''aka mainyu'', ''aka'' being the Avestan language word for "evil". Hence, ''aka mainyu'' is the "evil spirit" or "evil mind" or "evil thought," as contrasted with ''[[Amesha Spenta|spenta mainyu]]'', the "bounteous spirit" with which [[Ahura Mazda]] conceived of creation, which then "was".

The ''aka mainyu'' epithet recurs in ''Yasna'' 32.5, when the principle is identified with the [[daeva|''daeva''s]] that deceive humankind and themselves. While in later Zoroastrianism, the ''daevas'' are demons, this is not yet evident in the Gathas: Zoroaster stated that the ''daevas'' are "wrong gods" or "false gods" that are to be rejected, but they are not yet demons.&lt;ref name="Hellenschmidt_1993_599_602"&gt;{{citation|chapter=Daiva|author1=Hellenschmidt, Clarice  |author2=Kellens, Jean|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|year=1993|volume=6|pages=599–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Yasna'' 32.3, these ''daevas'' are identified as the offspring, not of Angra Mainyu, but of ''[[Akem Manah|akem manah]]'', "evil thinking". A few verses earlier it is however the ''daebaaman'', "deceiver"—not otherwise identified but "probably Angra Mainyu"&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;—who induces the ''daevas'' to choose ''achistem manah''—"worst thinking." In ''Yasna'' 32.13, the abode of the wicked is not the abode of Angra Mainyu, but the abode of the same "worst thinking". "One would have expected [Angra Mainyu] to reign in hell, since he had created 'death and how, at the end, the worst existence shall be for the deceitful' (''Y.'' 30.4)."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

===In the Younger Avesta===
''Yasna'' 19.15 recalls that Ahura Mazda's recital of the [[Ahuna Vairya]] invocation puts Angra Mainyu in a stupor. In ''Yasna'' 9.8, Angra Mainyu creates [[Zahhak|Aži Dahaka]], but the serpent recoils at the sight of [[Mithra]]'s mace (''Yasht'' 10.97, 10.134). In ''Yasht'' 13, the [[Fravashi]]s defuse Angra Mainyu's plans to dry up the earth, and in ''Yasht'' 8.44 Angra Mainyu battles but cannot defeat [[Tishtrya]] and so prevent the rains. In ''Vendidad'' 19, Angra Mainyu urges Zoroaster to turn from the good religion by promising him sovereignty of the world. On being rejected, Angra Mainyu assails the prophet with legions of demons, but Zoroaster deflects them all. In ''Yasht'' 19.96, a verse that reflects a Gathic injunction, Angra Mainyu will be vanquished and Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail.

In ''Yasht'' 19.46ff, Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu battle for possession of ''khvaraenah'', "divine glory" or "fortune". In some verses of the Yasna (e.g. ''Yasna'' 57.17), the two principles are said to have created the world, which contradicts the Gathic principle that declares Ahura Mazda to be the sole creator and which is reiterated in the cosmogony of ''[[Vendidad]]'' 1. In that first chapter, which is the basis for the 9th–12th-century ''[[Bundahishn]]'', the creation of sixteen lands by Ahura Mazda is countered by the Angra Mainyu's creation of sixteen scourges such as winter, sickness, and vice. "This shift in the position of Ahura Mazda, his total assimilation to this Bounteous Spirit [Mazda's instrument of creation], must have taken place in the 4th century BC at the latest; for it is reflected in Aristotle's testimony, which confronts Areimanios with Oromazdes (apud Diogenes Laertius, 1.2.6)."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

''Yasht'' 15.43 assigns Angra Mainyu to the nether world, a world of darkness. So also ''Vendidad '' 19.47, but other passages in the same chapter (19.1 and 19.44) have him dwelling in the region of the ''daeva''s, which the ''Vendidad'' asserts is in the north. There (19.1, 19.43–44), Angra Mainyu is the ''daevanam daevo'', "''daeva'' of ''daeva''s" or chief of the ''daeva''s. The superlative ''daevo.taema'' is however assigned to the demon Paitisha ("opponent"). In an enumeration of the ''daeva''s in Vendidad 1.43, Angra Mainyu appears first and Paitisha appears last. "Nowhere is Angra Mainyu said to be the creator of the ''daeva''s or their father."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

==In Zurvanite Zoroastrianism==
{{main article|Zurvanism}}
[[Zurvanism]] was a branch of Zoroastrianism that sought to resolve the dilemma of the "twin spirits" of ''Yasna'' 30.3. The resolution, which probably developed out of the contact with [[Chaldea]],{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} was to have both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu as twin sons of the First Principle "Time" (Avestan: ''Zurvan''). Zurvanism was strongly criticized as a heresy during the [[Sassanid]] period (225–651) of Iranian history,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} an era in which it probably also had its largest following.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Although the [[monist]] doctrine is not attested after the 10th century, some Zurvanite features are nonetheless still evident in present-day Zoroastrianism.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Zurvanism's principal feature is then the notion that both Ahura Mazda ([[Middle Persian|MP]]: Ohrmuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) were twin brothers, with the former being the epitome of good and the latter being the epitome of evil. Further, this dichotomy was ''by choice'', that is, Angra Mainyu chose to be evil: "It is not that I cannot create anything good, but that I will not." To prove the ability to create something good, he created the peacock.

The mythology of the twins is only attested in the post-Sassanid Syriac and Armenian polemic such as that of [[Yeznik of Kolb|Eznik of Kolb]]. According to these sources the genesis saw Zurvan as an [[androgynous]] deity, existing alone but desiring offspring who would create "heaven and hell and everything in between." Zurvan then sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards the end of this period, Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan's decision, which he then communicated to his brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000 years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity.&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1966_419_428"&gt;{{citation|last=Zaehner|first=Richard Charles|title=Zurvan, a Zoroastrian dilemma|year=1955|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Zoroastrian tradition==
[[File:Text-pal-Ahlmn'-ahreman.png|thumb|The Middle Persian word ʾhlmn' (Ahreman) in [[Book Pahlavi]] script. The word is traditionally always written upside down.]]

In the [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] texts of the 9th–12th century, Ahriman (written ''ʼhl(y)mn'') is frequently written upside down "as a sign of contempt and disgust."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

In the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf]]'' 5.10, the narrator—the 'righteous Viraf'—is taken by [[Sarosh]] and [[Atar|Adar]] to see "the reality of God and the archangels, and the non-reality of Ahriman and the demons."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authors=Haug, Martin (trans., ed.)|chapter=The Book of Arda Viraf|editor=Charles F. Horne|title=The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East (Vol. 7)|year=1917|publisher=Parke, Austin, and Lipscomb|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of "non-reality" is also expressed in other texts, such as the ''[[Denkard]]'', a 9th-century "encyclopedia of Mazdaism",&lt;ref name="deMenasce"&gt;{{citation|last=de Menasce|first=Jean-Pierre|year=1958|title=Une encyclopédie mazdéenne: le Dēnkart. Quatre conférences données à l'Université de Paris sous les auspices de la fondation Ratanbai Katrak|location=Paris|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states Ahriman "has never been and never will be."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt; In chapter 100 of ''Book of the Arda Viraf'', which is titled 'Ahriman', the narrator sees the "Evil spirit, ... whose religion is evil [and] who ever ridiculed and mocked the wicked in hell."

In the Zurvanite ''Ulema-i Islam'' (a Zoroastrian text, despite the title), "Ahriman also is called by some name by some people and they ascribe evil unto him but nothing can also be done by him without Time.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}" A few chapters later, the Ulema notes that "it is clear that Ahriman is a non-entity" but "at the resurrection Ahriman will be destroyed and thereafter all will be good; and [change?] will proceed through the will of God." In the ''Sad Dar'', the world is described as having been created by Ohrmuzd and become pure through his truth. But Ahriman, "being devoid of anything good, does not issue from that which is owing to truth." (62.2)

''[[Jamasp Namag|Book of Jamaspi]]'' 2.3 notes that "Ahriman, like a worm, is so much associated with darkness and old age, that he perishes in the end."&lt;ref name="Jamaspi_Modi"&gt;{{citation|last=Modi|first=Jivanji Jamshedji Modi|title=Jamasp Namak ("Book of Jamaspi")|year=1903|publisher=K. R. Cama Oriental Institute|location=Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 4.3 recalls the grotesque legend of Tahmurasp (Avestan: Taxma Urupi) riding Angra Mainyu for thirty years (cf. ''Yasht'' 15.12, 19.29) and so preventing him from doing evil. In chapter 7, Jamasp explains that the Indians declare Ahriman will die, but "those, who are not of good religion, go to hell."

The ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a Zoroastrian account of creation completed in the 12th century has much to say about Ahriman and his role in the cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the [[Ahuna Vairya]], Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates [[Jeh]], the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the [[yazatas|''yazad''s]] on one side and Ahriman with his [[daeva|''dev''s]] on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the forces of evil through good thoughts, words and deeds.

Other texts see the world created by Ohrmuzd as a trap for Ahriman, who is then distracted by creation and expends his force in a battle he cannot win. (''The epistles of Zatspram'' 3.23; ''Shkand Gumanig Vichar'' 4.63–4.79). The ''Dadistan denig'' explains that Ohrmuzd, being omniscient, knew of Ahriman's intent, but it would have been against his "justice and goodness to punish Ahriman before he wrought evil [and] this is why the world is created."&lt;ref name="JDG_1982_670_673" /&gt;

Ahriman has no such omniscience, a fact that Ohrmuzd reminds him of (''Bundahishn'' 1.16). In contrast, in [[Manichaean]] scripture, Mani ascribes foresight to Ahriman.&lt;ref name="Dhalla_1938_392"&gt;{{citation|last=Dhalla|first=Maneckji Nusservanji|publisher=OUP|location=New York|year=1938| title=History of Zoroastrianism}} p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In present-day Zoroastrianism==
In 1862, [[Martin Haug]] proposed a new reconstruction of what he believed was Zoroaster's original monotheistic teaching, as expressed in the Gathas— a teaching which he believed had been corrupted by later Zoroastrian dualistic tradition as expressed in [[#In the Younger Avesta|post-Gathic scripture]] and in the [[#In tradition|texts of tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Haug|first=Martin|author2=&lt;!-- posthumous pub: edited by West, Edward W.--&gt;|title=Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis|location=London|publisher=Trubner|year=1884 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSAHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}. &lt;!-- 3rd edition --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For Angra Mainyu, this interpretation meant a demotion from a spirit coeval with Ahura Mazda to a mere product of Ahura Mazda. Haug's theory was based to a great extent on a new interpretation of ''[[Yasna]]'' 30.3; he argued that the good "twin" in that passage should not be regarded as more or less identical to Ahura Mazda, as earlier Zoroastrian thought had assumed,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Cf. Boyce, Mary (1982), ''A History of Zoroastrianism. Volume 1: The Early Period''. Third impression with corrections. pp. 192–194&lt;/ref&gt; but as a separate created entity, Spenta Mainyu. Thus, both Angra Mainyu and Spenta Mainyu were created by Ahura Mazda and should be regarded as his respective 'creative' and 'destructive' emanations.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Haug's interpretation was gratefully received by the [[Parsi]]s of Bombay, who at the time were under considerable pressure from Christian missionaries (most notable amongst them [[John Wilson (scholar)|John Wilson]])&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{citation|last=Wilson|first=John|year=1843|title=The Parsi religion: Unfolded, Refuted and Contrasted with Christianity|location=Bombay|publisher=American Mission Press}} pp. 106ff.&lt;/ref&gt; who sought converts among the Zoroastrian community and criticized Zoroastrianism for its alleged dualism as contrasted with their own monotheism.&lt;ref name="Maneck"&gt;{{Citation|last=Maneck|first=Susan Stiles|title=The Death of Ahriman: Culture, Identity and Theological Change Among the Parsis of India|publisher=K. R. Cama Oriental Institute|location=Bombay|year=1997}} pp. 182ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Haug's reconstruction had also other attractive aspects that seemed to make the religion more compatible with nineteenth-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as he attributed to Zoroaster a rejection of rituals and of worship of entities other than the supreme deity.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, Mary (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices]''. Routledge. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

These new ideas were subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, which eventually reached the west and so in turn corroborated Haug's theories. Among the Parsis of the cities, who were accustomed to English language literature, Haug's ideas were more often repeated than those of the [[Gujarati language]] objections of the priests, with the result that Haug's ideas became well entrenched and are today almost universally accepted as doctrine.&lt;ref name="Maneck" /&gt;

While some modern scholars&lt;ref name="Gershevitch_1964_32"&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1086/371754|last=Gershevitch|first=Ilya|title=Zoroaster's Own Contribution|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=23|issue=1|year=&lt;!-- Jan --&gt;1964|pages=12–38}} p. 13.: The conclusion that the Fiendish Spirit, too, was an emanation of Ahura Mazdah's is unavoidable. But we need not go so far as to assume that Zarathustra imagined the Devil as having directly issued from God. Rather, since free will, too, is a basic tenet of Zarathushtrianism, we may think of the 'childbirth' implied in the idea of twinship as having consisted in the emanation by God of undifferentiated 'spirit', which only at the emergence of free will split into two "twin" Spirits of opposite allegiance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Ahriman|last=Duchesne-Guillemin|first=Jacques|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|location=New York|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1982|volume=1|pages=670–673|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ahriman}}: The myth of the Twin Spirits is a model he set for the choice every person is called upon to make. It can not be doubted that both are sons of Ahura Mazda, since they are explicitly said to be twins, and we learn from Y. 47.2–3 that Ahura Mazda is the father of one of them. Before choosing, neither of them was wicked. There is therefore nothing shocking in Angra Mainyu's being a son of Ahura Mazda, and there is no need to resort to the improbable solution that Zoroaster was speaking figuratively. That Ohrmazd and Ahriman's brotherhood was later considered an abominable heresy is a different matter; Ohrmazd had by then replaced the Bounteous Spirit; and there was no trace any more, in the orthodox view, of the primeval choice, perhaps the prophet's most original conception.&lt;/ref&gt; have theories similar to Haug's regarding Angra Mainyu's origins,&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, Mary (1990), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPlmnX7AgMEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism]''.

== Anthroposophy==

[[Rudolf Steiner]], who founded the esoteric spiritual movement [[anthroposophy]], used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forces which pull humanity away from the centering influence of [[Christ]]. Steiner associated Ahriman, the lower spirit, with materialism, science, heredity, objectivity and soul-hardening. He thought that contemporary Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, 'some little time after our present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium'.&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{Citation|last=Steiner|first=Rudolph|title=The Ahrimanic Deception - Lecture given by Rudolf Steiner in Zurich October 27th, 1919|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|location=Spring Valley, New York|year=1985}} pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Karnataka}}

'''Beary''' or '''Byari''' (ಬ್ಯಾರಿ ಬಾಸೆ ''Byāri Bāsě'') is an Indian language spoken by the [[Muslim]] communities mainly of [[Karnataka]] ([[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi District|Udupi]] districts) and some parts of North [[Kerala]] (''Byaris'').&lt;ref name=studies-ix&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Bearys speak a language made of [[Malayalam]] idioms with [[Tulu language|Tulu]] phonology and grammar.&lt;ref name=studies-ix/&gt; This language is traditionally known as ''Mappila Bashe'' because of Bearys' close contact with [[Mappila]], the Malayali Muslims.&lt;ref name=studies-ix/&gt; Due to the intensive influence of Tulu for centuries, it is today considered close to both [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and [[Malayalam]].

==Features==
The language uses the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] alphabets for writing. Being a distant cousin of other dialects of Malayalam and surrounded by other [[language family|linguistic groups]] for centuries, mainly Tulu, the dialect exhibits ancient features as well as modern innovations not seen in other well-known dialects of Malayalam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;
Surrounded by Tulu-speaking populations, the impact of Tulu on the phonological, morphological and syntactic structure of the dialect is evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;
Professor BM Ichlangod by his recent research work on the Beary dialect proved that, it was one of the independent South Indian Dravidian dialect having derived from Tamil and also rarely Bearies used a script known as [[Vatteluttu alphabet|Vatteluthu]].

===Distinction of ''ḻ'', ''ṇ'', ''ṟ''===
Sounds peculiar to Malayalam such as 'ḻ', 'ṇ', 'ṟ' are not found in this dialect.&lt;ref name=studies-65&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; 'ḷ' and  'ṇ'  are merged with l and n, respectively.&lt;ref name=studies-65/&gt; 'ṟ' is merged with r and tt, '&lt;u&gt;tt&lt;/u&gt;' to t.&lt;ref name=studies-66&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p.66&lt;/ref&gt; This resembles Tulu.&lt;ref name=studies-66/&gt;

===''v'' &gt; ''b''===
The initial ''v'' of standard Malayalam corresponds to an initial ''b'' in Beary Bashe.&lt;ref name=studies-66/&gt;
The same change has taken place in Tulu, too.

# Some dialects.
# This orthographic representation is phonemic. On a phonetic level, it often becomes {{IPA|[ˈʋaːɖəɡə]}}, which is closer to the Tulu and Beary Bashe forms. This occurs because of a rule whereby voiced plosive consonants are intervocalic allophones of their unvoiced counterparts. However, this only applies to native Dravidian words, and as ''vāṭaka'' is a Sanskrit loanword, the prescriptively correct pronunciation is indeed {{IPA|[ˈʋaːʈəkə]}}.

===Distinction of ‘a’ and ‘e’===
The final ‘a’ of standard Malayalam corresponds to the final ‘e’ in Beary Bashe.&lt;ref name=studies-66/&gt;

===Lexical relations===
Almost all lexical items in Beary Bashe can be related to corresponding lexical items in Malayalam, Tulu or Perso-Arabic origin.&lt;ref name=studies-79&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some equivalents can only be found in [[Mappila]] dialects of Malayalam in Kerala.&lt;ref name=studies-79/&gt;

==Person endings==
Verbs in old [[Dravidian languages]] did not have any person marking.&lt;ref name=studies-68&gt;{{Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996}}, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Person endings of verbs observed in modern Dravidian languages are later innovations.&lt;ref name=studies-68/&gt;
Malayalam is the only Dravidian language that does not show any verbal person suffixes,&lt;ref name=studies-68/&gt; so Malayalam verbs can be said to represent the original stage of Dravidian verbs.&lt;ref name=studies-68/&gt; Person suffixes in Beary Bashe closely resemble those of Tulu,&lt;ref name=studies-68/&gt; although the past tense in this dialect agrees with that of standard Malayalam in shape as well as in the distribution of allomorphs.&lt;ref name=studies-68/&gt;

== Arabic influence ==
Beary Bashe is strongly influenced by the Arabic language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-12/msg00490.html Arabic and other language influence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615080525/http://www.tamil.net/list/2000-12/msg00490.html |date=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativised Arabic words are very common in everyday speech, especially in coastal areas. ''Saan'', ''Pinhana'', ''Gubboosu'', ''Dabboosu'', ''Pattir'', ''Rakkasi'', ''Seintaan'', and ''Kayeen'' are a few examples of Beary words with Arabic roots. Beary Bashe also has words related to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]]. Tamil and Malayalam Speakers can understand Beary up to an extent of 75%.

== Literature ==

The Bearys of the coast have produced a rich body of literary works in both Beary Bashe and Kannada. Beary literature comprises poetry, research articles on Bearys, historical analysis of Dakshina Kannada Muslims, essays, stories and other genres of literature. "English-Kannada-Beary" dictionary is also available in the market produced by Dr. A. Wahhab Doddamane. A number of notable Beary littérateurs have contributed to enrich the Beary literature. Dr. Susheela P. Upadhyaya, an eminent scholar has made a comprehensive study in finding the roots of Beary literature. Dr. A. Wahhab Doddamane has produced a book entitled '''The Muslims of Dakshina Kannada''', which is an informative documentary work.

The Bearys have also produced a number of magazines and periodicals from Mangalore and other cities of the district. Some periodicals have become popular and a few of them have become a part of Beary history. Generally Kannada script is used to produce Beary literature. More than a 100 books, 400 audio cassettes and 2 video albums have been brought out so far.&lt;ref name="The Hindu, Saturday, Oct 13, 2007"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/13/stories/2007101361130300.htm The Hindu, Saturday, Oct 13, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/65ESe60O7?url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/13/stories/2007101361130300.htm |date=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrics===
Bearys have brought out numerous lyrics and songs in Beary Bashe. Beary songwriters and music composers have published a number of Beary albums, thousands of copies in electronic format have already been sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/02/06/stories/2006020600440200.htm Online edition of The Hindu, Monday, Feb 06, 2006]. Hindu.com. Retrieved on 26 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk songs===
The Beary Bashe has its own songs and 'ghazals'. Although it is unique in its nature the songs bore resemblance to Moplah Patts ([[Mappila Songs]]). The Beary folk songs were rendered during marriage (''Mangila'') parties, and for many other occasions. '''''Kolkkali patt''''' is a song sung during a cultural play called ''Kolata'' which uses short sticks in both the hands while playing, '''''Unjal patt''''' is sung by the girls during the occasion of putting the child to cradle, '''''Moyilanji patt''''' is sung during marriage ceremonies.

Unfortunately modern day Bearys do not know the folk songs sung by their ancestors. Several Beary folk games have also vanished.
 
One of the famous folk songs sung by Beary women to tease the bride during her wedding celebrations is "appa chudu chudu patima". Elderly ladies of the neighbourhood gather around the bride on the day of '''''Mangila''''' (wedding) to sing those melodious teasing lines.  The first few lines are:
Nallo baasye baava beary, cheh ... !!

:''appa chudu chudu patima,''
:''ippa baru baru mapule;''
:''chutte appa karinhi poyi,''
:''banne mapule madangi poyi ....''

===Fourth Beary Sahitya Sammelana===
The Fourth ''Beary Sahitya Sammelana'' (The Fourth Beary Literary Summit), held
in Vokkaligara Samaja Bhavana in the city of Chikmagalur on 27 February 2007 which demanded that the state government establish a '''''Beary Sahitya Academy.''''' The Sammelana was jointly organized by ''Kendra Beary Sahitya Parishat,'' Mangalore, and ''Chickmagalur Bearygala Okkoota.'' Chikmagalur is the district that harbors the second largest Beary population, next to Dakshina Kannada.

The theme of the Sammelana was ''Prosperity through Literature, Development through Education and Integrity for Security.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/03/stories/2007020316460300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Fourth Beary Sahitya Sammelan in Chikmagalur | date=3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sammelana also took up issues such as '''''official recognition to the Beary Bashe''''' by the State Government, setting up of '''''Beary Sahitya Academy''''', and recognition to the community as '''''linguistic minority'''''. It is said that Beary Bashe is as old as [[Tulu language|Tulu]] and spoken by more than 1,500,000 people around the world. The history of this dialect is at least 1200 years old.&lt;ref name="The Hindu, Saturday, Oct 13, 2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">The '''Democratic and Agricultural Labour Party''' (DALP), more commonly referred to as the '''Christian Democratic Party''' (CDP), was a short-lived political party in [[Belize]]. It promoted [[Christian Democratic]] ideals.

==History==
Shortly after the formation of the [[National Independence Party (Belize)|National Independence Party]] in 1958, Member of the [[Belize House of Representatives]] Enrique Depaz claimed at a meeting held on 19 August that there was no opposition to the ruling [[People's United Party]] (PUP), who had just won [[British Honduras general election, 1957|elections]] in March 1957. He proposed that a third party was necessary to provide real representation to Belizeans. His proposal was accepted and the DALP was formed under leader Nicholas Pollard. The party aimed to achieve self-government and promote social, economic and political development and was against entering groupings such as the [[Federation of the West Indies]] or any proposed affiliation with [[Guatemala]] and/or the rest of [[Central America]].

By October 1960, the party felt it was time to reorganise. Pollard was demoted to Deputy Leader and replaced by MP Denbigh Jeffery. Joining them were Chairman Lionel Francis (previously of the [[National Party (Belize)|NP]]), Secretary Mervyn Hulse and assistant Ernest Cain, Treasurer Clare Gill and National Organizer Robert Taylor. The party contested its [[British Honduras general election, 1961|first elections]] in 1961, but none of the eleven candidates it fielded won a seat. As a result the party fizzled and most of its members switched over to the National Independence Party.

The party was briefly revived prior to the [[Belizean general election, 1984|1984 elections]] by Theodore Aranda to promote his new party based in Dangriga. However, it received only 708 votes (1.5%) and failed to win a seat.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen, D (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', pp105-106 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deacon Blackfire''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]]. Blackfire is stated as being over a hundred years old, and is often portrayed as a power-crazed charismatic [[con artist]] and cult leader skilled in manipulation and brainwashing. Blackfire claimed to be a Native American shaman who was entombed alive after being found guilty of killing a tribal chief and committing heresy.

==Publication history==
He first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Cult]]'' #1 (1988) and was created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Bernie Wrightson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Deacon Blackfire is the main antagonist in the four-issue miniseries, ''Batman: The Cult''. Blackfire is a conman and cult leader who may be over 100 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Cult'' #3 (October 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; He forms an army in the sewers beneath [[Gotham City]], largely composed of the [[homeless]]. Blackfire uses this army to begin a violent war on crime, which escalates into him taking over the entire city, resulting in it being isolated from the rest of the country. Blackfire captures and [[brainwashing|brainwashes]] Batman, temporarily making the Caped Crusader a member of Blackfire's cult, during which Batman breaks his cardinal rule of not killing. Batman eventually breaks his [[psychological conditioning|conditioning]], but its aftereffects make it difficult for him to capture Blackfire. After a brutal search through the sewers, Batman confronts Blackfire, who demands that Batman kill him, making him a [[martyr]]. Batman refuses, and instead savagely beats Blackfire in front of his army. Blackfire's army turns on him and kills him.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Cult'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackest Night===
As part of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Blackfire's corpse is reanimated by a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power ring]] and recruited to the [[Black Lantern Corps]] in ''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (October 2009).&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Deacon Blackfire is an evangelist who is the center of the occult power permeating Arkham Asylum, with Joker's Daughter as his enforcer. When [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]] and [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] (as Jim Corrigan) uncover the secret of the Asylum, both are captured by Blackfire and his demonic army. In the same issue, flashbacks are shown of the previous time Batman encountered the Deacon. The Deacon had an army of devoted homeless and underprivileged, but he also kept many of them drugged under his control. He attempted to do the same with Batman, keeping him chained and drugged in his basement for seven days and seven nights, but the Dark Knight's resiliency led to Deacon ordering his devotees to kill him. Batman however, brought up the question of why Deacon Blackfire wouldn't kill him himself, if he was as powerful as he wanted his army to believe. Batman is able to break the pipe he is chained to, and in a reversal of their confrontation in "The Cult," orders the Deacon to kill him to prove himself in front of his followers. Deacon Blackfire refuses multiple times, and his disillusioned army turns on him and appears to beat him to death.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Eternal'' #17&lt;/ref&gt;

Between their first encounter and the time of Eternal, the Deacon has taken over the body of [[Maxie Zeus]], in attempt to regain entry into this world.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Eternal'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth===
The ghost of Deacon Blackfire returns in ''Detective Comics'' #982 (June 2018), attempting to possess his only remaining blood relative as a means of resurrection.

==In other media==
Deacon Blackfire makes his debut in adapted media in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Marc Worden]]. Deacon Blackfire is the villain behind the "Lamb to the Slaughter" side quest. He is seen at the Lady of Gotham statue about to sacrifice [[Creeper (comics)|Jack Ryder]] when he gets too close in investigating Deacon Blackfire's cult. Batman arrives at the Lady of Gotham statue where he fights Deacon Blackfire's cultists to get to Deacon Blackfire and Jack Ryder. After the cultists are defeated, Batman disables the electrical generators powering the sacrificial cage, defeats Deacon Blackfire, and frees Jack Ryder. Moments later at the Gotham City Police Department, Deacon Blackfire is handed to Aaron Cash and the police officers with him to have him locked up in their cells. If [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] is incarcerated at the [[Gotham City Police Department]], Deacon Blackfire and [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]] develop an animosity towards each other as both villains consider themselves to be God's rightful representative.

'''Eva Carrière''' (born '''Marthe Béraud''' 1886 in France, died sometime after 1922), also known as '''Eva C''', was a prominent [[spiritualist]] and [[psychic]] [[mediumship|medium]] in the early 20th century.

== Biography ==
Béraud was born 1886 in France, the daughter of a French officer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847''. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian. (2010). ''Dictionary of Pseudonyms: 13,000 Assumed Names and Their Origins, 5th ed''. McFarland. p. 84. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4373-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became engaged to Maurice Noël, a soldier who died in the Congo from tropical disease in 1904 before the marriage could take place. Béraud lived with General Elie Noël and his wife at Villa Carmen in [[Algiers]]. She claimed she developed her [[mediumship]] ability after the death of her fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing. p. 310. {{ISBN|978-1161361827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, she held a series of [[séance]]s at Villa Carmen and sitters were invited. In these séances she claimed to materialize a spirit called Bien Boa, a 300-year-old Brahmin [[Hindu]]. However, photographs taken of Boa looked like the figure was made from a large cardboard cutout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 131. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other sittings [[Charles Richet]] reported that Boa was breathing, had moved around the room and had touched him. A photograph revealed Boa to be a man dressed up in a [[cloak]], [[helmet]] and beard.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brady Brower. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 84-86. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newspaper article in 1906 revealed that an Arab coachman known as Areski, who had previously worked at the villa, had been hired to play the part of Bien Boa and that the entire thing was a [[hoax]]. Areski wrote that he made his appearance into the room by a trapdoor. Béraud also admitted to being involved with the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Aykroyd, Angela Narth and Dan Aykroyd. (2009). ''A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters''. Rodale Books. p. 59. {{ISBN|978-1605298757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, Béraud changed her name to Eva Carrière (Eva C) to hide the fraud of her past and began a new career as a medium.&lt;ref&gt;Sofie Lachapelle. (2011). ''Investigating the Supernatural: From Spiritism and Occultism to Psychical Research and Metapsychics in France, 1853-1931''. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 110. {{ISBN|978-1421400136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Béraud had a sexual relationship with a woman 25 years her elder, Juliette Bisson (1861–1956), with whom she performed during her seances.&lt;ref name=Kalush&gt;Kalush (2006). ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero''. Atria Books. p. 419. {{ISBN|978-0743272087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beraud died sometime after 1922.

== Investigations ==

Carrière's psychic performances were investigated by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], author of the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' mystery series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brightbytes.com/collection/spiritpc.html Jack and Beverly's Spirit Photographs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that her performances were genuine and that she was not engaged in any deception. Another psychic investigator of the time, [[Harry Houdini]], observed one of her séances and asserted that they were fraudulent. Houdini was never convinced by Carrière and likened her performance to a magician's trick, the [http://www.thegreatharryhoudini.com/needletrick.html Hindu needle trick].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Houdini]]. (2011). ''A Magician among the Spirits (Cambridge Library Collection - Spiritualism and Esoteric Knowledge)''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-1108027489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physician-psychical researcher [[Gustav Geley]] investigated Carrière and wrote she was a genuine medium but never-published photographs were discovered after Geley's death which revealed fraudulent activity from the medium's companion, Juliette Bisson, such as wires seen running from Carrière's head supporting fake [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;See the entry for ectoplasm in [[J.

Visible Ink Press. {{ISBN|978-1578592098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another physician-psychical researcher, [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]], investigated Carrière and believed the ectoplasm she produced was genuine. The psychiatrist [[Mathilde Ludendorff]] wrote that the experiments of Schrenck-Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3381523 | pmid=23002296 | doi=10.1017/mdh.2011.36 | volume=56 | title=Policing epistemic deviance: Albert Von Schrenck-Notzing and Albert Moll(1) | journal=Med Hist | pages=255–76 | last1 = Sommer | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Schrenck-Notzing mediumship sessions with Carrière the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the [[séance]] room.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H.

Time-Life Books. 1989. p. 64. {{ISBN|978-0809463442}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was well known for running around the séance room naked indulging in [[Human female sexuality|sexual]] activities with her audience. Her companion Juliette Bisson would, during the course of the séance sittings with Schrenck-Notzing, introduce her finger into Eva's [[vagina]] to ensure no "ectoplasm" had been loaded there beforehand to fool the investigators, and she would also strip nude at the end of a séance and demanded another full-on gynecological exam.&lt;ref name=Kalush/&gt; The mediumship sessions of Carrière with Schrenck-Notzing have been described as [[pornography|pornographic]]. The photographs that were taken during the séances show Carrière in the nude emerging from her cabinet and others revealing fake ectoplasm strings hanging from her breasts. Another photograph revealed ectoplasm in the shape of a deflated and disembodied [[penis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g54/g54_delgado.html Bawdy Technologies and the Birth of Ectoplasm By L. Anne Delgado]&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Ruth Brandon]], Juliette Bisson and Carrière were in a sexual relationship together, and they worked in collaboration with each other to fake the ectoplasm and [[eroticism|erotic]]ize their male audience.&lt;ref name="Brandon 1983"&gt;[[Ruth Brandon]].

In 1920, anthropologist [[Eric Dingwall]] and physician-psychical researcher [[V. J. Woolley]] tested Carrière in London. They found no evidence of psychic phenomena, discovered that her [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] was made from chewed paper, and said "the séances proved negative".&lt;ref&gt;Simeon Edmunds. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. pp. 110-111. {{ISBN|978-0850300130}} "In 1920 Eva C came to London at the invitation of the SPR. Forty séances, held under the direction of Dr. E. J. Dingwall and Dr. J. V. Woolley, proved entirely negative. The small amount of 'ectoplasm' produced proved on analysis to be nothing more than chewed up paper."&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Brandon wrote that Carrière produced some of her effects by regurgitation, hiding her ectoplasm in the séance cabinet and using her secret accomplice Juliette Bisson.&lt;ref name="Brandon 1983"/&gt;

According to [[Harry Price]], the photographs of her ectoplasm taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional, made from cardboard and newspaper portraits, and that there were no scientific controls, as both her hands were free. In 1920, Carrière was investigated by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) in London. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Price. (1939). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. {{ISBN|978-0766142428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Donald J. West|Donald West]] wrote that Carrière´s ectoplasm was made of cut-out paper faces from [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it was made from a magazine cut out, complete with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. West. (1954). ''Psychical Research Today''. Chapter Séance-Room Phenomena. Duckworth. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue]]. (1972). ''Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement''. Doubleday. p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, a Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper ''Neue Wiener Tagblatt'' exposed the fraud of Carrière:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss Eva prepared the heads before every séance, and endeavoured to make them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one. In spite of all her endeavours, she could not obliterate certain characteristic lines.&lt;ref name="Brandon 1983"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carrière used cut out faces of [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|King Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], French president [[Raymond Poincaré]], and the actress Mona Delza.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-1573920216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1954, Rudolf Lambert, an SPR member, published details of fraud which had been covered up by many early members of the [[Institute Metapsychique International]] (IMI).&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"&gt;Sofie Lachapelle.

Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 144-145. {{ISBN|978-1421400136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert had studied [[Gustav Geley]]'s files on Eva Carrière, and discovered photographs taken by her companion Juliette Bisson depicting fraudulent [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]].&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"/&gt; Various "materializations" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. Geley never published his discovery. [[Eugéne Osty]], the director of the institute, and members Jean Meyer, [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]] and [[Charles Richet]] all knew about the fraudulent photographs, but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena, so demanded the scandal be kept secret.&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"/&gt;

'''Guillaume Postel''' (25 March 1510 – 6 September 1581) was a French linguist, astronomer, [[Christian Kabbalah|Cabbalist]], diplomat, professor, and religious universalist.

Born in the village of [[Barenton]] in [[Normandy]], Postel made his way to [[Paris]] to further his education. While studying at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe]], he became acquainted with [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and many of the men who would become the founders of the [[Company of Jesus]], retaining a lifelong affiliation with them.

==Diplomacy and scholarship==
Postel was adept at [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and other [[Semitic languages]], as well as the Classical languages of [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]], and soon came to the attention of the French court.

===Travel to the Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Note of Postel on an Arabic astronomical manuscript in 1436 in Constantinople.jpg|thumb|left|Note of Guillaume Postel on the Arabic astronomical manuscript of [[al-Kharaqī]], ''Muntahā al-idrāk fī taqāsīm al-aflāk'' ("The Ultimate Grasp of the Divisions of Spheres"), 1536, [[Constantinople]]]]
In 1536, when [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] sought a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] with the [[Ottoman Turks]], he sent Postel as the official interpreter of the French embassy of [[Jean de La Forêt]] to the Turkish [[sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in [[Constantinople]].

Postel was also apparently assigned to gather interesting Eastern manuscripts for the royal library, today housed in the collection of oriental manuscripts at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris.

[[File:De La Republique des Turcs Guillaume Postel Poitiers 1560.jpg|thumb|''De la République des Turcs'', Guillaume Postel, [[Poitiers]], 1560]]
In ''Linguarum Duodecim Characteribus Differentium Alphabetum Introductio'' (''An Introduction to the Alphabetic Characters of Twelve Different Languages''), published in 1538, Postel became the first scholar to recognize the inscriptions on [[Judea]]n coins from the period of the [[Great Jewish Revolt]] as Hebrew written in the ancient "[[Samaritan]]" characters.&lt;ref name=Madden/&gt;

In 1543, Postel published a criticism of Protestantism, and highlighted parallels between [[Islam and Protestantism]] in ''Alcorani seu legis Mahometi et Evangelistarum concordiae liber'' ("The book of concord between the Coran and the Evangelicals").&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism in early modern France'', by Ina Baghdianitz McCabe, {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, in ''De orbis terrae concordia'', (''Concerning the Harmony of the Earth''), Postel advocated a [[universalist]] world religion. The thesis of the book was that all [[Jew]]s, [[Muslims]] and heathens could be converted to the Christian religion once all of the religions of the world were shown to have common foundations and that [[Christianity]] best represented these foundations. He believed these foundations to be the love of God, the praising of God, the love of Mankind, and the helping of Mankind.

In his ''De la République des Turcs'' (''Of the Turkish Republic'') Postel makes a rather positive description of the Ottoman society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWk4C0rV0fgC&amp;pg=PA21 ''Veiled encounters: representing the Orient in 17th-century French travel'' by Michael Harrigan p.21]&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1553 ''Des merveilles du monde et principalemẽt des admirables choses des Indes &amp; du noveau monde'' is one of the earliest European descriptions of [[religion in Japan]]. He interprets Japanese religion in terms of his universalist views on religion, claiming that the indigenous Japanese religion was a form of [[Christianity]] and that one could still find evidence of their worship of [[crucifix|crucifixes]].&lt;ref name="Josephson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=59-60|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo13657764.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such claims about Japanese religion were common in Europe at the time; Postel's writings may have influenced [[Francis Xavier]]'s expectations of Japan as he traveled there.&lt;ref name="Josephson"/&gt;

Postel was also a relentless advocate for the unification of all Christian churches, a common concern during the period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and remarkably tolerant of other faiths during a time when such tolerance was unusual. This tendency led him to work with the Jesuits in Rome and then Venice, but the incompatibility of their beliefs with his prevented his full membership in their order.

===Cosmographer and Cartographer===
[[File:Guillaume Postel CHASDIA seu Australis terra.jpg|thumb|''CHASDIA seu Australis terra, quam Vulgus nautarum di fuego vocant alii Papagallorum dicunt'' (Chasdia or Terra Australis, which the common sailors call Tierra del Fuego and others say is the Land of the Parrots). Part of Guillaume Postel, ''Polo aptata Nova Charta Universi,'' 1578, inscribed: ''Ce quart de globe, ou demy Hémisphere contient dedans sa longitude clxxx degrès [180º], partie Australle de l'Atlantide dicte Peru ou America par Americ Vespuce Florentin son inventeur, et davantage une partie de la Chasdia or terre Australle vers les Isles Mologa ou Moluques'' (This quarter of the globe, or half hemisphere contains within its 180 degrees of longitude, the Austral part of Atlantis called Peru or America after Amerigo Vespucci its discoverer, and furthermore a part of Chasdia or Terra Australis toward the Mologa or Moluccas Islands). Service historique de la Marine, fonds du service hydrographique, recueil no.1, carte no.10; Brazil, Ministério de Relaçiões Exteriores, Rio de Janeiro, 193-3.]]
Postel is believed to have spent the years 1548 to 1551 on another trip to the East, traveling to the [[Holy Land]] and [[Syria]] to collect manuscripts. After this trip, he earned the appointment of Professor of Mathematics and Oriental Languages at the [[Collège de France|Collège Royal]]. He took an interest in geography in his course of lectures at the Collège Royal from 1537. In 1557, he published a short compendium under the name, ''De Universitate Liber'', perhaps inspired by that of [[Henricus Glareanus]] (1527). This geographer had drawn two polar projections which remained in manuscript. Postel enlarged his treatise in the ''Cosmographicae Disciplinae Compendium'', published in Basel by Oporinus in 1561, in which he set out clearly his ideas on the five continents: Asia-''Sem'', Africa-''Cham'' or ''Chamesia'', ''Iapetia'' or Europe and ''Atlantides''-America divided into ''boreal'' and ''austral'', separated from ''Chasdia'' or the Austral continent by the ''Fretum Martini Bohemi'' (Strait of Magellan). The ''Cosmographicae Disciplinae'' had an index of 600 names, which Postel put into his 1578 world map, ''Polo aptata Nova Charta Universi''.&lt;ref&gt;France, Service historique de la Marine, fonds du service hydrographique, recueil no.1, carte no.10; another copy Brazil, Ministério de Relaçiões Exteriores, Rio de Janeiro, 193-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He inscribed on it to the south of South America a legend reading: ''Ce quart de globe, ou demy Hémisphere contient dedans sa longitude clxxx degrès [180º], partie Australle de l'Atlantide dicte Peru ou America par Americ Vespuce Florentin son inventeur, et davantage une partie de la Chasdia or terre Australle vers les Isles Mologa ou Moluques (This quarter of the globe, or half hemisphere, contains within its 180 degrees of longitude the Austral part of Atlantis called Peru or America after Amerigo Vespucci its discoverer, and as well a part of Chasdia or Terra Australis toward the Mologa or Moluccas Islands).'' On his map, the ''Terre Australe'' is called ''Chasdia'' in three places: under Africa (''&lt;small&gt;CHASDIAE&lt;/small&gt; pars adhuc incognita''); under America ''(&lt;small&gt;CHASDIAE&lt;/small&gt;called residuum Atlantidis meridiana pars''); and under the Moluccas (&lt;small&gt;''CHASDIAE&lt;/small&gt; pars''), where it is joined to an unnamed New Guinea with its ''Rio S. Augustin''. Between South America and ''Chasdia'' is found the mention of the ''Fretum Martin Bohemi'' (Strait of [[Martin Behaim]]). ''Chasdia'' was a term forged by Postel: ''Chasdia qui est vers le Gond ou Pole Austral ainsi appellée à cause que de la Meridionale partie ou Australe procede la Misericorde dicte Chassed'' (Chasdia which is toward the austral Hinge or Pole, so called because from the southern or austral part originates Mercy called Chessed).&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Destombes, “Guillaume Postel cartographe”, in Günter Schilder, P. C. J. van der Krogt, Steven de Clercq  (eds.), ''Marcel Destombes, 1905-1983: contributions sélectionnées à l'histoire de la cartographie et des instruments scientifiques,'' Volume 3 of ''HES studies in the history of cartography and scientific instruments'', HES Publishers, 1987, pp.552-566, p.561.&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend on the same map over the southern continent reads: ''&lt;small&gt;CHASDIA&lt;/small&gt; seu Australis terra, quam Vulgus nautarum di fuego vocant alii Papagallorum dicunt'' (Chasdia or Terra Australis, which the common sailors call Tierra del Fuego and others say is the Land of the Parrots).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gilbert Dubois, ''Celtes et Gaulois,'' Paris, 1972, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt; Postel’s world map strongly influenced [[Gerard de Jode]] and others of the Antwerp school.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney W. Shirley, ''The Mapping of the World: Early Printed World Maps 1472-1700,'' Early Riverside, Conn., World Press, 2001, pp.166-7, pl.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near East and Central Europe===
[[File:Arabic astronomical manuscript of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi annotated by Guillaume Postel.jpg|thumb|Arabic astronomical manuscript of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], annotated by Guillaume Postel]]
After several years, however, Postel resigned his professorship and traveled all over Central Europe, including Austria and Italy, returning to France after each trip, often by way of [[Venice]]. Through his efforts at manuscript collection, translation, and publishing, he brought many Greek, Hebrew and Arabic texts into European intellectual discourse in the Late [[Renaissance]] and [[Early Modern]] periods. Among these texts are:

* [[Euclid's Elements]], in the version of the [[astronomer]] [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]];
* An astronomical work by [[al-Kharaqī]], ''Muntahā al-idrāk fī taqāsīm al-aflāk'' ("The Ultimate Grasp of the Divisions of Spheres"), disputing [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic science and the making of European Renaissance'', by George Saliba, p.218 {{ISBN|978-0-262-19557-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[astronomy|Astronomical]] works by al-Tusi and other Arabic astronomers, which may have influenced [[Copernicus]]'s theory of [[epicycles]];
* Latin translations of the ''[[Zohar]]'', the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', and the ''[[Bahir|Sefer ha-Bahir]]'', the fundamental works of Jewish [[Kabbalah]], printed in 1552, predating the first Hebrew printing of these works by ten years;{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* as well as other Cabbalistic texts, such as his own commentary on the Cabbalistic significance of the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], which he published in 1548 in Latin and subsequently in Hebrew.

===Two aspects of the soul===
To Postel, the human soul is composed of intellect and emotion, which he envisages as male and female, head and heart. And the soul's [[Triple deity|triadic]] [[wikt:unity|unity]] is through the union of these two halves. 
&lt;blockquote&gt; The mind by its purity makes good errors of the heart, but the generosity of the heart must rescue the egoistic barrenness of the brain.... Religion to the majority is superstition based in fear, and those who profess such have not the woman-heart, because they are foreign to the divine enthusiasms of that mother-love which explains all religion. The power that has invaded the brain and binds the spirit is not that of the good, understanding and long-suffering God; it is wicked, imbecilic and cowardly.... The frozen and shriveled brain weighs on the dead heart like a tombstone. What an awakening will it be for understanding, what a rebirth for reason, what a victory for truth, when the heart shall be raised by [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]! ... The sublime grandeurs of the spirit of love will be taught by the maternal genius of religion.  The Word has been made man, but the world will be saved when the Word shall have been made woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Yet Postel did not mean a second [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of divinity, his sentiment and language make it clear that he spoke [[Figure of speech|figuratively]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eliphas Levi]] ''Histoire de la Magie'', 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heresy and confinement===
[[File:Guillaume Postel.jpg|thumb|right|Guillaume Postel]]

While working on his translations of the Zohar and the Bahir in Venice in 1547, Postel became the confessor of "Mother" Zuana, an elderly woman who was responsible for the kitchen of the hospital of San Giovanni e Paolo. Zuana confessed to experiencing divine visions, which inspired Postel to believe that she was a prophet, that he was her spiritual son, and that he was destined to be the unifier of the world's religions. When he returned from his second journey to the East, he dedicated two works to her memory: ''Les Très Merveilleuses Victoire des Femmes du Nouveau Monde'' and ''La Vergine Venetiana''.

Based on his own visions, these works brought Postel into conflict with the [[Inquisition]]. Postel's ties, however, with the very men tasked with trying him led to a verdict of insanity, rather than [[heresy]], which carried the death penalty, and consequently Postel was confined to the [[Pope|Papal]] prisons in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Yvelise Bernard, L'Orient du XVIe siècle, Paris, L'Harmattan 1988. see her annotated biography pp 31-37&lt;/ref&gt; He was released when the prison was opened upon the death of [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] in 1559. [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Šimon Proxenus ze Sudetu]] (1532–1575),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Proxenus ze Sudetu |first= Šimon |editor-first= Dana |editor-last= Martínková |title= Commentarii de itinere Francogallico |series= Bibliotheca scriptorum Medii Recentisque Aevorum, ser. nova, t. 5 |year= 1979 |publisher= Akadémiai Kiadó |location= Budapest |language= Latin |isbn= 978-963-05-1843-7 |oclc= 7736635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that in 1564 Postel was detained to the monastery of St. Martin des Champs in Paris, ''en raison de son délire sur la Mère Jeanne'', or because of his delusions on the Mother Jeanne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Secret  |first= François  |title= Postel revisité: nouvelles recherches sur Guillaume Postel et son milieu |year= 1998 |publisher= S.É.H.A.|location= Paris |language= French |isbn= 978-88-7252-187-8 |oclc= 123291208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postel resumed his life in Paris, but the [[Nicole Aubrey|Miracle at Laon]] in 1566 had a profound effect on him, and that year he published an account of it, ''De summopere considerando miraculo'', in which he again expounded upon the interrelatedness of all parts of the universe and his imminent restoration of the world order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2543605|last1 = Kuntz|first1 = Marion Leathers|title = Guillaume Postel et Jean Boulaese: De Summopere (1566) et le Miracle de Laon (1566)|journal = Sixteenth Century Journal|volume = 28|issue = 4|pages = 1355|doi = 10.2307/2543605|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he was sentenced to house arrest by the [[parlement of Paris]], and eventually spent the last eleven years of his life confined to the monastery of [[Musée des Arts et Métiers|St. Martin des Champs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4629">Hinduism is followed in the Martinique by a small fraction of [[Indo-Martiniquais]].As of 2007,Hinduism constitute 0.3% of the population of Martinique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmap.org/uploads/9/3/4/4/9344303/martinique_profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;But according to other sources it is as high as 5%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?250810-Martinique&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the abolition of [[slavery]] in 1848, plantation owners filled their need for laborers by importing [[India]]ns from [[Indian subcontinent|the subcontinent]], starting in 1853.  These immigrants brought with them their Hindu religion. Many Hindu [[temple]]s are still in use in Martinique and, in 1987, a personal description of their secret ceremonies was published by a Hindu participant.

The symbols, gestures and myths of Hinduism were an important inspiration to the French artist [[Paul Gauguin]], who visited Martinique in 1887.

==Demographics==
Though [[Indo-Martiniquais]]  comprises approximately 10% of the population of the island of [[Martinique]],only a few 15% of them are still Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/19731/MB&lt;/ref&gt;.

As of 2007,Hinduism constitute 0.3% of the population of Martinique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmap.org/uploads/9/3/4/4/9344303/martinique_profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; But according to other sources it is as high as 5%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theapricity.com/forum/showthread.php?250810-Martinique&lt;/ref&gt;It is to be noted that the Hindus and
quimboiseurs(another religion in Martinique) considers themselves also to be Catholic due to the lack of connection with the Hindus worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Martinique.html&lt;/ref&gt; Maldevidan Spiritists is a syncretic religion in Martinique which combine aspects of the Hindu religion with 
Catholicism associating the principal deity, Maldevidan([[Madurai Veeran]]), with Jesus Christ and the second 
most important deity, Mari-eman([[Mariamman]]), with the Virgin Mary. This is common in the northern 
regions of the island with many shrines and gathering places throughout the region. 
Rituals include playing drums, dancing on sharpened machettes, and sacrificing animals 
such as cocks and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmap.org/uploads/9/3/4/4/9344303/martinique_profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Status==
The Hinduism in Martinique constitutes of a variation of popular Tamil Hinduism, which was characterized by the practice of animal sacrifice, the veneration of village deities and the use of the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] language as the ceremonial language, although the language has lost its usage in the plantation and post-plantation society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=XOyYCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;lpg=PA356&amp;dq=hinduism+in+martinique&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dR56Y-sXEV&amp;sig=Cipo7sOHplj9WTknYzp3RDQmCrU&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdh-WY_bPRAhUQKywKHTbnAaQQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=hinduism%20in%20martinique&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions: Volume 1: A - L; Volume 2: M - Z|last=Taylor|first=Patrick|last2=Case|first2=Frederick I.|date=2013-04-30|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252094330|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hinduism in Wales''' is of relatively recent provenance, with under half of [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Hinduism|Hindus]] having settled there in the second half of the 20th century. There were 10,434 Hindus in Wales in the 2011 Census, almost double the number in the 2001 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262|publisher=ons.gov.uk|accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Most Welsh Hindus are of [[India]]n origin, or at least from neighbouring countries, such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]]. Many of these came after [[Idi Amin]]'s expulsion from [[Uganda]] in the 1970s, and some also came from [[South Africa]]. There are also a few of [[Indonesia]]n origin. 

Many of these in turn are from the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. Common languages amongst them, other than [[English language|English]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] include [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]].

The Hindu Cultural Association (HCA Wales), established in March 1991, is a Registered Charity with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]. It is run by the Indian community in Wales and aims to both serve the pan-Indian community as well as helping the integration of the Indian community into the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiacentre.co.uk/aboutus.html About us] indiacentre.co.uk, accessed 22 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples and sites==
[[Skanda Vale]] is a Hindu monastic centre, based in [[Llanpumsaint]], [[Carmarthenshire]]. The site is dedicated to temple is dedicated to Lord [[Murugan|Subramanya]], and is made up of three temples. It attracts around 70,000 devotees annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff|page=503 |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The largest Hindu temple in Wales, the [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Cardiff|Shri Swaminarayan Mandir]], is located in [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]], Cardiff. A [[Swaminarayan temple]] it was first opened in 1982.

The Sanatan Dharma Mandal Temple established in 1985 originally in the Parade Cardiff to serve Hindus in South Wales.

In English translations of [[Buddhist texts]], '''householder''' denotes a variety of terms. Most broadly, it refers to any layperson, and most narrowly, to a wealthy and prestigious familial patriarch.&lt;ref&gt;In regards to the narrower definition of what today is often translated from the Pali Canon as "householder," see, for instance, the description of ''{{IAST|gṛhaspati}}'' in Nattier (2003), pp. 22-25.  For more information, see [[#note-2|Note 3]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contemporary Buddhist communities, householder is often used synonymously with ''[[laity]]'', or non-[[monasticism|monastics]].

The Buddhist notion of householder is often contrasted with that of wandering ascetics ({{lang-pi|{{IAST|Pāḷi}}}}: ''{{IAST|samaṇa}}''; [[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|[[śramaṇa]]}}'') and [[Buddhist monasticism|monastics]] (''[[bhikkhu]]'' and ''[[bhikkhuni]]''), who would not live (for extended periods) in a normal house and who would pursue freedom from attachments to houses and families. 

[[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|Upāsakas and upāsikās]], also called [[śrāvaka|śrāvakas and śrāvikās]] - are householders and other laypersons who [[refuge (Buddhism)|take refuge]] in the Three Jewels (the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the [[Dharma|teachings]] and the [[sangha|community]]) and practice the [[Five Precepts]].  In southeast Asian communities, lay disciples also [[Alms#Buddhism|give alms]] to monks on their daily rounds and observe weekly [[uposatha]] days. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of ethical conduct and  [[dāna]] or "almsgiving" will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely even if there is no further "Noble" Buddhist practice (connected with the Supramundane goal of Nibbana, "Unbinding"). This level of attainment is viewed as a proper aim for laypersons.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some traditional Buddhist societies, such as in [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]], people transition between householder and monk and back to householder with regularity and celebration as in the practice of [[shinbyu]] among the [[Bamar people]].&lt;ref&gt;In [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7014173.stm Buckley (2007)], a BBC News article describing Burma's monks, the subheading includes: "...even those who do not choose to become a 'career monk' usually enter the orders for short periods of their lives...." In addition, the article's initial source is a BBC Burmese service professional who mentions that during his adult life he himself entered monastic life three times, each time for a few weeks.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the evolving features of Buddhism in the West is the increasing dissolution of the traditional distinction between monastics and laity.
{{quote|For all the diversity of Buddhist practices in the West, general trends in the recent transformations of Buddhist practice ... can be identified. These include an erosion of the distinction between professional and lay Buddhists; a decentralization of doctrinal authority; a diminished role for Buddhist monastics; an increasing spirit of egalitarianism; greater leadership roles for women; greater social activism; and, in many cases, an increasing emphasis on the psychological, as opposed to the purely religious, nature of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Wallace|authorlink1=The Spectrum of Buddhist Practice in the West|editor1-last=Prebish|editor1-first=Charles S.|title=Westward dharma : Buddhism beyond Asia|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley [u.a.]|isbn=0-520-22625-9|page=35|url=http://www.alanwallace.org/The%20Spectrum%20of%20Buddhist%20Practice.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theravada perspectives==
{{Peoplepalicanon}}
{{Buddhism}}
In the [[Pāli Canon]], householders received diverse advice from the Buddha and his disciples.

Core householder practices include undertaking the Five Precepts and taking refuge in the Three Jewels.  In addition, the canon nurtures the essential bond between householders and monastics still apparent today in southeast Asian communities.

===Who is a householder?===
In traditional Indian society, a householder (Sanskrit ''[[grihastha|gṛhastin]]'') is typically a settled adult male with a family. In the Pali canon, various Pali words have been translated into the English word "householder", including '''agārika''', '''gahapati''', '''gahattha''' and '''gihin'''.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Pali Text Society]]'s (PTS) "Pali-English Dictionary" provides the following definitions for these various householder-related Pali words (listed alphabetically below):
* &lt;u&gt;agārika&lt;/u&gt; - "having a house..., householder, layman," juxtaposed with ''[[anagarika|anagārika]]''.  Similarly, ''agārikā'' is translated as "housewife." (PTS, 1921-25, p. 3, entry for ''agārika''.)
* &lt;u&gt;[[gahapati]]&lt;/u&gt; - "the possessor of a house, the head of the household, ''[[pater familias]]''," often with a social status similar to high-ranking personages (Pali, ''khattiyā'') and [[brahmins]], suggesting comfort and wealth; may be used as a form of address comparable to "Sir." (PTS, 1921-25, p. 248, entry for ''gahapati''.)  See also Buddhadatta, 2002, p. 96, where "gaha-ttha" is defined as "a layman; householder" and "gaha-pati" is defined as "master of a house"; and, Nattier (2003), pp. 22-25, which provides contextual information to support its conclusion: "The word ''{{IAST|gṛhapati}}'' [Sanskrit for the Pali ''gahapati''] is thus not an indicator of simple householder status but rather of significant social and financial standing, and it would have been applied only to a relatively limited segment of the lay Buddhist population."
* &lt;u&gt;gahattha&lt;/u&gt; - "a householder, one who leads the life of a layman." (PTS, 1921-25, p. 247, entry for ''gaha'' with mention of use with the suffix ''-ttha.'')
* &lt;u&gt;gihin&lt;/u&gt; - "a householder, one who leads a domestic life, a layman." (PTS, 1921-25, p. 251, entry for ''gihin''.)

In the Pali canon, these terms for "householder" can be combined with some other appellations.  For instance, in the Sāleyyaka Sutta (MN 41), the Buddha is addressed by ''sāleyyakā brāhmana-gahapatikā'' which, for instance, is translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi (2005, p. 156) as "brahmin householders of Sālā."

Within the Pali canon, there is a "Householder section" (''Gahapativagga'') in the following [[nikaya]]s:
* the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN 51 to MN 60) (see Nanamoli &amp; Bodhi, 2001, pp. 441-519).
* the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] (SN 12.41 to SN 12.50) (see Bodhi, 2000, pp. 578-86, and, in the Sinhalese Tipitaka, http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/3Samyutta-Nikaya/Samyutta2/12-Abhisamaya-Samyutta/05-Gahapativaggo-e.html).
* the Anguttara Nikaya (AN 8.3) (see, in the Sinhalese Tipitaka, http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara5/8-atthakanipata/003-gahapativaggo-e.html).&lt;/ref&gt;
Vocations most often associated with householders in the Pali canon are those of guild foreman, banker and merchant (Pali, ''{{IAST|seṭṭhi}}'') but other vocations are mentioned such as farmer and carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;See PTS (1921–25) entries for "Gahapati" (p.&amp;nbsp;248; retrieved 2008-02-16 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1:1:1150.pali) and "{{IAST|Seṭṭhi}}" (p.&amp;nbsp;722; retrieved 2008-02-16 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:416.pali).&lt;/ref&gt;Gombrich (2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;56–7) states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Who were these people in terms of class or profession?  In the Canon, most of them evidently own land, but they usually have labourers to do the physical work.  Sometimes they are also in business.  In fact, they illustrate how it is in the first instance wealth derived from agriculture which provides business capital.  The average ''gahapati'' who gave material support to the Buddha and his Sangha thus seems to have been something like a gentleman farmer, perhaps with a town house.  On the other hand, inscriptions in the western Deccan, where Buddhism flourished in the early centuries CE, use the term ''gahapati'' to refer to urban merchants.  We must distinguish between reference and meaning: the meaning of ''gahapati'' is simple and unvarying, but the reference shifts with the social context.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other people in the canon who are sometimes identified as "householders" in contemporary translations are simply those individuals who dwelt in a home or who had not renounced "home life" (Pali, ''agārasmā'') for "homelessness" (Pali, ''anagāriya'').

===Householder ethics===
While there is no formal "householder discipline" in the [[vinaya]] or "code of ethics", the ''[[Sigalovada Sutta]]'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 31)&lt;ref&gt;DN 31 is translated in Narada (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; has been referred to as "the Vinaya of the householder" (''gihi-vinaya'').&lt;ref&gt;This epithet is attributed to [[Buddhaghosa]] in Narada (1995) and is referenced in Bodhi (2005), p. 109; Hinüber (2000), p. 31; and Law (1932-33), p. 85, ''n''. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[sutra|sutta]] includes:
* an enumeration of the Five Precepts
* an analysis of good-hearted (Pali: ''su-hada'') friends
* a description of respectful actions for one's parents, teachers, spouse, friends, workers and religious guides.

Similarly, in the "[[Dhammika Sutta]]" ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 2.14),&lt;ref&gt;Ireland (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha articulates the "layman's rule of conduct" (Pali, ''gahatthavatta''),&lt;ref&gt;PTS, p. 247, under the entry for "gaha (1)"&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
* the Five Precepts
* the [[Five Precepts#Eight Precepts|Eight Precepts]] for Uposatha days
* support of one's parents
* engaging in fair business.

The ''Mahanama sūtra'' has been called the "''locus classicus'' on the definition of ''upāsaka''."&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Views of the Buddhist Laity: Precepts and Upāsaka Status" by Giulio Agostini. PhD dissertation. Berkeley: 2004 pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; This sutra is preserved in five versions (two in Pali, three in Chinese) representing two different recensions, one in the ''Samyuktagama/Samyuttanikaya'', the other in the ''Anguttaranikaya'' and in the ''Samyuktagama'' and further developed in the ''Abhidharmaskandha'', one of the canonical books of the Sarvastivadin Abhidharma.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Views of the Buddhist Laity: Precepts and Upāsaka Status" by Giulio Agostini. PhD dissertation. Berkeley: 2004 pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; In this sutra the Buddha defines an upāsaka in terms of faith (''śraddhā''), morality (''śīla''), liberality (''[[tyāga]]''), and wisdom (''prajñā''), as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Views of the Buddhist Laity: Precepts and Upāsaka Status" by Giulio Agostini. PhD dissertation. Berkeley: 2004 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;
* "One produces a deep thought of faith toward the Tathagata and is established in faith. He never lacks faith or is evil towards śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, or deva, or māra, or brahmā. This is called the faith of an upāsaka."
* "Not to kill, not to steal, not to seduce, not to lie, and not to drink liquor, etc. This is called the morality of an upāsaka".
* "It is a rule (dharma) for an upāsaka that he should abandon stinginess. As for all living beings, without exception, stinginess, and envy are destroyed by him. Therefore, his mind should be devoid of stinginess and envy, and he should produce thoughts of liberality and personally donate, tirelessly. This is called 'possessed of liberality.'"
* "An upāsaka knows suffering according to reality, knows the collection  of suffering according to reality, knows the extinction of suffering according to reality, and knows the path to the extinction of suffering according to reality. He understands with certainty. This is called 'possessed of wisdom.'"

Some early schools, particularly the [[Sautrāntika]], allowed for ''aparipūrṇa-upāsaka'' (partial lay vow holders), who took anywhere from one to four of the śīla observances.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Views of the Buddhist Laity: Precepts and Upāsaka Status" by Giulio Agostini. PhD dissertation. Berkeley: 2004 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suttas in the canon likewise underline keeping the precepts, maintaining virtuous friends, homage to one's benefactors and earning one's wealth honestly.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the [[Dighajanu Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the [[Sutta Pitaka]] the Buddha provides moral instruction to householders and their family members&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 31, the Buddha addresses "Sigalaka the householder's son" (Bodhi, 2005, pp. 116-8).&lt;/ref&gt; on how to be good parents, spouses and children.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, additional examples in Narada (1995) and in Bodhi (2005)'s chapter, "The Happiness Visible in this Present Life," pp. 107-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddha's advice to Buddhist laywomen is contained mostly in the Anguttara Nikaya 8:49; IV 269-71. His advice was as follows:
*  Be capable at one's work
*  Work with diligence and skill
*  Manage domestic help skillfully (if relevant) and treat them fairly
*  Perform household duties efficiently
*  Be hospitable to one's husband's parents and friends
*  Be faithful to one's husband; protect and invest family earnings
*  Discharge responsibilities lovingly and conscientiously; accomplish faith (faith in the possibility of enlightenment, and of the enlightenment of the Buddha.)
*  Accomplish moral discipline (observe/practise the five precepts.)
*  Practise generosity (cultivate a mind free from stinginess or avarice; delight in charity, giving and sharing.)
*  Cultivate wisdom (Perceive the impermanence of all things.).

The Buddha also gave advice on householders' financial matters. In the Anguttara Nikaya (4.61; II 65-68) it is said that the Buddha stated that there are four worthy ways in which to spend one's wealth:
*  On the everyday maintenance of the happiness of oneself and one's family (as well as any employees, friends and co-workers);
*  On providing insurance (against losses from fire, floods, unloved heirs and misfortune generally);
*  By making offerings to relatives, guests, ancestors ( offerings to ancestors are traditionally made, in a respectful Halloween type ritual, throughout Buddhist countries on [[Bon Festival|Ullambana]], in the eighth lunar month – around October. Food offerings and good deeds are done in order to relieve the sufferings of hungry ghosts and to help rescue one's ancestors from the lower realms, to secure rebirth for them in higher realms. Many people visit cemeteries to make offerings to departed ancestors), the ruler and the [[deva (Buddhism)|devas]] (note that worshipping Devas will not bring you closer to enlightenment but it may give you some kind of material advantage);
*  By providing alms to monks and nuns who are devoted to the attainment of nibbana. In the Digha Nikaya (III) the Buddha is said to have advised Sigala, a young man, that he should spend one fourth of his income on daily expenses, invest half in his business and put aside one fourth as insurance against an emergency.

===Lay-monastic reciprocity===
Some suttas suggest that Buddhist renunciates are best going it alone.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[Rhinoceros Sutta]] ([[Sutta Nipata|Snp]] 1.3) (Thanissaro, 1997) has the frequent cautionary refrain: "wander alone like a rhinoceros."&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others celebrate and provide instruction for a vital reciprocity between householders and monastics.  For instance, in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]],&lt;ref&gt;Itivuttaka 4.8 (Thanissaro, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha articulates that "brahmins and householders" (Pali, ''brāhmanagahapatikā'') support monks by providing monks with robes, [[Alms#Buddhism|alms food]], lodgings and medicine while monks teach brahmins and householders the [[Dhamma]].  In this sutta, the Buddha declares:
:Householders &amp; the homeless [monastics]
:in mutual dependence
:both reach the true Dhamma:
:the unsurpassed safety from bondage.&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Householders &amp; future lives===
In the Pali canon, the pursuit of Nibbana (Skt: ''Nirvana'') within this lifetime usually starts with giving up the householder life.  This is due to the householder life's intrinsic attachments to a home, a spouse, children and the associated wealth necessary for maintaining the household.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a recurrent refrain attributed to the Buddha in the nikāyas is:

:"Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open.  It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell." (MN 36, "The Greater Discourse to Saccaka," trans. {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} &amp;amp; Bodhi, 2001, p. 335, para. 12.)
In Pali:
:{{IAST|''Abbhokāso pabbajjā. Nayidaṃ sukaraṃ agāraṃ ajjhāvasatā ekantaparipuṇṇaṃ ekantaparisuddhaṃ saṃkhalikhitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ.''}}
This refrain is also found in [[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 4, DN 6, [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 27, MN 38, MN 51, MN 60, MN 76, MN 79, MN 94, MN 100, MN 101, MN 125, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 4.1.11, SN 11.1.6, [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.4.5.8, and AN 10.2.5.9.

More poetically, one finds in the ''Muni Sutta'' ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1.12), verse 14 (trans. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.12.than.html Thanissaro, 1996]):
:As the crested,
:blue-necked peacock,
:when flying,
::never matches
:the wild goose
:in speed:
::Even so the householder
::never keeps up with the monk,
:the sage secluded,
::doing [[Jhana in Theravada|jhana]]
::in the forest.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, instead of advising householders to relinquish these and all attachments as a prerequisite for the complete liberation from [[samsara]] in this lifetime, the Buddha instructed householders on how to achieve "well-being and happiness" (''hita-[[sukha]]'') in this and [[rebirth (Buddhism)|future lives]] in a spiritually meaningful way. 

In Buddhism, a householder's spiritual path is often conceived of in terms of making [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] (Pali: ''puñña'').  The primary bases for meritorious action in Buddhism are generosity (''dāna''), ethical conduct (''sīla'') and mental development (''bhāvanā'').  Traditional Buddhist practices associated with such behaviors are summarized in the table below.

{{LayTheravadaRebirth}}

===Householders &amp; Nibbana===
The [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (AN 6.119 and AN 6.120)&lt;ref&gt;In an on-line English-language [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[Tipitaka]], these suttas are identified as AN 6.12.3 and 6.12.4 respectively, and are available at http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara4/6-chakkanipata/012-samannavaggo-e.html.  An on-line Pali-language version of these Sinhalese suttas, identified as AN 6.2.17 through 6.2.34 (with a separate verse for each ''gahapati''), are available at http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara4/6-chakkanipata/012-samannavaggo-p.html.  In the [[Pali Text Society|PTS]] edition of the tipitaka, these passages are identified as [[Anguttara Nikaya|A]].iii, 450-51.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies 19 householders (''gahapati'')&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika &amp; Hecker (2003), p. 365, state that AN 6.120 refers to 21 "eminent lay disciples."  The actual Pali text itself explicitly identifies 18 householders (''gahapati'') and three lay disciples (''[[upasaka]]''; see also, ''[[Sravaka|savaka]]''); nonetheless, many of these identified householders are also identified as "foremost" (''agga'') lay disciples in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 1.14.[http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara1/1-ekanipata/014-Etadaggapali-e.html]  Tangentially, Bodhi (2005), p. 226, notes that a lay disciple is able to achieve the state of [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|nonreturner]] but is not able to achieve [[Arhat|arahantship]] unless upon death or, after realizing such, they immediately become monastics.&lt;/ref&gt; who have "attained perfection" or, according to an alternate translation, "attained to certainty" (''ni{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hamgata'') and "seen [[nibbana|deathlessness]], seen deathlessness with their own eyes" (''amataddaso, {{IAST|amataṃ}} sacchikata'').&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi's translation of [[Samyutta Nikaya]], chapter 43, where ''amata'' ("deathlessness" or "the deathless") and ''nibbana'' are synonyms (Bodhi, 2005, pp. 364-5).&lt;/ref&gt; These householders are endowed (''samannāgato'') with six things (''chahi dhammehi''):
* unwavering [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] (''aveccappasādena'') in the Buddha
* unwavering faith in the [[Dharma|Dhamma]]
* unwavering faith in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]&lt;ref&gt;These first three objects of faith — the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha — are known in Buddhism as the Three Jewels.  In the Pali Canon, in general, ''sangha'' (without an explicit modifier or other contextual information) can refer to either the community of monks (see [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) or the community of noble disciples (see [[sravaka]] and [[arhat]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* noble [[Śīla|moral discipline]] (''ariyena sīlena'')
* noble [[Wisdom in Buddhism|knowledge or wisdom]] (''ariyena ñānena'')
* noble [[bodhi|release]] (''ariyāya vimuttiyā'')

While some interpret this passage to indicate that these householders have attained [[arhat]]ship, others interpret it to mean they have attained at least "stream entry" ([[sotāpanna]]) but not final release.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Robinson &amp; Johnson (1970/1982), p.&amp;nbsp;41:
:The early teaching admitted that laypersons could attain the first three degrees of sainthood (stream-winner, once-returner, and non-returner); but whether they could become arhants was a disputed point.  The Buddha reportedly declared that he took no categorical stand, that with the laity as with the monks it is conduct that counts. The Sūtras list twenty lay followers who attained the highest goal without ever becoming monks.  Their case, though, is rarer than that of monks becoming arhants, and the household life is not considered propitious for the highest attainment.
For an example of an alternate view, see Mendis (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;185, ''n''. 64):
:A famous passage at [[Anguttara Nikaya|A]].iii, 450-51 is often held to provide evidence for lay persons attaining arahantship and continuing to remain as householders, but such an interpretation is erroneous, based on mistaking the expression ''{{IAST|niṭṭhaṅgata}}'' to mean 'attained the goal,' when it actually means 'attained to certainty' and signifies a stream-enterer or one at some other [[Four stages of enlightenment|grade of noble attainment]] short of arhatship.&lt;/ref&gt;  The para-canonical [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañha]] adds:
:"...[F]or a householder who has attained arahantship: either, that very day, he goes forth into homelessness or he attains final Nibbāna.  That day is not able to pass without one or other of these events taking place." ([[Milinda Panha|Miln]]. VII, 2)&lt;ref&gt;Mendis (2001), p. 119.  Mendis (2001), p. 185, ''n''. 64, further notes:
:This statement is not found as such in the canonical texts, but the idea it expresses seems to be based on the few instances recorded in the Suttas of lay persons attaining arahantship.  In such cases the lay person either immediately seeks admission into the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Order]], as in the case of Yasa ([[Vinaya|Vin]].i,17) or is a householder on the verge of death, as in the case mentioned at [[Samyutta Nikaya|S]].V,410...."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta (MN 71 / M I.483) the Buddha is asked by the ascetic Vacchagotta "is there any householder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdship, on the dissolution of the body has made an end to suffering?"  The Buddha replied "there is no householder who, without abandoning the fetter of householdship, on the dissolution of the body has made an end to suffering." &lt;ref&gt;The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha. A 
Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya.  Bhikkhu Ñanamola and Bhikkhu Bodhi pg. 588&lt;/ref&gt;

Attaining the state of [[anāgāmi]] or "non-returner" is portrayed in the early texts as the ideal goal for laity.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Shaw, author of ''Buddhist Meditation: An Anthology of Texts from the Pāli Canon''. Routledge, 2006. [www.vesakday.net/vesak50/article/pdf_file/13_Buddhist_%20Meditation_Practices_West.pdf], page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prominent householders in the Pali canon===
The following are examples of individuals who are explicitly identified as a "householder" in multiple suttas:
* '''[[Anathapindika]]''', is referenced for instance in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 1.14.249 as "the householder Sudatta, the foremost lay devotee."&lt;ref&gt;In an on-line English-language Sinhalese Tipitaka, see http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara1/1-ekanipata/014-Etadaggapali-e.html.  Also see, Nyanaponika &amp; Hecker (2003), pp. 337-62.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Citta]]''', referenced for instance in AN 1.14.250 as "the [foremost] householder for explaining the Teaching."&lt;ref&gt;In an on-line English-language Sinhalese Tipitaka, see http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/4Anguttara-Nikaya/Anguttara1/1-ekanipata/014-Etadaggapali-e.html. Also see, Nyanaponika &amp; Hecker (2003), pp. 365-72.&lt;/ref&gt;  In SN 17.23, Citta is one of two male lay disciples identified for emulation by the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;688.  This sutta is entitled, "Only Son," and in it the Buddha states:
:"A faithful female lay follower, rightly imploring her only son, dear and beloved, might implore him thus: 'Dear, you should become like Citta the householder and [[Hatthaka of Alavaka]] — for this is the standard and criterion for my male disciples who are lay followers...."&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nakulapita''' and '''Nakulamata''', referenced for instance in AN 1.14.257 and AN 1.14.266, respectively, as "the best confident" and the foremost "for undivided pleasantness."&lt;ref&gt;Also see AN 4.55 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 121-2, 433 ''n''. 3.  Note that, technically, Nakulapita is identified as the "householder" and, his spouse, Nakulamata as the "householder's wife."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other individuals who are not explicitly identified in the suttas as "householder" but who, by the aforementioned broader criteria, might be considered a householder include:
* '''Ghatikara''' was a potter in the time of the [[Kassapa Buddha]]. He was an ''anāgāmi'' and his chief supporter. ([http://www.vipassana.info/081-ghatikara-e1.htm MN 81]).

==Mahayana perspectives==
The [[Sigalovada Sutta]] has a parallel Chinese text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w3.cbeta.org/result/normal/T01/0001_011.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. 1, No. 1, Sutra 16 (佛說長阿含第二分善生經第十二)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few differences between the Pali and Chinese versions.  Further discussion of householder duties is found in the fourteenth chapter of the Sutra on Upasaka Precepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/T24/T24n1488.htm |title=Taisho Tripitaka Vol. T24, No. 1488 (優婆塞戒經)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dogen]] recommended that householders meditate at least five minutes each day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aszc.org/abbot/2000_Sept.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zen]] tradition, [[Vimalakirti|Vimalakīrti]] and [[Layman Pang|Páng Yùn]] were prominent householders/laypersons who achieved enlightenment.

==Vajrayana perspectives==
The Vajrayana tradition has produced many prominent householders including [[Marpa Lotsawa]], [[Dromtön]], the heart son of [[Atiśa]], and [[Padmasambhava]]. to mention a few.

The [[ngagpa]] ({{bo|w=sngags pa}}. feminine ''ngagma'', {{bo|w=sngags ma}}) is an ordained Tantric practitioner, sometimes a householder with certain vows (dependent upon lama and lineage) that make them the householder equivalent of a monk or nun. The path of a ngakpa is a rigorous discipline whereby one "enjoys the sense-fields' as a part of one's practice. A practitioner utilizes the whole of the phenomenal world as one's path. Marrying, raising children, working jobs, leisure, art, play etc. are all means to realize the enlightened state or [[rigpa]], non-dual awareness. As such, we can see the prominence of householders in the Vajrayana tradition.  One can, however, be a householder without taking the vows of a ngagpa. Simply holding the five precepts, bodhisattva vows and the tantric vows while practising diligently can result in enlightenment.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

==Contemporary Buddhist householder practices==
Below common contemporary lay Buddhist practices are summarized.  Some of these practices — such as taking Refuge and meditating — are common to all major schools.  Other practices — such as taking the Eight Precepts or the Bodhisattva Vows — are not pan-Buddhist.

&lt;u&gt;Daily practice:&lt;/u&gt; [[Prostration (Buddhism)|prostrations]] to the [[Triple Gem]], taking [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] in the Triple Gem, taking the [[The Five Precepts|Five Precepts]], [[Buddhist chant|chanting]] other verses, [[Buddhist meditation|meditating]], [[Dana (Buddhism)|giving and sharing]] (Pali: ''dana'').

&lt;u&gt;Special day practices ([[Uposatha]]):&lt;/u&gt; practicing the [[Eight Precepts]], studying [[Buddhist scriptures]],
visiting and supporting [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]], visiting and supporting [[wat|Buddhist monasteries]].

&lt;u&gt;Other practices:&lt;/u&gt; undertaking a [[Pilgrimage (Buddhism)|pilgrimage]].

=== Mahayana practices ===
&lt;u&gt;Daily practices:&lt;/u&gt; Prostrations to the Triple Gem, taking refuge in the Triple Gem, taking the Five Precepts, chanting sutras and the names of buddhas/bodhisattvas, meditating, cultivating compassion and [[bodhichitta]], recitation of [[mantra]]s.

&lt;u&gt;Other practices:&lt;/u&gt; [[Bodhisattva vows]], going on a retreat.

=== Vajrayana practices ===
&lt;u&gt;Daily practices:&lt;/u&gt; Prostrations, refuge, cultivating compassion and [[bodhicitta]], [[bodhisattva vow]]s, tantric vows (if applicable), meditation in the form of Tantric [[sādhanā]]s (if applicable), purification techniques, recitation of [[mantra]]s

&lt;u&gt;Special day practices:&lt;/u&gt; Eight precepts, listening to teachings, offering ceremonies.

The '''Iowa Sisterhood''' was a group of women ministers who organized eighteen [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] societies in several [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states in the late 19th century and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hepokoski|first=Carol|title=Women Ministers in the Prairie Star District|url=http://www.psduua.org/heritage/bring/part1/1b_hepokoski.html|work=Bring, O Past, Your Honor|publisher=The Ministers Association of the Prairie Star District of the Unitarian Universalist Association|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Some of the first women ordained in the United States were [[Universalism|Universalist]] or Unitarian; however, the path for women ministers was not easy. Of those early women who achieved ordination, few were allowed to serve in full-time ministries.  Others were relegated to small, struggling parishes or assistant positions alongside their clergy husbands.  Despite the lack of encouragement, at the end of the 19th century a group of women claimed their role as ordained ministers.  Following the Women's Ministerial Conference organized by [[Julia Ward Howe]] in 1875, 21 Unitarian women founded the Iowa Sisterhood to serve churches throughout the Great Plains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uua.org/re/tapestry/adults/river/workshop9/178592.shtml|title=The Iowa Sisterhood|date=2011-10-26|work=UUA.org|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1880 and 1930, these women changed the course of Unitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uupm.org/services/iowa-sisterhood-lessons-on-membership/|title=Iowa Sisterhood: Lessons on Membership|last=|first=|date=|work=Unitarian Universalist Parish of Monson|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Iowa Sisterhood was led primarily by [[Mary Safford|Mary Augusta Safford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uudb.org/articles/maryaugustasafford.html Mary Augusta Safford]. Unitarian Universalist Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included [[Eleanor Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uudb.org/articles/eleanorelizabethgordon.html Eleanor Elizabeth Gordon].

Few male scholars from the seminaries of the East were attracted to the life [of the Plains states].  But if the Plains were beyond the recognition of an Eastern religious hierarchy, they were also remote from that hierarchy's rules and control.  It was a place where women were accepted for their willingness to step in and serve, for their tenacity in the face of hardship, and for their ministry.

One reason for the success of the Iowa Sisterhood was the non-academic, pastoral approach these women brought to their churches.  They sought to make their churches extensions of the domestic hearth, thereby expanding the traditional role of women beyond the home and into the church.  The Sisterhood brought family matters into the church ... seven days a week, with social events and classes on domestic arts.

Although [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], leader of the Unitarian Church's Western Conference, was a staunch ally of the Iowa Sisterhood, the success of these women and their churches did not translate into wider denominational acceptance.  The women were seen as an embarrassment among the [Unitarian] clergy back in Boston.  By the turn of the 20th century, society in general experienced a reassertion of male authority.  Unitarianism's leaders began a concerted return to a more manly ministry in order to revitalize the denomination.  The move of rural populations to the cities further undermined the Sisterhood's efforts and congregations.

Most of the women ministers were rushed into retirement.  Others left to pursue social justice work in peace, suffrage, and social work movements.  They remained vocal about the rights of women and the place of church in society.  It was not a large movement, nor was it long-lasting.  The Iowa Sisterhood did not radically alter the possibilities for women in Unitarian ministry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But ... it offered an example of women called to minister and men called to support their work.

{{Islam by country}}
{{Culture of Algeria}}

[[Islam]] is the majority religion in [[Algeria]]. The vast majority of citizens are [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] belonging to [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]], with a minority of [[Ibadi]], most of whom live in the [[M'zab]] Valley region.&lt;ref name="Morrow2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Morrow|title=Algeria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzWaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT82|date=21 October 2014|publisher=Mason Crest|isbn=978-1-63355-981-3|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam provides the society with its central social and cultural identity and gives most individuals their basic ethical and attitudinal orientation. Orthodox observance of the faith is much less widespread and steadfast than is identification with Islam. There are also [[Sufi]] philosophies which arose as a reaction to theoretical perspectives of some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sufisofalgeria.org/Eng_Ver_Sidi_Ali_al_Budilmi_Autobiography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Arrival of Islam===
: ''See: [[Medieval Muslim Algeria]]''
Islam was first brought to [[Algeria]] by the [[Umayyad]] dynasty following the invasion of [[Uqba ibn Nafi]], in a drawn-out process of conquest and conversion stretching from 670 to 711. The native [[Berber people|Berbers]] were rapidly converted in large numbers, although some [[Christian]] and probably [[paganism|pagan]] communities would remain at least until [[Almoravid]] times. However, as in the [[Middle East]] itself, they sought to combine their new Islam with resistance to the Caliphate's foreign rule - a niche which the [[Kharijite]] and [[Shiite]] "[[heresy|heresies]]" filled perfectly. By the late 8th century, most of Algeria was ruled by the [[Rustamid]]s, who professed the strictly puritanical but politically moderate [[Ibadhi]] sect and saw the [[Caliph]]s as immoral usurpers. They were destroyed by the [[Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s in 909, but their doctrine was re-established further south by refugees whose descendants would ultimately found the towns of the [[M'zab]] valley in the Algerian Sahara, where Ibadhism still dominates.

Though it convinced the [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]], the Fatimids' [[Ismaili]] doctrine remained unpopular in most of North Africa, and the Fatimids themselves abandoned Algeria for [[Egypt]] as soon as they could, leaving North Africa to a dynasty only nominally subject to them, the [[Zirid]]s. With the political threat of the Abbasid Caliphate gone, these soon reverted to [[Sunni]] Islam - specifically, the [[Maliki]] branch, whose popularity had spread widely in the [[Maghreb]]. The Fatimids took their revenge by sending the [[Bedouin]] [[Banu Hilal]] to wreak havoc on the region, but were incapable of controlling it; Shiism rapidly dwindled, and became virtually non-existent in the area.

The [[Almohad]]s were zealously orthodox, and under their rule Algeria gradually acquired its notable religious homogeneity. Sunni Islam and the Maliki ''[[madhhab]]'' became virtually universal, apart from the Ibadhis of the M'zab and small Jewish communities. 

Islam took longer to spread to the far south of Algeria, whose history is to a large extent separate: only in the 15th century were the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] finally converted to Islam.

During the [[Regency of Algiers|Regency]] period, unlike the Maliki Algerian masses, the Ottoman-Algerians remained affiliated with the Hanifi school of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="GordonOxnevad2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis A. Gordon|author2=Ian Oxnevad|title=Middle East Politics for the New Millennium: A Constructivist Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT2kDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|date=7 October 2016|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9698-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judicial system was headed by one mufti for each of the [[Madhhabs]] represented in the Regency. Major towns had both Hanafi and Maliki mosques, while the Ibadi community had their own mosques and, especially, cemeteries. The dual Hanafi/Maliki system was maintained under French colonial regime.&lt;ref name="McDougall2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=James McDougall|title=A History of Algeria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-CBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=30 April 2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85164-0|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Colonization===
{{main article|French Algeria}}
In 1830, the [[France|French]] conquered [[Algiers]]. Their attempts to rule the rest of the country met stiff opposition, often religiously inspired: the [[Sufi]] warrior Amir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] was particularly notable for his campaign to keep the French out. Even after his defeat, rebellions continued to be mounted until at least 1870, notably that of Cheikh [[Mokrani]]; again, a religious motivation was notable in most, though not all, of these.

Soon after arriving in Algeria, the French colonial regime set about undermining traditional Muslim Algerian culture. By French law Muslims could not hold public meetings, carry firearms, or leave their homes or villages without permission. Legally, they were French subjects, but to become French citizens, with full rights, they had to renounce Islamic law. Few did so. The land of Islamic charitable trusts (''[[habus]]'') was regarded as government property and confiscated. Much of the network of traditional [[Qur'anic school]]s and [[zaouia]]s - regarded with suspicion as centers of potential resistance - collapsed, and the literacy rate fell.

However, the emergence of the religious scholar and reformer [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]] would go some way to reversing these trends. Beginning in the 1910s, he preached against the traditional [[marabout]]s and the saint cults, they believed in voodoo dolls,and urged the importance of Arabic and Islamic education; his disciples founded an extensive network of schools, and rapidly brought the saint cults into widespread disrepute, making Algerian Islam substantially more orthodox.

While in Islam, a Muslim society subject to non-Muslim rulers is acceptable (see [[Qur'an]])""which verse"", the discrimination against Islam led it to be a strong element of the resistance movement to the French in the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. The independence fighters were termed ''[[mujahid|moudjahidine]]'' - practicers of [[jihad]] - and its fallen are called ''[[martyr|chouhada]]'', martyrs, despite the revolution's avowed [[socialism]]; even during the revolution, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] made symbolic efforts to impose Islamic principles, such as banning [[wine]] and [[prostitution]].

===After independence===
After independence the Algerian government asserted state control over religious activities for purposes of national consolidation and political control. Islam became the religion of the state in the new constitution (Article 2), and was the religion of its leaders. The state monopolized the building of mosques, and the Ministry of Religious Affairs controlled an estimated 5,000 public mosques by the mid-1980s. [[Imam]]s were trained, appointed, and paid by the state, and the Friday [[khutba]], or sermon, was issued to them by the Ministry of Religious Affairs. That ministry also administered religious property (the [[habus]]), provided for religious education and training in schools, and created special institutes for Islamic learning. Islamic law (''[[sharia]]'') principles were introduced into family law in particular, while remaining absent from most of the legal code; thus, for example, while Muslim women were banned from marrying non-Muslims (by the [[Algerian Family Code]] of 1984), wine remained legal. 

Those measures, however, did not satisfy everyone. As early as 1964 a militant Islamic movement, called [[Al Qiyam]] (values), emerged and became the precursor of the Islamic Salvation Front ([[Islamist]] party) of the 1990s. Al Qiyam called for a more dominant role for Islam in Algeria's legal and political systems and opposed what it saw as Western practices in the social and cultural life of Algerians. This proved to be the most difficult challenge for the immediate post-independent regimes as they tried to incorporate an Islamic national identity alongside socialist policies. Whereas the new leaders of Algeria saw Islam and Socialism as both compatible and features of Algerian culture and society; radical Islamists saw Islam as the only defining characteristic and in fact incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan N.C. Hill (2006) Identity and instability in postcolonial Algeria, The Journal of North African Studies, 11:1, 1-16, DOI: 10.1080/13629380500409735&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Houari Boumediene]] largely contained militant Islamism during his reign, although it remained throughout the 1970s under a different name and with a new organization. Following Boumediene's death, [[Chadli Bendjedid]] became president in 1979. Chadli's regime was much more tolerant with Islamists, and with Algeria in the midst of an socio-economic crisis including unemployment and inflation, social tensions were high. Policies of [[Arabization]] (increasing Arabic education and the use of Arabic in professional institutions) had failed to come to fruition: French remained the language of the political elite and French speaking students were prioritised for jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan N.C. Hill (2006) Identity and instability in postcolonial Algeria, The Journal of North African Studies, 11:1, 1-16, DOI: 10.1080/13629380500409735&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the movement began spreading to university campuses where it was encouraged by the state as a counterbalance to left-wing student movements. By the 1980s, the movement had become even stronger, and bloody clashes erupted at the [[Ben Aknoun]] campus of the [[University of Algiers]] in November 1982. The violence resulted in the state's cracking down on the movement, a confrontation that would intensify throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The rise of Islamism had a significant impact on Algerian society. More women began wearing the veil, some because they had become more conservative religiously and others because the veil kept them from being harassed on the streets, on campuses, or at work. Islamists also prevented the enactment of a more liberal family code despite pressure from feminist groups and associations.

After the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the 1991 elections, and was then banned after the elections' cancellation by the military, the tensions between Islamists and the government erupted into open fighting, which lasted some 10 years in the course of which some [[Algerian Civil War|100,000 people were killed]]. However, some Islamist parties remained aboveground - notably the [[Movement of Society for Peace]] and [[Islamic Renaissance Movement]] - and were allowed by the government to contest later elections. In recent years, the [[Civil Harmony Act]] and [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]] have been passed, providing an amnesty for most crimes committed in the course of the war.

==Practice==
[[Sunni]] Islam is quasi universal, apart from the [[Mozabite people|Mozabite]] region who are mainly [[Ibadi|Ibadhism]]. The dominant [[madhhab]] is [[Maliki]]. There are a few followers of the [[Hanafi]] rite among people of Turkish descent.&lt;ref name="Gibb1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXcRAQAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Brill|page=371|quote=Virtually the only rite practised in Algeria is the Malikite; there are a few followers of the HanafI rite among people of Turkish descent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi]] [[tariqa|brotherhoods]] have retreated considerably, but remain in some areas. Algerians have a Muslim tradition of patron saints, although it is viewed as [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] by Salafis. Sidi Abderrahmane, saint patron of [[Algiers]], is perhaps the most notorious as numerous popular songs in Algeria mention him.

==In Politics==
{{main article|Islamic Salvation Front}}
The popularity of [[Islamism]] fluctuates according to circumstance; in the 2002 elections, legal Islamist parties received some 20% of the seats in the National Assembly, way down from the [[Islamic Salvation Front|FIS's]] 50% in 1991. Conversely, there is strong anti-Islamist sentiment from secular parties such as the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy|RCD]] and the Algerian [[Workers' Party (Algeria)|Workers Party]]. Support for Islamist parties is especially low in the Kabylie region, where the [[Islamic Salvation Front|FIS]] obtained no seats in 1991, the majority being taken by the [[Front des Forces Socialistes|Front of Socialist Forces]], another secular party.

The recent rise of a number of radical religious movements involving [[Ahmadism]], [[Salafism]], [[Shiism]], [[Wahhabism]] and [[takfiri]] ideology have raised concerns among officials in the Algerian Ministry of Religious Affairs and Endowments, which has decided to take action by strengthening the monitoring and control of places targeted by the radical Islamists for recruits.&lt;ref name="Racelma 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Racelma | first=Kaci | title=Algerian Ministry of Religious Affairs Warns Against Extremism | website=Al-Monitor | date=May 17, 2013 | url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/algeria-ministry-religious-affairs-warning-extremism.html | accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rishi]] Jahnu''' appears in the story of the [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganges]] and [[Bhagiratha]]. When the Ganges came to earth after being released from Lord [[Shiva|Shiva's]] locks, her torrential waters wreaked havoc with Jahnu's fields and penance. Angered by this, the great sage drank up all of the Ganges' waters to punish her. Seeing this, the Gods prayed to the sage to release the Ganges, so that she could proceed on her mission to release the souls of the ancestors of Bhagiratha. Jahnu relented and he released the Ganges from his ear. For this, the [[Ganges river]] is also known as ''Jahnavi'', meaning "daughter of Jahnu". He belonged to [[Amavasu Dynasty]] and an ancestor of [[Vishwamitra]].

He was directly responsible for the establishment of literally hundreds of ''[[yeshiva]]'' day schools across the United States outside of the [[New York Metropolitan Area]].&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;Dei'ah Vedibur [http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5759/tzav/kamintzk.htm News: Dr. Joseph Kaminetsky zt"l] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822183458/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5759/tzav/kamintzk.htm |date=2007-08-22 }}, March 24, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and mission==
Kaminetsky was born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1911.  At first, he attended [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] for a year, but his father wanted him to attend a ''[[yeshiva]]'', and sold the family home in order to afford the tuition; they moved from [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] to [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]].  Kaminetsky attended [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]] for elementary school, and later Talmudical Academy High School on East Broadway on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

Kaminetsky then became a member of the first class at [[Yeshiva University]], graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1932.  He immediately sought to immerse himself in the area of Jewish education, becoming the principal of the afternoon school of Manhattan's prestigious Jewish Center synagogue and later its assistant rabbi under [[Leo Jung|Rabbi Leo Jung]], serving this post in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]] [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E4DD1531F93AA25750C0A96F958260 Paid Notice: Deaths KAMINETSKY, JOSEPH], March 19, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving his [[doctorate]] in education from [[Columbia University|Columbia Teachers College]],&lt;ref name="JP" /&gt; he became the executive director of [[Manhattan Day School]].  It was at this post that he was tapped to be a leader at Torah Umesorah.  He served as educational director for two years before rising to director of the entire organization, replacing [[Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz|Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz]] upon the latter's death in 1948.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

Kaminetsky was seen as a true visionary by the leaders of the American Jewish community.  At Kaminetsky's [[funeral]] in 1999, [[Boruch Mordechai Ezrachi|Rabbi Boruch Mordechai Ezrachi]] told a story of how, upon his first visit to America in 1973, he was in the presence of [[Moshe Feinstein|Rabbi Moshe Feinstein]] when Kaminetsky entered the room.  He did not know who Kaminetsky was and was astonished to see Feinstein rising in respect for this unknown man.  Afterward, Feinstein explained that "this man has established [[Torah]] in America."&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

For the next 35 years, Kaminetsky traveled throughout the United States with a mission to establish a Jewish day school in every town and city across America with a Jewish population of at least 5,000.&lt;ref name="JP" /&gt;  Upon retiring in 1980 at the age of 69, he moved to [[Jerusalem]] with his wife Selma.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

Kaminetsky published his memoirs in March 1995, entitled ''Memorable Encounters: A Torah pioneer's glimpses of great men and years of challenge''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0899066186 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His son, Rabbi David Kaminetsky, was principal of Manhattan Day School for a decade but left to become the national director of [[NCSY]], a post he left in 2002.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;

His daughter Nechama is married to Meir Steinhardt, both of whom are involved in Jewish education.  He is also survived by his son Judah and daughter Phyllis, married to Gedalya Riess.  His daughter Symie is married to Rabbi Eliezer Liff, who live in Jerusalem and are similarly involved in Jewish education.&lt;ref name="dvd" /&gt;  His wife, Selma, died in July 2010.

A '''Hebrew Bible manuscript''' is a handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) made on papyrus, parchment, or paper, and written in the [[Hebrew language]]. (Some of the Biblical text and notations may be in [[Aramaic]].) The oldest manuscripts were written in a form of scroll, the medieval manuscripts usually were written in a form of [[codex]]. The late manuscripts written after the 9th century use the [[Masoretic Text]]. The important manuscripts are associated with [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Aaron ben Asher]] (especially [[Codex Leningradensis]]).&lt;ref&gt;H. Kelley, Daniel Stephen Mynatt, Timothy G. Crawford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gh6OHYcIZgkC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Masorah of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia: introduction and annotated glossary''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The original manuscripts and early copies of the Old Testament disappeared over time, because of wars, (especially the destruction of the First and Second Temples), and other intentional destructions.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Price, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7ZHjZencgIC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Searching for the Original Bible''], Harvest House Publishers, 2007, p. 45-50&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the lapse of time between the original manuscripts and their surviving copies is much longer than in the case of the [[New Testament]] [[Biblical manuscript#New Testament manuscripts|manuscripts]].

The first list of the Old Testament manuscripts in Hebrew, made by [[Benjamin Kennicott]] (1776–1780) and published by Oxford, listed 615 manuscripts from libraries in England and on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hartwell Horne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pMUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7&amp;lpg= ''An introduction to the critical study and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures''] (1836), vol. 2, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni de Rossi]] (1784–1788) published a list of 731 manuscripts.&lt;ref name = lakeside&gt;[http://www.lakesideministries.com/TopicalStudies/Foundations/OldTestament.htm#OLD%20TESTAMENT%20MANUSCRIPTS Old Testament manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; The main manuscript discoveries in modern times are those of the [[Cairo Geniza]] (c. 1890) and the Dead Sea Scrolls (1947). In the old synagogue in [[Cairo]] were discovered 260,000 Hebrew manuscripts, 10,000 of which are biblical manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliahebraica.com.br/textos/Gueniza_do_Cairo.pdf ''Fragmentos do Gueniza do Cairo'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sinclair, [http://www.davidsinclairmc.com/christianarticles/AN%20OVERVIEW%20OF%20THE%20BIBLE%20-%20Version%20II.pdf#page=15 ''An Overview of the Bible''] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 200 biblical manuscripts among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], some of them were written in the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. They were written before the year 70 AD. 14 scroll manuscripts were discovered in [[Masada]] in 1963–1965.&lt;ref&gt;Würthwein Ernst (1988). ''Der Text des Alten Testaments'', Stuttgart: [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]], pp. 38–39; translated into English and published in 1995 as Wurthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (2nd rev. ed, 1995, Grand Rapids, Mich., Wm.B. Eerdmans Publg. Co.)(this is the source for most of the dates of the mss listed).&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest organized collection of Hebrew Old Testament manuscripts in the world is housed in the [[Russian National Library]] ("Second Firkovitch Collection") in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref name = lakeside/&gt;

[[Codex Leningradensis]] is the oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew. Manuscripts earlier than the 13th century are very rare. The majority of the manuscripts have survived in a fragmentary condition.

During the battle, Sibbecai the Hushathite, one of [[David's Mighty Warriors]], killed Saph, who was one of the four. The expression ''yelide haraphah'' is rendered several different ways in translations of the Bible: "the descendants of Rapha" (NIV, NLT), "the descendants of the giants" (ESV, NLT&lt;ref&gt;NLT takes this interpretation, but in slightly different words.&lt;/ref&gt;), "the descendants of the giant" (NASB, Holman), and "the sons of the giant" (KJV, ASV). While most interpreters the phrase as a statement about the ancestry of the four people killed, describing them as descended from giants, another interpretation takes the phrase as meaning "votaries of Rapha," in reference to a deity by that name to which a group of warriors would have been associated.&lt;ref&gt;L'Heureux, Conrad E.

===Sarsekim===
'''Sarsekim''' or '''Sarsechim''' is a name or title, or a portion of a name or title, which appears in Jeremiah 39:3. Jeremiah describes describes Babylonian officials, some named and the rest unnamed, who according to the text sat down "in the middle gate" of Jerusalem during its destruction in 587 or 586 BCE. The portion which explicitly gives the names and/or titles of the officials reads, in Hebrew, ''nrgl śr ʾṣr smgr nbw śr skym rb srys nrgl śr ʾṣr rb-mg''. Various interpretations have divided the names in various ways. The [[King James Version]], sticking closely to the grammatical indicators added to the text by the [[Masoretes]] during the Middle Ages, reads this as indicating six figures: "Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag". The [[New International Version]] sees three characters "Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official." Versions featuring these three figures, with variations in the exact details of translations, include NLT and ESV. Four figures appear in the New American Standard Bible, "Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag."

In 2007, a Babylonian Tablet was deciphered containing a reference to a "Nabu-sharussu-ukin," identified as referring to the biblical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Meir Lubetski|author2=Edith Lubetski|title=New Inscriptions and Seals Relating to the Biblical World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqiEktf1IwEC&amp;pg=PA47|date=11 September 2012|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-557-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Nebo-Sarsekim Tablet]].

And [the wife of] Shaaph the father of Madmannah bore Sheva the father of Machbenah and the father of Gibea. And the daughter of Caleb was Achsah" (1 Chronicles 2:47–49).

The words [the wife of] do not occur in the Hebrew text, which reads literally, as Sara Japhet translates it, "And Shaaph the father of Madmannah bore Sheva . . ." but with a feminine form (''watteled'') of the verb "bore," rather than the expected masculine form ''wayyoled.''&lt;ref name="JaphetShaaph"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara Japhet|title=I and II Chronicles: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rJ1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-589-7|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japhet outlines several possibilities as to how the text may originally have read.&lt;ref name="JaphetShaaph" /&gt;

The name might mean "one born on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]", but more probably is a modification of the ethnic Zephathi (Zephathite), from [[Sarepta|Zarephathi]] (Zarephathite). [[Meshullam]] and [[Jozabad]], with which Shabbethai's name is combined, both originate in ethnic names. ([[Encyclopaedia Biblica]])

The exact sort of copying error or deliberate abbreviation that may have led to this state of affairs is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sara Japhet|title=I and II Chronicles: A Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rJ1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-1-61164-589-7|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign deities ==
[[File:Allat-Minerva.jpg|thumb|367x367px|Statue of [[Al-Lat]]-[[Minerva]] from [[As-Suwayda]], [[Syria]]. ]]

The Arabs, through contact with other cultures, also worshipped foreign deities, as this was the case in eastern Arabia, Nabataea, and many others.

=== Other Semitic deities ===
[[Palmyra]] was home to an Arab population, who arrived there in the late first millennium BC. The pantheon of Palmyra included mostly northwestern Semitic/Canaanite deities, with the addition of Mesopotamian deities and Arab deities, as well as local deities, which include [[Aglibol]], [[Yarhibol]] and [[Malakbel]].  At Palmyra, a [[Temple of Al-Lat|temple dedicated to Al-Lat]] was set up by a citizen Taimarsu of Palmyra circa 123-164 AD.{{Sfn|Trombley|1993|p=145}}  

In Arabia itself, the Lihyanites were said to have also worshipped Aglibol. Worship of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], [[Nabu]] and [[Utu|Shamash]] was evidently practiced in [[Eastern Arabia]], brought into the region by merchants and visitors. In Islamic tradition, according to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the god [[Hubal]] himself was brought into [[Mecca]] by a tribe leader named Amr ibn Luhayy, and according to [[al-Azraqi]], the image was imported from [[Mesopotamia]]. 

=== Greco-Roman deities ===
Through contact and influence, some local deities became identified with Greco-Roman deities, such as [[Al-Lat]] with [[Athena]] (or in Herodotus' case, [[Aphrodite]]), [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-'Uzza]] with [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]], and Manat with Nemesis. Cults and temples of Arabian deities also found their way outside the peninsula, such as Dushara (Latin: Dusares) in Italy. An altar dedicated to Wadd (known in Greek as ''Oaddos'') and various other Minaean deities evidently existed in the Greek island of [[Delos]].

=== Egyptian deities ===
Bes, an Egyptian god, may have been worshipped in Arabia, as representations of a dwarf-god resembling him were found in the peninsula.

'''Mes Aynak''' ([[Pashto]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|ps|مس عينک}}, meaning "little source of copper"), also called '''Mis Ainak''' or '''Mis-e-Ainak''', is a site {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], located in a barren region of [[Logar Province]]. Mes Aynak contains Afghanistan's largest [[copper]] deposit, as well as the remains of an ancient settlement with over 400 Buddha statues, [[stupa]]s and a {{convert|40|ha|abbr=on|-1}} monastery complex. Archaeologists are only beginning to find remnants of an older 5,000-year-old [[Bronze Age]] site beneath the Buddhist level, including an [[Smelting#Copper and bronze|ancient copper smelter]].

The site of Mes Aynak possesses a vast complex of Buddhist monasteries, homes, and market areas.  The site contains artifacts recovered from the Bronze Age, and some of the artifacts recovered have dated back over three thousand years. The site's orientation on the [[Silk Road]] has yielded a mixture of elements from China and India. The wealth of Mes Aynak’s residents has been well represented in the site's far-reaching size and well guarded perimeter. Afghanistan’s eagerness to unearth the copper below the site is leading to the site's destruction rather than its preservation. Archaeologists have photographed the site and the relics excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rescuing Mes Aynak - Photo Gallery|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/norfolk-photography|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Mes Aynak'' ({{lang|ps|مس عينک}}) literally means "little source of copper"; ''mis'' ({{lang|fa|مس}}) is "copper", while ''aynak'' ({{lang|ps|عينک}}) is a [[diminutive]] form of ''ayn'' ({{lang|ar|عين}}), which means "source".

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
[[File:Statue of standing bodhisattva, schist, Mes Aynak, 3rd-6th century CE.165042.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|Statue of the Buddha, Mes Aynak, 3rd-6th century CE.]]
As the name suggests, the presence of copper at Mes Aynak has been known about for some time, while the site's archaeological wealth has been known about since exploration by Russian and Afghan geologists in 1973-4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/afghanminerals/docs/tenders/Aynak/PartI_Aynak_Information_Package.pdf Aynak Information Package], Afghanistan Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Buddhist remains date from the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] era, although these gradually gave way to [[Tang Empire|T'ang Chinese]] and [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghur]] influences. Mes Aynak was at the peak of its prosperity between the fifth and seventh century AD. A period of slow decline began in the eighth century, and the settlement was finally abandoned 200 years later.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1"&gt;Dalrymple, William (31 May 2013) [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/31/mes-aynak-afghanistan-buddhist-treasure Mes Aynak: Afghanistan's Buddhist buried treasure faces destruction] guardian.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining lease==
{{see also|Mining in Afghanistan}}
In November 2007, a 30-year lease was granted for the copper mine to the [[China Metallurgical Group]] (MCC) for US$3 billion, making it the biggest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan’s history.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Martin (April 2010) [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Race+to+save+Buddhist+relics+in+former+Bin+Laden+camp/23443 Race to save Buddhist relics in former Bin Laden camp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228082611/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Race+to+save+Buddhist+relics+in+former+Bin+Laden+camp/23443 |date=28 February 2012 }} theartnewspaper.com&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations have persisted that the then-minister of mines obstructed the contracting process and accepted a large bribe to eliminate the other companies involved in the bid.

The Afghan Mining Ministry estimates that the mine holds some six million tons of copper (5.52 million metric tons). The mine is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars, and to generate jobs and economic activity for the country, but threatens the site's archaeological remains.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Heidi (14 November 2010) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/14/chinese-copper-mine-afghanistan-mes-aynak-_n_783315.html Chinese Copper Mine In Afghanistan Threatens 2,600-Year-Old Buddhist Monastery] The Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Brent (17 May 2012)[http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/are-chinese-miners-destroying-2000-year-old-buddhist-site-afghanistan-images Are Chinese Miners Destroying a 2,000-Year-Old Buddhist Site in Afghanistan?] http://asiasociety.org&lt;/ref&gt; The site is accessed via a {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} motorable track from the surfaced road between Kabul and [[Gardez]].&lt;ref name=bgs1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/afghanminerals/docs/tenders/Aynak/PartI_Aynak_Information_Package.pdf | title=Aynak Information Package Part I Introduction |publisher= Afghanistan Geological Survey and the British Geological Survey |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mining lease holders propose to build a [[railway]] to serve the copper mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/agreement-signed-for-north-south-corridor.html | title=Agreement signed for north-south corridor | date=23 September 2010 | publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2012, MCC has not developed an environmental impact plan, and has remained secretive about [[Mining feasibility study|feasibility studies]], and the plan regarding the opening and closing of the mine, as well as any guarantees contained in the [[contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Benard, Dr Cheryl (4 July 2012) [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/04/afghanistan-s-mineral-wealth-could-be-a-bonanza-or-lead-to-disaster.html Afghanistan’s Mineral Wealth Could Be a Bonanza—or Lead to Disaster] thedailybeast.com&lt;/ref&gt; International experts have warned that the project, and other similar projects in Afghanistan, could be threatened because MCC has not fulfilled promises made to the Afghan government, such as the lack of provision of proper housing for relocated villagers. Other investments that have yet to be fulfilled include a railway, a 400-megawatt power plant and a coal mine.&lt;ref name=nissenbaum&gt;Nissenbaum, Dion (14 June 2012) [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/afghanistan-mining-wealth-thwarted-by-delays/story-fnay3ubk-1226395155692 Afghanistan mining wealth thwarted by delays] The Australian, theaustralian.com&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Global Witness]], an independent advocacy group that focuses on natural resource exploitation, said there was a "major gap" between the government's promises of transparency and its follow-through.&lt;ref name=nissenbaum /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(24 April 2012)[http://www.globalwitness.org/library/future-afghan-mining-sector-threatened-weak-contracts Future of Afghan mining sector threatened by weak contracts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists believe that Mes Aynak is a major historical heritage site. It has been called "one of the most important points along the [[Silk Road]]" by French archaeologist, Philippe Marquis.&lt;ref&gt;(15 November 2010) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1329650/Company-digging-Afghanistan-unearths-2-600-year-old-Buddhist-monastery.html Copper load of this! Company digging mine in Afghanistan unearths 2,600-year-old Buddhist monastery] Dailymail.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There are thought to be 19 separate archaeological sites in the valley including two small forts, a citadel, four fortified monasteries, several Buddhist stupas and a [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]], as well as ancient copper workings, smelting workshops, a [[Mint (coin)|mint]], and miners habitations.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt; In addition to the Buddhist monasteries and other structures from the Buddhist era that have already been identified, Mes Aynak also holds the remains of prior civilizations likely going back as far as the 3rd century BC. Historians are particularly excited by the prospect of learning more about the early science of metallurgy and mining by exploring this site. It is known to contain coins, glass, and the tools for making these, going back thousands of years. 

All of this historical material is in imminent danger of destruction by the mining endeavor. In response to negative reports in the press comparing the Chinese mining company to those who destroyed the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], a plan for minimal [[archaeological excavation]] was put in place. This plan still foresees the destruction of the site and everything still buried beneath it, but it does allow for the removal of whatever artifacts can be carried away by a small archaeological team led by DAFA, the French archaeological mission to Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Rescue excavations===
Between May 2010 and July 2011 archaeologists excavated approximately 400 items; more than what the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]] housed before the war. The site covers roughly {{convert|400000|m2}}, encompassing several separate monasteries and a commercial area. It appears that Buddhists who began settling the area almost two millennia ago were drawn by the availability of copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Baker | first = Aryn | title = Deciding Between Heritage and Hard Cash in Afghanistan | url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2099676,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = 20 August 2012 | date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a stone statue, or [[stele]], found in 2010 has been identified as a depiction of Prince Siddhartha before he founded Buddhism and has been taken to support the idea that there was an ancient monastic [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] dedicated to  Siddhartha's pre-enlightenment life.&lt;ref&gt;Jarus, Owen (6 June 2012) [http://www.livescience.com/20799-ancient-statue-reveals-prince-buddha.html Ancient Statue Reveals Prince Who Would Become Buddha] livescience.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, a conference of experts in the fields of geology, mining engineering, archaeology, history and economic development met at [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies|SAIS]] in Washington, D.C to assess the situation in Mes Aynak. The provisional findings were tentatively encouraging: because of the length of time before mining can actually start at the site (approximately five years), it is indeed possible for collaboration between archaeologists and mining engineers to work to save Mes Aynak's cultural treasures. The site could either become a positive model for mineral extraction working to preserve cultural heritage or become an irreparable failure. However, a number of measures, that are not currently in place, must be met first. The site is still scheduled for destruction in January 2013.&lt;ref name=ARCH&gt;[http://www.archinternational.org/mes_aynak.html Experts Show How to Preserve Ancient Mes Aynak Ruins While Safely Mining Copper Near Kabul, Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629011855/http://archinternational.org/mes_aynak.html |date=29 June 2012 }} ARCH International, archinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ancient site needs saving not destroying|last=Huffman|first=Brent|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/22/opinion/afghanistan-buddha-site-mine/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavators at Mes Aynak have been denounced as "promoting Buddhism" and threatened by the Taliban and many of the Afghan excavators who are working for purely financial reasons don't feel any connection to the Buddhist artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bloch  |first=Hannah |date=September 2015 |title=Mega Copper Deal in Afghanistan Fuels Rush to Save Ancient Treasures |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/bloch-text |journal=National Geographic |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
The [[Embassy of the United States, Kabul|U.S. Embassy in Kabul]] has provided a million dollars of U.S. military funding to help save the Buddhist ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Global Heritage Fund blog article (July 2012) [http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/aynak_documentary GHF Supports Buddhas of Aynak Documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726062047/http://globalheritagefund.org/onthewire/blog/aynak_documentary |date=26 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2013 there is an international team of 67 archaeologists on site, including French, English, Afghans and Tajiks. There are also approximately 550 local labourers, which is set to increase to 650 in the summer. When this occurs Mes Aynak will become "the largest rescue dig anywhere in the world".&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt; All these personnel are protected by 200 armed guards. The team are using [[ground-penetrating radar]], [[Orthophoto|georectified photography]] and aerial 3D images to produce a comprehensive digital map of the ruins.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple_1" /&gt;

The rescue work was continuing as of June 2014, in spite of difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rescuing Mes Aynak|url = http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/09/mes-aynak/bloch-text|accessdate = 2015-08-19|first = Hannah|last = Bloch}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only 10 international experts working at the site, and fewer than 20 Afghan archaeologists from Kabul’s Institute of Archaeology. A team of seven Tajik archaeologists was also helping. Marek Lemiesz, a senior archaeologist at the site, said that more help was needed. Security was also a concern.&lt;ref&gt;24 June 2014, [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/24/mes-aynak-savingafghanistansculturaltreasures.html Saving Buddhist statues: Afghanistan’s big dig] america.aljazeera.com&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also indications that mining plans were being delayed because of the declining copper prices.

==Documentary==
A documentary titled ''[[Saving Mes Aynak]]'',&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1302159--afghanistan-archeological-site-in-a-race-for-survival|title=Afghanistan archeological site in a race for survival|last=Ward|first=Olivia|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Brent E. Huffman, tells the story of the archaeological site, as well as the dangerous environment the mine has created for archaeologists, Chinese workers, and local Afghans. The film follows several main characters, including Philippe Marquis, a French archaeologist leading emergency conservation efforts; Abdul Qadeer Temore, an Afghan archaeologist at the Afghan National Institute of Archaeology; Liu Wenming, a manager for the [[China Metallurgical Group Corporation]]; and Laura Tedesco, an American archaeologist working for the [[U.S. State Department]].

In July 2014 it was announced that ''Saving Mes Aynak'' will be completed by the end of 2014, and is being made with [[Kartemquin Films]].&lt;ref name="Kartemquin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kartemquin.com/news/saving-mes-aynak-comes-to-kartemquin|title=Saving Mes Aynak comes to Kartemquin|publisher=[[Kartemquin Films]]|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''Saving Mes Aynak'' premiered at the 2014 [[IDFA film festival]] in Amsterdam and in the USA at the 2015 [[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]].

In April 2015, Brent E. Huffman announced a plan to raise awareness of Mes Aynak through a #SaveMesAynak Global Screening Day and a fundraising campaign.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/saving-mes-aynak-documentary-campaign-indiegogo-1201480311/|title=Filmmakers Launch ‘Saving Mes Aynak’ Campaign for Afghan Archaeological Site|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=26 April 2015|accessdate=2015-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the film was offered for free streaming within Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidepulse.com/2015/06/25/saving-mes-aynak-is-free-to-watch-in-afghanistan/ |title=Saving Mes Aynak is free to watch in Afghanistan |last1=Corey |first1=Joe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Inside Pulse |publisher= |access-date=July 2, 2015 |quote="Kartemquin Films announced today that they will make director Brent E.

The '''Moon Temple''' of '''Chía''' was a temple constructed by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] as a place of worship for their Moon goddess [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. The temple was built in [[Chía, Cundinamarca]], [[Colombia]], then part of the [[Muisca Confederation]]. It was one of the most important temples in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.4, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was destroyed during the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]]. Little is known about the temple built on the Tíquiza Hill in western Chía bordering [[Tabio]].&lt;ref name=ColArte&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colarte.com/colarte/conspintores.asp?idartista=5510 Muisca Precolombino]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and worship ==
[[File:Escudo de Chía.svg|thumb|110px|left|Coat of arms of '''Chía'''; City of the Moon]]
The Temple of the Moon was built on the Tíquiza Hill west of the urban centre of Chía. The Muisca had an advanced knowledge of [[Muisca astronomy|astronomy]] and constructed various sites across their territories. ''[[El Infiernito]]'', just outside [[Villa de Leyva]] has survived, while the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Sun Temple]] of [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]] has been reconstructed. Just like the Sun Temple, the Moon temple was constructed according to the positions of the respective celestial body.&lt;ref name=Pueblos&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/chia.html Templo de la Luna in Chía] - Pueblos Originarios&lt;/ref&gt;

At the temple rituals were organised by the ''caciques'' and ''[[zipa]]s'' of the Muisca Confederation. The ''caciques'' and priests at the Moon Temple wore white robes, different from those at the Sun Temple that were red.&lt;ref name=ColArte/&gt; The Moon Temple not only formed a place of worship, also education to the new ''caciques'' and [[Muisca rulers]] was provided near the temple (''Seminario de la Cuca'').&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ancestros&gt;{{es}} [http://ancestroscolombianos.blogspot.com.co/2014/04/cultura-chibcha.html Education at the Moon Temple, Chía]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElTiempo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-925172 Chía, Ciudad de la Luna] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{visible anchor|Selâtin mosque}}s &lt;!-- [[Selâtin mosque]] and [[Selâtin mosque]] redirect here --&gt; ==

'''Selâtin mosques''', ('''Selâtin '''means in Arabic "Sultans") by the usual definition, are mosques commissioned by a sultan who personally led a [[military campaign]]. They are large mosques with several minarets. Fatih and Süleymaniye are typical examples. However, this definition does not exactly cover the concept. Beginning by the 17th century, most sultans preferred to stay in the capital rather than campaigning. Ahmet I (reigned 1603–1617), who was a non-campaigning sultan, commissioned the Blue Mosques, one of the greatest mosques which had 6 minarets.  This mosque is also considered a selâtin mosque.

Most of the mosques were commissioned by the sultans. But some mosques were commissioned by the other members of the dynasty; usually the mothers of sultans.

'''Mount Wilga House''' is an [[Heritage register|heritage-listed]] former residence and rehabilitation hospital at 2a Manor Road (Rosamond Street), [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]] in the [[Hornsby Shire]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. Its design is attributed to [[Henry Marcus Clark]] and was built from 1913 to 1914. It is also known as '''Mt Wilga'''. The property is privately owned. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5044998|Mount Wilga House|hr=00535|fn=EF14/4751;S91/00356; HC 870251|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[North Shore railway line]] terminates at [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]], where it connects with the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]] going to [[Brooklyn, New South Wales|Brooklyn]], [[Gosford]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and eventually the [[New South Wales North Coast|North Coast]] and [[Brisbane]]. The Northern Line was extended from [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]] to the Hawkesbury in 1886, passing through the present suburb of Hornsby. The station was over {{convert|2|mi|km|order=flip|spell=on}} from the village of Hornsby (modern day [[Normanhurst, New South Wales|Normanhurst]]), so in 1895 the station was called Hornsby Junction to avoid confusion. In 1900 the word Junction was dropped and the area around the station became known as Hornsby; Old Hornsby was the name adopted for the present Normanhurst.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-71&gt;Pollen &amp; Healy, 1988, 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Mt Wilga Estate dates from an initial purchase in 1907 of {{convert|49|acre|ha|order=flip}} at Hornsby by Georgina Clark, wife of the successful [[Sydney]] Draper and Retailer, [[Henry Marcus Clark]].  Additional purchases of {{convert|26.75|acre|ha|order=flip}} acres and {{convert|45|acre|ha|order=flip}} were made between 1907 and 1908.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In 1908 Clark built a {{convert|520|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} long suspension bridge over the deep gully which lies between Mt Wilga and Hornsby railway station to facilitate the arrival of guests to the property from Sydney.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Prior to Mt. Wilga, Clark had resided in "[[Sefton, New South Wales|Sefton]] Hall" in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]] Road, [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]], which was named after a property in England.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Mt. Wilga was reputedly designed by the owner and planned along similar lines to his summer home "Sefton Hall" at [[Mount Wilson, New South Wales|Mount Wilson]] in the northern [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. It was intended to be Marcus Clark's winter home.  The original garden as planned by Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end.  A formal area of the garden was laid out to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house. To the south and south east was a service area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

However, Clark died in 1913 during the construction of the large single storey [[Australian residential architectural styles#Federation Queen Anne|Federation Queen Anne]] style house.  It was completed in 1914 by his widow, Georgina Clark.  The Clark family resided at Mt Wilga until 1919.  Henry's son, Les Clark built a very similar house "Dulcidene Homestead" in [[Dubbo]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In 1926 Mrs Georgina M Clark sold the house and a portion of its land to Miss Jessie Hamilton Scott]of Hornsby who subdivided the land creating Manor Road.  In 1928 the subdivision of Mt Wilga into 67 residential allotments was initiated. The large allotment containing Mt Wilga house remained in private hands until its sale in 1952 to the Commonwealth of Australia for use as a rehabilitation hospital.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In 1948 the property was owned by a Dr Smallpage.  The Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Hospital operated between 1952 and 1987.  During the 35&amp;ndash;year period the estate and house were altered to accommodate the functions and facilities of a rehabilitation hospital. Several large buildings were constructed on site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In 1985 Howard Tanner &amp; Associates (HT&amp;A;) prepared'"Mt Wilga, Hornsby NSW: Conservation Management Plan for the Administration Building' for the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction. In January 1987, Howard Tanner wrote to the then Heritage &amp; Conservation Branch advising of the impending sale of the property by the [[Australian Government]]. In March, 1987, HT&amp;A; wrote to the Heritage &amp; Conservation Branch making recommendations for a site curtilage based on historic and contemporary conditions.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

[[File:Mount Wilga House 02.jpg|thumb|Mount Wilga House]]

Concern over the future of the site led to the placement of a Permanent Conservation Order (PCO) #535 over the house and some of the curtilage on 4 September 1987.  This is understood to have taken place prior to the sale of the property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In late 1987 (post PCO listing) Alpha Pacific purchased the site for use as a private rehabilitation hospital, and in July, 1988, sought to subdivide the site.  The Heritage Council refused the application which sought to reduce the curtilage around Mt Wilga.  A modified proposal to subdivide the site into two large allotments was subsequently approved by the Heritage Council.  Consequently, Lot 2 DP 792198 was sold in 1990 to the Japan-based Buddhist sect, the Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai Australia and run as a Buddhist Cultural Centre.&lt;ref name=Austral&gt;1999: Austral. Archaeology, 2014, i&lt;/ref&gt;  The northern Lot 1 DP 792198 continued to operate as a private hospital.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

The original garden as planned by Marcus Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end.  The formal area of the garden which existed to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house were lost during the development of the hospital.  The extant grounds to the south and south east of the house were formerly the service area of the property.  In their present state the grounds reflect the reduction of the gardens and expansion of open lawn areas, the gradual attrition and simplification of planting and the removal of the majority of the trees, associated with the institutional management of the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

In August 1991 a Conservation Management Plan was prepared by Robertson &amp; Hindmarsh Pty Ltd for Soka Gakkai International Australia, a Buddhist group who made a number of small modifications to the house and outbuildings. These included repainting the interior and exterior of the house, recarpeting, refurbishing a former minor building into a Women's temple and various services were partially separated from the hospital to the north. Although the  group planned further extensions to the temple facilities, they moved from the site in 1999 and these modifications were never initiated.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-72&gt;Austral Archaeology, 2014, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

The site was sold to a consortium wanting to construct a SEPP5 aged care facility.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-73&gt;Branch report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt; From 1999 the site has been vacant, or served once again as a private residence.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;&lt;ref name=Austral/&gt;

In August 1999 Scott Robertson of Robertson &amp; Hindmarsh Pty Ltd was engaged by Mirrabeema Project Management on behalf of the Mt Wilga Village Consortium to prepare "Conservation Management Plan of Mt Wilga, 2a Manor Road, Hornsby".  At its meeting of 20 January 2000, the Heritage Council provided its general terms of approval to an amended integrated development application. On 9 June 2000 delegated conditional approval was granted to the subsequent section 63 application. On 6 October 2000 delegated conditional approval was granted to a further section 63 application under the Heritage Act.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Since 2006 one residential allotment facing Manor Road (known as Lot 2 in DP 1181742), outside the NSW State Heritage Register curtilage boundary, has been subdivided off the property. This lot was previously occupied by a cottage on the Mount Wilga estate, which was demolished {{circa|2000}}.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-74&gt;NBRS &amp; Partners, 2014, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

The site was sold in 2008 to Austcorp Project No. 1 Pty Ltd.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-75&gt;Heritage Branch Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1999 and 2010 a series of unsuccessful attempts by several owners were made to adapt the site for medium-high density retirement living. During this time, many buildings with little heritage significance were demolished and many conservation works to the house were completed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-76&gt;NBRS &amp; Partners, 2014, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt; Additions to the hospital were approved in 2011. The current owners bought the homestead site in 2011. A four&amp;ndash;lot subdivision (three small lots on the southern boundary, one large lot for the house) was withdrawn and later a two&amp;ndash;lot subdivision was approved (for the current owners) in 2012.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

== Description ==
;Site
Federation mansion and garden prominently sited in large grounds&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-77&gt;LEP, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; on the apex of a long ridge with commanding views of the surrounding countryside, including across the valley to "neighbouring" mansion, Mount Errington.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

;Garden
The original garden planned by Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end.  A formal area of the garden was laid out to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house. To the south and south east was a service area. Despite subdivision and loss of land to the north and east, a generous area of garden surrounds the house to the east and south. This retains the core of the eastern garden, [[driveway]] and a good part of the former service area, including the tennis court, bowling green and site of the former chicken house. Subdivision and redevelopment of the hospital to the north and west has greatly altered much of the estate's land there and encroaches fairly close to the carriage loop and western boundary of Mt. Wilga.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Period elements remaining on the site include border planting around the perimeter of the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

A grand drive sweeps south-west from Manor Road leading up to a fine circular carriage drive in front (north) of the house (formerly gravel, now bitumen) with central planting plot and dominant Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) to {{convert|14|m}} high. (This possibly dates from {{circa|1920}}s as it is not evident in a 1917 photograph). The original long drive [[sandstone]] castellated gate arch structure no longer exists - it has been replaced with a modest brick pillar modern steel gates in the hospital era) but an eastern pedestrian entrance constructed of sandstone remains. This eastern entrance is covered by climbing fig (Ficus pumila var.pumila) and retains an intact [[wrought iron]] period gate.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Mt Wilga's grounds include large sloping lawn areas to the house's east and south, a tennis court to its east, a bowling green to its south-east and some shrubbery (seemingly reduced in quantity).&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Large mature trees including Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), Port Jackson or rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa) and Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) to {{convert|20|m}} (probably from {{circa|1910}}) camphor laurels (Cinnammomum camphora) and brush box (Lophostemon confertus) to a 16m evergreen /southern magnolia / bull [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] (Magnolia grandiflora) and crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica). Along the southern boundary there is a row of turpentine trees (Syncarpia glomulifera) to 15m high which have grown since the 1950s and, further to the south-west adjoining the former service driveway to the former garage, a Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), book leaf cypress/arborvitae (Platycladus orientalis) and brush box trees (now outside the boundary to the west near the former service drive).&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Also mature trees on site include two sweet gums (Liquidambar styraciflua), two frangipani (Plumeria rubra) flanking the front steps to the house, a rare jambos/ rose apple (Syzygium jambos) tree on the eastern boundary near the entrance drive, an ironbark tree west of the house (Eucalyptus sp., possibly E.crebra), a NZ flax bush south of the drawing room (Phormium tenax) and a large Chinese wisteria (W.sinensis) on the wire mesh fence of the tennis court.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

Younger tree plantings on the eastern lawn include tupelo or sour gum (Nyssa sylvatica), Camellia sasanqua, a mature Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) and native cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandii).&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Read, 9 March 2012, visit.&lt;/ref&gt;

A weld-mesh boundary fence is modern (dating from the hospital era)&lt;ref&gt;S.Read, pers.comm.&lt;/ref&gt; and inappropriate to the style of the grounds (LEP).&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

;Residence
Federation mansion with face brick walls, complex steep pitched terracotta tiled roof, tall roughcast [[chimneys]], shingled and half-timbered [[gable]]s, sandstone [[veranda]] [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] with simple scalloped timber valences. Unusual cylindrical polished [[granite]] colonettes support the timber veranda posts.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

The residence is a single storey with a basement and three-storey tower at the roof apex.  Original [[casement window]]s include projecting bays with [[leadlight]] and sculpted sandstone sills. Original doors and other joinery remains.  Much of the original interior survives.   The residence is prominently sited in large grounds with a number of large trees and a stone gateway (LEP).&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
2007-8: 88 units with basement parking: repairs and maintenance work to preserve the fabric of the building, including the:
* removal of glazing to the tower reinstate the lookout at the summit o the tower;
* replication of stolen items from the house (using documentary evidence) will improve the presentation of the house and allow an understanding of its decoration.  This replication will restore significance that has been lessened by the theft of joinery items and [[lighting]] fixtures.
* reconstruction of the stone gate will ensure its survival, restore its significance, enable an understanding of is significance as part of Marcus Clark's pedestrian link to Hornsby across the gully, enhance its appearance and ensure public safety;
* relaying original tiles on a new slab will prevent subsidence and protect the tiles from substrate collapse; and
* rebuilding the north-west corner of the front veranda will ensure the survival, while using the existing timber and stone elements.&lt;ref name=nswshr-535-73/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-535/&gt;

{{Islam and iman}}
In [[Islam]], the '''munafiqun''' ('hypocrites', {{lang-ar|منافقون}}, singular {{lang|ar|منافق}} ''munāfiq'') were a group decried in the [[Quran]] as outward [[Muslims]] who were inwardly concealing disbelief and actively sought to undermine the [[Muslim community]]. The hypocrisy itself is called ''nifāq'' ({{lang|ar|نفاق}}).

==Types of hypocrisy== 
* Hypocrisy towards God regarding actual faith. (Q2:8) and (Q2:14)
* Hypocrisy towards the tenets of faith: for example, somebody may believe in God, Judgment Day, accounting, scales of deeds and Hellfire, but not fear them at all or not refrain from committing sins because of them. Yet he claims, "I fear God."
* Hypocrisy towards others: somebody is double-faced and double-tongued. He praises someone in their presence, then, behind their back, he denounces them and tries to cause them pain and harm them."

==Munafiqun in the Qur'an==
The [[Qur'an]] has many verses discussing ''munāfiqūn'', referring to them as more dangerous to [[Muslim]]s than the worst non-Muslim enemies of Islam.

[[Image:Nalanda view from Dochu La.JPG|thumb|300px|View of Nalanda Buddhist Institute from Dochu La (pass)]]

'''Nalanda Buddhist Institute'''(NBI), also known locally as '''Daley''' Goenpa or '''Dalida''', is a Buddhist monastic school ([[shedra]]). 
The shedra is located in the western part of the [[Punakha District]] (Dzongkhag) in the Kingdom of [[Bhutan]].  It is located below [[Talo Monastery]] and is above Walakha. It is about a 25-minute drive from the main highway to Punakha, before reaching Kuruthang from the Metsina junction. Nalanda Buddhist Institute can be seen from Dochu La pass and from Thinleygang on the main Easst-West highway.

The name Nalanda means 'insatiable giving'.

==The Founding of Nalanda Monastery (Nalanda Buddhist Institute)==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
In 1757, the 9th [[Je Khenpo]], '''Shakya Rinchen''', considered to be a reincarnation of [[Rechung Dorje Drakpa]], founded the Nalanda Monastery in Punakha located below Talo Monastery. Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche, also known as '''Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche''', was from Sha Rueb Samchokha in the [[Wangdue Phodrang]] Dzongkhag (district). Rechunga was one of two extraordinary disciples of [[Milarepa]] in the '''[[Kagyu]]''' [[Buddhist]] lineage.  He was known as the “moon like” disciple of '''Milarepa''' and travelled to [[India]] to bring back profound teachings to [[Tibet]].  These important teachings were presented to Milarepa who absorbed them into the Kagyu lineage.

==The “Two Nalandas: Bhutan and India”==
{{Unreferenced section|small=y|date=November 2016}}
At the time when this monastery was built, the ancient '''[[Nalanda]]''' University in India was a very holy and sacred place. The original Nalanda University is located in what was known as [[Magadha]] that is now near present-day [[Patna]], the capital of the present day state of [[Bihar]], India.

The people in Bhutan made great efforts to visit this special holy place at least once in their lifetimes. However, there were no roads and people had to walk to India.  As a result, the journey was very unsafe and people were at risk of being robbed or worse.  On arrival in India, people from Bhutan faced many difficulties including dealing with differences in food, culture, and language, as well as being in an unfamiliar place.

As a way of accommodating the people’s desire to visit Nalanda, Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche built this monastery in Bhutan and named it after the Nalanda University in India. Phajoding Monastery, located in the mountains outside of [[Thimphu]], was the first monastery that Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche constructed.  Nalanda Monastery is the second monastery he founded in Bhutan and is known as the “Second Nalanda”.

It is said that the power of the Nalanda Monastery in Bhutan is no different than that of the Nalanda University in India.  Whatever merit (result of positive action through compassion) is achieved at Nalanda Monastery in Bhutan is equivalent to the merit that is gained at Nalanda University in India.

==Founding - Auspicious signs==
Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche had already completed building Phajoding Monastery in the hills above the Thimphu valley.  He wondered where he should build the next monastery.  The monk body was moving from [[Thimphu Dzong]] to Punakha, as is tradition, to spend the winter months in [[Punakha Dzong]].  As he was walking over Dochu La (pass), he saw eight vultures flying to an area on the side of the hills above the river. 
Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche suspected that maybe these vultures were the eight original scholars ([[pandit]]s) from Nalanda University in India. Therefore, he sought confirmation in a dream and the eight scholars appeared and gave him a teaching. Based on the selection of this site by the vultures and the dream of the eight scholars, this location was chosen as the place where he built Nalanda Monastery.

During Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen’s lifetime, Nalanda Monastery in Bhutan was a thriving Buddhist teaching institution with a renowned reputation.  After Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen’s final thugdham ([[dzongkha]]) /maha [[Samādhi]] ([[pali]]/[[sanscrit]]), slowly the teachings stopped and the great institute lay dormant.  Attempts to revive the teaching at Nalanda Monastery happened several times by different teachers but after the teachers departed, the monk community again shrank and were insufficient to serve the community or sustain teaching.

Eventually, the uncle of His Majesty, the Fourth King, '''[[Jigme Singye Wangchuk]]''', Dorji Lopen Yoenten Gyaltsen, requested permission from the King to open an official Buddhist [[shedra]].  In 1991, His Majesty gave permission for Nalanda Monastery to become a shedra and in 1992, two lopens (teachers) opened the shedra with 20 monks. Over time, the number of lopens and students has increased. As of 2014, there are 6 lopens and 125 students who range from 8 to 28 years of age.

===The Eight Disappearing Indians===
While constructing the original temple of Nalanda in Bhutan, Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche saw eight men from India in a small valley next to the building site.  He realised that these eight Indians must be the eight scholars (pandits) of the original Nalanda University in India. When he went to find them to see if this was true, they had disappeared.  The disappearance of the Indians was taken as confirmation that these indeed were the great eight scholars (pandits) of Nalanda University.

The eight scholars of Nalanda University are known as the Six Ornaments of the Southern Continent and the Two Excellent Ones.  This refers to eight of the greatest and most distinguished scholars of Nalanda University.   The Six Ornaments include: '''[[Nāgārjuna]]''', '''[[Aryadeva]]''', '''[[Asaṅga]]''', '''[[Vasubandhu]]''', '''[[Dignāga]]''', and '''[[Dharmakīrti]]'''.  The Two Excellent Ones are '''Gunaprabha''' and '''Shakyaprabha'''.   Each of these great scholars wrote extensive, elaborate, and profound Buddhist philosophical commentaries that are still studied today throughout monasteries and nunneries.   In order to praise and honour them for their auspicious appearance in the valley, Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche himself built clay statues of each of them.  These statues can be seen inside the lower shrine room of the upper temple (lhakang).

==Upper lhakang - Nalanda Temple==
[[File:Nalanda (upper) temple Nalanda Buddhist Institute, Punakha Dz Bhutan 2013.JPG|300px|thumbnail|Nalanda temple]]

The upper temple (lhakang) was originally as only a single story building that was later extended to a second storey by Je Jambashinyen, the 50th [[Je Khenpo]] of Bhutan.

===Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen (upper) shrine room===

====Central altar piece====

'''Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche Statue'''
On the main altar of the upper shrine room stands a clay statue of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche, the founder of Nalanda Monastery. He is sitting in a pose of teaching. He is dressed as the incarnation of [[Sambhogakaya]], the manifestation of a Buddha ornately dressed who possesses complete pure qualities.  He is wearing the six ornaments of the [[pāramitā]] (the six perfections) which include a five leaf crown, wrist bracelets, and ankle bracelets.

====Main altar (left to right)====

*Far left:	 Yonten Thaye, 13th Je Khenpo, clay statue one of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche's two main disciples.
*Second left: 	Kunga Jamtsho, 12th Je Khenpo, clay statue. The second of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche's two main disciples.
*Left: 	Lodro Gyeltsen, 39th Je Khenpo, also wearing Sambhogakaya ornaments.
*Right: 	Jampyel Shinyen, 50th Je Khenpo, clay statue. The builder of the second storey of the main Nalanda temple.
*Second right: 	[[Namgyälma]] (Ushnishavijaya), clay statue. Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche's guardian and tutelary deity. He made this statue himself.  While making the statue, he got distracted and began making a Green [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] statue. Namgyalma reminded him to make the statue of her. Hence, of the 3 faces of Namgyalma, the central face resembles Green Tara.
*Far right: 	Jow Je Pelden Atisha ([[Atiśa]]), the great Indian scholar.

====Alcove====
Access is restricted to the alcove where the main statue, Dorji Yudenma/Shengchong Wangmo, resides. There are a number of other small statues. The alcove entrance is flanked by clay and wooden statues of Yarsapa on the left, the protector deity of the valley; and his sister Pelzom Gyalmo, on the right.

====Special Wall paintings (clockwise from main altar)====

==Lower lhakang  - Sonam Gatshel Temple==
[[File:Sonam Gatshel temple Nalanda Buddhist Institute, Punakha Dz Bhutan 2013.JPG|300px|thumbnail|Sonam Gatshel temple]]
One of Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche’s main disciples built the original lower temple (Sonam Ghatsel temple) but it was destroyed by fire.  It was rebuilt in the 1960s, during the Fourth King’s (Jigme Singye Wangchuck) reign, with the support of the Queen Great Grandmother Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuk.

==Library==
A library and a classroom were constructed in 2010 to house reference texts in [[Dzongkha]], [[Sanskrit]] and English. These include books on [[Buddhist philosophy]] as well as English language, history, civic studies, geography and maths.  Student monks can borrow these reference books for to support the monastic curriculum or for their own personal interest and learning.

==Shedra curriculum==
A [[shedra]] is a Buddhist institute that includes the teaching of Buddhist philosophy, learning and playing of ritual instruments, making ritual cakes called [[tormas]] (Skt: balingta), reciting scriptures, conducting prayer ceremonies ([[pujas]]) for both special observance days and on behalf of members in the lay community. The technique of debate is used in the shedra as a way of verifying Buddhist logic and ensuring a firm understanding of Buddhist philosophy. 
[[File:Studying Nalanda Bhutan.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|Junior students read scriptures]]
[[File:Senior debating class Nalanda Buddhist Institute, Punakha Dz Bhutan 2013.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Senior students daily debating practice of buddhist philosophy]]
Debating practice requires at least one monk that is the answerer with at least another monk that is the questioner.  The answerer must give a competent answer to the question or otherwise face further questioning.  The debate of Buddhist logic continues between the questioner and answerer.  The technique of debate in the shedra helps to dispel confusion and illusion about Buddhist philosophical teachings.  It helps the mind to develop greater clarity about the nature of reality that includes the idea of a self and the experience of phenomena &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The second Nalanda beckons|author=Hernadi,Istvan)|magazine=Tashi Delek (Druk Air inflight magazine)|date=May–June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English Classes ==
Monks join NBI with a wide range of previous mainstream education. Some may not attended school at all whilst others may have completed Class X or even XII.  Recognising the importance of English in modern Bhutan, ex-Principal Khenpo Tshewang introduced English classes in 2006 making use of students who had completed higher school grades or local volunteers, thus the ability and availability of teachers has varied over time.
Nalanda Buddhist Institute divides students into four (4) groups based on their ability with English.  The monks learn speaking and conversational skills, vocabulary, reading, and writing. In addition to basic grammar, the monks are taught some subjects in English such as Buddhism, health and disease, and basic science.  English examinations are not a part of the standard monastic education but NBI will conduct them from 2014. 
English classes are held six (6) days a week between 7 and 8pm. The monastery happily welcomes visitors to visit the monastery and speak English with the monks.  The monks appreciate the opportunity to practice their English and enjoy learning about other people, their countries, and their cultures.
[[File:Monks playing homemade scrabble at Nalanda Buddhist Institute, Bhutan.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Monks practice spelling by playing homemade scrabble]]

==Inaugural Translation Class==
Under the direction and guidance of Khenpo Sonam Tshewang, the first dedicated Translation Class began at Nalanda Buddhist Institute in 2013.  The Translation Class is a three (3) year course where students focus on learning and improving English speaking, vocabulary, reading, and writing skills.  The goal is for the monks to translate documents as well as interpret for lopens (teachers) speaking in Dzongkha or Chokey to an English speaking audience.
English is used in tandem with [[Dzongkha]] (the official language of Bhutan), and Chokey ([[Classical Tibetan]]); the spiritual language used in many Buddhist texts; during translation.  Students learn how to translate between the three (3) languages. The class is focuses on learning Buddhist texts in English to enable translation into Dzongkha or Chokey, becoming familiar with the English vocabulary in common use for Buddhist concepts.  
In order to ensure full understanding and accurate translation students, other non-religious subjects are taught, such as planetary science and the secular view of the origin of the universe, basic anatomy and physiology, other religions, and traditions of Buddhism.

==Computer Laboratory==
The monastery got its first computers in 2007 and a small lab was established where monks could practice typing and use of basic software.
The monastery is upgrading its computer laboratory. With support from a local company in Thimphu and some government assistance, the monastery is acquiring ten (10) new computers and furniture.  The goal is for the computer laboratory to expand to thirty (30) computers as the opportunity becomes available.  The monks will begin lessons that will focus on: learning typing in both English and Dzongkha, using basic software and other computer skills although there is no internet connection. 
Future plans include creating Buddhist texts called [[pecha]]s and preservation of Buddhist texts.

==Three-Year Retreat Centre==
The [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] centre is located on the hillside below Nalanda Buddhist Institute. There are six cottages which can house twelve meditators for three-year retreats.  A small temple is also part of the retreat centre.

==Being Self Sufficient==
The monastery is looking into opportunities to become more self-sufficient while preserving and maintaining the precious environment and resources.  The monastery has goals for [[solar water heating]], [[solar cooking]] equipment or other energy efficient cooking equipment, a greenhouse for growing vegetables, and a clean water supply that includes watershed protection and conservation management.

==Ganden Jesa Dor (Heaven Viewing Rock)==

Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche was sitting on a big stone and appreciating the scenery around Nalanda when he saw a vision of [[Tusita]] Heaven (Ganden Heaven). He called to his two main disciples Je Kuenga and Je Yuenten.  When they came, he told them to sit on the stone and then held them by the waist.  When they looked at the same spot where Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche had been looking they also saw Tusita Heaven.  The stone where they sat is now a sacred spot at the monastery.   The stone has the special name, Ganden Jesa Dor or Heaven Viewing Rock.

==Gyalwang Shakya Tenpi Ningchey==
The [[tulku]] (reincarnation) of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen known as Gyalwang Tenpi Ningchey Rinpoche, has resided at Nalanda Buddhist Institute since the age of four &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://nigeldickinson.photoshelter.com/image/I0000shy3IvXFvEg|title=Tulku Gyelwang Tenpi Rinpoche|publisher=Nigel Dickinson| accessdate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://phajodingmonastery.com/gyalwa-shakya-rinchen-returns-to-phajoding/|title=Tulku Gyelwang Tenpi Rinpoche|publisher=Phajoding monastery| accessdate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
when he was recognised as a reincarnation of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche. 
[[Image:Gyelwang Tenpi Ningchey tulku.jpg|thumb|left|250px| Tulku Gyelwang Tenpi Ningchey Rinpoche standing on Ganden Viewing Rock]]
At the age of two or three, he recalled his previous life as Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche.  The monk body ([[Dratshang Lhentshog]]) of Bhutan formally recognised him as the reincarnation of Gyalwang Shakya Rinchen Rinpoche.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">The '''Octave''' is one of [[Luxembourg]]'s major annual religious celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knol.google.com/k/luxembourg-s-religious-traditions-part-2# LUXEMBOURG’S RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS]&lt;/ref&gt; It takes starts on the 3rd Sunday after [[Easter]] and closes with the Octave Procession on the 5th Sunday after Easter. It honours ''Our Lady of Luxembourg, Maria Mutter Jesu, Consolatrix Afflictorum, Patrona Civitatis et Patriae Luxemburgensis''.

==History==
The political, social and religious environment at the beginning of the Octave was characterised by the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618-1648) and the years of the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] (1626-1636): two thirds of the population died of the latter. This time of crisis was marked by war and famine.

At the same time, the Jesuit mission had a clear goal: through an attractive popular religiousness, the Catholic faith should be strengthened in the spirit of the [[Counter-Reformation]] of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545-1563), to prevent the spread of Protestantism.      
* 1 October 1603: The Jesuite college was founded in Luxembourg city     
* 1613-1621: The Jesuit church was built ([[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] since 1870)     
* 8 December 1624: Students from the Jesuit college carried a wooden, 73&amp;nbsp;cm high statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] in front of the city walls on the [[Glacis]]. Father Jacques Brocquart S.J. was the initiator of this pilgrimage, and gave the statue the title of ''Consolatrix Afflictorum ''(Comforter of the Afflicted'')''
* 1625-1628: The pilgrim's chapel was built on the Glacis, to be enlarged in 1640, and reconsecrated in 1642     
* 10 May 1666: Mary, Mother of Jesus, Comforter of the Afflicted, was elected the patroness of the city of Luxembourg      
* 20 February 1678: The Comforter of the Afflicted was elected patroness of the Duchy of Luxembourg and of the County of Chiny     
* 1766: First centenary: The cast-iron [[Votive offering|votive]] altar from the smithy of [[Orval Abbey]] was a gift from the people to their patroness     
* 1778: The Jesuit church became the parish church, after the Jesuit order was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, and the old parish church (St. Nicholas' church) had become decrepit     
* 1796: The pilgrims' chapel on the Glacis was destroyed by [[French Revolution]]ary troops. Since then the statue has been in the cathedral.      
* 1866: For the second centenary, the statue was ceremonially crowned with permission of Pope [[Pius IX]]     
* 1870: Luxembourg became a bishopric, and the old Jesuit church became the cathedral     
* 1921: Bishop [[Pierre Nommesch]] decided to make up for the 250th anniversary of the election of the patroness with a peace and anniversary Octave, since the celebrations had not taken place in 1916 due to World War I (and because Bishop [[Jean Joseph Koppes]] had been gravely ill). He also doubled the length of the Octave, as one week was no longer enough to accommodate all parishes and associations.     
* 1978: For the third centenary of the election as patroness of the country, the ''Fondation du Tricentenaire'' was founded.

==Election of Mary as patroness==
The text of the election act of Mary as patroness of the country on 20 February 1678 was as follows:

''Sainte Marie mere de JESUS Consolatrice des affliges, nous les trois Estats du Pays Dûche de Luxembourg et Comte de Chiny avec tous les habitans du Pays Vous choisisons aujourdhuy e mes nom et celuy de nos successeurs pour dame et patrone perpetuele de toute la Province, et professions fermement de vous honorer toujours pour tele. Cepourquoy nous vous supplions tres humblement de nous recevoir en vostre protection et de nous assister au temps de guerre, peste et famine et en toutes nos necessites et duersites. Amen''

Translation:

"Holy Mary, mother of Jesus, Comforter of the afflicted, we the three Estates of the Country Duchy of Luxembourg and County of Chiny with all the inhabitants of the Country choose You in our names and those of our successors, as lady and patroness perpetual of all the Province, and profess firmly to honour always. That is why we beg you very humbly to take us into your protection and to assist us in time of war, pestilence and famine and in all our needs and varieties. Amen."

The text was signed in the Jesuit church by the three estates (clergy, nobility and citizens of the towns), and by the magistrates of the 15 cities and the three "Franchises" of the Duchy of Luxembourg.

Thus the Virgin Mary Octave took on a national character. In [[World War II]], it also took on a patriotic meaning, and to this day belongs to the religious identity of Luxembourg.

The '''Prosperous Peace Party''' ({{lang-id|Partai Damai Sejahtera}}) was a [[Christian]]-democratic [[political party]] in [[Indonesia]]. It portrayed itself as the reincarnation of Parkindo, the Indonesian Christian Party, which contested the 1955 and 1971 elections. Although it was initially founded by Christians, the party was open to all religions, and 21 of its candidates in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]] were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;''Tempo'' magazine No. 0931/March 31-April 06, 2009, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2004|2004 Indonesian legislative election]], the party won 2.1% of the popular vote and 12 out of 550 seats, but in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]], the party won 1.5 percent of the votes, less than the required 2.5 percent electoral threshold, meaning it lost all its seats in the [[People's Representative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kpu.go.id/dmdocuments/modul_1d.pdf Indonesian General Election Commission website] "Bab V: Hasil Pemilu" (Section V: Election Results) p45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/05/10/democratic-party-controls-26-parliamentary-seats.html ''The Jakarta Post'' 10 May 2009] Democratic Party controls 26% of parliamentary seats&lt;/ref&gt;

The party agreed to merge along with 9 other parties into [[People's Conscience Party|Hanura]] on 10 March 2013 after failing to be certified to contest in the [[Indonesian legislative election, 2014|2014 legislative election]] by the Electoral Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2013/03/10/1741281/Sepuluh.Parpol.Tak.Lolos.Verifikasi.Gabung.ke.Hanura |author = Dian Maharani| title = Sepuluh Parpol Tak Lolos Verifikasi Gabung ke Hanura (Ten Paties that Failed the Verification Join Hanura) | date = 14 April 2011 | publisher = [[Kompas]] |language = Indonesian| access-date = 18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{also|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}

'''Sacrifice''' was a religious activity in [[Maya civilization|Maya culture]], involving either the [[Animal sacrifice|killing of animals]] or the [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]] by members of the community, in [[ritual]]s superintended by [[Maya priesthood|priests]]. Sacrifice has been a feature of almost all pre-modern societies at some stage of their development and for broadly the same reason: to propitiate or fulfill a perceived obligation towards the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]].

==Crisis and sacrifice==
What is known of Mayan ritual practices comes from two sources: the extant [[Maya codices|chronicles and codices]] of the [[Franciscan missions to the Maya|missionary-ethnographers]] who arrived with or shortly after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and subsequent archaeological data. The historical record is more sparse than that for the Aztecs,&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;Bancroft 1882, p/ 687.&lt;/ref&gt; and can only be reliable in regards to the Post-Classical period, long after the [[Classic Maya collapse]]. The chroniclers have also been accused of colonial bias, but the most comprehensive account of [[Maya society]],&lt;ref name="Landa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/maya/ybac/|title=Yucatan Before and After the Conquest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Diego de Landa]], has been described by modern experts as an "ethnographic masterpiece”,&lt;ref&gt;Wells 1996, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt; despite his role in the destruction of [[Maya codices]].

The archaeological data has continued to expand as more excavations are undertaken, confirming much of what the early chroniclers wrote. A major breakthrough was the deciphering of the [[Maya script|Maya syllabary]] in the 1950s, which has allowed the glyphs carved into many temples to be understood. Excavation and forensic examination of human remains has also thrown light on the age, sex and cause of [[death]] of sacrificial victims.

==Sacrifices in calendar and everyday rituals==
{{Maya civilization}}

[[File:British museum173.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|Lintel 24]] at [[Yaxchilan]], depicting [[Lady Xoc]] drawing a barbed rope through her tongue.]]
The Mayas engaged in a large number of festivals and rituals on fixed days of the year, many of which involved animal sacrifices and all of which seem to have involved blood letting. The ubiquity of this practice is a unique aspect of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture, and is now believed to have originated with the [[Olmec]]s,&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;Joyce et al 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; the region's first civilization.

Ritualised sacrifice was usually performed in public by religious or political leaders piercing a soft body part, most commonly the tongue, [[ear]] or [[foreskin]], and collecting the [[blood]] to smear directly on the [[Cult image|idol]] or collecting it on paper, which was then burned.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt; In what is today [[Nicaragua]], the blood was smeared on [[maize]], distributed to the people and baked into sacred bread.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, p.&amp;nbsp;710&lt;/ref&gt; The blood could also be collected from the non-elite, often from the foreskins of [[youth]]s (p.&amp;nbsp;678), or from high-ranking [[lady|women]].

The site of collection was of obvious ritual significance. Joralemon notes it is "virtually certain" that blood from the [[penis]] and the vagina were the most sacred and had "extraordinary [[Fertility|fertilizing power]]" and that such rituals were essential for the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of the natural world, particularly cultivated [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Jor"&gt;Joralemon 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; In one dramatic variant men and women "gathered in the temple in a line, and each made a pierced hole through the member, across from side to side, and then passed through as great a quantity of cord as they could stand; and thus all together fastened and strung together, they anointed the statue the Spanish considered to be sun worship of "[[Baʿal]]" from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;De Landa, pp.&amp;nbsp;47–48&lt;/ref&gt; But auto-sacrifice could also be an everyday event, with those passing by an [[Cult image|idol]] anointing it with blood drawn on the spot as a sign of piety.&lt;ref name="Jor"/&gt;

Blood sacrifice to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya gods]] was vigorously opposed by the [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spanish clergy]] as the most visible sign of native [[apostasy]], as De Landa, who was later to become the second bishop of the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]], makes clear:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"After the people had been thus instructed in [[religion]], and the youths benefitted as we have said, they were perverted by their priests and [[Chief of the Name|chiefs]] to return to their [[idolatry]]; this they did, making sacrifices not only by [[incense]], but also of human blood. Upon this the friars held an [[Inquisition]], calling upon the Alcalde Mayor for aid; they held trials and celebrated an [[Auto-da-fé|Auto]],&lt;ref&gt;The reference in this poorly translated passage is to an ''[[auto-da-fé]]''. See [[Diego de Landa#Suppression of the Maya|Suppression of the Maya]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; putting many on scaffolds, capped, shorn and beaten, and some in the penitential robes for a time. Some of the Indians out of grief, and deluded by the [[devil]], hung themselves; but generally they all showed much repentance and readiness to be good Christians."&lt;ref&gt;P. 30, with translator's footnote: "Landa evades saying here that it was under his own leadership and assumed authority that this assumption of full inquisitional rights, with a calling on the plenary civil power, went on.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mesoamerica]] lacked domesticated food animals such as sheep, cows and pigs,&lt;ref name="Diamond1997GGS"&gt;Diamond 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; so animal [[protein]] and byproducts could only be obtained by hunting. Montero-Lopez argues that on the basis of analysis of the distribution of deer parts in Classical Maya sites (white-tailed deer were the most common sacrificial and festive food animal), the archeological record does not support a clear distinction between the secular and sacred uses of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Montero Lopez 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After deer, the next most common sacrificial animals were dogs and various birds (whose heads were offered to the idols), followed by a wide range of more exotic creatures, from [[jaguar]]s to alligators. Animal sacrifice also seems to have been a common ritual before the commencement of any important task or undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, p.&amp;nbsp;687&lt;/ref&gt;

De Landa provides the most comprehensive account of [[Maya calendar|calendar festivals]] and rituals (chapters 34-40), but in none of these ''regular'' events is human sacrifice mentioned, which must mean his Maya informants were unaware of any instances since the cleric would hardly have suppressed such information.

[[File:Mexico Cenotes.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sacred Cenote]]: the site of an unknown number of human sacrifices]]
The traditional view is that the Mayans were far less prolific in sacrificing people than their [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|neighbours]]. Bancroft notes: "An event which in [[Mexico]] would be the death-signal to a [[hecatomb]] of human victims would in Yucatán be celebrated by the death of a spotted [[dog]]."(p.&amp;nbsp;704)
But mounting archeological evidence has for many decades now supported the chroniclers' contention that human [[sacrifice]] was far from unknown in Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiesler &amp; Cucina 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The city of [[Chichen Itza]], the main focus of Maya regional power from the Late Classical period, appears to have also been a major focus of [[human sacrifice]]. There are two natural [[sinkhole]]s, or ''[[cenote]]s'', at the site of the city, which would have provided a plentiful supply of potable [[water]]. The largest of these, [[Sacred Cenote|Cenote Sagrado]] (also known as the Well of Sacrifice), was where many victims were cast as an offering to the [[rain]] god [[Chaac]]. A 2007 study of remains taken from this ''cenote'' found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;de Anda Alanís 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
 Bancroft describes one procedure:&lt;blockquote&gt;A long cord was then fastened round the body of each victim, and the moment the smoke ceased to rise from the altar, all were hurled into the gulf. The crowd, which had gathered from every part of the country to see the sacrifice, immediately drew back from the brink of the pit and continued to pray without cessation for some time. The bodies were then drawn up and buried in the neighboring grove. (p.705)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is no consensus on why these sacrifices took place, their true scale at different times, or even who the victims were.

Because Maya society was organised as independent city states, the local political and religious elites could independently initiate human sacrifices as they saw fit. De Landa notes that a common cause for temple sacrifices in many cities was the occurrence of "[[Infectious disease|pestilence]]s, dissensions, or droughts or the like ills". (p.&amp;nbsp;91) In such cases, slaves were usually purchased and after a variety of rituals were anointed with blue [[dye]] and either shot with arrows through the [[heart]] or held on an altar while the priest swiftly removed the heart using a ceremonial knife. In either case the heart was presented to the [[temple]] [[Cult image|idol]], which was also anointed with [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;Pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bancroft, one tribe sacrificed illegitimate [[boy]]s twice a year, again by removing the heart, but collecting the blood in a bowl and scattering it to the four cardinal [[compass]] points within the temple.

Capturing prisoners after a successful battle also provided victims for sacrifice, presumably to propitiate whatever [[deity]] had promised victory in the first place, although there is no record of the Maya initiating conflicts solely for this purpose as was apparently the case with the Aztecs. Modern analysis of the [[ancient Maya art]] indicates a large number of representations of prisoners of war that are now understood to be sacrificial victims: "The analysis of the representations and sometimes of their context shows that the crossed-arms-on-the-chest gesture is associated with the concepts of [[Deference|submissiveness]], [[Hostage|captivity]] and death — in a word, sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;Baudez &amp; Matthews 1978 or 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maya vessel with sacrificial scene DMA 2005-26.jpg|thumb|Human sacrificial victim on a Maya vessel, 600–850 AD ''(Dallas Museum of Art)'']]
[[Mayanist]]s believe that, like the Aztecs, the Maya performed child sacrifice in specific circumstances, most commonly as foundation dedications for temples and other structures. Maya art from the [[Maya civilization#Classic|Classic period]] also depicts the extraction of children’s hearts during the ascension to the [[throne]] of the new [[ajaw|king]], or at the beginnings of the [[Maya calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of these cases, Stele 11 in [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], [[Guatemala]], a sacrificed boy can be seen. Other scenes of sacrificed boys are visible on jars.

As archeologists continue to excavate, more instances of child dedicatory sacrifices are being uncovered. A dig commenced in 1974 at the northern [[Belize]] site of [[Lamanai]] turned up the remains of five children, ranging in age from a newborn to about 8&amp;nbsp;years old:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conclusion that the five children were sacrificial victims is virtually inescapable... Nowhere else at Lamanai is there evidence of human sacrifice, either of children or adults... However, it is clear that the offering of children as part of the dedicatory activities that preceded the setting up of stelae was not uncommon at any time or place in the Maya lowlands."&lt;ref name="Pender"&gt;Pendergast 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 a mass grave of one- to two-year-old sacrificed children was found in the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] region of [[Comalcalco]]. The sacrifices were apparently performed for dedicatory purposes when building temples at the Comalcalco [[acropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;Marí 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

An excavation at [[Peru|El Perú-Waka’]] turned up the remains of an infant with, unusually, those of an adult male, in the presence of extensive evidence of feasting that had followed the expansion of a residence which had then been "ensouled" by the rituals and sacrifices. The analysis suggests that the "interments show that human sacrifice was not limited to the royal actors associated with the Classic Maya state, but could be practiced by lesser elites as part of their own private ceremonies"&lt;ref&gt;Eppich 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins, meaning and social function==

Both blood and human sacrifice were ubiquitous in all cultures of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, but beyond some uncontroversial generalisations there is no scholarly consensus on the broader questions (and specific mysteries) this raises. Most scholars agree that both practices arose among the Olmecs at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, and have been transmitted to subsequent cultures, including the Maya. Why they arose among the Olmecs is unknown, and probably unknowable, given the paucity of data.

Blood, and by extension the still-beating heart, is the central element in both the ethnography and iconography of sacrifice, and its use through ritual established or renewed for the Maya a connection with the sacred that was for them essential to the very existence of the natural order. Julian Lee’s observation that the Maya "drew no sharp distinction between the [[Animism|animate and the inanimate]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lee 1996, p.413.&lt;/ref&gt; and the remarks by Pendergast&lt;ref name="Pender"/&gt; and others that sacrifices "ensouled" buildings and idols indicates a social meaning, as Reilly suggests, most akin to [[transubstantiation]]&lt;ref&gt;Reilly 1991, p.158.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a literal rather than symbolic transformation on which the [[destiny|fate]] of the world and its inhabitants depended.

As with all known theocratic societies, it is likely the Maya political and religious elites played mutually reinforcing roles in supporting the position of the other and ensuring the social stability essential for both, with sacrifice rituals functioning as the performative centrepiece of communal integration. But on likely divergences of interests between different social groups in regard to sacrifice rituals, including within these elites, the historical record has so far been silent.

Heelas writes in his very first paragraph: "And the founder of est (the highly influential seminar training established by Erhard in 1971) observes that, 'Of all the disciplines that I studied, and learned, Zen was the ''essential'' one.'" (page 167). And Heelas goes on to discuss est and Erhard a few pages later: "No European city comes anywhere near the 'one out of 34 adults have taken est' figure provided by this organisation for Boston. [...] To the extent that Erhard, for example, is a latter-day Gurdjieffian (it is surely not a coincidence that he devotes himself to what he calls 'The Work') he can appeal to a similar clientele as those attracted to the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man."

Going back a step, however, these developments in turn largely derive from events in Europe. One event, above all others, stands out: Gurdjieff's establishment, in 1922, if the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. [...] Gurdjieff's Institute paved the weay for what was to follow. [...] ASll the basic ingredients of the self-religions are [...] in evidence. As well as provoking what was to come, Gurdjieff's 'The Work' is still alive and well. [...] Between five and ten thousand attend centres [in England] (including the Gurdjieff Ouspensky School), and then there are those attached to such neo-Gurdjieffian movements as Arica, the Emis Foundation (700) and the School of Economic Science.

A '''Sheikh''' or sheik (Arabic: شيخ shaykh; ; pl. شيوخ shuyūkh),  of '''Sufism''' is a [[Sufi]] who is authorized to teach, initiate and guide aspiring [[dervish]]es in the islamic faith. The sheik is vital to the path of the novice Sufi, for the sheik has himself travelled the path of mysticism. Viewed as the spiritual master, the sheik forms a formal allegiance (bay'a) to the disciple of Sufism and authorizes the disciple's travels and helps the disciple along the mystical path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|  first=Arthur|title=Sufi Heirs of the Prophet|year=1998|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition focuses on the importance of chains and legitimization. In Sufism, sheiks are connected by a continuous spiritual chain (isnad, [[Hadith studies#The sanad and the matn|sanad]], [[silsila]]). This chain links every previous Sufi sheik, and eventually can be traced back to the Successors, and in later times to the Prophet himself. As Sufism grew, influential shayks began to acquire spiritual centers and waypoints known as  [[khanqah]], [[ribat]], and [[zaouia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur|title=Sufi Heirs of the Prophet|year=1998|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikhs duplicate the Prophetic realities, and are also expected to perform and act as an intermediary between the Creator and the created, since the sheikh has arrived close to God through his meditations and spiritual travels. There are several types of such sheikh.

==A sheik of barakah (blessing)==

This can, for example, be someone who inherits leadership of a group of Sufis, who although he does not have the spiritual standing of a genuine sheik of Tarbiyah (Instruction) nevertheless has a blessing in that by holding to him his followers have unity and community, as is in the Noble [[Hadith]], "The hand of [[Allah]] is with the group (jama'ah)."

==A sheik of Ahwal (states)==
This is a sheik who has genuine tasting of the states of Sufism and can transmit them.

==A sheik of Tarbiyah (instruction)==
This is properly the correct usage of the term sheik according to the Sufis. This is the realised gnostic ('arif) of Allah, who has been granted idhn (permission and authorisation) by God(Allah), to lead the followers of the path of Sufism to knowledge of Allah. This idhn is not to be confused with [[ijazah]] (authorisation) granted by a sheik or a scholar to a student to teach. Even if all of the scholars and sheiks granted their ijazah to a student, he would still not be a sheik of Instruction until he had the idhn of Allah and Muhammad. This is manifest in his tawfiq or 'success' in inculcating the perfections of Islam, [[Iman (concept)|iman]] and [[ihsan]] in his disciples [point 8, below].

==The Teaching-sheik==
The sheik of Sufism derives authority and social standing from his sacred knowledge. Students would be taught this knowledge in inner religious circles located in private homes and in mosques, hoping to create an atmosphere of refined religious thought that would safeguard the transmission of religious knowledge. By studying the [[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]] in these circles, the students would learn proper decorum and etiquette. From this the Sufi sheiks would establish a set or rituals and practices that would perpetuate the culture of Sufi learning, based upon the [[Sunnah]]. Having personal contact with a sheik allows both Sufis and the [[ulama]] to stimulate a culture of religious learning. The legitimacy of the sheik is based on the unbroken chain of authors or other sheiks. The shorter the chain the more authoritative the person becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur|title=Sufi Heirs of the Prophet|year=1998|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching-sheiks provided their disciples with religious instruction as well as theology. During this time student travelled and interacted with different teacher-sheiks. Sufi sheiks flourished throughout the Islamic world more than any other type of personal authority because their mediatory skills were required for the smooth functioning of an agrarian-nomadic economy with a decentralized form of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|title=Irfan revisited: Khomeini and the Legacy of Islamic Mystical Philosophy|journal=Middle East Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SufiAuthority.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|Sufi Authority]] --&gt;

==The Directing-sheik==
With the advent of institutionalized Sufism in the ninth century came the changed relationship between disciple and sheik. This came at a time in the Islamic world when other institutions were spreading to an ever far-reaching Islamic world, and were facing a collapsing caliphal empire. The sheik became a more authoritative figure, and become synonymous with prophetic traits as well as a totally functional leader. The sheik took on a new role as a permanent and known teacher, not a teaching-guide to a group of disciples. The sheik had permanent residence in a lodge and surrounded himself with his students. The disciples would live with the sheik and would follow the sheiks rules and prescribed behaviors. The lodge became an integral part of the Muslim community, as it maintained land holdings and also supported economic activities in cities. The directing-sheik became an authority for those seeking training and a strengthening of their moral and intellectual character. The shift from teaching-sheik to directing-sheik brought about an unprecedented focus on decorum ([[Adab (behavior)|adab]]). Directing-sheiks core characteristic was set within the Sufi context of training others to approach God more closely and intimately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buehler|first=Arthur|title=Sufi Heirs of the Prophet|year=1998|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, S.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the experience of learning the mystical path of Sufism underneath the guise of the directing-sheik was much more intense than that of the teacher-sheik.

==Khirka==
The importance of lineage in Sufism is exhibited by one such example as the Khirka. Khirka literally meaning, "Rough cloak, scapular, coarse gown". The cloak acts as an initiation process in Sufism in which the sheik puts his khirka on the disciple, or known as "Investiture with the Cloak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Hadith Muhammad's Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World|publisher=Oxford|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acts as the manifestation of blessings being transmitted from sheik to disciple. The act is reminiscent of when the Prophet Muhammad placed a cloak over Ali. This process solidifies the sheik-disciple relationship and creates an allegiance. After this process the disciple is able to join the Sufi order and continue studying underneath the sheik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Michon|title=Ḵh̲irḳa|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-4293&gt;|publisher=Brill|accessdate=4/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silsila==
Silsila is used in Sufism to describe the continuous spiritual chain that links Sufi orders and sheiks in a lineage relating back to the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trimingham|first=J.L.|title=Silsila|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-7032|publisher=Brill Online|accessdate=4/2/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Necessary qualifications of a sheik==
The basic requirements for a person to be a Sufi sheik are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tariqa Notes - sheik Nuh Ha Mim Keller | work=Masud.co.uk | url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh | accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Being a Sunni Muslim with valid tenants of faith ('[[aqida]])
# Being a scholar ('[['alim|alim]]) of Sacred Law capable of answering most questions about what Allah expects of him and his students without having to ask someone else.
# Having a verifiably public authorization from a spiritual guide to be a spiritual guide, connecting him through a chain of transmission ([[silsila]]) without a single break back to the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him and give him peace).
# Being suitable to take as an exemplar in the religion, not disobedient or wicked in his personal life.
# Knowing the fundamental terms of [[Sufism]] such as [[Fanaa (Sufism)|fanaa]]' (annihilation), [[baqaa]]' (subsistence), [[marifa]] (gnosis), and the rest, by having actually tread the path under a sheik and understood them at first hand.
# Exalting the commands of Allah in word and deed, and knowing that it is above every human being.
# Having permission from Allah and [[Muhammad]] - beyond the authorization given to him by his sheik - manifest in his tawfiq or 'success' in inculcating the perfections of Islam, iman and ihsan in his disciples.
# Finding a disciple capable of taking his teaching and absorbing his secret from him; that is, being the sheik that Allah has destined for that disciple.
# Not being self-satisfied, or veiled from his own neediness to Allah by his disciples' need for him.

The customary position with the people of Sufism, particularly in the Shadhili and the Darqawi tariqah, is that a person will not be a sheik without having had a background in the basic disciplines of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah|Sunna]]. This is the position of [[Imam]] [[Junayd]]. However, in unusual circumstances there have been exceptions to this rule, among them the famous wali, Abd al-Aziz ad-Dabbagh [http://www.bogvaerker.dk/ibriz.html] of Fez, and in the Darqawi tariqah, the sheik Sidi al-'Arabi ibn al-Huwari from whom sheik Muhammad ibn al-Habib took the tariqah, and most famously sheik [[Ahmad al-Alawi]], a master of Sufism whom all accept without reservation.

==The Conditions of a Disciple (related)==
# Having a valid aim in taking the path, meaning Allah alone and nothing besides.
# Being genuine, meaning convinced of the secret between one's sheik and Allah, and willing to submit, and listen, and follow.
# Having good manners, noble character, and respect for others.
# Having praiseworthy states such as patience, silence, reliance on [[Allah]], nonattachment to material things, and lack of curiosity about what does not concern one.
# Giving selfless service, whether convenient or inconvenient, to [[Allah]], the sunnah, the [[tariqa]], and to one's fellow man.
# Venerating the Allah and [[Muhammad]], its religion, its friends ([[awliya']]), and everything else it is said to have exalted.
# Having high spiritual resolve.
# Unfalteringly carrying out one's decisions, undeterred by the Devil, this world, one's ego, or vain caprice.

[[File:50番繁多寺前で托鉢する遍路P1010122.jpg|thumb|[[Japan]]]]

'''Takuhatsu''' (托鉢) is a traditional form of [[dāna]] or alms given to [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]s in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=OxfordRef/&gt; In the practice of takuhatsu, monks travel to various businesses and residences in order to exchange chanting of sutras in Sino-Japanese (generating merit) for donations of food and money.

Monks generally wear traditional takuhatsu clothes reminiscent of medieval Japanese garb and wear the names of their monasteries on their satchels to confirm their identities. This system is used by [[Zen]] monks who are in training, to beg for their food. This is generally done in groups of ten to fifteen. The group goes through the street single-file, chanting {{Nihongo||法|Hō|[[dharma]]}}, and sympathizers come down and fill their alms bowls. This is the monks offering of the Dharma and their lives of guardians of the Dharma to the people. According to Zen tradition, the givers should be grateful.&lt;ref&gt;Reps &amp; Senzaki, p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Culture of Disbelief''''' ({{ISBN|0-385-47498-9}}) is a 1994 book by [[Stephen L. Carter]]. In it, he holds that [[religion]] in the United States is trivialized by American [[law]] and [[politics]], and that those with a strong religious faith are forced to bend to meet the viewpoint of a "public faith" which is largely faithless. Carter argues that there is a place for faith in public life, while still adhering to the [[separation of church and state]].

[[File:Honorius.jpg|thumb|''Grimoire du Pape Honorius'' (1760)]]
'''''The Grimoire of Pope Honorius''''', or '''''Le Grimoire du Pape Honorius''''', is an 18th to 19th century [[grimoire]], claiming to be written by [[Pope Honorius III]] (1150 - 1227). It is unique among grimoires in that it was specifically designed to be used by a priest, and some of the instructions include saying a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. While its name is derived from the 13th century ''[[Grimoire of Honorius]]'', its content is closer to later grimories like the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'' and ''[[Grimorium Verum]]''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/grimhono.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ida10-1.jpg|270px|thumb|right|3100px|[[Pope Pius XII]]]] --&gt;
The '''theology of [[Pope Pius XII]]''' comprised forty-one [[encyclicals]], as well as speeches and nearly 1000 messages, during his long pontificate. The encyclicals ''[[Mystici corporis]]'' and ''[[Mediator Dei]]'' clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' opened the doors for biblical research. But his magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, [[education]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[war]] and [[peace]], the life of [[saints]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of [[God]], things eternal and temporal.

==The Unity of Human Society==
{{Main|Summi Pontificatus}}
Addressing the problems of racism and anti-semitism in 1939, Pius XII said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What a wonderful vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in God in the unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain and develop life;  in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for all. (''Summi Pontificatus'', 3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this first of his encyclicals, [[Summi Pontificatus]], he developed a  main theme of his pontificate.  Christianity is  universal, and therefore opposed to racial or national hostility and superiority.  He continues this theme in other encyclicals, such as ''[[Mystici corporis]]'' and ''[[Mediator Dei]]'', and in numerous speeches and addresses. There are no racial differences because the human race forms a unity, for "from one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth".

Nations, despite a difference of development due to diverse conditions of life and of culture, are not destined to break the unity of the human race, but rather to enrich and embellish it by the sharing of their own peculiar gifts and by a reciprocal interchange.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. Summi Pontificatus, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  All races, the whole human race,  are loved by Christ  without exception or exclusion. Differences in nationality and race do not matter. True love means loving all, if they are Catholic, Christian, or not.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1939, 413&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rquote|right|Oh, the teachings of Pius XII. He understood to adapt the magisterium of the Church to the most modern thinking.|[[Pope John XXIII]]|referring to more than 8000 pages of papal teaching.&lt;ref&gt;John XXIII, Pius XII, in Domenico Tardini, Pius XII, Roma 1959, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Church as the mystical body of Christ==
{{Main|Mystici corporis Christi}}
* If we would define and describe this true [[local church|Church]] of [[Jesus Christ]] - which is the One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church  &lt;ref&gt;Vat. Council, Const. de Ecc. Cf. ibidem, Const. de fide cath., c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;- we shall find nothing more noble, more sublime, or more divine than the expression "the Mystical Body of Christ" - an expression which springs from and is, as it were, the fair flowering of the repeated teaching of the Sacred Scriptures and the Holy Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Mystici corporis Christi'', 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church is called body, because she is a living entity, she is called the body of Christ, because Christ is her Head and Founder; she is called mystical body, because she is neither a purely physical nor a purely spiritual unity, but  super national.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1943, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pius XII]] builds on a theological development in the 1920s and 1930s in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[England]], which all re-discovered the ancient Pauline concept of the Mystical Body of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;La Cristologia in Italia 1930–1990, Sergio de Marchi, Piemme,  1994, P. Parente, De Verbo Incarnato, 1933,  Hofmann, Der Kirchenbegriff des hl. Augustinus, München 1933, H. Käppeli, Zur Lehre des hl. Thomans von Aquin  vom Corpus Christi  Mysticum, Freiburg, 1931,  E Mersch, Le Corps Mystique du Christ 2 Vol. Paris, 1936, A E Rawloson, Corpus Christi Mysticum, Berlin, 1931,  Robinson, H Wheeler, The Cross of the Servant, London, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pius XII]] utilized these new discoveries and authoritatively added his directions to them, as the Dutch Jesuit [[Sebastian Tromp]] documented.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Tromp: Annotations ad enc MC Periodica 32, 1943, pp 377-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has two aspects, a visible and an invisible one. Full membership have those who live under the visible representative of Christ.  The relation of the faithful with Christ is mystical, not  physical.  The faithful, through their faith hope and love, are  united  with Christ in the Church. Christ loves and lives in the faithful. Christ and the Church as the whole Church, which is alive through the Holy Spirit. Each of the faithful is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore  an equal and important element of the body of Christ.  The unification with Christ takes place in the Holy Eucharist.  Within the Church, there exist not an active and passive element,   leadership and  lay people. All members of the Church are called to work  on the  perfection of the body of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Mystici corporis Christi''&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church is the animating principle of human society. Therefore, they in particular ought to have an ever-clearer consciousness not only of belonging to the Church, but of being the Church, that is to say, the community of the faithful on earth under the leadership of the Pope, the common Head, and of the bishops in communion with him. They are the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Discourse, 20 February 1946:AAS 38 (1946) 149; quoted by John Paul II, CL 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgy reforms==

{{Main|Pope Pius XII Liturgy Reforms|Mediator Dei}}

In his encyclical [[Mediator Dei]],  Pope Pius  links [[liturgy]] with the last will of [[Christ]].

:"But it is His will,  that the worship He instituted and practiced during His life on earth shall continue ever afterwards without intermission. For he has not left mankind an [[orphan]]. He still offers us the support of His powerful, unfailing intercession, acting as our "advocate with the Father." He aids us likewise through His Church, where He is present indefectibly as the ages run their course: through the Church which He constituted "the pillar of truth" and dispenser of grace, and which by His sacrifice on the cross, He founded, consecrated and confirmed forever. "&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, Mediator Dei, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself,  teaching all men the truth, and, offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way,  the Church re-establishes the unity between the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and His creatures,  a unity which turns strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, Mediator Dei,  19&lt;/ref&gt;  The sacrifice of the altar, being Christ's own actions, convey and dispense divine  grace from Christ  to the members of the Mystical Body.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1947, Mediator Dei,  31&lt;/ref&gt;

Liturgy requires participation of The faithful. Pius rejects the widespread Catholic practices of  private and interior devotions by  individuals during Holy Mass as  sterile. They separate the faithful "from the sacrifice of the altar, and  from the stream of vital energy that flows from Head to members". Catholic  worship offers to God a joint  profession of Catholic faith and a continuous exercise of hope and charity.  The entire liturgy, therefore, has the Catholic faith as  its content.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1947,  Mediator Dei,  47&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerous Liturgy reforms  of Pius XII show two characteristics.  Renewal and the rediscovery of old liturgical traditions, such as the reintroduction of the [[Easter Vigil]], and,  a more structured atmosphere within the Church buildings.  The use of [[vernacular]] language, accepted in certain cases by Pope Pius, was hotly debated at his time. He increased  non-Latin services, especially in countries with expanding Catholic mission activities. After the Dogma of the Assumption, a new mass formula was introduced for the festivities  15 August. The ''Sacred Congregation of Rites''  had jurisdiction over the Rites  and ceremonies of the Latin Church,  such as Holy Mass,  sacred functions and divine worship. The location of the Blessed Sacrament within the Church, to be always at the main altar in the centre of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1957,  425&lt;/ref&gt; The Church should display religious objects, but not be overloaded with secondary objects or even [[Kitsch]]. [[Modern art|Modern]] sacred  [[art]]  should be reverential and reflect the spirit of our time.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1952, 542-546&lt;/ref&gt; Priests  are permitted to officiate marriages without Holy Mass. They may also officiate confirmations in certain instances.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1946, 349-354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred Scriptures==

In 1893,  [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued  in ''[[Providentissimus Deus]]''  instructions for biblical research. Fifty years later,  [[Pius XII]] recalls the progress made. In his encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', published in 1943 &lt;ref&gt;AAS 1943, 297,&lt;/ref&gt; he encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the [[Bible]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope Leo XIII's]] encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient  [[Jewish]] history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests  a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures  in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1943, 305,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mariology and the Dogma of the Assumption==
{{Main|Mariology of Pope Pius XII}}
[[File:SalusPopuliromanicrowned.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The [[Salus Populi Romani]] was venerated by Pope Pius XII. Here he celebrated his first mass on April 1, 1899. A rare picture of Salus Populi Romani crowned for the [[Marian year]] 1954 by Pius XII'']]
The 1854 dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]]  by [[Pius IX]]  defined the Virgin conceived without sin, as the mother of God and our mother.  Pope Pius XII  built on this  in ''[[Mystici corporis]]'', which summarizes his [[mariology]]:    Maria, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls,  "''in the name of the whole human race''" gave her consent "for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature.",&lt;ref&gt;Office for Holy Week&lt;/ref&gt; thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material.  She who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, became mother of all His members. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer,  should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost.&lt;ref name = "EMCC-110"&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Mystici corporis Christi'', 110&lt;/ref&gt;  She is  Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ,  and  reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.&lt;ref name = "EMCC-110"/&gt;

On 1 November 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma of the assumption:

:"By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Mother of God]], the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1950, 753&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogma of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary, is the crowning  of the theology of Pope Pius XII. It was preceded by the 1946 encyclical [[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]],  which  requested  all  Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. In this dogmatic statement, the phrase ''"having completed the course of her earthly life, "'' leaves open the question of whether the Virgin  Mary died before her Assumption, or, whether she  was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed. Mary's Assumption was a divine gift to Mary as [[Mother of God]]. As Mary completed her race as a shining example to the human race,  the perspective of the gift of assumption is offered to the whole human race.

As a young boy and in later life [[Eugenio Pacelli]] was an ardent follower  of the [[Virgin Mary]].  On 8 September 1953, the encyclical [[Fulgens corona]] announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] .&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, 577&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Pius XII left open the [[Mediatrix]] question, the  role of the Virgin  in the salvation acts of her son Jesus Christ. In the encyclical [[Ad caeli reginam]] he promulgated the feast, [[Queenship of Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954, 625&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pius XII]], who was consecrated  on 13 May 1917, the very day, [[Our Lady of Fatima]] is believed to have first appeared,  consecrated the world to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in 1942, in accordance with the second "secret" of Our Lady of Fatima. (His remains were to be buried  in the crypt of Saint Peter Basilica on the feast day  of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], 13 October 1958)

==Church and society==
===Medical theology===
Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers. Pio XII, ''Discorsi Ai Medici'' compiles 700 pages of specific addresses. Pope Pius XII addressed [[physician|doctors]], nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of  rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca,  but also issues of uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII went often new ways, thus he was  first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may  shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM Pope Pius XII, The Moral Limits of Medical Research and Treatment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200244/http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM |date=21 August 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other topics were the behaviour of medical doctors, facing [[pain]] and [[death]], [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilisation]], [[genetics]], [[artificial insemination]],  painless child birth, the multiple moral aspects of developing medical technologies, [[morality]] in applied [[psychology]], moral limits to medical research and treatment, and [[cancer]] treatment of [[children]], and more.

===Sexuality and conscience===
Pope Pius XII fully accepted the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]] as a moral form of [[family planning]], although only limited circumstances, within the context of family.&lt;ref name="midwives"&gt;Two speeches on 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951: ''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given to the Italian Catholic Union of midwives 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, DC.  Text of the speeches available from [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P511029.HTM EWTN] or [http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=3462 CatholicCulture.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholics interpreted the 1930 encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' by Pope Pius XI to allow moral use of the rhythm method,&lt;ref name="kippley"&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley |author2=Sheila Kippley  | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2 | pages=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and internal rulings of the Catholic Church in 1853 and 1880&lt;!--

Some historians consider these two speeches by Pius XII to be the first explicit Church acceptance of the method.&lt;ref name="wife"&gt;{{cite book | first=Marilyn | last=Shannon | year=2001 | title=A History of the Wife | edition=First | pages=307 | publisher=HarperCollins | location=New York | isbn=0-06-019338-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to mid-wives, Pope Pius XII offered this understanding of [[Human sexuality|sexual]] pleasures: "The Creator himself... established that in the [generative] function, spouses should experience pleasure and enjoyment of body and spirit. Therefore, the spouses do nothing evil in seeking this pleasure and enjoyment. They accept what the Creator has intended for them. At the same time, spouses should know how to keep themselves within the limits of just moderation."&lt;ref name="midwives" /&gt;

To Pius XII, "The [[conscience]] is the innermost and most secret nucleus of man. There he withdraws with his intellectual capacities into complete separation, alone with himself or better, alone with God, whose voice echoes in his conscience.  There he decides over good or bad. There chooses between victory or defeat.  The conscience is therefore, to use an old, venerable picture, a sanctuary, on whose entrance all must stop."&lt;ref&gt;Radiomessaggio, La Coscienza Cristiana come oggetto della educazione, in Pio XII, Discorsi, Vol XIV,  p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This respect applies to children and  even more to adults: "It is correctly argued, that the true meaning of adult independence is not to be led like a little Child."

[[Vatican II]] picked up this quote on conscience from Pius XII verbatim in ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', and concluded: "By conscience, in a wonderful way, that law is recognized, which is fulfilled in the love of God and neighbour."&lt;ref&gt;Vatican II, ''Lumen gentium'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, the [[Magisterium]] of the Church explicitly highlights this particular view of Pope Pius XII, quoting it as an element of the official Catholic Catechism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2000 | url=http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.htm#2362 | title =#2362 | work =Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition | pages =Article 6: The Sixth Commandment | publisher =United States Catholic Conference | accessdate = 2008-02-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101121225/http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art6.htm#2362 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church's modern view on family planning was further developed in the 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]]&lt;ref&gt;Pope Paul VI. (1968). ''[[Humanae vitae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 2005 encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]''.

===Theology and Science===
To Pius XII, [[science]] and [[religion]] were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term&lt;ref&gt;Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1940, p407; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1942, p.52; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1946, p.89 Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1951, p.28.221.413.574&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding their  relation, his advisor Professor Robert  Leiber wrote: "''Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo."''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Leiber,  Pius XII Stimmen der Zeit, November 1958  in Pius XII. Sagt, Frankfurt 1959, p.411&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding similar praises from [[Pope John Paul II]]  in 1992, Pope Pius XII listed, in 1939, Galileo in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences to be among ''"most audacious heroes of research...not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments"''&lt;ref&gt;Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences  1939–1986, Vatican City, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius commenting on "the state and nature of original matter"  acknowledges  that science declares this to be an "insoluble enigma" but continues, that "it seems that science of today, by going back in one leap millions of centuries, has succeeded in being witness to that primordial ''Fiat Lux'' when,  out of nothing,  there burst forth with matter a sea of light and radiation, while the particles of chemical elements split and reunited in million of galaxies"&lt;ref&gt;Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences 1939–1986, Vatican City,  p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;   Pius continued, that these facts need further investigation, and theories founded upon them need "new developments and proofs in order to offer a secure basis for reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of the Sciences  1939–1986, Vatican City,  p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
{{Main|Humani generis}}
In 1950, Pope Pius XII  teaches, there is no sufficient basis for a comprehensive belief in evolution, because the facts are still missing. Catholic religion can take evolution theory  into account at some time:
''This certainly would be praiseworthy in the case of clearly proved facts; but caution must be used when there is rather question of hypotheses, having some sort of scientific foundation, in which the doctrine contained in Sacred Scripture or in Tradition is involved''.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclical took up a nuanced position with regard to evolution: The question of the origin of man's body from pre-existing and living matter is a legitimate matter of inquiry for natural science. Catholics are free to form their own opinions, but they should do so cautiously; they should not confuse fact with conjecture, and they should respect the Church's right to define matters touching on Revelation&lt;ref&gt;.&lt; Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 36&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ''For these reasons the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter&amp;nbsp;– for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God''.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Pius acknowledged in 1950, that [[evolution]] might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who use it as a religion, who "imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution... explains the origin of all things".   While ''Humani generis'' was significant as the first occasion on which a pope explicitly addressed the topic of evolution at length, it did not represent a change in doctrine for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. As early as 1868, Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] wrote, "the theory of Darwin, true or not, is not necessarily atheistic; on the contrary, it may simply be suggesting a larger idea of divine providence and skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323080822/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=18503 |archivedate=23 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }} Catholic Online&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Paul II|Pope John Paul II]] went further in acknowledging the success of evolutionary theory in his 1996 ''Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences''. He called evolution "more than a hypothesis" and said, "It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge, but maintained the line of his predecessor, Pope Pius XII, regarding the origin of the soul in God."&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II. (1996). [http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8712_message_from_the_pope_1996_1_3_2001.asp  ''Message to Pontifical Academy of Sciences''].&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclical issues a clear no to another scientific opinion popular at the time, [[polygenism]], "the scientific hypothesis that mankind descended from a group of original humans."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galg gem.jpg|right|180px|thumb|[[Gemma Galgani]] was canonized in 1940 by Pius XII.]]
The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history to publish papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]]  in [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the [[Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today.   In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or "walled in",&lt;ref&gt;Communication,  Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid detection by the advancing German army.  Insisting that all publications  must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time,  were never published or appeared only once  issued in the Vatican daily, [[Osservatore Romano]]. An array of sources exists today, not all of them available in English. This applies especially  to the many speeches and addresses to various groups. Available are:
**''Acta Apostolicae Sedis. (AAS), Vatican City 1939–1958.'' Official documents of the Pontificate of Pope Pius XII
**''Pio  XII, Discorsi e Radio Messaggi di Sua Santita Pio XII'', Vatican City 1939–1958, Official speeches of Pius XII, 20 vol.
**''Pio XII, Discorsi Ai Medici'' collected byFiorenzo Angelini,  Roma, 1959, 725 pages, Italian, medical theology and morality.

A small percentage of the Pope Pius XII  publications are available on internet on the Vatican Website.

==Canonizations and beatifications==
{{Main|Saints canonized by Pope Pius XII|Beatifications of Pope Pius XII}}
Pope Pius XII [[canonization|canonized]] numerous  saints, including [[Pope Pius X]] and [[Maria Goretti]]. He beatified [[Pope Innocent XI]]. The first canonizations were two women, the founder of a female order, [[Mary Euphrasia Pelletier]], and [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Gemma Galgani]]. Pelletier had  a reputation for opening new ways for Catholic charities, helping people in difficulties with the law, who so far were neglected by the system and the Church. Galgani was a rather unknown girl whose virtue became model  by her canonization.&lt;ref&gt;Pascalina Lehnert, ''Pius XII, Ich durfte ihm dienen,'' Würzburg, 1982, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thero''''' (commonly appearing in the masculine and feminine forms '''''thera''''' and '''''therī''''' respectively) is an [[honorific]] term in [[Pali]] for senior [[bhikkhu]]s and [[bhikkhuni]]s (Buddhist monks and nuns) in the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Buddhist monastic order]]. The word literally means "elder". These terms, appearing at the end of a monastic's [[dharma name|given name]], are used to distinguish those who have at least 10 years since their ''[[upasampada]]'' (higher ordination). The name of an important collection of very early Buddhist poetry is called the ''[[Therigatha]]'', "verses of the ''therīs''".

The terms '''''mahāthera''''' and '''''mahātherī''''' are used to refer to very distinguished elderly and venerable monks and nuns considered to have reached a higher level of spiritual development.

Usage of these terms varies according to the [[Schools of Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]] and culture. In [[Sri Lanka]], these terms are widely used.

Some prominent theras and therīs:
* [[Ananda]] thera
* [[Mahapajapati Gotami]] therī
* [[Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero]]
* [[Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thero]]
* [[Ayya Tathaaloka]] therī
* [[Gangodawila Soma Thero]]

'''Venkateswara Temple''' is a landmark Vaishnavite temple situated in the hill town of [[Tirumala]] at [[Tirupati]] in [[Chittoor district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]], India. The Temple is dedicated to Lord [[Venkateswara|Sri Venkateswara]], an incarnation of [[Vishnu]], who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from trials and troubles of [[Kali Yuga]]. Hence the place has also got the name Kaliyuga [[Vaikuntham]] and the Lord here is referred to as Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam. The temple is also known by other names like Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple, Tirupati Balaji Temple. Lord Venkateswara is known by many other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_about.htm |title=Tirumala Temple |accessdate=13 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011032254/http://tirumala.org/maintemple_about.htm |archive-date=11 October 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirumala Hills are part of [[Seshachalam Hills]] range. The hills are {{convert|853|m|ft}} above sea level. The Hills comprises [[sapthagiri|seven peaks]], representing the seven heads of [[Adisesha]]. The temple lies on the seventh peak -[[Venkata (hill)|Venkatadri]], on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. Hence the temple is also referred to as "Temple of Seven Hills". Tirumala town covers about {{convert|10.33|sqmi|km2|2|abbr=on}} in area.

The Temple is constructed in Dravidian architecture and is believed to be constructed over a period of time starting from 300 AD. The Garbagriha (Sanctum Sanctorum) is called AnandaNilayam. The presiding deity, Venkateswara, is in standing posture and faces east in Garbha griha. The temple follows Vaikhanasa Agama tradition of worship. The temple is one of the eight Vishnu Swayambhu Kshetras and is listed as 106th and the last earthly [[Divya Desam]]. The Temple premises had two modern Queue complex buildings to organize the pilgrim rush, Tarigonda Vengamamba Annaprasadam complex for free meals to Pilgrims, hair tonsure buildings and a number of pilgrim lodging sites.

It is the richest temple in the world in terms of donations received and wealth.&lt;ref name="ndtv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070026005| title=NDTV Report | accessdate=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSHindu"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sivaratnam |first1=C |year=1964 |title=An Outline of the Cultural History and Principles of Hinduism |publisher= Stangard Printers |location=Colombo |edition=1 |oclc=12240260 |url= |quote=Koneswaram temple.

There are [[Legend of Tirumala|several legends]] associated with the manifestation of the Lord in Tirumala. According to one legend, the temple has a [[murti]] (deity) of Lord Venkateswara, which it is believed shall remain here for the entire duration of the present [[Kali Yuga]].

==Temple legend==
{{main|Legend of Tirumala}}

During [[Dvapara Yuga]], [[Shesha|Adisesha]] resided on earth as [[Seshachalam Hills]] after losing a contest with [[Vayu]]. According to [[Puranas]], [[Tirumala]] is regarded as Adivaraha Kshetra. After killing [[Hiranyaksha]], [[Varaha|Adivaraha]] resided on this hill. Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam is the widely accepted legend over Tirumala Temple.&lt;ref name=legend1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tirumala.org/TempleLegend.aspx|title = Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams-Temple Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Kali Yuga]], [[Narada]] advised [[Rishi]]s who were performing [[Yajna]] to decide who could be given the fruits of yagna among [[Trimurti]]s. [[Bhrigu]] was sent to test Trimurtis.  The sage who had an extra eye in the sole of his foot visited Lord [[Brahma]] and Lord [[Shiva]] and went unnoticed in both these locations. At last he visited [[Vishnu]] and the lord acts as if he had not noticed Bhrigu. Getting angered by this act, sage Bhrigu kicked Lord Vishnu in the chest, to which Vishnu did not react and instead apologized to the Sage by massaging his feet. During this act, he squashed the extra eye that was present in the sole of Bhrigu's foot. However [[Lakshmi]] finds it as an insult and had left [[Vaikuntam]] onto Earth to [[Kolhapur]] and started meditating.&lt;ref name=legend1 /&gt;

Lord Vishnu  bore human form as [[Venkateswara|Srinivasa]], left Vaikuntam, in search of Lakshmi, reached Tirumala Hills and started meditating. Lakshmi came to know about the condition of Srinivasa and prayed to Siva and Brahma. Siva and Brahma then converted themselves into Cow and Calf and Goddess Lakshmi had handed over the cow and calf to [[Chola]] king ruling over Tirumala Hills at that time. The Cow would provide milk to Srinivasa daily while it was taken for grazing. One day Cowherd saw this and tried to beat the Cow with staff but Lord Srinivasa had borne the injury. Getting angered by this Srinivasa had cursed the Chola king to become a [[Demon]] as dharma says Servants sin should be borne by Kings. The king prayed for mercy after which Srinivasa said to him, that the King should take next birth as Akasaraja and should perform marriage of his daughter Padmavati with Srinivasa.&lt;ref name=legend1 /&gt;

Lord Srinivasa went to his mother [[Vakula Devi]] on Tirumala hills and stayed there for a while. After curse Chola king took rebirth as Akasaraja and he had a daughter named Padmavati who was born in the Padmapushkarini situated at present day [[Tiruchanur]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Lord Srinivasa married Padmavati at present day Narayanavanam in Andhra Pradesh and will return to Tirumala Hills. After few months Goddess Lakshmi had come to know about the marriage of Srinivasa with Padamavati and went to Tirumala hills to question Srinivasa. It is said that the Lord srinivasa turns into Stone right when he was encountered by Lakshmi and Padmavathi. Lord Brahma and Shiva appear before the confused queens and explain the main purpose behind all this - The Lord's desire to be on the 7 hills for the emancipation of mankind from the perpetual troubles of Kali Yuga. Goddesses Lakshmi and Padmavathi also turn into stone deities expressing their wish to be with their Lord always. Lakshmi stays with Him on His Chest on the left side while Padmavathi rests on His Chest's right side.&lt;ref name=legend1 /&gt;

==History of the temple==

===Medieval history===
The first recorded endowment was made by Pallava queen Samavai in the year 966 CE. She donated many jewels and two parcels of land(one 10 acres and other 13 acres) and ordered to use the revenues generated from that land to be used for the celebration of major festivals in the temple.{{sfn|Feminism and World Religions| 1999| p= 48}} The [[Pallava dynasty]](9th century), the [[Chola dynasty]](10th century), and Vijayanagara [[pradhan]]s (14th and 15th centuries) were committed devotees of Lord Venkateswara. The temple gained most of its current wealth and size under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], with the donation of diamonds and gold.&lt;ref name = 'Tirumalatemple'&gt;{{cite book |author=Dr. N.Ramesan|title=The Tirumala Temple |year=1981 |publisher=Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|location=Tirumala}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1517, Vijayanagara Emperor [[Krishnadevaraya]], on one of his many visits to the temple, donated gold and jewels, enabling the [[Ananda Nilayam]] (inner shrine) roofing to be gilded. After the decline of Vijayanagara Empire, leaders from states such as the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] and the [[Gadwal Samsthanam]] worshiped as pilgrims and gave ornaments and valuables to the temple. Maratha general [[Raghoji I Bhonsle]] (died 1755) visited the temple and set up a permanent administration for the conduct of worship in the temple.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_history.htm| title=Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams: Temple History| accessdate=15 July 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412013703/http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_history.htm| archive-date=12 April 2012| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

[[File:SwamiPushkarni.JPG|thumb|250px|Swami Pushkarni of Tirumala]]

After the dusk of [[Vijayanagara Empire]], the temple went into the hands of Golconda in July 1656 and then it was under the French  for a short period of time and under Nawab of Carnatic till 1801 CE.

===Epigraphical records===
This Temple bears on its walls several inscriptions which are of historical, cultural and linguistic importance. The number of inscriptions on the Hill Temple and in the temples of Lower Tirupati and Tiruchanur exceed one thousand. There is evidence to suggest that many early inscriptions on the walls of the temples have disappeared beyond recovery. As many as 640 inscriptions are found engraved on the walls of the temple. They are published by the [[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams]] along with the inscriptions found in other related temples in and around Tirupati. All the inscriptions are in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Kannada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://srivenkatesa.org/index.php/temple/templehistory/675-tirumala-hill-shrine-and-inscriptions |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208115439/http://srivenkatesa.org/index.php/temple/templehistory/675-tirumala-hill-shrine-and-inscriptions |archive-date=8 December 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the temple, there is a unique collection of about 3000 copper plates on which the [[Carnatic music|Telugu Sankirtanas]] of [[Tallapaka Annamacharya]] and his descendants are inscribed.

The [[Pallavas]], the [[Cholas]], the [[Pandyas]], [[Kadava]]rayas, Yadavarayas, [[Telugu Cholas]], Telugu Pallavas, Vijayanagara kings (Sangama, Saluva and Tuluva lines) have left the marks of their patronage and endowments on the walls of the temples of Tirumala and Tirupati.&lt;ref name="tirumala.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_main.htm |title=Tirumala Tirupati Devastanamulu |publisher=Tirumala.org |date= |accessdate=17 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806184716/http://www.tirumala.org/maintemple_main.htm |archive-date=6 August 2002 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair tonsuring===
Many devotees have their head tonsured as "Mokku", an offering to God. The daily amount of hair collected is over a ton.&lt;ref name="rai"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/14/world/a-religious-tangle-over-the-hair-of-pious-hindus.html?pagewanted=all |title=A Religious Tangle Over the Hair of Pious Hindus |author=Saritha Rai |date=14 July 2004 |accessdate=26 April 2009 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per legend, when Lord Venkateswara was hit on his head by a shepherd, a small portion of his scalp became bald. This was noticed by Neela Devi, a [[Gandharva]] princess. She felt "such an attractive face should not have a flaw". Immediately, she cut a portion of her hair and, with her magical power, implanted it on his scalp. Lord Venkateswara noticed her sacrifice. As hair is a beautiful asset of the female form, he promised her that all his devotees who come to his abode would offer their hair to him, and she would be the recipient of all the hair received. Hence, it is believed that hair offered by the devotees is accepted by Neela Devi. The hill, Neeladri, one of the seven hills, is named after her.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Hundi (donation pot)===
As per legend, it is believed that Srinivasa had to make arrangements for his wedding. Lord Kubera credited money to Lord Venkateswara (a form of the god Vishnu) for his marriage with Padmavathi. Srinivasa sought a loan of one crore and 11.4&amp;nbsp;million (11,400,000) coins of gold from Kubera and had Viswakarma, the divine architect, create heavenly surroundings in the Seshadri hills. Together, Srinivasa and Padmavathi lived for all eternity while Goddess Lakshmi, understanding the commitments of Lord Vishnu, chose to live in his heart forever.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In remembrance of this, devotees go to Tirupati to donate money in Venkateswara's hundi (donation pot) so that he can pay it back to Kubera. The hundi collections go as high as 22.5 million INR a day.&lt;ref name="ndtv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-12/india/28543646_1_ttd-famous-lord-venkateswara-temple-idle-gold| title=Times of India – TTD Deposits Gold with SBI| accessdate=13 September 2007 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these myths traveled across the Atlantic during the period of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] to become part of Caribbean, Cuban or [[Brazilian mythology]], with some endemic changes.

Features of West African mythology include:

* [[Mami Wata]] or Water Spirits
* [[Abiku]]
* [[Ogbanje]]
* [[River Snake]]
* [[Ancestral Spirits]] (This falls into religion and/or reincarnation belief systems as much as myth)
* [[Anansi]] or [[Trickster]]

'''Yitzchok Moully''' is an [[Australian]]-[[Americans|American]], [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi and artist associated with the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement and is known for his "Chasidic Pop Art" painting style. Moully serves as a Chabad emissary (''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shaliach]]'') in [[Basking Ridge, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=mishpop&gt;Bensoussan, Barbara. "True Color." ''Mishpacha Magazine''. July 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mishpop1&gt;[http://www.collive.com/show_news.rtx?id=20827&amp;alias=pop-artist-chossid-shliach "Pop Artist, Chossid, Shliach."] ''COLlive.com''.

Moully's combination of rabbinic work and art is expressed in a piece "Orange Socks."
The piece, according to Moully, contrasts what people think of as a homogeneous Chassidic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wischusen |first1=Phreddy |title=‘Under the Black Hat’ Pop Art in Jerusalem Focuses on Chassidim - Rabbi Yitzchok Moully brings spiritual and emotional depth to a new exhibit |url=https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/3824604/jewish/Under-the-Black-Hat-Pop-Art-in-Jerusalem-Focuses-on-Chassidim.htm |website=www.chabad.org |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |language=en |date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yitzchok Moully was born in 1979&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt; in [[Queensland, Australia]] but moved to [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] at the age of three. At the age of five, Moully and his mother moved to [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn]] and joined the Chabad community there. Moully later studied at Chabad yeshivoth, married, and became the assistant rabbi at the Chabad Jewish Center of Basking Ridge, New Jersey.&lt;ref name=mishpop/&gt;

==Art==
Moully has produced works by using the silkscreen process; his art contrasts strong Jewish and Chasidic images with vibrant bold colors creating what he describes as "Chassidic Pop Art."&lt;ref name=algepop/&gt; Moully uses color and styles similar to the work of [[Andy Warhol]], using popular images from Jewish Chasidic culture including [[dreidels]], [[Kiddush]] cups and praying rabbis.&lt;ref name=forpop&gt;Trappler-Spielman, Sara. [http://www.forward.com/articles/12739/hasidic-rabbi-by-day-pop-artist-by-night-/ Hasidic Rabbi by Day, Pop Artist by Night."] ''The Jewish Daily Forward''. Wednesday, February 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Moully also works in abstract art, and has been heavily influenced by artists such as by the French Canadian artist Jean Pierre Lafrance &lt;ref&gt;Peter Kharmandarian [http://www.artonthebanks.com/2015/05/interviews-the-pop-art-rabbi-yitzchok-moully/ Interview: The Pop Art Rabbi – Yitzchok Moully]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Moully began exhibiting his art in galleries and community centers in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Currently, his work is on exhibit at the gallery [[ArtisZen Arts]] in [[Lambertville, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=forpop/&gt;

==The Creative Soul==

'''Śūnyatā''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:शून्यता#Sanskrit|शून्यता]]|śūnyatā}}; {{lang-pi|suññatā}}) – pronounced ‘shoonyataa’, translated into English most often as ''emptiness''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dale Mathers|author2=Melvin E. Miller|author3=Osamu Ando|title=Self and No-Self: Continuing the Dialogue Between Buddhism and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVpcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-72386-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes ''voidness''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140228062714/http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/sunna.htm Suñña] - Palikanon.com,&lt;/ref&gt; – is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept which has multiple meanings depending on its doctrinal context. It is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditation state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], suññatā often refers to the [[anatta|non-self]] (Pāli: ''anattā'', Sanskrit: ''anātman''){{refn|group=note|A common translation is "no-self", without a self, but the Pali canon uses ''anattā'' as a singular substantive, meaning "not-self".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2009|p=124}}}} nature of the [[five aggregates]] of experience and the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]]. Suññatā is also often used to refer to a meditative state or experience.

In [[Mahayana]], ''Sunyata'' refers to the tenet that "all things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature (''[[svabhava]]''),"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher W. Gowans|title=Buddhist Moral Philosophy: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW4KBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT69 |year=2014| publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-65934-1 |pages=69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also refer to the [[Buddha-nature]] teachings and primordial or empty awareness, as in [[Dzogchen]] and [[Rangtong-Shentong|Shentong]].

==Etymology==
"''Śūnyatā''" ([[Sanskrit]]) is usually translated as "devoidness," "emptiness," "hollow, hollowness," "voidness." It is the noun form of the adjective ''śūnya'' or ''śhūnya'', plus ''-tā'': 
* ''śūnya'' means "zero," "nothing," "empty" or "void"&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams, Sir Monier (2nd edn, 1899) [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1085-zuSkavraNa.jpg ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary'']. Reprinted Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1986: p.1085.&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the root ''śvi'', meaning "hollow"
* ''-tā'' means "-ness"

==Development of the concept==
The concept of Sunyata as "emptiness", states Sue Hamilton, is related to the concept of ''[[anatta]]'' in early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue Hamilton|title=Early Buddhism: A New Approach : the I of the Beholder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ji9EvkprnPsC |year=2000|publisher = Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1357-8|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, many different philosophical schools or tenet-systems (Sanskrit: ''siddhānta'')&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Anne C. (1991). ''Knowing Naming &amp; Negation a sourcebook on Tibetan, Sautrantika''. Snowlion publications, {{ISBN|0-937938-21-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed within Buddhism in an effort to explain the exact philosophical meaning of emptiness.

After the Buddha, emptiness was further developed by the [[Abhidharma]] schools, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]] and the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school, an early Mahāyāna school. Emptiness ("positively" interpreted) is also an important element of the [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha nature]] literature, which played a formative role in the evolution of subsequent Mahāyāna doctrine and practice.

==Early Buddhism==
{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}

===Pāli Nikāyas===
[[Image:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|right|A simile from the Pali scriptures (SN 22.95) compares [[Rūpa#Buddhism|form]] and [[Vedanā|feelings]] with foam and bubbles.]]
{{See also|Sati (Buddhism)}}

The Pali canon uses the term emptiness in three ways: "(1) as a meditative dwelling, (2) as an attribute of objects, and (3) as a type of awareness-release."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.122.than.html MN 122. See, e.g., Maha-suññata Sutta: The Greater Discourse on Emptiness translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu," Retrieved on 30 July 2013 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Suñña Sutta'',&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu_1997d_3585"&gt;{{harvnb|Bhikkhu|1997d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  part of the [[Pali Canon|Pāli canon]], relates that the monk [[Ananda|Ānanda]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha's]] attendant asked, 
{{quote|It is said that the world is empty, the world is empty, lord. In what respect is it said that the world is empty?" The Buddha replied, "Insofar as it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self: Thus it is said, Ānanda, that the world is empty.}}

According to [[Thanissaro Bhikku]]:
{{quote|Emptiness as a quality of [[Dharmas#Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]], in the early canons, means simply that one cannot identify them as one's own self or having anything pertaining to one's own self ... Emptiness as a mental state, in the early canons, means a mode of perception in which one neither adds anything to nor takes anything away from what is present, noting simply, "There is this." This mode is achieved through a process of intense concentration, coupled with the insight that notes more and more subtle levels of the presence and absence of disturbance (see MN 121).&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikku, The Buddhist Religions: An Historical Introduction, P 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Emptiness of dhammas====
According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the Pāli discourses use the adjective suñña with a much higher frequency than the corresponding noun suññatā. This reflects an emphasis on qualifying phenomena as 'being empty' rather than on an abstract state of empty-'ness' in early Buddhism, states Analayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Analayo|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Excursions into the Thought-World of the Pali Discourses|year=2012|publisher=[[Pariyatti]]|page=272|ISBN=9781928706984}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Meditative state====
Emptiness as a meditative state is said to be reached when "not attending to any themes, he [the bhikku] enters &amp; remains in internal emptiness" (MN 122). This meditative dwelling is developed through the "four formless states" of meditation or [[Arūpajhāna]]s and then through "themeless concentration of awareness."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;

The Cūlasuññata-sutta (MN III 104) and the Mahāsuññata-sutta (MN III 109) outline how a monk can "dwell in emptiness" through a gradual step by step mental cultivation process, they both stress the importance of the impermanence of mental states and the absence of a self.

In the Kāmabhu Sutta S IV.293, it is explained that a [[bhikkhu]] can experience a [[Jhana in Theravada#Cessation of feelings and perceptions|trancelike contemplation]] in which perception and feeling cease. When he emerges from this state, he recounts three types of "contact" (''[[Sparśa|phasso]]''):
# "emptiness" (''suññato''),
# "signless" (''animitto''),
# "undirected" (''appa{{IAST|ṇ}}ihito'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.006.than.html SN 41.6. See, e.g., Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2004), "SN 41.6 Kamabhu Sutta: With Kamabhu (On the Cessation of Perception &amp; Feeling)," retrieved Feb 4 2009 from "Access to Insight" at www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
The meaning of emptiness as contemplated here is explained at M I.297 and S IV.296-97 as the "emancipation of the mind by emptiness" (''suññatā cetovimutti'') being consequent upon the realization that "this world is empty of self or anything pertaining to self" (''suññam ida{{IAST|ṃ}} attena vā attaniyena vā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.043.than.html MN 43 and SN 41.7.  See, e.g., respectively, Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2006), "MN 43 Mahavedalla Sutta: The Greater Set of Questions-and-Answers," retrieved February 4, 2009 from "Access to Insight"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn41/sn41.007.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.) (2004), "SN 41.7 Godatta Sutta: To Godatta (On Awareness-release)," retrieved February 4, 2009 from "Access to Insight"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "emptiness" (''suññatā'') is also used in two suttas in the ''Majjhima Nikāya'', in the context of a progression of mental states. The texts refer to each state's emptiness of the one below.&lt;ref&gt;MN 121 and MN 122. See, e.g., respectively, Thanissaro (1997a) and Thanissaro (1997b).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Āgamas===
Some of the Sarvāstivādin Agama sutras (extant in Chinese) which have emptiness as a theme include Samyukta Agama 335 - ''Paramārtha-śunyatā-sūtra'' (Sutra on ultimate emptiness) and Samyukta Agama 297 - ''Mahā-śunyatā-dharma-paryāya'' (Greater discourse on emptiness). These sutras have no parallel Pali suttas.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; These sutras associate emptiness with [[dependent origination]], which shows that this relation of the two terms was already established in pre-[[Nagarjuna]] sources. The sutra on great emptiness states:
{{quote|"What is the Dharma Discourse on Great Emptiness? It is this— ‘When this exists, that exists; when this arises, that arises.’"&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase "when this exists..." is a common gloss on [[dependent origination]]. Sarvāstivādin Agamas also speak of a certain emptiness [[samadhi]] (''śūnyatāsamādhi'') as well as stating that all dharmas are "classified as conventional".&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 22, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mun-Keat Choong and [[Yin Shun]] have both published studies on the various uses of emptiness in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] (Pali Canon and Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Choong, Mun-Keat; The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yìn Shùn; An Investigation into Emptiness (Kōng zhī Tànjìu 空之探究) (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Choong has also published a collection of translations of Agama sutras from the Chinese on the topic of emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.une.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/76164/2ed-2010-Annotated-Trans-SA-sutras-Emptiness-and-the-Middle-Way2.pdf Choong; Annotated Translation of Sutras from the Chinese Samyuktagama relevant to the Early Buddhist Teachings on Emptiness and the Middle Way (2004; second edition, International Buddhist College, Thailand, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Buddhist schools and Abhidharma==
Many of the [[early Buddhist schools]] featured sunyata as an important part of their teachings.

The [[Sarvastivadin]] school's Abhidharma texts like the Dharmaskandhapāda Śāstra, and the later Mahāvibhāṣa also take up the theme of emptiness vis a vis dependent origination as found in the Agamas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools such as the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] Prajñaptivādins as well as many of the Sthavira schools (except the [[Pudgalavada]]) held that all dharmas were empty (dharma śūnyatā).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This can be seen in the early [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma]] texts such as the [[Patisambhidamagga]] which also speak of the emptiness of the five aggregates and of [[svabhava]] as being "empty of essential nature".&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Karl H; Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D., page 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada [[Kathavatthu]] also argues against the idea that emptiness is unconditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Shì hùifēng, “Dependent Origination = Emptiness”—Nāgārjuna’s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main themes of Harivarman's [[Tattvasiddhi]]-Śāstra (3rd-4th century) is ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]]-śūnyatā'', the emptiness of phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew. ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' 2004. pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravada==
[[Theravada]] Buddhists generally take the view espoused in the [[Pali canon]], that emptiness is merely the [[Anatta|not-self]] nature of the [[five aggregates]] as well as a mode of perception which is "empty of the presuppositions we usually add to experience to make sense of it"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/emptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikku, "Emptiness", Access to Insight, 8 March 2011, Retrieved July 30, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; - especially that of unchanging selfhood. Therefore, some Theravadan teachers like [[Thanissaro Bhikku]] hold that emptiness is not so much a metaphysical view, as it is a strategic mode of acting and of seeing the world which leads to liberation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of emptiness as lack of [[Svabhava|inherent existence]] has very little to do with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]] — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/integrityofemptiness.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu. "The Integrity of Emptiness" Access to Insight, 5 June 2010, Retrieved on 30 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Theravadins such as [[David Kalupahana]], see [[Nagarjuna]]'s view of emptiness as compatible with the [[Pali Canon]]. In his analysis of the [[Mulamadhyamikakarika]], Kalupahana sees Nagarjuna's argument as rooted in the [[Kaccānagotta Sutta]] (which Nagarjuna cites by name). Kalupahana states that Nagarjuna's major goal was to discredit heterodox views of [[Svabhava]] (own-nature) held by the [[Sarvastivadins]] and establish the non-substantiality of all dharmas.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, D. Mulamadhyamakakarika of nagarjuna, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Harvey, the Abhidhamma theory of the Theravadins is not based on the kind of [[Svabhava]] that Nagarjuna was critiquing: "They are dhammas because they are upheld by conditions or they are upheld according to their own nature' (Asl.39). Here 'own-nature' would mean characteristic nature, which is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma. This is of significance as it makes the Mahayana critique of the Sarvastivadin's notion of own-nature largely irrelevant to the Theravada."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHISM, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emptiness as an approach to meditation is seen as a state in which one is "empty of disturbance." This form of meditation is one in which the meditator becomes concentrated and focuses on the absence or presence of disturbances in their mind, if they find a disturbance they notice it and allow it drop away, this leads to deeper states of calmness.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt; Emptiness is also seen as a way to look at sense experience that does not identify with the "I-making" and "my-making" process of the mind. As a form of meditation, this is developed by perceiving the [[ayatana|six sense spheres]] and their objects as empty of any self, this leads to a [[Arupajhana|formless jhana]] of nothingness and a state of equanimity.&lt;ref name="Thanissaro Bhikkhu 2010"/&gt;

According to [[Gil Fronsdal]]: "Emptiness is as important in the Theravada tradition as it is in the Mahayana.  From the earliest times, Theravada Buddhism has viewed emptiness as one of the important doors to liberation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/books-articles/articles/emptiness-in-theravada-buddhism/ Emptiness in Theravada Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathew Kosuta sees the Abhidhamma teachings of the modern Thai teacher Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket as being very similar to the Mahayana emptiness view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Articles/Theravada%20Emptiness_The%20Abhidhammic%20theory%20of%20Ajaan%20Sujin%20Boriharnwanaket_Kosuta_2007.pdf Kosuta, Theravada emptiness, The abhidhammic theory of Ajaan Sujin Boriharnwanaket]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahayana Buddhism==
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}
===Prajna-paramita Sutras===
{{Main|Perfection of Wisdom}}
The Prajna-paramita (Perfection of Wisdom) Sutras taught that all entities, including ''dharmas'', are only conceptual existents or constructs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 68, 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pages 52-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, these objects are "empty" of the identity imputed by their designated labels.{{sfn|Kalupahan|1994|p=160-169}} The [[Heart sutra]], a text from the [[Prajnaparamita|prajnaparamita-sutras]], articulates this in the following saying in which the [[Skandha|five skandhas]] are said to be "empty":
{{quote|Form is emptiness, emptiness is form&lt;br&gt;Emptiness is not separate from form, form is not separate from emptiness&lt;br&gt;Whatever is form is emptiness, whatever is emptiness is form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm |title=The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra |publisher=Buddhanet.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Original: "Rupan śūnyatā śūnyatāiva rupan.

===Mādhyamaka===
{{Main|Madhyamaka}}
[[File:Dew on grass Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The emptiness of phenomena is often compared to drops of [[dew]]]]
Mādhyamaka is a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist school of philosophy]] established by the Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Thought"&gt;[[Paul Williams (British professor)|Williams, Paul]] (2000). ''Buddhist Thought'' Routledge, p140.&lt;/ref&gt; In Madhyamaka, to say that an object is "empty" is synonymous with saying that it is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]], which means, it's affected by the [[three marks of existence]]: it is fated to be [[Impermanence|transient]], [[Dukkha|unsatisfactory]], and [[Anatta|without inherent existence]].

Madhyamaka states that impermanent collections of causes and conditions are designated by mere conceptual labels. This also applies to the principle of causality itself, since ''everything'' is dependently originated.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; If unaware of this, things may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise as having inherent existence in the first place.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Chapter 21 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā goes into the reasoning behind this.&lt;ref name="Tsondru, Mabja 2011, pages 56-58"/&gt;}} Thus both existence and nihilism are ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 56-58, 405-417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;unclear&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nagarjuna====
Madhyamaka is retroactively seen as being founded by the monk [[Nāgārjuna]]. Nāgārjuna's goal was to refute the essentialism of certain [[Abhidharma]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Wasler, Joseph. ''Nagarjuna in Context.'' New York: Columibia University Press. 2005, pgs. 225-263.&lt;/ref&gt; His best-known work is the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], in which he used the ''[[Prasaṅgika|reductio ad absurdum]]'' to show the non-substantiality of the perceived world.

[[Nāgārjuna]] equates emptiness with [[dependent origination]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 66-71, 447-477.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] 24:18}}
{{quote|On the basis of the Buddha's view that all experienced phenomena (''dharma'') are "dependently arisen" (''pratitya-samutpanna''), Nagarjuna insisted that such phenomena are empty (''sunya''). This did not mean that they are not experienced and, therefore, non-existent; only that they are devoid of a permanent and eternal substance (''[[Svabhāva|svabhava]]''). Since they are experienced elements of existence, they are not mere names (''prjnapti'').{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

In his analysis, any enduring [[Svabhāva|essential nature]] would prevent the process of dependent origination, or any kind of origination at all. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change.&lt;ref&gt;Tsondru, Mabja. ''Ornament of Reason.'' Snow Lion Publications. 2011, pages 40-41, 322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Nāgārjuna equates svabhāva (essence) with bhāva (existence) in Chapter 15 of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā}}

In doing so, he restores the [[Middle way]] of the Buddha, which had become influenced by absolute tendencies:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}
{{quote|Utilizing the Buddha's theory of "dependent arising" (''pratitya-samutpanna'') Nagarjuna demonstrated the futility of these metaphysical speculations. His method of dealing with such metaphysics is referred to as a "middle way" (''madhyama pratipad''). It is the middle way that avoided the substantialism of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] as well as the [[nominalism]] of the [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantikas]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=120}}}}

==== Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction====
{{Main|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction}}

In Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the Gelugpa, a distinction is being made between Svatantrika and Prasaṅgika approaches to reasoning.

''Svātantrika'' is attributed primarily to the 6th century Indian scholar [[Bhavaviveka]], who argued for the use of syllogistical statements in the propagation of Madhyamaka, in line with the developing Buddhist logic. It is used in contrast with [[Prasangika|Prāsangika]] Madhyamaka. According to Tsonghkhapa, for the Svatantrika conventional phenomena are understood to have a conventional essential existence, but without an ultimately existing essence.

The name ''Prasangika'' is derived from ''[[Prasaṅgika|prasanga]]'', or ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' arguments, rather than ''[[Svatantrika|svatantra-anumana]]'', or ''[[Syllogism|independent syllogisms]]''. [[Buddhapalita]] (470–550) are regarded as the main proponents of the Prasaṅgika, which argues that only arguments should be used which lay bare the logical inconstencies of their opponents.

====Nihilism and eternalism====

Some non-Buddhist and Buddhist writers state that the Sunyata concept in Madhyamaka philosophy is nihilistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Junjirō Takakusu|title=The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyJjCx_tEiMC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1592-6|pages=4, 105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura |title=Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India, China, Tibet, Japan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9gm9CzNd5EC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0764-8 |pages=590–591 footnote 20 }}, Quote: "Already in India, 'sunyata' was liable to be misunderstood as nothingness or nihil'. (...) The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] of Hinayana Buddhism viewed the Madhyamika school as 'one that argues that everything is nothing. (...) It is only natural that most of the Western scholars call the ''prajnaparamita sutra'' or the doctrine of the Madhyamika school nihilism since criticisms were already expressed in India. Against such criticisms, however, Nagarjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school says, 'you are ignorant of the function of sunyata, the meaning of the sunyata and sunyata itself'."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jackson writes:
{{quote|A nihilistic interpretation of the concept of voidness (or of mind-only) is not, by any means, a merely hypothetical possibility; it consistently was adopted by Buddhism's opponents, wherever the religion spread, nor have Buddhists themselves been immune to it...&lt;ref name="Jackson_1993_57"&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|1993|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view has been challenged by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. C. Nayak |title=Mādhyamika Śūnyatā, a Reappraisal: A Reappraisal of Mādhyamika Philosophical Enterprise with Special Reference to Nāgārjuna and Chandrakīrti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkRAQAAIAAJ |date=2001 |publisher=Indian Council of Philosophical Research |isbn=978-81-85636-47-4 |pages=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] such as ''Tathagata'', while other scholars consider it a mistake.&lt;ref name=ferrer102&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, page 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jorge Ferrer, Nāgārjuna presents the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.&lt;ref name=ferrer102/&gt;

Randall Collins states that for Nagarjuna, ultimate reality was "shunyata, emptiness".&lt;ref name=collins221&gt;Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; In Nagarjuna's thesis, adds Collins, this emptiness is not a negation, but the premise that "no concepts are intelligible".&lt;ref name=collins221/&gt; David Kalupahana states that this topic has been debated by ancient and medieval Buddhist metaphysicians, with a divergence of views; emptiness is a view, adds Kalupahana, but "holding up emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth without reference to that which is empty is the last thing either the Buddha or Nāgārjuna would advocate".&lt;ref&gt;[[David J. Kalupahana]], ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ferrer, Nāgārjuna criticized those whose mind held any "positions and beliefs", suggesting liberation is "avoidance of all views", and explaining emptiness as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Noguera Ferrer, ''Revisioning Transpersonal Theory: A Participatory Vision of Human Spirituality.'' SUNY Press, 2002, pages 102. The quote is from the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Victorious Ones have announced that emptiness is the relinquishing of all [[View (Buddhism)|views]]. Those who are possessed of the view of emptiness are said to be incorrigible.}}

===Yogacara===
{{Main|Yogacara}}
[[Yogacara]] explains "emptiness" in an analysis of the way we perceive "things". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the [[Skandha|five skandhas]]: form, perception, feeling, volition and discrimination.{{refn|group=note|Translations do differ, which makes a difference. [[Vijñāna]] can be translated as "consciousness", but also as "discernement".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}}} The five skandhas together create consciousness. The "things" we are conscious of are "mere concepts", not 'das Ding an sich' or 'the thing in itself'.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992}}

===Buddha-nature and Yogacara-Madhyamaka===
{{Main|Buddha-nature|Tathāgatagarbha Sutras}}

An influential division of 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts develop the notion of Buddha-nature.&lt;ref name="PW_103_109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

The notion of Buddha-nature was opposed within the later Tibetan Gelugpa school, because they imply a "self-like" concept.&lt;ref name="PW_103_109"/&gt;

====''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras''====
The Tathāgatagarbha is the topic of the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'', where the title itself means a ''garbha'' (womb, matrix, seed) containing ''Tathagata'' (Buddha). In the ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self. The ultimate goal of the path is characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by [[Essentialism|essentialist]] philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Sutra]]s suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'.&lt;ref name=paulwilliamsp104&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tathāgatagarbha'' sutras presents a further developed understanding of emptiness, wherein the Buddha Nature, the Buddha and Liberation are seen as transcending the realm of emptiness, i.e. of the conditioned and dependently originated phenomena.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}}

The ''[[Srimala Sutra|Śrīmālā Sūtra]]'' is one of the earliest texts on tathagata-garbha thought, composed in 3rd century in south India, according to Brian Brown. It asserted that everyone can potentially attain Buddhahood, and warns against the doctrine of Sunyata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Śrīmālā Sūtra'' posits that the Buddha-nature is ultimately identifiable as the [[dharmakaya|supramundane nature of the Buddha]], the ''garbha'' is the ground for Buddha-nature, this nature is unborn and undying, has ultimate existence, has no beginning nor end, is nondual, and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=4–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The text also adds that the ''garbha'' has "no self, soul or personality" and "incomprehensible to anyone distracted by sunyata (voidness)"; rather it is the support for phenomenal existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Edward Brown |title=The Buddha Nature: A Study of the Tathāgatagarbha and Ālayavijñāna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXnF2dolnNgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0631-3 |pages=5–7, 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another seminal text, which was and is influential in Tibetan Buddhism, is the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]] sutra. It forms the basis of [[shentong]], a further developed form of Madhyamaka, in which the realization of emptiness is a preliminary stage to realize the [[Nature of mind (Buddhism)|nature of mind]], the self-reflexive nature of consciousness which shines through when it is freed from the defilements. Moderate shentong-views are still being taught in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, despite the fierce resistance and persecution by Gelugpas in previous centuries.

====Scholarly opinions====
While highly influential in Indian and east Asian Buddhism, for western scholars the ''Tathagatagarbha '' doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being appears to be confusing, since it seems to be equivalent to a 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Paul Williams: "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–105, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to contradict the doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts. Some scholars, however, view such teachings as metaphorical, not to be taken literally.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} Wayman and Wayman have also disagreed with this literalist view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, the [[Buddha nature]] which these sutras discuss, does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, the intention of the teaching of Buddha nature is [[soteriology|soteriological]] rather than theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Heng-Ching Shih |title=The Significance Of 'Tathagatagarbha' —- A Positive Expression Of Sunyata |url=http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807082256/http://budsas.org/ebud/ebdha191.htm |archivedate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sallie B. |last=King |title=The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist.

''Mahayanism'', Tokyo: Karin Bunko, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matsumoto Shiro and Hakamaya Noriaki, the idea of an ontological reality of the Buddha-nature is an un-Buddhist idea:&lt;ref name="nanzan-u.ac.jp"/&gt; Their "Critical Buddhism" approach rejects what it calls "''dhatu-vada''" (substantialist Buddha nature doctrines)
{{quote|Buddhism is based on the principles of no-self and causation, which deny any substance underlying the phenomenal world. The idea of ''tathagata-garbha'', on the contrary, posits a substance (namely, ''tathagata''-''garbha'') as the basis of the phenomenal world. [Matsumoto Shiro] asserts that ''dhatu-vada'' is the object that the Buddha criticized in founding Buddhism, and that Buddhism is nothing but unceasing critical activity against any form of ''dhatu-vada''.&lt;ref&gt;''Pruning the Bodhi Tree: the Storm over Critical Buddhism'' by Jamie Hubbard and Paul Loren Swanson, University of Hawai'i Press, 1997, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The critical Buddhism approach has, in turn, recently been characterised as operating with a restricted definition of Buddhism.  Paul Williams comments:
{{quote|At least some ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' contravene the teachings of not-Self, or the Madhyamika idea of emptiness. And these ways of understanding the ''tathagatagarbha'' were and are widespread in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Yet by their own self-definition they are Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, London, 2009, pp. 124, 125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
[[File:Appearance of sky for weather forecast, Dhaka, Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|In Tibetan Buddhism, emptiness is often symbolized by and compared to the open sky&lt;ref&gt;Vessantara; Meeting the Buddhas: A Guide to Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Tantric Deities. "They [conditioned things] are sky-like, and un-graspable, like clouds."&lt;/ref&gt; which is associated with [[openness]] and [[freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa: Volume Four, Dawn of tantra, page 366&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in all the schools, but with two distinct variations:{{sfn|Cornu|2001|p=145, 150}}
* Rangtong, c.q. Prasangika-Madhyamaka, which is taught by the Gelugpa, but also by the Nyingma and Sakya:
:* Tsongkhapa, and the subsequent Gelugpa tradition, lay emphasis on a strict [[Prasangika]] interpretation of emptiness. It sees its own interpretation as the final truth on ''sunyata''.
:* The [[Nyingma]] and the Sakya-school teach that emptiness goes further than a mere denial of inherently existing, with the Dzogchen (Nyingma) tradition pointing to the ''[[nature of mind]]''. 
* Shentong, which is a further developed Yogacara-Madhyamaka and influenced by Buddha-nature teachings, and taught in Jonang and Kagyu.

====Strict emptiness – Gelugpa====
The [[Gelug|Gelugpa school]] of Tibetan Buddhism is the most influential of the four Tibetan Buddhist schools. It was founded in the beginning of the 15th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419), who was "strongly scholastic in orientation and encouraged the study of the great Indian masters of philosophy".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

The [[14th Dalai Lama]], who generally speaks from the Gelugpa version of the ''Mādhyamaka-[[Prasangika|Prasaṅgika]]'', states:
{{quote|According to the theory of emptiness, any belief in an objective reality grounded in the assumption of intrinsic, independent existence is simply untenable.&lt;br&gt;All things and events, whether 'material', mental or even abstract concepts like time, are devoid of objective, independent existence ... [T]hings and events are 'empty' in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute 'being' that affords independence.&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (2005). ''The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality'' (Hardcover). Broadway. {{ISBN|0-7679-2066-X}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-7679-2066-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Nature of mind====

=====Nyingma/Dzogchen=====
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}

In Dzogchen, emptiness does not refer to the mere negation of inherent existence, but to profound emptiness, the Ground and nature of mind which is free from temporary characteristics.

=====Bon=====
The Tibetan [[Bon#Yungdrung Bon|Yungdrung Bon-tradition]] regards the Ma Gyu, or [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Mother Tantras|Mother Tantra]], as the highest tantra. Its views are close to [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ligmincha.org/store/vmchk/by-practice/sadhanas-of-the-ma-gyu-mother-tantra/view-all-products.html Ligmincha Institute: Sadhanas of the Ma Gyu (Mother Tantra)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bon-encyclopedia.wikispaces.com/ma+gyud |title=Ma Gyud - The Mother Tantras |publisher=Bon-encyclopedia.wikispaces.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It sees waking life as an illusion, from which we have to wake up, just as we recognize dreams to be illusions.{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=53}} Sunyata is the lack of inherent existence.{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=55}} The Mother Tantra uses ...
{{quote|...examples, similes and metaphors that we can ponder in order to better understand this illusory nature of both dream and waking life".{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=54}}}}

These "examples, similes and metaphors" ...
{{quote|...stress the lack of inherent existence and the unity of experience and experiencer. In the sutra teachings we call this "emptiness," in tantra "illusion," and in Dzogchen "the single sphere."{{sfn|Wangyal Rinpoche|2004|p=55}}}}

=====Sakya=====
The [[Sakya|Sakya school]] originated in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century.{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=202}} [[Gorampa|Gorampa Sonam Senge]] (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the [[Sakya]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], established an understandings of [[Prasangika]] which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, emptiness is not just mere emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, but profound emptiness, the absence of the four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free from even grasping the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cabezón, José Ignacio. ''Freedom from extremes: Gorampa's "Distinguishing the views" and the Polemics of Emptiness.'' Wisdom Publications, 2007, pages 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shentong (Buddha-nature)====

=====Jonang=====
{{Main|Jonang}}
The Jonang school originated in the 12th century. Tsongkhapa strongly opposed the Jonang school, whose views he "deemed to be ... dharmically incorrect".{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=207}}

In the Tibetan [[Jonang]] school, only the Buddha and the Buddha Nature are viewed as ''not'' intrinsically empty, but as truly real, unconditioned, and replete with eternal, changeless virtues.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8-16}} The Buddha Nature ([[tathagatagarbha]]) is only empty of what is impermanent and conditioned, not of its own self. The Buddha Nature is truly real, and primordially present in all beings.

An important Tibetan treatise on Emptiness and the Buddha Nature is found in the scholar-monk [[Dolpopa|Dolpopa's]] voluminous study, ''Mountain Doctrine''.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006}} It... 
{{quote| ... follows the format, inherited from India, of a presentation by way of both reasoning and scripture - the scriptural citations being so rich that the book can also be considered an inspiring anthology, a veritable treasure-trove of literature about the [[Buddha-nature|matrix-of-one-gone-thus]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=5}}}}

In this vast ''Mountain Doctrine'', [[Dolpopa]] describes the Buddha Nature as ...
{{quote|[N]on-material emptiness, emptiness that is far from an annihilatory emptiness, great emptiness that is the ultimate pristine wisdom of superiors ...buddha earlier than all buddhas, ... causeless original buddha.{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=14}}}}

The Buddha-nature is filled with eternal powers and virtues:
{{quote|[P]ermanent, stable, eternal, everlasting. Not compounded by causes and conditions, the matrix-of-one-gone-thus is intrinsically endowed with ultimate buddha qualities of body, speech, and mind such as the ten powers; it is not something that did not exist before and is newly produced; it is self-arisen.'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=8}}}}

Dolpopa also cites the ''[[Angulimaliya Sutra|Angulimaliya Sutra&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s]]'' contrast between empty phenomena such as the moral and emotional afflictions (''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]]''), which are like ephemeral hailstones, and the enduring, eternal Buddha, which is like a precious gem:
{{quote|Empty phenomena are other [different]; non-empty phenomena are other [different]. The tens of millions of afflictive emotions like hail-stones are empty. The phenomena in the class of non-virtues, like hail-stones, quickly disintegrate. Buddha, like a vaidurya jewel, is permanent ... The liberation of a buddha also is form ... do not make a discrimination of non-division, saying, "The character of liberation is empty".'{{sfn|Hopkins|2006|p=210}}}}

=====Kagyu=====
The Kagyu teacher [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche|Khenpo Tsultrim]], in ''Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness'', presents five strages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=19-26}}{{sfn|Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso|1994}}
* "Sravaka meditation on non-self" – meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self;
* "Cittamatra-approach" – meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver;
* "Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach" – meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any "substance";
* "Prasangika-Mdhyamaka approach" – meditation on "the non-conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness." In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned;
*  Shentong Madhyamaka – meditation on ''Paramarthasatya'' ("Absolute Reality"),{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=21}}{{refn|group=note|name="Absolute"|According to Hookham, non-dual experience is Ultimate Reality.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} ''Buddhajnana'',{{refn|group=note|name="Buddhajnana"|According to Hookham, "The Chinese Tathagarba schools describe Buddhajnana as the totality of all that is, which pervades every part of all that is in its totality."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}} According to Hookham, for Shentong Buddhajnana is "the non-dual nature of Mind completely unobscured and endowed with its countless Buddha Qualities (''Buddhagunas'').{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=37}}}} which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as "truly existing."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} This approach helps "to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,"{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=22}} and "the habit – fosterd on the earlier stages of the path – of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}} It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner "to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated."{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=23}}

===Chinese Buddhism===
When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in terms of its own culture. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The [[Tathāgatagarbha Sutras]] and the idea of the [[Buddha-nature]] were endorsed, because of the perceived similarities with the [[Tao]], which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. [[Sunyata]] at first was also understood as pointing to transcendental reality.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}} It took [[Chinese Buddhism]] several centuries to realize that [[sunyata]] does not refer to an essential transcendental reality underneath or behind the world of appearances.{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

====Chán====
{{Main|Zen|Chinese Chán}}
The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernable in Zen. Zen teachers still mention the Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature is Sunyata, the absence of an independent and substantial "self".{{sfn|Lai|Year unknown}}

===Western Buddhism===
Various western Buddhists note that ''sunyata'' refers to the emptiness of inherent existence, as in Madhyamaka; but also to the emptiness of mind or awareness, as open space and the "ground of being," as in meditation-orientated traditions and approaches such as Dzogchen and [[Shentong]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;ref group=web name="Wellings"&gt;Nigel Wellings (2009), ''[http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 Is there anything there? – the Tibetan Rangtong Shentong debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518063508/http://www.contemplativeforum.co.uk/wordpress/?p=204 |date=2015-05-18 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Quotes:&lt;br&gt;* John Snelling: "At the core of Mahayana philosophy lies the notion of Emptiness: ''Shunyata''. This is very much in the spirit of ''anatta'' (Skt. ''anatman'') as first taught by the Buddha. It is often used to imply, not mere or sheer nothingness (that would be the nihilistic view), but 'emptiness of ''inherent existence'''; that is, the absence of any kind of enduring or self-sustaining essence. There is also a sense in which it has connotations of 'conceptual emptiness': absence of thoughts. It could be regarded too as a non-term signifying the ineffable understanding arising within the practice of meditation. Although seemingly negative, it also has its positive uses - and of course ultimately points beyond the positive negative dichotomy."{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=101-102}}&lt;br&gt;* Hans Knibbe: "There are at least to important meanings of this concept of emptiness, namely:&lt;br&gt; - empty of independent existence;&lt;br&gt; - openness and space as grounf of being.{{sfn|Knibbe|2014|p=46}}&lt;br&gt;* Nigel Wellings:&lt;ref group=web name ="Wellings"/&gt; "Thus we have two types of emptiness, the emptiness of self in the skandhas that reveals the absence of an empirical and metaphysical self. And the emptiness of the self in Nirvâ.na that reveals nothing of the empirical self existing within the Nirvâ.na consciousness.&lt;br&gt;Harvey seems to confirm this view when he tells us that all conditioned dharmas are empty of self because they are impermanent and a source of suffering, while the unconditioned dharma, Nirvâ.na, is empty because it does not “support the feeling of ‘I-ness’”, that is, the impermanent skandhas. (1990:52). This is very similar to the teaching of the modern Kagyu Nyingma Lama, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a Shentong exponent:
{{quote|All appearances are empty, in that they can be destroyed or extinguished in some way [...] The whole universe vanishes at some point, destroyed by the seven fires and one immense deluge. In this way, all appearances are empty.&lt;br&gt;Mind is also ultimately empty, but its way of being empty is not the same as appearances. [My italics] Mind can experience anything but it cannot be destroyed. Its original nature is the dharmakaya of all Buddhas. You cannot actually do anything to mind – you can’t change it, wash it away, bury it or burn it. What is truly empty, though, is all the appearances that appear in the mind. (Tulku Urgyen (1999), ''As It Is vol.1'' Rangjang Yeshe, Boudhanath, Hong Kong &amp; Nasby. p.53)}}}}

==Hinduism==

===Influence on Advaita Vedanta===
Gaudapada is considered by some scholars to have been strongly influenced by Buddhism, as he developed his concept of [[Ajativada|"ajāta"]] from Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=35-36}} which uses the term "anutpāda":{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}}
* "An" means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to [[Saṃsāra|birth, change and death]]. The Absolute is ''aja'', the unborn eternal.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} The [[Empiricism|empirical world]] of [[phenomenon|appearances]] is considered [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (unreal as it is transitory), and not [[Philosophical realism|absolutely existent]].{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=127}} Thus, Gaudapada's concept of ''ajativada'' is similar to Buddhist term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or śūnyatā.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}}{{refn|group=note|The term is also used in the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is [[kenshō]], seeing into the true nature of existence,{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance [Sunyata]".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}}}

But Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} Gaudapada's perspective found in ''Mandukya Karika'' is based on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} According to Gaudapada, the metaphysical absolute called [[Brahman]] never changes, while the phenomenal world changes continuously, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the perceived world has to be a transitory (unreal) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (''paramārthatā'') the phenomenal world is ''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'', "illusion",{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}} apparently existing but ultimately not metaphysically real.{{sfn|Hiriyanna|2000|p=25, 160-161}}

In ''Gaudapada-Karika'', chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that [[Brahman]] never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:
{{quote|
When the mind does not lie low, and is not again tossed about, then that being without movement, and not presenting any appearance, culminates into [[Brahman]]. Resting in itself, calm, with Nirvana, indescribable, highest happiness, unborn and one with the unborn knowable, omniscient they say. No creature whatever is born, no origination of it exists or takes place. This is that highest truth where nothing whatever is born.
|Gaudapada Karika|3.46-48, Translated by RD Karmarkar&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n83/mode/2up Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast to Renard's view,{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}} Karmarkar states the Ajativada of Gaudapada has nothing in common with the ''Śūnyatā'' concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;RD Karmarkar, [https://archive.org/stream/Gaudapada-Karika.English/Gaudapada-Karika#page/n45/mode/2up/search/ajativada Gaudapada's Karika], Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages xxxix-xl&lt;/ref&gt; While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Comans, their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of "Brahman, [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Turiya" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=36}}

===In Shaivism===
''Sunya'' and ''Sunyatisunya'' are concepts which appear in some [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] texts, such as the [[Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra]], which contains several verses mentioning voidness as a feature of ultimate reality - [[Shiva]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Absolute void is Bhairava who is beyond the senses and the mind, beyond all the categories of these instruments. From the point of view of the human mins, He is most void. from the point of view of Reality, He is most full, for He is the source of all manifestation."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The yogi should concentrate intensely on the idea (and also feel) that this universe is totally void. In that void, his mind would become absorbed. Then he becomes highly qualified for absorption i.e. his mind is absorbed in the absolute void (sunyatisunya)."&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh, Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness: A Treasury of 112 Types of Yoga, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a series of Kannada language texts of [[Lingayatism]], a Shaivism tradition, ''shunya'' is equated to the concept of the Supreme. In particular, the ''Shunya Sampadane'' texts present the ideas of [[Allama Prabhu]] in a form of dialogue, where ''shunya'' is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as a state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Schuhmacher|title=The Encyclopedia of Eastern Philosophy and Religion: Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Zen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpP8770qVakC |year=1994|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-0-87773-980-7|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vaishnavism===
''Shunya Brahma'' is a concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as "personified void". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' (Vishnu) in certain text.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chittaranjan Das|title=Bhakta Charana Das (Medieval Oriya Writer)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2QowAAAAMAAJ |year=1994|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7201-716-3|pages=9, 101–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''Śūnyatā'' concept of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"/&gt; However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p388"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roshen Dalal|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;pg=PA388 |year=2010|publisher=Penguin  |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhoi2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bettina Bäumer (Translator)|title=Bhima Bhoi, Verses from the Void: Mystic Poetry of an Oriya Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNnhSAAACAAJ|year=2010|publisher=Manohar Publishers |isbn=978-81-7304-813-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vaishnavism]] of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the idea of Shunya [[Brahman]] or Shunya [[Purusha]] is found in the poetry of the Orissan [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] (Five Friends), such as in the compositions of 16th-century [[Acyutananda]]. Acyutananda's ''Shunya Samhita'' extols the nature of Shunya Brahman: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''nāhi tāhāra rūpa varṇa, adṛsha avarṇa tā cinha.''&lt;br /&gt;
''tāhāku brahmā boli kahi, śūnya brahmhati se bolāi.''

It has no shape, no colour, &lt;br /&gt;
It is invisible and without a name&lt;br /&gt;
This Brahman is called Shunya Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;Acyutānanda, ''Brahma Saṃhitā'', translated by Patnaik, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oriya literature#Age of the Panchasakhas|Panchasakhas]] practiced a form of [[Bhakti]] called Jnana-mishrita Bhakti-marga, which saw the necessity of knowledge ([[Jnana]]) and devotion - [[Bhakti]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
