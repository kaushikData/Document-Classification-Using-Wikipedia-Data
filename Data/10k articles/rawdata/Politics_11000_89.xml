'''AGIR''' (''ACT'' or ''REACT'' in English) is an organization of students with a [[Galician nationalism|Galician independentist]] and [[anticapitalist]] ideology. It's an organization that has presence in different [[Comarcas of Galicia|comarcas]] of [[Galiza]] and is made up only of active students.

==History==
AGIR was created by the merge of 4 previous organizations: [[Independentist Students]], the [[Revolutionary Students Federation|FER]], the [[Galician Antifascist Students Assembly]] and [[Comitê Aberto do Movimento Estudantil de Magistério|CAMEM]], being the [[Revolutionary Students Federation|FER]], close to [[Primeira Linha]], the most supportive of the merge. The majority of the [[Independentist Students]] militants (the largest of the previous organizations) abandoned AGIR due to disagreements with the political line of the new organization. In the 2012 elections to the student representatives in the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] AGIR gained its first seat in the University Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sermosgaliza.gal/artigo/social/as-organizacions-estudantis-nacionalistas-logran-38-d-s-75-representantes-no-claustro-da-usc/20120523171039001553.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015064027/http://www.sermosgaliza.gal/artigo/social/as-organizacions-estudantis-nacionalistas-logran-38-d-s-75-representantes-no-claustro-da-usc/20120523171039001553.html |archivedate=15 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 elections AGIR won two seats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.es/export/sites/default/gl/goberno/secxeral/Resolucixn_e_listaxe_nelectos_provisionais_claustro_OK.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology, goals and structure==

AGIR defends a [[public education]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farodevigo.es/galicia/2014/02/20/estudiantes-gallegos-salen-calle-jueves/970982.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/santiago/2012/05/09/estudiantes-usc-dividen-movilizaciones-contra-recortes/0003_201205S9C6991.htm?idioma=galego&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Galician language]],&lt;ref&gt;http://old.kaosenlared.net/noticia/galiza-agir-lanca-campanha-pola-lingua&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism|not patriarchal]], democratic and of quality. The organization fights against privatization and for an educational plan for [[Galiza]], in [[Galician language]] and against [[sexism]] in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agir-galiza.org/web2.0/dez-medidas-basicas-para-um-outro-ensino-decalogo-do-estudantado-da-esquerda-independentista/|title=Dez medidas básicas para um outro ensino.

[[Sheikh]] '''Abdul Amir al-Jamri''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-(sheik) Abdel Amir Al-Jamri from Bahrain pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|ˈ|ɑː|b|d|əl|_|ə|ˈ|m|ɪər|_|æ|l|_|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː|m|r|i}} {{respell|AHB|dəl|_|ə|MEER|_|al|_|JAHM|ree}}; {{lang-ar|شيخ عبدالأمير الجمري}}; 1 March 1938 – 18 December 2006) was one of the most prominent [[Shia]] clerics and [[Bahraini opposition|opposition]] leaders in [[Bahrain]]. He was also a writer and a poet.

Born in the village of [[Bani Jamra]], al-Jamri became a [[Hussainia|Hussaini]] [[khatib]] (Shia preacher) after finishing primary school. At the age of 21, he began his Islamic studies, first in Bahrain and later in the [[Hawza|religious institute]] of [[Al Najaf]], [[Iraq]], where he remained for 11 years. He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was [[Bahraini parliamentary election, 1973|elected]] to the newly formed [[National Assembly of Bahrain|parliament]]. The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir, [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa|Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa]], after it had rejected the [[State Security Law in Bahrain|State Security Law]]. In 1977, al-Jamri was appointed as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain. He held the position until 1988, when he was briefly arrested due to his criticism of the government.

Al-Jamri is most notable for his role during the [[1990s uprising in Bahrain]]. As the lead figure of the opposition, he succeeded in bringing [[Islamist]]s, [[liberalism|liberal]]s and [[leftist]]s together against the monarchy. The events began in the form of petitions in 1992 and 1994 calling for restoration of the parliament and reinstatement of the suspended [[1973 Constitution of Bahrain#Constitution of 1973|constitution]], but led to widespread violence and the death of 40 individuals. Due to his civil rights activity, al-Jamri was imprisoned between April and September 1995, before being arrested again in January 1996 and imprisoned until July 1999, which was followed by a year and a half of house arrest.

In January 2001, al-Jamri was released along with other opposition activists. The new emir, [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]], proposed a reform plan, the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain]], which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued a new constitution which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands. Disappointed, al-Jamri soon fell ill, suffering from a series of [[stroke]]s and eventually dying of [[multiple organ failure]].

==Early life and Islamic studies==

Al-Jamri was born in the village of [[Bani Jamra]], Northern Bahrain, on 1 March 1938.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; His full name was '''Abdul Amir bin Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Abdulrasool bin Mohammed bin Hussain bin Ebrahim bin Makki bin Suleiman bin Makki al-Jamri al-Bahrani''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالأمير بن منصور بن محمد بن عبدالرسول بن محمد بن حسين بن إبراهيم بن مكي بن سليمان بن مكي الجمري البحراني}}),&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; although he was also known by his [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] '''Abu Jameel''' ({{lang-ar|أبو جميل}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ar:كم نحن بحاجة إليك أبا جميل |author=Hani al-Fardan | work=Al-Wasat |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3390/news/read/615705/1.html| language=Arabic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ar:لا أقول وداعا أبا جميل |language=Arabic |work=Al-Wasat |date=11 January 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2013| url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1588/news/read/210254/1.html |author=Ali Rashid Al Asheri}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father &amp;ndash; known as Mansoor or Nasir &amp;ndash; was a Quranic teacher, owner of a textile workshop,&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; and head of a "devout Shia family".&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"&gt;{{cite news| title=Sheikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=5 June 2013| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/dec/20/guardianobituaries.world |author=Phil Davison}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jamri's father taught him the [[Quran]] and basics of [[Salat|Islamic prayer]] when he was 6,&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ar:الشيخ الجمري... الاعتقال والحصار والإقامة الجبرية لم تثنه يوما عن شعبه |author=Amani al-Maskati |date=12 December 2007 |work=Al-Wasat |accessdate=8 June 2013 |language=Arabic |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267713/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; although died four years later.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; Al-Jamri finished formal education at [[Budaiya]] primary school when he was 12,&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; before becoming a [[Hussainia|Hussaini]] [[khatib]] (Shia preacher),&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(4)"&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ar:محمد حسين الجمري يروي يوميات عائلة تحت الحصار! |language=Arabic|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267715/1.html |author=Haidar Mohammed |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=8 June 2013 |work=Al-Wasat}}&lt;/ref&gt; learning from other well-known khatibs in his village such as his cousin, the renovator Shia khatib Mulla [[Atiya al-Jamri]].&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; He also obtained a job in the [[Manama Souq]], working there until 1962.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;

In 1959, al-Jamri began his religious studies in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; He was taught by [[Sheikh]] Abdulla al-Bahrani (died 1961) and Sheikh Baqir al-Asfoor.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; In 1962, following the death of his mentor, al-Jamri traveled to [[Iraq]] to study [[Islamic theology]] and [[Sharia|law]] in the [[Hawza|religious institute]] of [[Al Najaf]].&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; Mentored for two years by [[Ayatollah]] [[Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr]] and [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]], he reached the stage of independent research (Bahth al-kharij; {{lang-ar|بحث الخارج}}), the highest level of study in religious seminaries.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; He also wrote several religious articles which were published in Iraqi newspapers and magazines.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; In the country, al-Jamri used the [[pseudonym]] Abdulla Mansoor Mohammed in order to avoid trouble when passing through customs in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, where it was believed that the prefix "Abdul" should only be used with the name of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| script-title=ar:ذكريات غير متناثرة من النجف الأشرف |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/pictures/books/d2.pdf |trans-title=Non-scattered memories of Najaf |year=2007 |page=17 |publisher=''Al-Wasat'' |accessdate=10 June 2013 |author=Mansoor Al-Jamri |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudonym also helped him evade Iraq's [[Ba'athist]] regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] following an anti-Ba'athist speech which al-Jamri gave in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| script-title=ar:ذكريات غير متناثرة من النجف الأشرف |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/pictures/books/d2.pdf |trans-title=Non-scattered memories of Najaf |year=2007 |pages=17, 19 |publisher=''Al-Wasat'' |accessdate=10 June 2013 |author=Mansoor Al-Jamri |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spending 11 years in Iraq, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in 1973.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; Between 1973 and 1981, al-Jamri was a frequent host on [[Bahrain TV]], giving religious talks on Islamic occasions such as [[Ramadan]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]].&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; In 1985, he founded a small [[hawza]] in the mosque next to his house.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt;

==Member of Parliament==

Bahrain became [[Bahrain Independence Day|independent]] from the United Kingdom in 1971 and the [[Bahraini Constituent Assembly election, 1972|Constituent Assembly of 1972]] had drafted a [[1973 Constitution of Bahrain#Constitution of 1973|new constitution]] by 1973.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 22.10.2010"&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ar:"الكتلة الدينية" في برلمان 1973 |author=Wesam Al-Seb'a |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2013| language=Arabic |work=Al-Wasat |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/2968/news/read/493809/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his study colleague [[Isa Qassim]], al-Jamri initially wanted to complete his religious studies and did not care much about politics.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt; His mentor in Iraq, Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, issued a binding [[fatwā]] for participation in the [[Bahraini parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; Al-Jamri and five others formed the "Religious Bloc" which adopted a wide program including supporting the labor's union and demands, forbidding trade of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, and separating men and women in education institutes. The bloc also called for prohibiting male doctors from treating female patients (especially in pregnancy) as well as other demands connected to traditional Islamic customs.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt; Al-Jamri was elected to the [[National Assembly of Bahrain]], ranking second behind Isa Qassim.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt;

In August 1975, the constitution was suspended and the assembly dissolved&lt;ref name="BBC 18.12.2006"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahrain pro-democracy cleric dies |work=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6190705.stm|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Emir, [[Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa|Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa]], after it had rejected the [[State Security Law in Bahrain|State Security Law]].&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"/&gt; The act &amp;ndash; also known as "the precautionary law" &amp;ndash; was proposed by the British adviser [[Ian Henderson (police officer)|Ian Henderson]].&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"/&gt; It gave police wide powers of arrest and allowed individuals to be held in prison without trial or charge for up to three years (renewable&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;) for suspicion "that they might be a threat to the state".&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"&gt;{{cite news| author=[[Adam Curtis]] |date=11 May 2012 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2012/05/if_you_take_my_advice_-_id_rep.html |title=If you take my advice - I'd repress them |work=BBC |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jamri was a member of a foreign relations committee,&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 22.10.2010"/&gt; and an outspoken critic of the State Security Law.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;

==1977–1988==

In the period from 1975 to 2001, the Emir [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; Human rights activists and opposition leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the arbitrary arrest of thousands, and assassinations, all of which were denied by the authorities.&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"/&gt; Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed that they were being discriminated against by the government, and that they were being treated as second class citizens.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;

===Judge===

In 1977, the government offered al-Jamri the opportunity to serve as a judge at the High Religious Court of Bahrain ([[Shia]] branch).&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; Al-Jamri agreed after Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei issued him with a religious permit to do so.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; The decision was controversial within Bahrain, as many Shia clerics had refused to participate in the [[Judiciary of Bahrain|government-run judiciary]] ever since its foundation in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; Al-Jamri held the position until June 1988, when he was suspended due to his criticism of the government.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt;

===Political activism===

Following the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]],&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; and continuing throughout the 1980s, the intensity of Bahrain's political situation sharply increased.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by the [[National Security Agency (Bahrain)|Security and Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; In 1984, the [[Islamic Enlightenment institution]], with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt;

In 1988, the situation came to a head when al-Jamri ignored a final warning by the government.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; In June, he was dismissed from his job as a judge.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; In August, his son-in-law [[Abduljalil Khalil]] was arrested and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ar:الشيخ عبدالامير الجمري |language=Arabic |date=3 July 2003 |work=Al-Wasat |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/300/news/read/319191/1.html |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; In September, his elder son [[Mohamed Jameel al-Jamri|Mohamed Jameel]] was arrested and sentenced to ten years.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; The authorities then ordered al-Jamri's arrest; on 6 September, Colonel [[Adel Flaifel]] and a number of security forces arrived at his house.&lt;ref name="al-Jamri book"/&gt; Al-Jamri's wife rushed to the nearby mosque and called people from its speakers.&lt;ref name="al-Jamri book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; Amid neighbors' protests, security forces decided to let al-Jarmi go after only an hour's detention.&lt;ref name="al-Jamri book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt;

==Role during the 1990s uprising==

===Background===

{{main|1990s uprising in Bahrain}}

There was a time of civil strife in Bahrain from 1994 to 1999,&lt;ref name="BBC 18.12.2006"/&gt; during which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces to demand democratic reforms.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}} The uprising was the largest in the country's history, and included widespread demonstrations and violence.&lt;ref name="BBC 11.5.2012"/&gt;

In 1992, a petition was signed by 280 leading figures in civil society, demanding the restoration of parliament, reinstatement of the suspended constitution, the release of political prisoners, and the start of a reconciliation dialogue.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}} The government rejected their demands and instead set up a thirty-member appointed "Shura council" assigned with "commenting" on government proposed legislation.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; In 1994, another petition was launched with the same demands,&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; this time open to all citizens.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; Organizers said that they had collected over 20,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="HRW report"&gt;{{cite report| url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/45cafc9e2.html |title=Routine Abuse, Routine Denial: Civil Rights and the Political Crisis in Bahrain |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |author=[[Human Rights Watch]]| date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence broke out in June 1994 when riot police used tear gas on 1,500 demonstrators who had organized a sit-in in front of the Ministry of Labor. The protesters were campaigning against the increasing rate of unemployment, which had reached 15 percent.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; Over the following years, many opposition leaders were arrested and others exiled.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; Some protesters used [[Molotov cocktails]] to attack "police stations, banks and commercial properties".&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; Riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets, some of which were fired at the crowd from police helicopters.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; It was also reported that police used live ammunition in some cases.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; Overall, about forty people were killed,&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; including several detainees who were in police custody (allegedly due to torture), and at least three policemen.&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt;

During the uprising, al-Jamri "rose to prominence", becoming the lead figure among the opposition, who saw him as "their father figure and spiritual mentor."&lt;ref name="BBC 18.12.2006"/&gt;  To the Shia, he was their "spiritual leader".&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; He was a "chief architect"{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}} and a signatory of the 1992 and 1994 petitions.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; He was also the informal leader of the U.K.-based [[Bahrain Freedom Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Detained by state |date=7 December 1998 |work=[[The Independent]] {{subscription required|via=[[Highbeam Research]]}}| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4956157.html |author=Fran Abrahams |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jamri, himself a Shia Islamist, had good relations with secular and liberal opposition forces and united them into "an effective opposition movement".&lt;ref name="NYT 21.12.2006"/&gt;{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=21}} Due to his civil rights activity,&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; the pro-democracy cleric&lt;ref name="BBC 18.12.2006"/&gt; was arrested and placed under house arrest for years.

===First arrest===

In 1995, following clashes between security forces and students, the government accused al-Jamri of having links to Iran and seeking to establish an "Islamic republic" in Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; Al-Jamri denied the accusations.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, on 1 April the government imposed a blockade on al-Jamri's home of Bani Jamra, placing him and 18 members of his family under house arrest.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; At least one man was killed and 16 others injured during clashes with police.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Arrests, Fatal Firebombing, Execution Raise the Stakes in Bahrain Unrest |work=[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]] {{subscription required|via=HighBeam Research}} |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-592537251.html |date=31 July 1996 |accessdate=6 June 2013| author=Stephen J. Sosebee}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day became known locally as the [[Black Saturday (Bahrain)|Black Saturday]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; Two weeks later, al-Jamri was transferred to a detention center.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; Along with other opposition figures he was released on 25 September 1995, following a deal with the government to calm down the situation in return for opening up talks on the restoration of parliament.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; Tens of thousands of Bahrainis gathered to welcome al-Jamri following his release.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; He gave a speech in which he promised to stay loyal to the hopes and sufferings of the Bahraini people.&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt;

===Second arrest, trial and conviction===

On 23 October, al-Jamri and other released opposition activists began a 10-day hunger strike in his house to protest what they called the government's failure to fulfill its pledges.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; Tens of thousands gathered in solidarity with the activists on the final day of the hunger strike (1 November).&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; On 21 January 1996 al-Jamri was detained again along with 7 other opposition leaders, including [[Abdulwahab Hussain]] and [[Hassan Mushaima]], following the collapse of the talks.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OMCT 6.3.2000"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.omct.org/urgent-campaigns/urgent-interventions/bahrain/2000/03/d14824/ |title=Bahrain: Bahrain:Abdul-Wahab Hussain |publisher=[[World Organisation Against Torture]] |date=6 March 2000 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrests provoked further unrest.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; The activists denied the charges of forming a militia group called "Bahraini [[Hizbullah]]" or receiving support from Iran.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;

Al-Jamri spent 3 and a half years in prison, during which he allegedly spent the first 9 months in solitary confinement and was closely observed during the remaining period.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; On 21 February 1999, about three years after his arrest, al-Jamri's trial before the State Security Court began.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; On 7 July, the court convicted him on charges of "spying and inciting unrest against the royal family".&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TE 10.7.1999"&gt;{{cite news| title=The poverty puzzle |date=10 July 1999 |work=The Economist {{subscription required|via=Highbeam Research}} |accessdate=6 June 2013 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55151032.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Jamri was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and fined [[Bahraini dinar|BD]]5.7 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]15 million).&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TE 10.7.1999"/&gt; British politician [[George Galloway]],&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name="HRW report"/&gt; [[International Pen]] and [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="TE 16.7.1999"&gt;{{cite journal| volume=XI |url=http://www.theestimate.com/public/071699.html |publisher=The Estimate |date=16 July 1999 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |title=Freeing the Dissident Sheikhs: Saudis, Bahrainis Relaxing Strictures?}}&lt;/ref&gt; led campaigns in solidarity with al-Jamri.

===Release, reconciliation and disappointment===

Emir Isa bin Salman died suddenly on 6 March and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Bahrain's ninth al-Khalifa |date=6 March 1999 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |work=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/291757.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new emir pardoned al-Jamri and released him a day after his conviction (8 July), but placed him under house arrest until 23 January 2001.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}} Before getting pardoned, al-Jamri had to appear on nationaltelevision and read a "humiliating letter of apology" to the Emir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Bahrain:Sunni and Shia Muslims want more than political gestures from Sheikh Hamad |work=[[The Economist]] {{subscription required|via=Highbeam Research}} |date=17 July 1999 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55176663.html |accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated meetings between commissioners of the Emir and al-Jamri were held during the house arrest period.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(4)"/&gt; Subsequent days saw the release of further political prisoners, and exiles were allowed to return.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=18}} On 8 February, al-Jamri and 3 other opposition leaders —[[Abdulla al-Ghuraifi]], Abdulwahab Hussain and [[Ali Rabea]]— met with the emir to discuss his reform plans, the [[National Action Charter of Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 30.4.2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/967/news/read/460775/1.html |script-title=ar:عبدالوهاب حسين |work=Al-Wasat |date=30 April 2005 |accessdate=23 May 2012| language=Arabic }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter called for the introduction of a [[constitutional monarchy]], an [[independent judiciary]], and a [[bicameral legislature]] composed of a lower house of elected representatives and an upper house of appointed legislators. The Charter also granted equal rights between men and women, and recognised all Bahraini citizens as having equal political rights, including the entitlement to elections and political candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?t=3&amp;cid=2 |title=Country Theme: Elections: Bahrain |publisher=Programme on Governance in the Arab Region |accessdate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wNSNDw42?url=http://www.pogar.org/countries/theme.aspx?t=3&amp;cid=2 |archivedate=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8 February meeting, the government promised that "the new political arrangements will not invalidate the 1973 constitution and that the upper appointed house will be for consultation only."{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=18}} The next day, after leading [[Friday prayer]], al-Jamri delivered a famous speech, starting with "Allah is my witness, I have missed you as much as [[Jacob]] missed [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]", before Abdulwahab announced that the opposition had decided to accept the reform plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=صادق الجمري يروي حواريات والده مع القيادة السياسية |author=Haidar Mohammed |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=8 June 2013 |work=Al-Wasat |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267716/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Action Charter was voted on in a referendum on 14 and 15 February, gaining massive popular support (98.4%).&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 30.4.2005"/&gt; In November 2001, the [[Al Wefaq]] Shia political society was founded,{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=21}} with al-Jamri being seen as its mentor.&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;

On 14 February 2002, the Emir introduced the new constitution of 2002, which gave him wide-ranging powers and gave the upper appointed house more powers than the elected lower house, including the right to legislate.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}} The "honeymoon" period between the opposition and government was over; al-Jamri stated his disappointment with the new constitution, stating that it fell short of the opposition's demands.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|pp=18–20}} "[T]his is not the type of parliament we had demanded," he said.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}}

==Illness and death==

Then under house arrest, in May 2000 al-Jamri suffered a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; He was taken to the [[Bahrain Defence Force Hospital]], where he underwent surgery.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt; During his stay at the hospital, he was visited by the King and [[Prime Minister of Bahrain|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; In May 2002, al-Jamri traveled to Germany for spinal surgery.&lt;ref name="AP 12.7.2003"/&gt; While undergoing medical checkups, it was discovered he had a [[thrombus]] behind his eye, which had developed when he was in prison.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; Following the surgery he suffered a stroke, also developing kidney problems and a blood infection, soon falling into a coma.&lt;ref name="AP 12.7.2003"/&gt; He woke from the coma on 30 June,&lt;ref name="AP 30.6.2002"&gt;{{cite news| title=Bahrain's leading Shiite cleric comes out of coma at German hospital |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-53958041.html |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2013 |work=Associated Press {{subscription required|via=Highbeam Research}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; but shortly after suffered a second stroke, resulting in internal bleeding,&lt;ref name="AP 12.7.2003"/&gt; and incapacitating him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=20}}

On 27 January 2003, al-Jamri was transferred from Germany to [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation#Projects and activities|Sultan bin Abdulaziz Humanitarian City]] in [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 3.7.2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=أم جميل: بعد 49 عاما... لايزال الشيخ الجمري معي |author=Nada al-Wadi |accessdate=9 June 2013| url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1604/news/read/212917/1.html |date=27 January 2007 |work=Al-Wasat}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his medical condition improved slightly.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; He returned to Bahrain on 12 July and was welcomed by hundreds of his supporters.&lt;ref name="AP 12.7.2003"&gt;{{cite news| title=Bahrain's leading Shiite cleric returns home after receiving medical treatment abroad for more than a year |author=Adnan Malik |date=12 July 2003 |accessdate=11 June 2013 |work=[[Associated Press]] {{subscription required|via=Highbeam Research}} |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-75180638.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His medical condition deteriorated again as he suffered from repeated [[Airway constriction|respiratory problems]] and another stroke, and in the end he lost the ability to speak.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt; In the early morning of 18 December 2006, al-Jamri was rushed by ambulance from his home to [[Salmaniya Medical Complex]], where he was announced dead.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"&gt;{{cite news| work=Al-Wasat |author=[[Mansoor Al-Jamri]] |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2013| script-title=ar:الشيخ الجمري أوفى لشعبه... فأوفى له |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267710/1.html |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death was [[Multiple organ failure|heart and kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20.12.2006"/&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Funeral===

Although al-Jamri's death was announced in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset [[Maghrib prayer]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007"&gt;{{cite news| author=Kassim Hussain | script-title=ar:الليلة الأخيرة... مهابة التشييع |language=Arabic |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2013 |work=Al-Wasat |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267712/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral course was changed several times.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; Ultimately, it began at 6:00 in [[Muqsha]] village before moving along the west side of Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt; The weather was extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black [[mourning]] clothes and carrying black flags.&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007"/&gt; According to a number of ''Al-Wasat'' writers, the funeral was the largest in the [[modern history of Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(3)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007(2)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Wasat 12.12.2007"/&gt;

===Successor===

Following the 2002 deterioration of his health, al-Jamri's position as a political and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition was taken over by his lifelong friend, Ayatollah [[Isa Qassim]].{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|pp=20–1}} Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions,{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=21}} but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri.{{sfn|Mansoor Al-Jamri|2010|p=21}} Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.&lt;ref name="sada"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2008/08/20/bahrain-s-controversial-political-associations-law/6eg5 |title=Bahrain's Controversial Political Associations Law |publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate= 21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph 18.2.2011"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/bahrain-wikileaks-cables/8334582/A-FIELD-GUIDE-TO-BAHRAINI-POLITICAL-PARTIES.html |title=A field guide to Bahraini political parties |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] (via [[Wikileaks]]) |date=18 February 2011| accessdate=21 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Al-Jamri wrote several books and poems (in Arabic).&lt;ref name="Al Wasat 27.1.2009"/&gt; He kept writing poems even when he became bedridden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=سيد طالب: تميز الشيخ الجمري بالشجاعة وعلاقاته المتميزة بجميع المناطق |author=Malik Abdulla |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=9 June 2013 |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/1923/news/read/267718/1.html |work=Al-Wasat}}&lt;/ref&gt; His books include:

During a 1995 meeting, the group unveiled a "wanted" poster that listed the names and addresses of a "Deadly Dozen" abortion providers. The poster accused them of "[[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]" and offered a $5,000 reward for the "arrest, conviction and revocation of license to practice medicine" of these physicians. The poster was published in Life Advocate magazine. A second poster targeted a specific person, Dr. Robert Crist, offered a reward for persuading him "to turn from his child killing," and included his name, address, and photo.

In 1996 it revealed its "[[Nuremberg Files]]" which included dossiers on abortion providers, [[politician]]s, [[judge]]s, [[abortion clinic|clinic employee]]s and other [[pro-choice|abortion rights supporters]]. The ACLA claimed that these dossiers could be used for trials for "crimes against humanity" when the [[Abortion in the United States|nation's laws]] changed to prohibit abortion. [[Neal Horsley]], an activist, published the information on his website. His website greyed the names of those injured and crossed out the names of those [[Abortion-related violence|killed by anti-abortion activists]].

[[Planned Parenthood]] successfully sued the ACLA. Although the posters and website did not contain any specific threat, the jury awarded $107 million. The ACLA appealed the verdict on [[Freedom of speech in the United States|First Amendment]] grounds. A panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] initially overturned the verdict, holding that the activities of the ACLA were protected under the First Amendment because they did not directly threaten harm to the plaintiffs, and because the ACLA's statements were not communicated privately to the plaintiffs. The [[en banc]] 9th Circuit reversed the panel&lt;http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/abortion/ppacla51602opn.pdf&gt;, and held that the ACLA could be held liable in damages because the website made a deliberate threat with the expectation that someone would act on it, unprotected by the First Amendment.

The '''Battle of Stockton-on-Tees''', often referred to as the '''Battle of Stockton''', took place on 10 September 1933 at Market Cross in the High Street of [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[County Durham]], [[England]]. It was a clash between members of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF) and [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[communism|communists]] and supporters of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The march was an early attempt by the BUF to rally support in depressed areas, but the anti-fascists protested and drove out the BUF supporters who had been shipped in from other areas.

==Background==
Stockton had been hit hard by the economic recession following the [[Great Depression]]. The BUF had made previous attempts to hold meetings in Stockton, but they were frequently heckled or attacked by anti-fascists. It was therefore decided by the BUF to make a show of strength. One reason given as to why Stockton was chosen for the rally was to base the growth of the movement on that of the [[Nazi Party]], which rose from a [[grassroots]] movement in small towns that suffered economic hardship. Stockton was a small town, and at the time opposition was weak as there was only one [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP in [[Teesside]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Making History"&gt;{{cite episode|title=18/10/2011|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015zpdj|series=Making History|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Radio 4]]|airdate=18 October 2011|minutes=16.07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan for the rally, however, had been leaked to local [[trade union]]s. Although no-one seems to know for certain how the plan was leaked, historian Richard Griffiths has suggested that the leader of the BUF rally, Captain Vincent Collier, was actually a [[Shill|plant]] working for the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Jewish Board of Deuputies]] and possibly also working for [[MI5]].&lt;ref&gt;Serdiville, 2018. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; With neither the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] or [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Parties]] offering solutions to the problem, locals turned to more radical organisations, with members of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the [[National Unemployed Workers' Movement]] thus decided to set up a "reception committee" ready for the arrival.&lt;ref name="Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.stockton.gov.uk/stories/battle-stockton-1933/|title=The Battle of Stockton - 1933|publisher=Stockton Borough Council|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/16695900.battle-of-stockton-1933-fascists-and-anti-fascists-wage-war-on-streets/|title=Battle of Stockton 1933: fascists and anti-fascists wage war on streets|publisher=[[The Northern Echo]]|date=8 September 2018|accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serdiville, 2018. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The BUF arrived via a convoy of coaches during the afternoon of 10 September 1933, bringing in 200-300 members from [[Tyneside]], [[Manchester]] and [[Lancashire]]. They parked on the southern side of the [[River Tees]], on the [[Thornaby-on-Tees]] side of [[Victoria Bridge (Stockton-on-Tees)|Victoria Bridge]], then part of [[North Yorkshire]]. They then went to Stockton High Street, to the Market Cross area and attempted to hold a rally led by Collier. However, they were attacked by up to 2,000-3,000 anti-fascist protesters who had hidden themselves in the side streets around the High Street, who then began heckling and spitting at Collier. Although there was little [[police]] presence at the start, with just seven constables on duty across the whole town centre, the police later ordered the BUF to leave the High Street, so they went to Silver Street to protect themselves, but this ended up trapping them. Both sides then armed themselves with [[stave (wood)|stave]]s, [[Branch|sticks]] and [[pickaxe]] handles. The anti-fascists also used various missiles including stones, half-bricks, [[Brass knuckles|knuckledusters]] and [[potato]]es with [[razor blades]] inserted into them.&lt;ref name="Making History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Page 7"&gt;Serdiville, 2018. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Channing | first = Iain | title = Blackshirts and White Wigs: Reflections on Public Order Law and the Political Activism of the British Union of Fascists | pages = 98-100 | publisher = [[University of Plymouth]] | location = [[Plymouth]] | date = March 2014 | language = English | url = https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10026.1/2897/2014channing10128808phd.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y | access-date = 14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More police officers arrived to separate the two groups and to escort the BUF back to their coaches, with some BUF members marshalling in Silver Street, a narrow lane linking the High Street to the quayside. However, some BUF stragglers had to out-run the anti-fascists, while other BUF members broke ranks and attacked the hostile crowd. Reports claim that up to 20 members of the BUF were injured. Amongst them was Edmund "Ned" Warburton, brother of [[John Warburton (fascist)|John Warburton]],&lt;ref&gt;"John Warburton Fleet Street photographer who acted as a bouncer for the British Union of Fascists", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 2 September 2004, p. 29. &lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], who was hospitalised and later blinded in one eye due to a stone being thrown at him. No arrests were made by the police on the day.&lt;ref name="Council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Page 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1470744/John-Warburton.html|title=John Warburton|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd |first=Chris |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9309751.The_Battle_of_Stockton__1933/ |title=The Battle of Stockton, 1933 |publisher=[[Northern Echo]] |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd |first=Chris |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9305571.Fascists_clash_with_hecklers_at_Stockton/?ref=ar|title=The Battle of Stockton, September 10, 1933 |date=15 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to the event different between the police and press reporting of the battle with: "The police were naturally keen to demonstrate that they competently and successfully handled a difficult situation, while the press were keen to sell papers and sensationalise the events. While the reality may lie somewhere in the middle of these accounts, local contemporary accounts of the ‘Battle of Stockton’ ardently subscribe to the more violent version in order to demonstrate the local residents’ rejection of fascism and the event itself is remembered as a precursor to the more famous [[Battle of Cable Street]]."&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

==Commemoration==
In August 2017, an organisation called The Battle of Stockton Campaign (BoS) was founded in order to commemorate the battle, and to make it as well-known as the better-known Battle of Cable Street, a similar event that took place in London three years later. On 9 September 2018, a plaque marking the battle was unveiled at Market Cross by the town's mayor, Eileen Johnson.&lt;ref name="Northern Echo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Kelley|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/heard-battle-stockton-not-many-15066427|title=Heard of the Battle of Stockton?

The '''Bologna massacre''' ({{lang-it|strage di Bologna}}) was a  [[terrorism|terrorist]] bombing of the [[Bologna Central Station|Central Station]] at [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], on the morning of 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200. The attack was carried out by the [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] terrorist organization ''[[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]]'' (Armed Revolutionary Groups), which denied having any involvement. Other theories have been proposed however, especially in correlation with the [[strategy of tension]]. The bombing was the fourth deadliest terrestrial terrorist attack in [[Western Europe]] behind the [[2016 Nice attack|Nice attack]] in July 2016, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]] in November 2015, and the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]] in March 2004.

==Bombing ==
[[File:Strage di bologna soccorsi 18.jpg|thumb|Rescuers carrying a victim.]]

At 10:25 [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]], a [[time bomb]] hidden in an unattended suitcase detonated inside an air-conditioned waiting room at the Bologna station. As air conditioning was uncommon in Italy, the room was full of people seeking refuge from the August heat. The explosion destroyed most of the main building and hit the [[Ancona]]–[[Chiasso]] train that was waiting at the first platform. The blast was heard for miles. The roof of the waiting room collapsed onto the occupants, which significantly increased the total number of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/2/newsid_4532000/4532091.stm "1980: Bologna blast leaves dozens dead", BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strage di bologna soccorsi 16.jpg|thumb|left|Bystanders assisted with the rescue operations.]]
On that Saturday, the station was full of tourists, and the city was unprepared for such a massive incident. Many citizens and travelers provided first aid to victims and helped to extract people buried under the rubble. 

Because of a large number of casualties, and an insufficient supply of [[ambulances]] and emergency vehicles available to transport the injured to the hospitals, firefighters also employed [[bus]]es (particularly those from the #37 route), private cars, and [[taxi (transport)|taxi]]s. To provide care to the victims, doctors and hospital staff returned early from vacation. Some hospital departments that had been closed for summer holidays were reopened to allow the admission of all patients.

In the following days the central square of Bologna, [[Piazza Maggiore]], hosted large-scale demonstrations of indignation and protest by the population. Harsh criticism was directed toward government representatives, who attended the funerals of the victims celebrated in the [[Basilica San Petronio]] on 6 August. The only applause was reserved for [[Italian President|President]] [[Sandro Pertini]], who arrived by helicopter in Bologna at 17:30 on the day of the massacre, and said in tears in front of reporters: "I have no words, we are facing the most criminal enterprise that has ever taken place in Italy."&lt;ref&gt;La storia d'Italia, Vol. 23, Dagli anni di piombo agli anni 80, Torino, 2005, pag. 587&lt;/ref&gt;

The #37 bus, along with the clock stopped at 10:25, remained a symbol of the massacre. The attack was recorded as the worst atrocity in Italy since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Peter, Jackson, Paul (2008). ''The far right in Europe: an encyclopedia''. Greenwood World Press, p. 238. {{ISBN|1846450039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigations ==

The next day, police investigators found metal fragments and scraps of plastics near the source of the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='95 Percent Sure' Station Blast Was Terror Bomb|publisher=Associated Press|date=3 August 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bomb was later found to be composed of 23&amp;nbsp;kg of [[explosive]], a mixture of 5&amp;nbsp;kg of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and [[Composition B]], improved from 18&amp;nbsp;kg of [[Poudre B|T4]] ([[nitroglycerin]] for civil use).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9pywmKG0sk Carlo Lucarelli, ''Blu notte La strage di Bologna''] {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government, led by [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] Prime Minister [[Francesco Cossiga]], first assumed that the explosion was due to an accidental explosion of an old [[boiler]] located in the basement of the station. However, the evidence soon pointed to an act of [[terrorism]]. ''[[L'Unità]]'', the newspaper of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), on 3 August attributed responsibility for the attack to neo-fascists. Later, in a special session to the Senate, Cossiga supported the theory that [[neofascist|neo-fascist]]s were behind the attack, "unlike [[Left-wing terrorism|leftist terrorism]], which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives, [[Right-wing terrorism|black terrorism]] prefers the massacre because it promotes panic and impulsive reactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police search starts for Bologna bombers |publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=5 August 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neo-Fascists 'Prefer Massacre'|publisher= Reuters|date=6 August 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misinformation and false leads ==
Shortly after the bombing, the press agency [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] received a call from someone purporting to represent NAR and claiming responsibility. The call later proved to be fake and to have originated from the Florence office of [[SISMI]], the Italian Military Secret Service. Federigo Manucci Benincasa, director of the Florence branch of SISMI, would later be charged with obstruction of justice.

In September 1980, a "[[Lebanon|Lebanese]] connection" was manufactured, involving [[Al Fatah]], [[Phalangist]]s, Italian radicals and Swiss journalists tied to the Italian intelligence community, who supplied investigators with fake notes, memos, and reports.&lt;ref name=Ferraresi&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r0DG3uk9o8oC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=bologna+massacre&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMIn5WW74iWyQIVhSceCh153wQj#v=onepage&amp;q=bologna%20massacre&amp;f=false Ferraresi, Franco. ''Threats to Democracy'', Princeton University Press, 2012, p. 260,n.53] {{ISBN|9781400822119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a "[[KGB]] connection" concocted by intelligence head General [[Giuseppe Santovito]], a member of [[Propaganda Due|P2]] and [[Francesco Pazienza]].

Generals [[Pietro Musumeci]], a member of P2, and Belmonte of SISMI had a police sergeant put a suitcase full of explosives, of the same type that blew up the station, on a train in [[Bologna]]. The suitcase also contained personal items of two [[Far-right politics|right-wing extremists]], a Frenchman, and a German. Musumeci also produced a phony dossier called "Terror on trains". Musumeci was charged with falsifying evidence in order to incriminate [[Roberto Fiore]] and [[Gabriele Adinolfi]], two leaders of ''[[Terza Posizione]]'' who had fled to London.&lt;ref name=Monzat89&gt;René Monzat, ''Enquêtes sur la droite extrême'', [[Le Monde]]-éditions, 1992, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Terza Posizione'' leaders claimed that Musumeci was trying to divert attention from [[Licio Gelli]] (head of the "masonic" lodge P2).&lt;ref name=Monzat89/&gt;

Gelli and Pazienza were convicted of obstructing the investigation, as were [[Pietro Musumeci|Musumeci]] and Belmonte of SISMI.

== Prosecution and trial ==
The attack has been attributed to the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari|NAR]] (Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari), a neo-fascist terrorist organization. A long and controversial court case began after the bombing. [[Francesca Mambro]] and [[Giuseppe Fioravanti]] were sentenced to life imprisonment.

In April 2007, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Luigi Ciavardini, a NAR member associated closely with close ties to ''Terza Posizione''. Ciavardini received a 30-year prison sentence for his role in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bologna bomber's 30-year jail term confirmed | publisher = Associated Press | date = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ciavardini had been arrested following the [[armed robbery]] of the ''Banca Unicredito di Roma'' on 15 September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/04/sezioni/cronaca/strage-bologna-ciavardini/strage-bologna-ciavardini/strage-bologna-ciavardini.html "Strage di Bologna, 30 anni a Ciavardini—Cassazione conferma la condanna all'ex Nar"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', 11 April 2007 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arrestato&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/10/sezioni/cronaca/arrestato-ciavardini/arrestato-ciavardini/arrestato-ciavardini.html "Arrestato l'estremista nero Ciavardini per una rapina a mano armata"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', 10 October 2006 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ciavardini was also charged with the assassination of Francesco Evangelista on 28 May 1980, and the assassination of Judge [[Mario Amato]] on 23 June 1980.&lt;ref name=Arrestato/&gt;
 
On 26 August 1980, the prosecutor of Bologna issued twenty-eight arrest warrants against far-right militants of the NAR and Terza Posizione. Among those arrested were [[Massimo Morsello]] (a future founder of [[Forza Nuova]]), Francesca Mambro, [[Aldo Semerari]], [[Maurizio Neri]], and fascist militant [[Paolo Signorelli]]. They were interrogated in Ferrara, Rome, Padua, and Parma. All were released from prison in 1981.

Main stages of the trial:
* [[Bologna]], 9 March 1987: first trial.
**Accused of murder: Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco, Roberto Rinani and Paolo Signorelli.
**Accused of forming an armed gang: Gilberto Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Egidio Giuliani, Marcello Iannilli, Mambro, Giovanni Melioli, Picciafuoco, Roberto Raho, Rinani and Signorelli.
**Accused of subversive association: Marco Ballan, Giuseppe Belmonte, Fabio De Felice, [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]], Fachini, [[Licio Gelli]], Maurizio Giorgi, [[Pietro Musumeci]], [[Francesco Pazienza]], Signorelli and [[Adriano Tilgher (politician)|Adriano Tilgher]].
**Accused of defamation to ensure impunity for the massacre's perpetrators: Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza.&lt;ref name=Zavoli&gt;Sergio Zavoli, ''La notte della Repubblica'', Nuova Eri, 1992 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11 July 1988: Judgment:
**Life imprisonment for the crime of murder: Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Picciafuoco. Acquitted: Rinani and Signorelli.
**Convicted of forming an armed gang: Cavallini, Fachini, Fioravanti, Giuliani, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli. Acquitted: Iannilli, Melioli and Raho.
**Acquitted of subversive association: Ballan, Belmonte, Felice, Delle Chiaie, Fachini, Gelli, Giorgi, Musumeci, Pazienza, Signorelli and Tilgher.
**Convicted of defamation to ensure impunity for the massacre's perpetrators: Belmonte, Gelli, Musumeci and Pazienza.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;
* 25 October 1989: The appeal process begins.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;
* 18 July 1990: Judgment on appeals:
**Acquitted of murder: Fachini, Fioravanti, Mambro, Picciafuoco, Rinani and Signorelli.
**Convicted of forming an armed gang: Cavallini, Fioravanti, Mambro and Giuliani.
**Convicted of defamation: Belmonte and Musumeci (acquitted of subversive association). The other defendants were acquitted.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;

On 12 February 1992, the united sections of the Criminal [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] acquitted Rinani and Signorelli of the charge of murder. Signorelli was also acquitted for armed gang and subversive association. The court also acquitted a number of other defendants facing various charges, cancelled the judgment and ordered a new trial. The court declared the appeal process must be redone because the sentences were deemed "illogical, incoherent, not assessing proofs and evidence in good terms, not taking into account the facts preceding and following the event, unmotivated or poorly motivated, in some parts the judges supporting unlikely arguments that not even the defense had argued".

* 11 October 1993: The new appeal trial begins. 
**Accused of murder: Massimiliano Fachini, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro and Sergio Picciafuoco.
**Accused of forming an armed gang: Gilberto Cavallini, Massimiliano Fachini, Egidio Giuliani, Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro, Sergio Picciafuoco and Roberto Rinani.
**Accused of defamation to ensure impunity for the massacre's perpetrators: Giuseppe Belmonte, Licio Gelli, Pietro Musumeci, and Francesco Pazienza.
* 16 May 1994: Judgment:
**Life imprisonment for the crime of murder: Valerio Fioravanti, Francesca Mambro and Sergio Picciafuoco. Acquitted: Massimiliano Fachini.
**Convicted of forming an armed gang: Gilberto Cavallini, Valerio Fioravanti, Egidio Giuliani, Francesca Mambro and Sergio Picciafuoco. Acquitted: Massimiliano Fachini and Roberto Rinani.
**Convicted of defamation to ensure impunity for the massacre's perpetrators: Giuseppe Belmonte, Licio Gelli, Pietro Musumeci, and Francesco Pazienza.
* 23 November 1995: The Supreme Court confirms the sentence, ordering a new trial for Picciafuoco. Confirmation of [[life imprisonment]] for Fioravanti and Mambro, members of the NAR (who have always maintained their innocence) for executing the attack. Sentence for investigation diversion to [[Licio Gelli|Gelli]] (headmaster of P2), Pazienza and SISMI officers Musumeci and Belmonte.
* 18 June 1996: The Appeals Court in [[Florence]] acquits Picciafuoco.
* 15 April 1997: The Supreme Court confirms the sentence.

In April 1998, Mambro was given a form of home-detention in which she was allowed to leave prison leave during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Hanley]], "Bologna bomber slips back into society", ''[[The Independent]]'', 16 April 1998 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980416/ai_n14160385/pg_1 on-line] {{en icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000, [[Massimo Carminati]] (NAR member), Ivano Bongiovanni (far-right sympathiser) and Federigo Manucci Benincasa ([[SISMI]] officer) were convicted for obstruction. Carminati and Manucci Benincasa were acquitted for lack of evidence in December 2001, while the use of Bongiovanni was declared unreliable (the conviction becomes final).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2001/12/22/bologna-due-assoluzioni-in-appello-per-la.html | title = Bologna, due assoluzioni in appello Per la strage non ci fu depistaggio | publisher = la Repubblica | date = 22 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2003, the Court of Cassation finally acquitted Carminati and Manucci Benincasa.

==Alternative hypotheses==
[[File:Strage di bologna funerali 2.jpg|thumb|right|Funerals of the victims.]]
As a result of the protracted legal procedures and numerous false leads, a number of theories took hold over the years following the attack:

* A theory suggests that officials in the Italian Secret Service were involved, along with members of the secret organization known as the [[Propaganda Due|P2]].&lt;ref name=Latto&gt;[http://www.iitaly.org/15203/massacre-bologna-30-years-later Latto, Maria Rita. "The Massacre of Bologna... 30 Years Later", ''i-Italy'', 2 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 1994 edition of the right-wing weekly ''[[L'Italia settimanale|L'Italia Settimanale]]'', a piece entitled "History of the First Republic" linked the Bologna attack with the [[Ustica massacre]] and compared it to the cases of [[Enrico Mattei]] and [[Aldo Moro]]. Without disputing the court rulings that have recognized the perpetrators, the text was intended to identify the masterminds. The text reads:

{{quote|Italy since the birth of the First Republic was, as everyone knows, a country with limited sovereignty (...) now, when, for immediate issues ( ...) has – rarely – made choices that have been found contrary to the covenants to which I said, it made, as said in a [[mafia]]-political-diplomatic terms, a ''sgarro'', a "bad mistake". And like in the mafia when a kid is wrong he ends up in some concrete pillar or is deprived of a relative (commonly called "cross-revenge"), so it is among states: When any country is wrong, one does not declare war, but it sends a "warning", as a bomb exploding in a square, on a train, a ship, etc. etc.|sign=|source=}}

* Between 1999 and 2006, during sessions of the parliamentary commission established to probe terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify those responsible for the massacre ([[Legislature XIII of Italy|XIII legislature]], 1996–2001), as well as those of a commission investigating the ''Mitrokhin dossier'' and the activity of Italian intelligence ([[Legislature XIV of Italy|XIV legislature]], 2001–2006), new elements emerged on international terrorist networks and the Italian secret services of the former Soviet bloc and major Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen and Iraq. With this information, it was possible to pick up the threads of a plot hidden for 25 years and to discover secret agreements with the Palestinian leadership (known as ''lodo Moro'') tied to arms trafficking between the PFLP and Italy – the threats to the Italian government for the seizure of missiles and the arrest of the PFLP leader in Italy, Abu Saleh Anzeh, in [[Ortona]] – the ties of the terrorist Abu Saleh Anzeh with the internationalist [[Ilich Ramirez Sanchez]], alias ''Carlos'' – the warning of the Italian antiterrorist secret service three weeks before the massacre, – the failure of the Italian intelligence operations to avoid retaliatory action – the arrival in Italy on 1 August 1980 of Thomas Kram, of a German terrorist group linked to Carlos and the Palestinians, and present in Bologna on the day of the massacre. Faced with this evidence, on 17 November 2005 the Bologna prosecutor opened a case against unknown persons (Dossier 7823/2005 RG).&lt;ref&gt;[http://segretidistato.liberoreporter.eu/index.php/home/libreria/libreria/62-dossier-strage-di-bologna-la-pista-segreta.html Dossier].&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to media reports in 2004, taken up again in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=214956 "Il giallo della strage di Bologna. Ecco le prove della pista araba"], ''[[il Giornale]]'', 22 October 2007 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesco Cossiga]], in a letter addressed to [[Enzo Fragalà]], leader of the [[Alleanza Nazionale|AN]] section in the [[Mitrokhin Commission|Mitrokhin Committee]], suggests a Palestinian involvement (at the hands of [[George Habash]]'s [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] - or by [[Salah Khalaf]] according judge Rosario Priore - and the [[Separat]] group of [[Ilich Ramirez Sanchez]], known as "Carlos the Jackal") behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capperi.net/stragebo.html "Strage Bologna: Cossiga, forse atto del terrorismo arabo"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807121524/http://www.capperi.net/stragebo.html |date=7 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 2008 former President [[Francesco Cossiga]] gave an interview to ''[[BBC]]'' in which it reaffirmed its belief that the massacre would not be attributable to black terrorism, but to an "incident" of Palestinian resistance groups operating in Italy. He declares also being convinced of the innocence of Francesca Mambro and [[Giuseppe Valerio Fioravanti]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_luglio_08/cossiga_cazzullo_f6395d90-4cb1-11dd-b408-00144f02aabc.shtml "La strage di Bologna, fu un incidente della resistenza palestinese"], ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 8 July 2008 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017478856&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter "Our World: The convenient war against the Jews"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512065926/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017478856&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |date=12 May 2011 }}, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The PFLP has always denied responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pflp.ps/english/?q=former-italian-prime-minister-fabricates-lies-agai], ''[[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, from his cell in [[Paris]], the [[State of Palestine|pro-Palestinian]] terrorist  [[Ilich Ramirez Sanchez]] ''Carlos'' stated that "the [[Mitrokhin Committee]] attempts to falsify history" and that "they were the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[Mossad]] to hit in Bologna", with the intent to warn and punish Italy for its relations of mutual trust with the [[PLO]], who had secretly pledged not to hit Italy in exchange for some protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2005/11_Novembre/23/biondani.shtml "A Bologna a colpire furono Cia e Mossad. Carlos: utilizzati giovani neofascisti, però per me Mambro e Fioravanti sono innocenti"], ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', 23 November 2005 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following the 2006 arrest of former Argentine [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A]] member [[Rodolfo Almirón]], Spanish lawyer José Angel Pérez Nievas declared that it was "probable that Almirón participated — along with Stefano Delle Chiaie and [[Augusto Cauchi]] — in the 1980 bombing in Bologna's train station." But the [[Argentine Supreme Court]] refused in 1998 to extradite Cauchi to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/vernota.php?tipo=N&amp;idPub=48460&amp;id=123482&amp;dis=1&amp;sec=1 "Denuncian que Almirón también participó en la ultraderecha española"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195642/http://www.telam.com.ar/vernota.php?tipo=N&amp;idPub=48460&amp;id=123482&amp;dis=1&amp;sec=1 |date=27 September 2007 }}, ''[[Telam]]'' Argentine news agency, 6 January 2007 {{es icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2007, the son of [[Massimo Sparti]] (thug linked to the [[Banda della Magliana]] and the main accuser of Fioravanti) declares, "my father in the history of the Bologna process has always lied"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Attualita%20ed%20Esteri/Attualita/2007/05/strage-bologna.shtml  "Strage di Bologna. Parla il figlio di Sparti, testimone chiave dell'accusa: «Mio padre ha sempre mentito»"], ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', 24 May 2007 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 19 August 2011 the prosecutor of Bologna placed under investigation two German terrorists, [[Thomas Kram]] and [[Christa Margot Fröhlich]], both linked to the group of terrorist Carlos, who would be present in Bologna on the day of the attack, thus following the trail of Palestinian terrorism, never accepted by the president of the family victims Paolo Bolognesi and instead repeatedly revived by Francesco Cossiga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2011/08/19/news/svolta_sulla_strage_del_due_agosto_indagati_due_terroristi_tedeschi-20611896/ "Svolta sulla strage del Due Agosto Indagati due terroristi tedeschi"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', 19 August 2011 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Bologna massacre memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Plaque at the Bologna Central Station]]
The municipality of Bologna together with the ''Associazione tra i familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980'' hold an annual international composition competition, which culminates with a concert in the town's main square, ''[[Piazza Maggiore]],'' annually on 2 August, which is also the day designated as a national memorial day for all terrorist massacres.

The area of the station where the bomb detonated has been reconstructed but, as a memorial of the attack, the original floor tile pierced by the detonation has been left in place and a deep crack closed by a glass panel has been made in the reconstructed main wall. Strangely, many people have believed the station clock had been stopped since the explosion, even though it hadn't.  In 1996, the station clock was stopped at 10:25, the time of the explosion, as a further memorial.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alternatememories.com/historical-events/27-general/184-the-stopped-clock-of-bologna&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victims' association ===
Relatives of the victims formed an association (''Associazione dei familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980'') to raise and maintain civil awareness about the case.

The victims' association (''Associazione tra i familiari delle vittime della strage alla stazione di Bologna del 2 agosto 1980'') was formed on 1 June 1981 in order to "get due justice with possible initiatives", made up initially of 44 people; the number of members later grew to 300 elements.

The association in the years following the massacre remained active, both for the memory of the massacre and to propose initiatives that were added to the investigation. Quarterly, its components are used to go to the [[court]], in order to meet [[Italian Judiciary|prosecutors]] and, out of the meeting, even launching a [[news conference]] for information on the state of things.

On 6 April 1983, the Association, together with the associations of victims of the massacres of [[Piazza Fontana bombing|Piazza Fontana]], [[Piazza della Loggia bombing|Piazza della Loggia]] and [[Italicus Express bombing 1974|Italicus train]], formed, based in [[Milan]], the Union of Relatives of Victims to Massacres (''Unione dei Familiari delle Vittime per Stragi'').&lt;ref&gt;The Association was responsible, together with other associations of victims of massacres the publication of the book entitled ''Il terrorismo e le sue maschere'' published by Pendragon in Bologna&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The bombing occupies a chapter in ''{{Interlanguage link|The Seventh Function of Language|fr|La Septième Fonction du langage}}'' by [[Laurent Binet]]. The 2017 French novel is a satire of the late-20th-century intellectual and political life of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/12/the-7th-function-of-language-by-laurent-binet-review|title=The 7th Function of Language by Laurent Binet review – who killed Roland Barthes?|last=Elkin|first=Lauren|date=2017-05-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and involves two detectives investigating what they assume to be the murder of the philosopher [[Roland Barthes]]. The detectives have traveled to Bologna to interview [[Umberto Eco]], and narrowly escape being injured in the attack.

| System || 1.1 || Deploy an automated asset inventory discovery tool and use it to build a preliminary inventory of systems connected to an organization’s public and private network(s). Both active tools that scan through IPv4 or IPv6 network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic should be employed.
|-
| System || 1.2 || If the organization is dynamically assigning addresses using DHCP, then deploy dynamic host configuration protocol&amp;nbsp;(DHCP) server logging, and use this information to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems.
|-
| System || 1.3 || Ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network.
|-
| System || 1.4 || Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device. The inventory should include every system that has an Internet protocol (IP) address on the network, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), printers, storage area networks, Voice Over-IP telephones, multi-homed addresses, virtual addresses, etc.  The asset inventory created must also include data on whether the device is a portable and/or personal device. Devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data must be identified, regardless of whether they are attached to the organization’s network.
|-
| System || 1.5 || Deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network.  The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.

| System || 2.2 || Deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system. The whitelist may be very extensive (as is available from commercial whitelist vendors), so that users are not inconvenienced when using common software. Or, for some special-purpose systems (which require only a small number of programs to achieve their needed business functionality), the whitelist may be quite narrow.
|-
| System || 2.3 || Deploy software inventory tools throughout the organization covering each of the operating system types in use, including servers, workstations, and laptops. The software inventory system should track the version of the underlying operating system as well as the applications installed on it. The software inventory systems must be tied into the hardware asset inventory so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location.
|-
| System || 2.4 || Virtual machines and/or air-gapped systems should be used to isolate and run applications that are required for business operations but based on higher risk should not be installed within a networked environment.

|-
| System || 3.1 || Establish standard secure configurations of your operating systems and software applications. Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. These images should be validated and refreshed on a regular basis to update their security configuration in light of recent vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
|-
| System || 3.2 || Follow strict configuration management, building a secure image that is used to build all new systems that are deployed in the enterprise.  Any existing system that becomes compromised should be re-imaged with the secure build. Regular updates or exceptions to this image should be integrated into the organization’s change management processes.  Images should be created for workstations, servers, and other system types used by the organization.
|-
| System || 3.3 || Store the master images on securely configured servers, validated with integrity checking tools capable of continuous inspection, and change management to ensure that only authorized changes to the images are possible. Alternatively, these master images can be stored in offline machines, air-gapped from the production network, with images copied via secure media to move them between the image storage servers and the production network.
|-
| System || 3.4 || Perform all remote administration of servers, workstation, network devices, and similar equipment over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC.
|-
| System || 3.5 || Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).
|-
| System || 3.6 || Implement and test an automated configuration monitoring system that verifies all remotely testable secure configuration elements, and alerts when unauthorized changes occur. This includes detecting new listening ports, new administrative users, changes to group and local policy objects (where applicable), and new services running on a system. Whenever possible use tools compliant with the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to streamline reporting and integration.
|-
| System || 3.7 || Deploy system configuration management tools, such as Active Directory Group Policy Objects for Microsoft Windows systems or Puppet for UNIX systems that will automatically enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems at regularly scheduled intervals. They should be capable of triggering redeployment of configuration settings on a scheduled, manual, or event-driven basis.

|-
| System || 4.1 || Run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk.  Use a SCAP-validated vulnerability scanner that looks for both code-based vulnerabilities (such as those described by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entries) and configuration-based vulnerabilities (as enumerated by the Common Configuration Enumeration Project).
|-
| System || 4.2 || Correlate event logs with information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools  is itself logged. Second, personnel should be able to correlate attack detection events with prior vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a target known to be vulnerable.
|-
| System || 4.3 || Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. Use a dedicated account for authenticated vulnerability scans, which should not be used for any other administrative activities and should be tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses.  Ensure that only authorized employees have access to the vulnerability management user interface and that roles are applied to each user.
|-
| System || 4.4 || Subscribe to vulnerability intelligence services in order to stay aware of emerging exposures, and use the information gained from this subscription to update the organization’s vulnerability scanning activities on at least a monthly basis.  Alternatively, ensure that the vulnerability scanning tools you use are regularly updated with all relevant important security vulnerabilities.
|-
| System || 4.5 || Deploy automated patch management tools and software update tools for operating system and software/applications on all systems for which such tools are available and safe.  Patches should be applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped.
|-
| System || 4.6 || Monitor logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure that this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans.  
|-
| System || 4.7 || Compare the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk.
|-
| System || 4.8 || Establish a process to risk-rate vulnerabilities based on the exploitability and potential impact of the vulnerability, and segmented by appropriate groups of assets (example, DMZ servers, internal network servers, desktops, laptops).  Apply patches for the riskiest vulnerabilities first.  A phased rollout can be used to minimize the impact to the organization. Establish expected patching timelines based on the risk rating level.

|-
| System || 5.1 || Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required.  Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior.
|-
| System || 5.2 || Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.
|-
| System || 5.3 || Before deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.
|-
| System || 5.4 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators’ group, or when a new local administrator account is added on a system.
|-
| System || 5.5 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert on any unsuccessful login to an administrative account.
|-
| System || 5.6 || Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access.  Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, biometrics, or other similar authentication methods.
|-
| System || 5.7 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters). 
|-
| System || 5.8 || Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems.
|-
| System || 5.9 || Administrators shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.

|-
| System || 6.1 || Include at least two synchronized time sources from which all servers and network equipment retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent.
|-
| System || 6.2 || Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.
|-
| System || 6.3 || Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals.  The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.
|-
| System || 6.4 || Have security personnel and/or system administrators run biweekly reports that identify anomalies in logs. They should then actively review the anomalies, documenting their findings.
|-
| System || 6.5 || Configure network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device.
|-
| System || 6.6 || Deploy a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or log analytic tools for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple machines and for log correlation and analysis.  Using the SIEM tool, system administrators and security personnel should devise profiles of common events from given systems so that they can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analysts with insignificant alerts.

|-
| System || 7.1 || Ensure that only fully supported web browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the organization, ideally only using the latest version of the browsers provided by the vendor in order to take advantage of the latest security functions and fixes.
|-
| System || 7.2 || Uninstall or disable any unnecessary or unauthorized browser or email client plugins or add-on applications. Each plugin shall utilize application / URL whitelisting and only allow the use of the application for pre-approved domains.
|-
| System || 7.3 || Limit the use of unnecessary scripting languages in all web browsers and email clients. This includes the use of languages such as ActiveX and JavaScript on systems where it is unnecessary to support such capabilities.
|-
| System || 7.4 || Log all URL requests from each of the organization's systems, whether onsite or a mobile device, in order to identify potentially malicious activity and assist incident handlers with identifying potentially compromised systems.
|-
| System || 7.5 || Deploy two separate browser configurations to each system. One configuration should disable the use of all plugins, unnecessary scripting languages, and generally be configured with limited functionality and be used for general web browsing. The other configuration shall allow for more browser functionality but should only be used to access specific websites that require the use of such functionality.
|-
| System || 7.6 || The organization shall maintain and enforce network based URL filters that limit a system's ability to connect to websites not approved by the organization. The organization shall subscribe to URL categorization services to ensure that they are up-to-date with the most recent website category definitions available. Uncategorized sites shall be blocked by default. This filtering shall be enforced for each of the organization's systems, whether they are physically at an organization's facilities or not.
|-
| System || 7.7 || To lower the chance of spoofed e-mail messages, implement the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) by deploying SPF records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers.
|-
| System || 7.8 || Scan and block all e-mail attachments entering the organization's e-mail gateway if they contain malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for the organization's business. This scanning should be done before the e-mail is placed in the user's inbox. This includes e-mail content filtering and web content filtering.

|-
| System || 8.1 || Employ automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers.
|-
| System || 8.2 || Employ anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or have administrators manually push updates to all machines. After applying an update, automated systems should verify that each system has received its signature update.
|-
| System || 8.3 || Limit use of external devices to those with an approved, documented business need. Monitor for use and attempted use of external devices. Configure laptops, workstations, and servers so that they will not auto-run content from removable media, like USB tokens (i.e., “thumb drives”), USB hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, external serial advanced technology attachment devices, and mounted network shares. Configure systems so that they automatically conduct an anti-malware scan of removable media when inserted.
|-
| System || 8.4 || Enable anti-exploitation features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), virtualization/containerization, etc. For increased protection, deploy capabilities such as Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) that can be configured to apply these protections to a broader set of applications and executables.
|-
| System || 8.5 || Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.
|-
| System || 8.6 || Enable domain name system (DNS) query logging to detect hostname lookup for known malicious C2 domains.

|-
| System || 9.1 || Ensure that only ports, protocols, and services with validated business needs are running on each system.
|-
| System || 9.2 || Apply host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed.
|-
| System || 9.3 || Perform automated port scans on a regular basis against all key servers and compared to a known effective baseline.  If a change that is not listed on the organization’s approved baseline is discovered, an alert should be generated and reviewed.
|-
| System || 9.4 || Verify any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network, and if it is not required for business purposes, move it to an internal VLAN and give it a private address.
|-
| System || 9.5 || Operate critical services on separate physical or logical host machines, such as DNS, file, mail, web, and database servers.
|-
| System || 9.6 || Place application firewalls in front of any critical servers to verify and validate the traffic going to the server.  Any unauthorized services or traffic should be blocked and an alert generated.

|-
| System || 10.1 || Ensure that each system is automatically backed up on at least a weekly basis, and more often for systems storing sensitive information. To help ensure the ability to rapidly restore a system from backup, the operating system, application software, and data on a machine should each be included in the overall backup procedure. These three components of a system do not have to be included in the same backup file or use the same backup software. There should be multiple backups over time, so that in the event of malware infection, restoration can be from a version that is believed to predate the original infection. All backup policies should be compliant with any regulatory or official requirements.
|-
| System || 10.2 || Test data on backup media on a regular basis by performing a data restoration process to ensure that the backup is properly working.
|-
| System || 10.3 || Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network.  This includes remote backups and cloud services.
|-
| System || 10.4 || Ensure that key systems have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls.  This will mitigate the risk of attacks like CryptoLocker which seek to encrypt or damage data on all addressable data shares, including backup destinations.
|- id="CSC11"

|-
| Network || 11.1 || Compare firewall, router, and switch configuration against standard secure configurations defined for each type of network device in use in the organization. The security configuration of such devices should be documented, reviewed, and approved by an organization change control board. Any deviations from the standard configuration or updates to the standard configuration should be documented and approved in a change control system.
|-
| Network || 11.2 || All new configuration rules beyond a baseline-hardened configuration that allow traffic to flow through network security devices, such as firewalls and network-based IPS, should be documented and recorded in a configuration management system, with a specific business reason for each change, a specific individual’s name responsible for that business need, and an expected duration of the need.
|-
| Network || 11.3 || Use automated tools to verify standard device configurations and detect changes. All alterations to such files should be logged and automatically reported to security personnel.
|-
| Network || 11.4 || Manage network devices using two-factor authentication and encrypted sessions.
|-
| Network || 11.5 || Install the latest stable version of any security-related updates on all network devices.
|-
| Network || 11.6 || Network engineers shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 11.7 || Manage the network infrastructure across network connections that are separated from the business use of that network, relying on separate VLANs or, preferably, on entirely different physical connectivity for management sessions for network devices.

|-
| Network || 12.1 || Deny communications with (or limit data flow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites (whitelists). Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters. Lists of bogon addresses are publicly available on the Internet from various sources, and indicate a series of IP addresses that should not be used for legitimate traffic traversing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 12.2 || On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built into the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border.  This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.
|-
| Network || 12.3 || Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.
|-
| Network || 12.4 || Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signatures or the behavior of potential attacks.  As attacks become automated, methods such as IDS typically delay the amount of time it takes for someone to react to an attack.  A properly configured network-based IPS can provide automation to block bad traffic. When evaluating network-based IPS products, include those using techniques other than signature-based detection (such as virtual machine or sandbox-based approaches) for consideration.
|-
| Network || 12.5 || Design and implement network perimeters so that all outgoing network traffic to the Internet must pass through at least one application layer filtering proxy server. The proxy should support decrypting network traffic, logging individual TCP sessions, blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a black list, and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites.  Organizations should force outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.
|-
| Network || 12.6 || Require all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems) to use two-factor authentication.
|-
| Network || 12.7 || All enterprise devices remotely logging into the internal network should be managed by the enterprise, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels. For third-party devices (e.g., subcontractors/vendors), publish minimum security standards for access to the enterprise network and perform a security scan before allowing access.
|-
| Network || 12.8 || Periodically scan for back-channel connections to the Internet that bypass the DMZ, including unauthorized VPN connections and dual-homed hosts connected to the enterprise network and to other networks via wireless, dial-up modems, or other mechanisms.  
|-
| Network || 12.9 || Deploy NetFlow collection and analysis to DMZ network flows to detect anomalous activity.
|-
| Network || 12.10 || To help identify covert channels exfiltrating data through a firewall, configure the built-in firewall session tracking mechanisms included in many commercial firewalls to identify TCP sessions that last an unusually long time for the given organization and firewall device, alerting personnel about the source and destination addresses associated with these long sessions.

|-
| Network || 13.1 || Perform an assessment of data to identify sensitive information that requires the application of encryption and integrity controls
|-
| Network || 13.2 || Deploy approved hard drive encryption software to mobile devices and systems that hold sensitive data.
|-
| Network || 13.3 || Deploy an automated tool on network perimeters that monitors for sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information), keywords, and other document characteristics to discover unauthorized attempts to exfiltrate data across network boundaries and block such transfers while alerting information security personnel. 
|-
| Network || 13.4 || Conduct periodic scans of server machines using automated tools to determine whether sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information, health, credit card, or classified information) is present on the system in clear text. These tools, which search for patterns that indicate the presence of sensitive information, can help identify if a business or technical process is leaving behind or otherwise leaking sensitive information.
|-
| Network || 13.5 || If there is no business need for supporting such devices, configure systems so that they will not write data to USB tokens or USB hard drives. If such devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow only specific USB devices (based on serial number or other unique property) to be accessed, and that can automatically encrypt all data placed on such devices. An inventory of all authorized devices must be maintained.
|-
| Network || 13.6 || Use network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network. Any anomalies that exceed the normal traffic patterns should be noted and appropriate action taken to address them.
|-
| Network || 13.7 || Monitor all traffic leaving the organization and detect any unauthorized use of encryption. Attackers often use an encrypted channel to bypass network security devices. Therefore, it is essential that organizations be able to detect rogue connections, terminate the connection, and remediate the infected system.
|-
| Network || 13.8 || Block access to known file transfer and e-mail exfiltration websites.
|-
| Network || 13.9 || Use host-based data loss prevention (DLP) to enforce ACLs even when data is copied off a server.  In most organizations, access to the data is controlled by ACLs that are implemented on the server.  Once the data have been copied to a desktop system, the ACLs are no longer enforced and the users can send the data to whomever they want.

| Application || 14.2 || All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted. Whenever information flows over a network with a lower trust level, the information should be encrypted.
|-
| Application || 14.3 || All network switches will enable Private Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) for segmented workstation networks to limit the ability of devices on a network to directly communicate with other devices on the subnet and limit an attackers ability to laterally move to compromise neighboring systems.
|-

These controls will enforce the principal that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.
|-
| Application || 14.5 || Sensitive information stored on systems shall be encrypted at rest and require a secondary authentication mechanism, not integrated into the operating system, in order to access the information.

|-
| Network || 15.1 || Ensure that each wireless device connected to the network matches an authorized configuration and security profile, with a documented owner of the connection and a defined business need. Organizations should deny access to those wireless devices that do not have such a configuration and profile.
|-
| Network || 15.2 || Configure network vulnerability scanning tools to detect wireless access points connected to the wired network. Identified devices should be reconciled against a list of authorized wireless access points. Unauthorized (i.e., rogue) access points should be deactivated.
|-
| Network || 15.3 || Use wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) to identify rogue wireless devices and detect attack attempts and successful compromises. In addition to WIDS, all wireless traffic should be monitored by WIDS as traffic passes into the wired network.
|-
| Network || 15.4 || Where a specific business need for wireless access has been identified, configure wireless access on client machines to allow access only to authorized wireless networks. For devices that do not have an essential wireless business purpose, disable wireless access in the hardware configuration (basic input/output system or extensible firmware interface).
|-
| Network || 15.5 || Ensure that all wireless traffic leverages at least Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption used with at least Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protection.
|-
| Network || 15.6 || Ensure that wireless networks use authentication protocols such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP/TLS), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.

Disable such accounts if not needed, or document and monitor exceptions (e.g., vendor maintenance accounts needed for system recovery or continuity operations). Require that managers match active employees and contractors with each account belonging to their managed staff. Security or system administrators should then disable accounts that are not assigned to valid workforce members.
|-
| Application || 16.7 || Use and configure account lockouts such that after a set number of failed login attempts the account is locked for a standard period of time.
|-
| Application || 16.8 || Monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging.
|-
| Application || 16.9 || Configure access for all accounts through a centralized point of authentication, for example Active Directory or LDAP.  Configure network and security devices for centralized authentication as well.
|-
| Application || 16.10 || Profile each user’s typical account usage by determining normal time-of-day access and access duration. Reports should be generated that indicate users who have logged in during unusual hours or have exceeded their normal login duration. This includes flagging the use of the user’s credentials from a computer other than computers on which the user generally works.

|-
| Application || 17.1 || Perform gap analysis to see which skills employees need and which behaviors employees are not adhering to, using this information to build a baseline training and awareness roadmap for all employees.&amp;nbsp;
|-
| Application || 17.2 || Deliver training to fill the skills gap. If possible, use more senior staff to deliver the training. A second option is to have outside teachers provide training onsite so the examples used will be directly relevant. If you have small numbers of people to train, use training conferences or online training to fill the gaps.
|-
| Application || 17.3 || Implement an security awareness program that (1) focuses only on the methods commonly used in intrusions that can be blocked through individual action, (2) is delivered in short online modules convenient for employees (3) is updated frequently (at least annually) to represent the latest attack techniques, (4) is mandated for completion by all employees at least annually, and (5) is reliably monitored for employee completion.
|-
| Application || 17.4 || Validate and improve awareness levels through periodic tests to see whether employees will click on a link from suspicious e-mail or provide sensitive information on the telephone without following appropriate procedures for authenticating a caller; targeted training should be provided to those who fall victim to the exercise.
|-
| Application || 17.5 || Use security skills assessments for each of the mission-critical roles to identify skills gaps. Use hands-on, real-world examples to measure mastery. If you do not have such assessments, use one of the available online competitions that simulate real-world scenarios for each of the identified jobs in order to measure skills mastery.

|-
| Application || 18.1 || For all acquired application software, check that the version you are using is still supported by the vendor. If not, update to the most current version and install all relevant patches and vendor security recommendations.
|-
| Application || 18.2 || Protect web applications by deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) that inspect all traffic flowing to the web application for common web application attacks, including but not limited to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, command injection, and directory traversal attacks. For applications that are not web-based, specific application firewalls should be deployed if such tools are available for the given application type.  If the traffic is encrypted, the device should either sit behind the encryption or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior to analysis.  If neither option is appropriate, a host-based web application firewall should be deployed.
|-
| Application || 18.3 || For in-house developed software, ensure that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. 
|-
| Application || 18.4 || Test in-house-developed and third-party-procured web applications for common security weaknesses using automated remote web application scanners prior to deployment, whenever updates are made to the application, and on a regular recurring basis. In particular, input validation and output encoding routines of application software should be reviewed and tested.
|-
| Application || 18.5 || Do not display system error messages to end-users (output sanitization).
|-
| Application || 18.6 || Maintain separate environments for production and nonproduction systems. Developers should not typically have unmonitored access to production environments.
|-
| Application || 18.7 || For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening configuration templates. All systems that are part of critical business processes should also be tested.
|-
| Application || 18.8 || Ensure that all software development personnel receive training in writing secure code for their specific development environment.
|-
| Application || 18.9 || For in-house developed applications, ensure that development artifacts (sample data and scripts; unused libraries, components, debug code; or tools) are not included in the deployed software, or accessible in the production environment.

|-
| Application || 19.1 || Ensure that there are written incident response procedures that include a definition of personnel roles for handling incidents. The procedures should define the phases of incident handling.
|-
| Application || 19.2 || Assign job titles and duties for handling computer and network incidents to specific individuals.
|-
| Application || 19.3 || Define management personnel who will support the incident handling process by acting in key decision-making roles.
|-
| Application || 19.4 || Devise organization-wide standards for the time required for system administrators and other personnel to report anomalous events to the incident handling team, the mechanisms for such reporting, and the kind of information that should be included in the incident notification. This reporting should also include notifying the appropriate Community Emergency Response Team in accordance with all legal or regulatory requirements for involving that organization in computer incidents.
|-
| Application || 19.5 || Assemble and maintain information on third-party contact information to be used to report a security incident (e.g., maintain an e-mail address of security@organization.com or have a web page http://organization.com/security).
|-
| Application || 19.6 || Publish information for all personnel, including employees and contractors, regarding reporting computer anomalies and incidents to the incident handling team. Such information should be included in routine employee awareness activities.
|-
| Application || 19.7 || Conduct periodic incident scenario sessions for personnel associated with the incident handling team to ensure that they understand current threats and risks, as well as their responsibilities in supporting the incident handling team.

|-
| Application || 20.1 || Conduct regular external and internal penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and attack vectors that can be used to exploit enterprise systems successfully. Penetration testing should occur from outside the network perimeter (i.e., the Internet or wireless frequencies around an organization) as well as from within its boundaries (i.e., on the internal network) to simulate both outsider and insider attacks.
|-
| Application || 20.2 || Any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing should be controlled and monitored to make sure they are only being used for legitimate purposes, and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over.
|-
| Application || 20.3 || Perform periodic Red Team exercises to test organizational readiness to identify and stop attacks or to respond quickly and effectively.
|-
| Application || 20.4 || Include tests for the presence of unprotected system information and artifacts that would be useful to attackers, including network diagrams, configuration files, older penetration test reports, e-mails or documents containing passwords or other information critical to system operation.
|-
| Application || 20.5 || Plan clear goals of the penetration test itself with blended attacks in mind, identifying the goal machine or target asset.  Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors&amp;mdash;often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation.  Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets.
|-
| Application || 20.6 || Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert.  The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts.
|-
| Application || 20.7 || Wherever possible, ensure that Red Teams results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP).  Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time.
|-
| Application || 20.8 || Create a test bed that mimics a production environment for specific penetration tests and Red Team attacks against elements that are not typically tested in production, such as attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition and other control systems.

[[File:Mauritius (+claim islands).svg|thumb|Islands of the Republic of Mauritius labelled in black]]'''[[Sovereignty]] over the [[Chagos Archipelago]]''' is disputed between [[Mauritius]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Mauritius has repeatedly asserted that the Chagos Archipelago is part of its territory and that the United Kingdom (UK) claim is a violation of [[United Nations]] resolutions banning the dismemberment of colonial territories before independence. The UK government has stated that it has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Chagos, and has also said that the Chagos will be returned to Mauritius once the islands are no longer required for defence purposes. Given the absence of any progress with the UK, Mauritius has decided to "internationalise" the dispute and take up the matter at all appropriate legal and political forums.

The [[African Union]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] have expressed unanimous support for Mauritius on the Chagos issue.&lt;ref name="real"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearworld.com/articles/2012/04/06/mauritius_chagos_archipelago_diego_garcia_99999.html|title=Time for UK to Leave Chagos Archipelago|publisher=Real clear world|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] states that the [[Outer islands of Mauritius]] includes the islands of [[Mauritius]], [[Rodrigues]], [[Agaléga]], [[Cargados Carajos]] and the [[Chagos Archipelago]], including [[Diego Garcia]] and any other island comprised in the State of Mauritius. The Government of the Republic of Mauritius has stated that it does not recognise the ''[[British Indian Ocean Territory]]'' which the United Kingdom created by excising the Chagos Archipelago from the territory of Mauritius prior to its independence, and claims that the Chagos Archipelago including Diego Garcia forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius under both Mauritian law and international law.&lt;ref name="defi1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defimedia.info/news-sunday/nos-parliament/item/13899-chagos-remains-a-matter-for-discussion.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1|title=Chagos remains a matter for discussion|publisher=Le Defimedia|accessdate=22 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427032857/http://www.defimedia.info/news-sunday/nos-parliament/item/13899-chagos-remains-a-matter-for-discussion.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1965, the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago away from Mauritius, and the islands of [[Aldabra]], [[Farquhar Group|Farquhar]], and [[Desroches]] from the [[Seychelles]], to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965. However, with effect from 23 June 1976 Aldabra, Farquhar, and Desroches were returned to the Seychelles on their attaining independence.

On 18 March 2015, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] unanimously held that the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area|marine protected area]] (MPA) which the United Kingdom declared around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 was created in violation of international law. The [[Prime Minister of Mauritius]] has stated that this is the first time that the country's conduct with regard to the Chagos Archipelago has been considered and condemned by any international court or tribunal. He described the ruling as an important milestone in the relentless struggle, at the political, diplomatic, and other levels, of successive Governments over the years for the effective exercise by Mauritius of the sovereignty it claims over the Chagos Archipelago. The tribunal considered in detail the undertakings given by the United Kingdom to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. The UK had argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal firmly rejected that argument, holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius, and have bound the UK ever since. It found that the UK's commitments towards Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding.&lt;ref name="alla"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503231218.html | title=Mauritius: MPA Around Chagos Archipelago Violates International Law – This Is a Historic Ruling for Mauritius, Says PM | work=allafrica.com/ | accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

Beginning in the late 15th century, Portuguese explorers began to venture into the Indian Ocean and recorded the location of Mauritius and the other [[Mascarene Islands]], [[Rodrigues]] and [[Réunion]] (the latter presently a French overseas department). In the 16th century, the Portuguese were joined by Dutch and English sailors, both nations having established East India Companies to exploit the commercial opportunities of the Indian Ocean and the Far East. Although Mauritius was used as a stopping point in the long voyages to and from the Indian Ocean, no attempt was made to establish a permanent settlement.&lt;ref name="Ruling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lexpress.mu/sites/lexpress/files/attachments/article/2015/2015-03/2015-03-20/mu-uk_20150318_award.pdf | title=IN THE MATTER OF THE CHAGOS MARINE PROTECTED AREA ARBITRATION – before – AN ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED UNDER ANNEX VII OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA – between – THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS – and – THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND | publisher=[[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] | date=18 March 2015 | accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first permanent colony in Mauritius was established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1638. The Dutch maintained a small presence on Mauritius, with a brief interruption, until 1710 at which point the Dutch East India Company abandoned the island. Following the Dutch departure, the French government took possession of Mauritius in 1715, renaming it the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Ile de France]].&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The Chagos Archipelago was known during this period, appearing on Portuguese charts as early as 1538, but remained largely untouched. France progressively claimed and surveyed the Archipelago in the mid-18th century and granted concessions for the establishment of coconut plantations, leading to permanent settlement. Throughout this period, France administered the Chagos Archipelago as a dependency of the Ile de France.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

In 1810, the British captured the Ile de France and renamed it Mauritius. By the Treaty of Paris of 30 May 1814, France ceded the Ile de France and all its [[Outer islands of Mauritius|dependencies]] (including the Chagos Archipelago) to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

===The British Administration of Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago===

From the date of the cession by France until 8 November 1965, when the Chagos Archipelago was detached from the colony of Mauritius, the Archipelago was administered by the United Kingdom as a Dependency of Mauritius. During this period, the economy of the Chagos Archipelago was primarily driven by the coconut plantations and the export of copra (dried coconut flesh) for the production of oil, although other activities developed as the population of the Archipelago expanded. British administration over the Chagos Archipelago was exercised by various means, including by visits to the Chagos Archipelago made by Special Commissioners and Magistrates from Mauritius.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

Although the broad outlines of British Administration of the colony during this period are not in dispute, the Parties disagree as to the extent of economic activity in the Chagos Archipelago and its significance for Mauritius, and on the significance of the Archipelago’s status as a dependency. Mauritius contends that there were "close economic, cultural and social links between Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago" and that "the administration of the Chagos Archipelago as a constituent part of Mauritius continued without interruption throughout that period of British rule". The United Kingdom, in contrast, submits that the Chagos Archipelago was only "very loosely administered from Mauritius" and "in law and in fact quite distinct from the Island of Mauritius." The United Kingdom further contends that "the islands had no economic relevance to Mauritius, other than as a supplier of coconut oil" and that, in any event, economic, social and cultural ties between the Chagos Archipelago and Mauritius during this period are irrelevant to the Archipelago’s legal status.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

===The Independence of Mauritius===

Beginning in 1831, the administration of the [[Governor of British Mauritius|British Governor of Mauritius]] was supplemented by the introduction of a Council of Government, originally composed of ex-officio members and members nominated by the Governor. The composition of this Council was subsequently democratized through the progressive introduction of elected members. In 1947, the adoption of a new Constitution for Mauritius replaced the Council of Government with separate Legislative and Executive Councils. The Legislative Council was composed of the Governor as President, 19 elected members, 12 members nominated by the Governor and 3 ex-officio members.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The first election of the Legislative Council took place in 1948, and the [[Labour party (Mauritius)|Mauritius Labour Party]] (the "MLP") secured 12 of the 19 seats available for elected members.35 The MLP strengthened its position in the 1953 election by securing 14 of the available seats, although the MLP lacked an overall majority in the Legislative Council because of the presence of a number of members appointed by the Governor.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The 1953 election marked the beginning of Mauritius’ move towards independence. Following that election, Mauritian representatives began to press the British Government for [[universal suffrage]], a ministerial system of government and greater elected representation in the Legislative Council. By 1959, the MLP-led government had openly adopted the goal of complete independence.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

Constitutional Conferences were held in 1955, 1958, 1961, and 1965, resulting in a new constitution in 1958 and the creation of the post of Chief Minister in 1961 (renamed as the Premier after 1963). In 1962, Dr Seewoosagur Ramgoolam (later [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]]) became the Chief Minister within a Council of Ministers chaired by the [[Governor of British Mauritius|Governor]] and, following the 1963 election, formed an all-party coalition government to pursue negotiations with the British on independence.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The final Constitutional Conference was held in London in September 1965 and was principally concerned with the debate between those Mauritian political leaders favouring independence and those preferring some form of continued association with the United Kingdom. On 24 September 1965, the final day of the conference, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt. Hon. [[Anthony Greenwood]] MP, who was the minister in the United Kingdom Government with responsibility for Mauritius, announced that the United Kingdom Government intended that Mauritius would proceed to full independence.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

Mauritius became independent on 12 March 1968.

===The detachment of the Chagos Archipelago===
{{over-quotation|section|date=July 2017}}
In conjunction with the move toward Mauritian independence, the United Kingdom formulated a proposal to separate the Chagos Archipelago from the remainder of the colony of Mauritius, and to retain the Archipelago under British control. According to Mauritius, the proposal to separate the Chagos Archipelago stemmed from a decision by the United Kingdom in the early 1960s to "accommodate the United States’ desire to use certain islands in the Indian Ocean for defence purposes."&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The record before the Tribunal sets out a series of bilateral talks between the United Kingdom and the United States in 1964 at which the two States decided that, in order to execute the plans for a defence facility in the Chagos Archipelago, the United Kingdom would "provide the land, and security of tenure, by detaching islands and placing them under direct U.K. administration."&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The suitability of Diego Garcia as the site of the planned defence facility was determined following a joint survey of the Chagos Archipelago and certain islands of the Seychelles in 1964. Following the survey, the United States sent its proposals to the United Kingdom, identifying Diego Garcia as its first preference as the site for the defence facility. The United Kingdom and the United States conducted further negotiations between 1964 and 1965 regarding the desirability of "detachment of the entire Chagos Archipelago," as well as the islands of [[Aldabra]], [[Farquhar Atoll|Farquhar]] and [[Desroches]] (then part of the colony of the Seychelles). They further discussed the terms of compensation that would be required "to secure the acceptance of the proposals by the local Governments."&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

On 19 July 1965, the Governor of Mauritius was instructed to communicate the proposal to detach the Chagos Archipelago to the Mauritius Council of Ministers and to report back on the Council’s reaction. The initial reaction of the Mauritian Ministers, conveyed by the Governor’s report of 23 July 1965, was a request for more time to consider the proposal. The report also noted that Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam expressed "dislike of detachment". At the next meeting of the Council on 30 July 1965, the Mauritian Ministers indicated that detachment would be "unacceptable to public opinion in Mauritius" and proposed the alternative of a long term lease, coupled with safeguards for mineral rights and a preference for Mauritius if fishing or agricultural rights were ever granted. The Parties differ in their understanding of the strength of, and motivation for, the Mauritian reaction. In any event, on 13 August 1965, the Governor of Mauritius informed the Mauritian Ministers that the United States objected to the proposal of a lease.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

Discussions over the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago continued in a series of meetings between certain Mauritian political leaders, including Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Anthony Greenwood, coinciding with the Constitutional Conference of September 1965 in London. Over the course of three meetings, the Mauritian leaders pressed the United Kingdom with respect to the compensation offered for Mauritian agreement to the detachment of the Archipelago, noting the involvement of the United States in the establishment of the defence facility and Mauritius’ need for continuing economic support (for example through a higher quota for Mauritius sugar imports into the United States), rather than the lump sum compensation being proposed by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom took the firm position that obtaining concessions from the United States was not feasible; the United Kingdom did, however, increase the level of lump sum compensation on offer from £1 million to £3 million and introduced the prospect of a commitment that the Archipelago would be returned to Mauritius when no longer needed for defence purposes. The Mauritian leaders also met with the Economic Minister at the U.S. Embassy in London on the question of sugar quotas, and Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam met privately with Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] on the morning of 23 September 1965. The United Kingdom’s record of this conversation records Prime Minister Wilson having told Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam that&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|in theory, there were a number of possibilities. The Premier and his colleagues could return to Mauritius either with Independence or without it. On the Defence point, Diego Garcia could either be detached by order in Council or with the agreement of the Premier and his colleagues. The best solution of all might be Independence and detachment by agreement, although he could not of course commit the Colonial Secretary at this point.}}

The meetings culminated in the afternoon of 23 September 1965 (the "Lancaster House Meeting") in a provisional agreement on the part of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam and his colleagues to agree in principle to the detachment of the Archipelago in exchange for the Secretary of State recommending certain actions by the United Kingdom to the Cabinet. The draft record of the Lancaster House Meeting set out the following:&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|Summing up the discussion, the SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether he could inform his colleagues that Dr. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Mr. Bissoondoyal and Mr. Mohamed were prepared to agree to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago on the understanding that he would recommend to his colleagues the following:- 
* (i) negotiations for a defence agreement between Britain and Mauritius; 
* (ii) in the event of independence an understanding between the two governments that they would consult together in the event of a difficult internal security situation arising in Mauritius; 
* (iii) compensation totalling up to [illegible] Mauritius Government over and above direct compensation to landowners and the cost of resettling others affected in the Chagos Islands; 
* (iv) the British Government should use its good offices with the United States Government in support of Mauritius’ request for concessions over sugar imports and the supply of wheat and other commodities; 
* (v) that the British Government would do their best to persuade the American Government to use labour and materials from Mauritius for construction work in the islands; 
* (vi) that if the need for the facilities on the islands disappeared the islands should be returned to Mauritius. Seewoosagur Ramgoolam said that this was acceptable to him and Messrs. Bissoondoyal and Mohamed in principle but he expressed the wish to discuss it with his other ministerial colleagues.}}

Thereafter, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam addressed a handwritten note to the Under-Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, Mr Trafford Smith, setting out further conditions relating to navigational and meteorological facilities on the Archipelago, fishing rights, emergency landing facilities, and the benefit of mineral or oil discoveries. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam’s note provided as follows:&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|Dear Mr. Trafford Smith,
 
I and Mr Mohamed have gone through the enclosed paper on the question of Diego Garcia and another near island (i.e. two altogether) and we wish to point out the amendments that should be effected on page 4 of this document. The matters to be added formed part of the original requirements submitted to H.M.G. We think that these can be incorporated in any final agreement.
With kind regards, S. Ramgoolam P.S. The two copies handed over to me are herewith enclosed.}}

The third page to Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam’s note set out the following items:

{{quote|
* (vii) Navigational &amp; Meteorological facilities 
* (viii) Fishing rights
* (ix) Use of Air Strip for Emergency Landing and if required for development of the other islands
* (x) Any mineral or oil discovered on or near islands to revert to the Mauritius Government.}}

These additions were incorporated into paragraph 22 of the final record of the Lancaster House Meeting, which the Tribunal considers to warrant quotation in full:&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

RECORD OF A MEETING HELD IN LANCASTER HOUSE AT 2. 30 P.M. ON THURSDAY 23rd SEPTEMBER 

MAURITIUS DEFENCE MATTERS 

Present:- The Secretary of State (in the Chair) Lord Taylor Sir Hilton Poynton Sir John Rennie Mr. P. R. Noakes Mr. J. Stacpoole Sir S. Ramgoolam Mr. S. Bissoondoyal Mr. J. M. Paturau Mr. A. R. Mohamed

THE SECRETARY OF STATE expressed his apologies for the unavoidable postponements and delays which some delegations at the Constitutional Conference had met with earlier in the day. He explained that he was required to inform his colleagues of the outcome of his talks with Mauritian Ministers about the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago at 4 p.m. that afternoon and was therefore anxious that a decision should be reached at the present meeting.

2. He expressed his anxiety that Mauritius should agree to the establishment of the proposed facilities, which besides their usefulness for the defence of the free world, would be valuable to Mauritius itself by ensuring a British presence in the area. On the other hand it appeared that the Chagos site was not indispensable and there was therefore a risk that Mauritius might lose this opportunity. In the previous discussions he had found himself caught between two fires: the demands which the Mauritius Government had made, mainly for economic concessions by the United States, and the evidence that the United States was unable to concede these demands. He had throughout done his best to ensure that whatever arrangements were agreed upon should secure the maximum benefit for Mauritius. He was prepared to recommend to his colleagues if Mauritius agreed to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago:-

* (i) negotiations for a defence agreement between Britain and Mauritius;
* (ii) that if Mauritius became independent, there should be an understanding that the two governments would consult together in the event of a difficult internal security situation arising in Mauritius;
* (iii) that the British Government should use its good offices with the United States Government in support of Mauritius request for concessions over the supply of wheat and other commodities
* (iv) that compensation totalling up to £3m. should be paid to the Mauritius Government over and above direct compensation to landowners and others affected in the Chagos Islands.

This was the furthest the British Government could go. They were anxious to settle this matter by agreement but the other British Ministers concerned were of course aware that the islands were distant from Mauritius, that the link with Mauritius was an accidental one and that it would be possible for the British Government to detach them from Mauritius by Order in Council.

3. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM replied that the Mauritius Government were anxious to help and to play their part in guaranteeing the defence of the free world. He asked whether the Archipelago could not be leased, (THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that this was not acceptable). MR. BISSOONDOYAL enquired whether the Islands would revert to Mauritius if the need for defence facilities there disappeared. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that he was prepared to recommend this to his colleagues.

4. MR. PATURAU said that he recognised the value and importance of an Anglo-Mauritius defence agreement, and the advantage for Mauritius if the facilities were established in the Chagos Islands, but he considered the proposed concessions a poor bargain for Mauritius.

5. MR. BISSOONDOYAL asked whether there could be an assurance that supplies and manpower from Mauritius would be used so far as possible. THE SECRETARY OF STATE said that the United States Government would be responsible for construction work and their normal practice was to use American manpower but he felt sure the British Government would do their best to persuade the American Government to use labour and materials from Mauritius.

6. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM asked the reason for Mr. Koenig’s absence from the meeting and MR. BISSOONDOYAL asked whether the reason was a political one, saying that if so this might affect the position.

7. Mr. MOHAMED made an energetic protest against repeated postponements of the Secretary of State's proposed meeting with the M.C.A. [Muslim Committee of Action], which he regarded as a slight to his party.

8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE repeated the apology with which he had opened the meeting, explaining that it was often necessary in such conferences to concentrate attention on a delegation which was experiencing acute difficulties, while he himself had been obliged to devote much time to a crisis in another part of the world.

9. MR MOHAMED then handed the Secretary of State a recent private letter from Mauritius which disclosed that extensive misrepresentations about the course of the Conference had been published in a Parti Mauricien newspaper. THE SECRETARY OF STATE commented that such misrepresentations should be disregarded, and that MR. MOHAMED had put forward the case for his community with great skill and patience.

10. MR. MOHAMED said that his party was ready to leave the bases question to the discretion of H.M.G. and to accept anything which was for the good of Mauritius. Mauritius needed a guarantee that defence help would be available nearby in case of need.

11. At SIR S. RAMGOOLAM’s request the Secretary of State repeated the outline he had given at a previous meeting of the development aid which would be available to Mauritius between 1966–1968, viz. a C.D. &amp; W. [Commonwealth Development &amp; Welfare] allocation totalling £2.4 million (including carryover) thus meaning that £800,000 a year would be available by way of grants in addition Mauritius would have access to Exchequer loans, which might be expected to be of the order of £1m. a year, on the conditions previously explained. He pointed out that Diego Garcia was not an economic asset to Mauritius and that the proposed compensation of £3m. would be an important contribution to Mauritius development. There was no chance of raising this figure.

12. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that there was a gap of some £4m. per year between the development expenditure which his government considered necessary in order to enable the Mauritian economy to "take off" and the resources in sight, and enquired whether it was possible to provide them with additional assistance over a 10 year period to bridge this gap.

13. THE SECRETARY OF STATE mentioned the possibility of arranging for say £2m. of the proposed compensation to be paid in 10 instalments annually of £200,000.

14. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM enquired about the economic settlement with Malta on independence and was informed that these arrangements had been negotiated in the context of a special situation for which there was no parallel in Mauritius.

15. SIR H. POYNTON pointed out that if Mauritius did not become independent within three years, the Colonial Office would normally consider making a supplementary allocation of C.D. &amp; W. grant money to cover the remainder of the life of the current C.D. &amp; W. Act, i.e. the period up to 1970. He added that if Mauritius became independent, they would normally receive the unspent balance of their C.D. &amp; W. allocation in a different form and it would be open to them after the three year period to seek further assistance such as Britain was providing for a number of independent Commonwealth countries.

16. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that he was prepared to agree in principle to be helpful over the proposals which H.M.G. had put forward but he remained concerned about the availability of capital for development in Mauritius and hoped that the British Government would be able to help him in this respect.

17. MR. BISSOONDOYAL said that while it would have been easier to reach conclusions if it had been possible to obtain unanimity among the party leaders, his party was prepared to support the stand which the Premier was taking. They attached great importance to British assistance being available in the event of a serious emergency in Mauritius.

18. MR. PATURAU asked that his disagreement should be noted. The sum offered as compensation was too small and would provide only temporary help for Mauritius economic needs. Sums as large as £25m. had been mentioned in the British press and Mauritius needed a substantial contribution to close the gap of £4-5m. in the development budget. He added that since the decision was not unamimous [sic], he foresaw serious political trouble over it in Mauritius.

19. THE SECRETARY OF STATE referred to his earlier suggestion that payment of the monetary compensation should be spread over a period of years.

20. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that he was hoping to come to London for economic discussions in October. The Mauritius Government’s proposals for development expenditure had not yet been finalised, but it was already clear that there would be a very substantial gap on the revenue side.

21. SIR H. POYNTON said that the total sum available for C.D. &amp; W. assistance to the dependent territories was a fixed one and it would not be possible to increase the allocation for one territory without proportionately reducing that of another.

22. Summing up the discussion, the SECRETARY OF STATE asked whether he could inform his colleagues that Dr. [Sir Seewoosagur] Ramgoolam, Mr. Bissoondoyal and Mr. Mohamed were prepared to agree to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago on the understanding that he would recommend to his colleagues the following:-

(i) negotiations for a defence agreement between Britain and Mauritius; 
(ii) in the event of independence an understanding between the two governments that they would consult together in the event of a difficult internal security situation arising in Mauritius; 
(iii) compensation totalling up to £3m. should be paid to the Mauritius Government over and above direct compensation to landowners and the cost of resettling others affected in the Chagos Islands; (iv) the British Government would use their good offices with the United States Government in support of Mauritius’ request for concessions over sugar imports and the supply of wheat and other commodities; (v) that the British Government would do their best to persuade the American Government to use labour and materials from Mauritius for construction work in the islands;
(vi) the British Government would use their good offices with the U.S. Government to ensure that the following facilities in the Chagos Archipelago would remain available to the Mauritius Government as far as practicable: 
(a) Navigational and Meteorological facilities; 
(b) Fishing Rights; 
(c) Use of Air Strip for emergency landing and for refuelling civil planes without disembarkation of passengers. 
(vii) that if the need for the facilities on the islands disappeared the islands should be returned to Mauritius; 
(viii) that the benefit of any minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago should revert to the Mauritius Government.

23. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that this was acceptable to him and Messrs. Bissoondoyal and Mohamed in principle but he expressed the wish to discuss it with his other ministerial colleagues.

24. THE SECRETARY OF STATE pointed out that he had to leave almost immediately to convey the decision to his own colleagues and LORD TAYLOR urged the Mauritian Ministers not to risk losing the substantial sum offered and the important assurance of a friendly military presence nearby.

25. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM said that Mr. Paturau had urged him to make a further effort to secure a larger sum by way of compensation, but the Secretary of State said there was no hope of this.

26. SIR J. RENNIE said that while he had hoped that Mauritius would be able to obtain trading concessions in these negotiations, this was now ruled out. It was in the interest of Mauritius to take the opportunity offered to ensure a friendly military presence in the area. What was important about the compensation was the use to which the lump sum was put.

27. SIR S. RAMGOOLAM mentioned particular development projects, such as a dam and a land settlement scheme, and expressed the hope that Britain would make additional help available in an independence settlement.

28. SIR H. POYNTON said that the Mauritius Government should not lose sight of the possibility of securing aid for such purposes from the World Bank, the I.D.A. and from friendly governments. While Mauritius remained a colony such powers as Western Germany regarded Mauritius economic problems as a British responsibility but there was the hope that after independence aid would be available from these sources. When Sir S. Ramgoolam suggested that he had said that grants could be extended for up to 10 years, Sir H. Poynton pointed out that he had only indicated that when the period for which the next allocation had been made expired, it would be open to the Mauritius Government to seek further assistance, from Britain, even though Mauritius had meanwhile become independent. It would not be possible to reach any understanding at present beyond saying that independence did not preclude the possibility of negotiating an extension of Commonwealth aid.

29. At this point the SECRETARY OF STATE left for 10, Dowing Street [sic], after receiving authority from Sir S. Ramgoolam and Mr. Bissoondoyal to report their acceptance in principle of the proposals outlined above subject to the subsequent negotiation of details. Mr. Mohamed gave the same assurance, saying that he spoke also for his colleague Mr. Osman. Mr. Paturau said he was unable to concur.}}

On 6 October 1965, instructions were sent to the Governor of Mauritius to secure "early confirmation that the Mauritius Government is willing to agree that Britain should now take the necessary legal steps to detach the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius on the conditions enumerated in (i)–(viii) in paragraph 22 of the enclosed record [of the Lancaster House Meeting]." The Secretary of State went on to note that -&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|
5. As regards points (iv), (v) and (vi) the British Government will make appropriate representation to the American Government as soon as possible. You will be kept fully informed of the progress of these representations.

6. The Chagos Archipelago will remain under British sovereignty, and Her Majesty’s Government have taken careful note of points (vii) and (viii).}}

On 5 November 1965, the Governor of Mauritius informed the Colonial Office as follows:&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|
Council of Ministers today confirmed agreement to the detachment of Chagos Archipelago on conditions enumerated, on the understanding that

(1) statement in paragraph 6 of your despatch "H.M.G. have taken careful note of points (vii) and (viii)" means H.M.G. have in fact agreed to them.

(2) As regards (vii) undertaking to Legislative Assembly excludes (a) sale or transfer by H.M.G. to third party or (b) any payment or financial obligation by Mauritius as condition of return. 
(3) In (viii) "on or near" means within area within which Mauritius would be able to derive benefit but for change of sovereignty. I should be grateful if you would confirm this understanding is agreed.}}

The Governor also noted that "[[Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate]] (PMSD) Ministers dissented and (are now) considering their position in the government." The Parties differ regarding the extent to which Mauritian consent to the detachment was given voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

The detachment of the Chagos Archipelago was effected by the establishment of the BIOT on 8 November 1965 by Order in Council. Pursuant to the Order in Council, the governance of the newly created BIOT was made the responsibility of the office of the BIOT Commissioner, appointed by the Queen upon the advice of the United Kingdom FCO. The BIOT Commissioner is assisted in the day-to-day management of the territory by a BIOT Administrator.&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

On the same day, the Secretary of State cabled the Governor of Mauritius as follows:&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

{{quote|As already stated in paragraph 6 of my despatch No. 423, the Chagos Archipelago will remain under British sovereignty. The islands are required for defence facilities and there is no intention of permitting prospecting for minerals or oils on or near them. The points set out in your paragraph 1 should not therefore arise but I shall nevertheless give them further consideration in view of your request.}}

On 12 November 1965, the Governor of Mauritius cabled the Colonial Office, querying whether the Mauritian Ministers could make public reference to the items in paragraph 22 of the record of the Lancaster House Meeting and adding "[i]n this connection I trust further consideration promised . . . will enable categorical assurances to be given."&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

On 19 November 1965, the Colonial Office cabled the Governor of Mauritius as follows: U.K./U.S. defence interests;&lt;ref name="Ruling"/&gt;

1. There is no objection to Ministers referring to points contained in paragraph 22 of enclosure to Secret despatch No. 423 of 6 October so long as qualifications contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the despatch are borne in mind.

2. It may well be some time before we can give final answers regarding points (iv), (v) and (vi) of paragraph 22 and as you know we cannot be at all hopeful for concessions over sugar imports and it would therefore seem unwise for anything to be said locally which would raise expectations on this point.

3. As regards point (vii) the assurance can be given provided it is made clear that a decision about the need to retain the islands must rest entirely with the United Kingdom Government and that it would not (repeat not) be open to the Government of Mauritius to raise the matter, or press for the return of the islands on its own initiative.

After initially penuriously denying that the islands were inhabited, British officials forcibly expelled approximately 2,000 [[Chagossians]], who had lived on those islands for millennia to mainland Mauritius to allow the United States to establish a [[military base]] on Diego Garcia. Since 1971, only the atoll of Diego Garcia is inhabited only by some 3,000 UK and US military and civilian contracted personnel.&lt;ref name="biot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/140416/140420/british_indian_ocean_territory/ |title=Commonwealth Secretariat&amp;nbsp;— British Indian Ocean Territory |publisher=Thecommonwealth.org |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042938/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/YearbookInternal/140416/140420/british_indian_ocean_territory/ |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marine protected area ===

{{Main|Chagos Marine Protected Area}}

The British Government established a [[marine protected area]] (MPA) around the Chagos Islands known as the ''Chagos Marine Protected Area'' was created on 1 April 2010 and enforced on 1 November 2010.&lt;ref name="Protect"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://protectchagos.org/|title=Protect Chagos|accessdate=9 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119044248/http://protectchagos.org/|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's largest fully protected reserve, twice the size of Great Britain. The designation proved controversial as the decision was announced during a period when the [[UK Parliament]] was in recess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8599125.stm|title=UK sets up Chagos Islands marine reserve|accessdate=12 August 2015|publisher=BBC News|last1=Rincon|first1=Paul|date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] release a leaked [[US Embassy London]] diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/05/09LONDON1156.html|title=leaked US diplomatic cable|accessdate=9 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202074830/http://cablegate.wikileaks.org/cable/2009/05/09LONDON1156.html|archivedate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; exposed British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] [[Colin Roberts (British administrator)|Colin Roberts]], in which Roberts "asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago’s former residents." Richard Mills concludes:

{{quote|Establishing a marine reserve might, indeed, as the FCO's Roberts stated, be the most effective long-term way to prevent any of the Chagos Islands' former inhabitants or their descendants from resettling in the [British Indian Ocean Territory].}}

=== Legal proceedings ===

{{Main|Mauritius v United Kingdom}}

The Government of Mauritius initiated proceedings on 20 December 2010 against the UK Government under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to challenge the legality of the ‘marine protected area’. Mauritius argues that Britain breached a UN resolution when it separated Chagos from the rest of the colony of Mauritius in the 1960s, before the country became independent, and that Britain therefore doesn’t have the right to declare the area a marine reserve and that the MPA was not compatible with the rights of the Chagossians.&lt;ref name="N.ASSEMBLY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/pm/file/StatementChagosMarineProtectionArea.pdf |title=STATEMENT BY DR THE HON.

On 18 March 2015, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled that the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area]] was illegal.

====United Nations General Assembly referral of territorial dispute to the International Court of Justice====
On 23 June 2017, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) voted in favour of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean.

=== Democracy ===

Since the illegal abduction of the Chagossians in the 1960s, annual surveys have been carried out clearly identifying that Chaggosians consider themselves to be both equal and inseparable members of the European Union and the United Kingdom.

=== Study ===

In March 2014, it was reported that the UK government were sending experts to the islands to examine options and risks of resettlement&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/chagos-islands-uk-experts-resettlement-study&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">'''Challenge grants''' are funds disbursed by one party (the [[grant (money)|grant]] maker), usually a government agency, [[corporation]], [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] or [[Charitable trust|trust]] (sometimes anonymously), typically to a [[non-profit]] entity or educational institution (the grantee) upon completion of the challenge requirement(s). The ''challenge'' refers to the actions or results that must be achieved before money is released and usually involves substantial effort, so that the recipients know that they are helping themselves through their own hard work and sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/challenge.html National Endowment for the Humanities website: Challenge Grants page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721105014/http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/challenge.html |date=July 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Challenge grants: 
# Spotlight the recipient organization and provide an endorsement from a well-known entity.
# Help other donors feel that their money goes farther.
# Enable the recipient to honor and reward the entity that issued the challenge grant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/non-profit-businesses/8890-1.html All-Business website: August 12, 2005-Leveraging a Fundraiser Tool: Challenge Grants]&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical requirement is similar to [[matching funds]] where funds be raised or acquired from other sources following a stated matching factor, often 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1. For example, a $1,000 challenge grant with a 3:1 match would require the recipient to raise $3,000 before they would receive the $1,000 grant. The challenge could require a new solution to an existing problem that had been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightfoundation.org/news/press_room/knight_press_releases/detail.dot?id=331205 Knight Foundation: June 26, 2008- $5 Million Challenge Grant from Knight Foundation Helps Start Effort to End Homelessness in Columbia, SC]&lt;/ref&gt; There could be additional requirements specified that could be virtually anything, from program certification to member participation.

'''Citizens for Self-Governance''' ('''CSG''') is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[United States|American]] political organization.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; In 2015, it launched a nationwide initiative calling for a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]] to reduce federal spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherfinski|first1=David|title=Supporters of convention to amend Constitution aim to defeat state legislators standing in way|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/7/republicans-opposed-to-constitutional-convention-t/?page=all|accessdate=13 April 2015 |publisher=[[Washington Times]] |date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's efforts are focused on imposing fiscal restraint on Washington D.C., reducing the federal government's authority over states, and imposing term limits on federal officials.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; {{As of|2018}}, the organization's resolution has passed in 12 states.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pollack|first1=Cassandra|title=Convention of states-related bill hits Gov.

The organization has also funded a lawsuit against the [[Internal Revenue Service]] alleging politically-oriented targeting of organizations. The group is based in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name="Wines"/&gt;

==Leadership==
[[Mark Meckler]] serves as President of CSG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richman|first=Josh|title=Political Blotter: NorCal Tea Party sues IRS|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23311842/political-blotter-norcal-tea-party-sues-irs|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meckler was previously co-founder of the [[Tea Party Patriots]] before resigning from that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=MJ|title=Mark Meckler, Tea party co-founder quits|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/73255.html|accessdate=January 5, 2014|newspaper=Politico|date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service===
{{main|IRS targeting controversy}}

In May 2013, CSG filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against the [[Internal Revenue Service]], alleging violations under the [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]] as well as violations of constitutional rights guaranteeing free expression and equal protection under the law.&lt;ref name=cnnlawsuit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raymond|first=Nate|title=Tea Party group sues IRS over inappropriate targeting|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-20/news/sns-rt-usa-irslawsuitl2n0e1250-20130520_1_tax-exempt-status-lois-lerner-irs-commissioner-steven-miller|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit stemmed from IRS targeting of conservative groups for more scrutiny as they applied for tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name=cnnlawsuit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Trinko

===Convention of the States===
CSG has called for a [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roller|first=Emma|title=Conservatives' Improbable New 'Convention of States' Project|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/12/04/alec_ron_johnson_support_convention_of_states.html|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=Slate|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niraj Chokshi
December 5, 2013, Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/12/05/next-up-for-alec-taming-the-federal-government/ Next up for ALEC: Taming the federal government], Accessed Jan. 21, 2014, "...a panel focused on a plan to call a convention of states under the Constitution to limit the powers of the federal government, developed by a group called Citizens for Self-Governance. CSG is led by Meckler...."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meckler:

{{Quote|By calling a convention of states, we can stop the federal spending and debt spree, the power grabs of the federal courts, and other misuses of federal power. The current situation is precisely what the Founders feared, and they gave us a solution we have a duty to use.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;}}

CSG has opened numerous chapters across the nation to urge state legislators to summon a national convention; for example, in [[Virginia]], the group sponsored the founder of [[Patrick Henry College]], [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]], to launch a ''Convention of States Project'' which is a forum for delegates appointed by state governments to propose amendments to the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Schmidt, January 20, 2014, Richmond Times-Dispatch, ''The News Virginian'', [http://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/special_reports/effort-seeks-to-reset-course-for-america/article_778def90-815f-11e3-8a24-001a4bcf6878.html Effort seeks to reset course for America], Accessed Jan. 21, 2014, "...Last year, Farris launched the Convention of States Project, sponsored by a group called Citizens for Self-Governance. In the past three months, the project has opened numerous chapters nationwide that lobby legislators...."&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, nearly 100 legislators from 32 states met at [[Mount Vernon]] to talk about how to call a convention of states. According to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', "The meeting lasted four hours, ending when legislators agreed to meet again in the spring of 2014. That’s the most progress anyone’s made in decades toward a states-first constitutional amendment campaign." CSG provided the legislators with briefing books that laid out a plan to call a convention of states.&lt;ref name="weigel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Inside the Secret Conservative Campaign to Rewrite the Constitution|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/chris_kapenga_mark_levin_and_article_v_the_secret_campaign_to_pass_conservative.html|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Slate|date=December 10, 2013|author2=Roller, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Georgia became the first state to pass CSG's convention of states application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowrey|first=Jason|title=Georgia Legislature calls for convention under Article V  Read more: The Daily Tribune News - Georgia Legislature calls for convention under Article V|url=http://www.daily-tribune.com/view/full_story/24722678/article-Georgia-Legislature-calls-for-convention-under-Article-V?instance=main_article|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=Daily Tribune News|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018}}, ten other states had followed suit, bringing the total number of states to pass CSG's convention of states application to twelve.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Brendan|title=Right-Wing Billionaires Are Buying Themselves a New Constitution|url=http://fusion.net/right-wing-billionaires-are-buying-themselves-a-new-con-1793960357|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Fusion|date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, CSG announced plans to have resolutions before at least 24 state legislatures in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Push continues for convention of states|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/07/09/4226174/push-continues-for-convention.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=Miami Herald|publisher=Associated Press|date=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the group backed bills in 26 states that would call for a convention. Some members of both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties have supported bills backed by the organization, while others from both the left and right have criticized the proposal, fearing that it could "set the stage for a runaway convention to make over the entire Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Brad|title=States urged to call for convention to amend U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article15392828.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Kansas City Star|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, CSG held a simulated [[convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Tea Party co-founder holds convention in Williamsburg for amending Constitution|url=http://wydaily.com/2016/09/23/tea-party-co-founder-holds-constitutional-convention-in-williamsburg/|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=Williamsburg Yorktown Daily|date=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simulated convention passed amendments relating to six topics, including requiring the states to approve any increase in the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], imposing [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]]; limiting the [[Commerce Clause]]; providing an "easy congressional override" of federal regulations; requiring a [[supermajority]] to impose federal taxes and repealing the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]]; and "giving the states (by a three-fifths vote) the power to abrogate any federal law, regulation, or executive order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farris|first1=Michael|last2=Ellis|first2=Jenna|title=A Convention of the States to Amend the Constitution|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/440506/constitutional-amendments-states-convention|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=National Review|date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim DeMint]] became a senior advisor to the group in June 2017. According to DeMint, "The Tea Party needs a new mission. They realize that all the work they did in 2010 has not resulted in all the things they hoped for. Many of them are turning to Article V."&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schouten|first1=Fredreka|title=Exclusive: In latest job, Jim DeMint wants to give Tea Party ' a new mission'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/06/12/jim-demint-joins-group-that-wants-to-amend-constitution-tea-party/102748540/|accessdate=13 June 2017|publisher=USA Today|date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opponents====
Opponents of the group's efforts to call a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution include conservative groups the [[John Birch Society]] and the [[Eagle Forum]] as well as [[George Soros]].&lt;ref name=fusion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bedard|first1=Paul|title=Soros, Birchers fight constitutional fix to limit Obama, Congress|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/soros-birchers-fight-constitutional-fix-to-limit-obama-congress/article/2561547|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=Washington Examiner|date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal advocacy group [[Common Cause]] has been a vocal opponent of the CSG's Convention of the States initiative; in a May 2016 report entitled ''The Dangerous Path: Big Money's Plan to Shred the Constitution'', the group wrote that "There is nothing to prevent the convention, once convened, from proposing additional changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights or upend our entire system of government."&lt;ref&gt;John C.

==Funding==
Tax records show that CSG's annual funding increased since its push to amend the Constitution began; the group received $1.8 million in contributions in 2011, and $5.7 million in contributions in 2015.&lt;ref name="Grissom"&gt;Brandi Grissom, [https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2017/03/01/major-conservatives-piggy-banks-behind-texas-obsession-amending-constitution Mega-rich conservative donors are behind Texas' obsession with amending the Constitution], ''Dallas News'' (March 1, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The group does not disclose the sources of its funding; in a 2013 tax filing, CSG stated that disclosure would "chill the donors' First Amendment right to associate in private with the organization."&lt;ref name="Grissom"/&gt;

CSG also operates the Alliance for Self-Governance and Convention of States Action, neither of which is legally required to disclose donors' identities.&lt;ref name="Grissom"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">A Jewish '''consistory''' (see conventional meanings: [[wikt:consistory|consistory]] in Wiktionary), (or '''''Consistoire''''' in French), was a body governing the [[Jews|Jewish]] congregations of a province or of a country; also the district administered by the consistory. 

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] established the first central Jewish consistory in France, and ordered regional ones to be set up in turn. The political emancipation of the Jews required the creation of a representative body that could transact official business with a government in the name of the Jews. The Jews in countries under French influence during the Napoleonic period often also established consistories. In addition, in this period, the educated classes desired religious reform and supported the creation of a body vested with authority to render religious decisions.

==France==

[[Napoleon I]] established the first Jewish consistory. In 1806 he convened the Assembly of Jewish Notables, whose resolutions were confirmed by a subsequently convened [[Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"|Grand Sanhedrin]]. By decree of March 17, 1808, he organized a consistory. According to this decree, every [[Departments of France|department]] containing 2,000 Jews might establish a consistory. Departments having fewer than this number might combine with others; but no department had more than one consistory. Above these provincial consistories, there was a [[Central Consistory|central consistory]]. Every consistory consisted of a grand rabbi, with another rabbi where possible, and three lay members, two of whom were residents of the town where the consistory sat. They were elected by twenty-five "notables," who were nominated by the French authorities. 

Thus Israelite French consistories were, like their [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Protestant namesakes]], parastatal entities to represent these religious minorities to the administration, which in return used to control them. Eligible to become members of the consistory were Israelites who had reached the age of thirty years, who had never been bankrupt, nor practised [[usury]]. The central consistory consisted of three grand rabbis and two lay members. Every year one grand rabbi retired, and the remaining members elected his successor.

Napoleon demanded that the consistories should ensure that resolutions passed by the Assembly of Notables and confirmed by the Sanhedrin should be enforced by the rabbis. He required the following: proper decorum should be maintained in the synagogue; Jews should take up mechanical trades (to replace usury); and the leaders should ensure that no young men evaded military service. The central consistory watched over the consistories of the various departments, and had the right to appoint the rabbis.

==French dependencies==

Napoleon's administration introduced the concept of the consistory to the various countries which were under the sway of France during his era and where Jews had been emancipated, such as [[Belgium]] (French-annexed from 1794 to 1814), and the [[client state]]s of [[Kingdom of Holland|Holland]] and [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]]. Napoleon's youngest brother, [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], ruled over Westphalia, where he established the {{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}} by decree of March 31, 1808. It was composed of a president (who could be either a rabbi or a layman), three rabbis, two lay members, and one secretary. Consistorial President [[Israel Jacobson]] was largely responsible for establishing this, as he hoped to use it to introduce his own ideas about Reform Judaism. The consistory ordered the introduction of confirmation for Jewish youths and removed the prohibition against consumption of leguminous plants on [[Passover]]. 

With the exception of the consistory in Belgium, none of these organizations survived the Napoleonic era. Counter-revolutions in the countries formerly under French influence resulted in governments re-establishing discriminatory laws against the Jews.

During the middle of the nineteenth century, various Jewish communities worked to introduce either a consistory or a synod which should, by an authoritative vote, settle the difficulties which arose when the demands of the time came into conflict with the traditional Halakah law. Some members of the Jewish communities wanted reform, but others resisted change. None of these attempts was successful.

==End of the nineteenth century==

Since Napoleon's 1808, the Consistory in France has changed. Members changed the method of electing the delegates, and dropped provisions assigning the rabbis secondary roles as government informers. In the later 19th century, [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] (May 25, 1844) and [[Napoleon III]] (June 15, 1850, and August 29, 1862) made significant changes. 

In 1871 the ambits of the three consistories in [[Colmar]], [[Metz]] and [[Strasbourg]] became part of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] outside the supervision of the Central Consistory. They were not under any other common umbrella. However, the three consistories remained concordatary religious bodies and were entitled to nominate together one representative for the upper house of the parliament of Alsace-Lorraine, as did other recognised religious bodies. After French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Alsace-Lorraine was ceded to Prussia. 

The French law of December 12, 1872, introduced the system of [[universal suffrage]] in elections of the consistories. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were twelve consistories: Paris, Nancy, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseilles, Bayonne, Epinal, Lille, Besançon, Algier, Constantine, and Oran. Each has the grand rabbi of the consistorial district and six lay members, with a secretary. Each consistory has a representative in the [[Central Consistory]], which is composed of twelve members and the Grand Rabbi of France; its seat is in Paris.

==20th century==

By the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 French law on the Separation of Religions and the State]], the Israelite consistories in France lost their status as ''établissements publics du culte'' (public-law corporations of [[Cult (religious practice)#Cult practice|cult]]). With the defeat of Germany in World War I, in 1919 the three Israelite consistories in Alsace-Moselle returned to French jurisdiction. Their concordatary status has since been preserved in what is now called the [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]]. They retain their status as parastatal entities.

The '''Constitution of São Tomé and Príncipe''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Constituição da República Democrática de São Tomé e Príncipe'') was first approved on 5 November 1975. There were revisions in 1980, 1987 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www2.camara.leg.br/saotomeeprincipe/parlamento/historial|title= Parlamento → Historial|accessdate= 23 August 2014|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7160">'''Council of Foreign Ministers''' was an organisation agreed upon at the [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945 and announced in the [[Potsdam Agreement]].

The Potsdam Agreement specified that the Council would be composed of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Republic of China|China]], France, and the United States. It would normally meet in London (at [[Lancaster House]]) and the first meeting was to take place no later than 1 September 1945. As the immediate important task, the Council was authorised to draw up treaties of peace with Italy, [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], Hungary and Finland, and to propose settlements of territorial questions outstanding on the termination of the [[World War II|war in Europe]]. Also the Council should prepare a peace settlement for Germany to be accepted when a "government adequate for the purpose is established".

== Topics of discussion ==
The ministers met two times in 1945: first at the [[London Conference of Foreign Ministers]] and then in December at the [[Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers]], and in 1946 at the [[Paris Conference of Foreign Ministers]].

The London conference was marred by a dispute between the Soviet Union and the United States over occupation of Japan and little of substance was accomplished. The Moscow conference was more productive; it agreed to the preparation of peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland; the creation of an eleven–member [[Allied Commission#Japan|Far Eastern Commission]] and a four–member [[Allied Council for Japan]]. It also agreed to the establishment by the [[United Nations]] of a commission for the control of atomic energy, as well as a number of other lesser issues brought about by the end of World War II. France joined the Council in 1946 and at the Paris Conference the final wording for the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties of 1947]] was agreed. The outstanding issue of [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was resolved at the New York meeting of the Foreign Ministers in November–December 1946.

In 1947 the ministers met twice first in Moscow, in the Spring, and again in the Autumn in London, but by this time the [[Cold War]] was gathering pace and they failed to agree on a peace treaty for Germany and Austria. They did however agree to the dissolution of the [[free state (government)|free state]] of Prussia, thereby recognising the [[Historical Eastern Germany|annexation of the Prussian territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]].

At a meeting in Paris in September 1948 the ministers failed to agree on what to do with the former Italian colonies. The council was revived in 1949 and met in Paris, during May and June, where they agreed to the ending of the Soviet [[Berlin Blockade|blockade of Berlin]], but failed to agree on German reunification. The Berlin meeting in 1954 ended in deadlock, but the following year in Vienna, they agreed on a peace treaty for Austria (the [[Austrian State Treaty]]).

Meetings by the foreign ministers in [[Geneva]], the first at the [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Summit]] in July 1955 and again a year later failed to reach agreement on German reunification, or European security and disarmament. A third meeting in 1959 again failed to reach agreement over Germany. The Western powers would only agree to a comprehensive peace treaty with a Germany reunited under a democratic government, not treaties with the governments of [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany. They also refused to agree with a Soviet proposal to a change in the status of Berlin from an occupied city into a demilitarised one.

In 1971 the foreign ministers of the four powers signed the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (effective from June 1972). It regularised trade and travel relations between West Berlin and West Germany and aimed at improving communications between East Berlin and West Berlin. The Soviet Union stipulated, however, that West Berlin would not be incorporated into West Germany. That meeting also produced the [[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]] (effective June 1973) which recognised two German states, and the two countries pledged to respect one another's sovereignty. Under the terms of the treaty, diplomatic missions were to be exchanged and commercial, tourist, cultural, and communications relations established. Under the agreement and the treaty, both German states joined the United Nations (September 1973).

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], on 12 September 1990 the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]] was signed by the four powers and the two German governments, which was the final [[peace treaty]] of World War II and the restoration of German sovereignty. This allowed [[German reunification]] to take place on 3 October 1990 and the reunited country became fully sovereign again on 15 March 1991.

      <comment>/* Danification of English words */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">'''Danglish''' is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[English language|English]]. The term is used in [[Denmark]] to refer to the increasingly strong influx of English or pseudo-English vocabulary into Danish. It is an example of [[code switching]], much like [[Spanglish]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Auer|first1=Peter|title=Code-Switching in Conversation|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DHk4-1SX3tYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=code-switching&amp;ots=VDO7OLtok2&amp;sig=iyV4leFDLCyo42n6MTE5cXDDlxs#v=onepage&amp;q=code-switching&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While it has been argued that the influx of English words, similar to the import of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[French language|French]] words in the past, makes the language more expressive, it remains controversial in many sectors of society, notably with older people, who are often less accustomed to English terms.

{{Citation needed span|text=Many Danes fully accept a takeover of correct English expressions when a proper Danish expression either does not exist or can not be created for several reasons. This is particularly true for expression from the sector of modern computing and/or media. What many detest, however, is the increasing tendency to unnecessarily substitute existing Danish words with sensible Anglicisms and, even worse, the creation of an—often distorted—pseudo-English vocabulary (usually for marketing purposes) and referring re- and misinterpretations of the original words, whether English or Danish.|date=July 2018|reason=This seems like an opinion and not a verifiable claim.}}

"Danglish" is also used as a pejorative referring to the use of poor and/or clumsy English by Danes.&lt;ref&gt;Mellish, Kay Xander. (2016) "Top 35 Mistakes Danes Make In English," p. 9.  KXMGroup, Copenhagen. {{ISBN|9788771141887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danification of English words==
Danglish words often receive standard Danish endings and prefixes; in other words, they are conjugated or declined in the same manner as Danish words. The following are examples of sentences featuring Danified English words; the correct terms in Danish are also included as well:

*"Jeg blev nødt til at genstarte/reboote computeren, fordi programmet crashede. (I had to reboot the computer because the software crashed.)
*"Har du allerede hentet/downloadet den nyeste version?" (Have you already downloaded the newest version?)

==Twisting of Danish idioms and grammar rules==
The adaptation also takes the other route, where literal translations of popular English expressions slowly but insistently replace the correct Danish words and idioms. Widespread examples of this evolution include but are not :

*at handle på noget (to act on something/take action. Correct term: at skride til handling)
*tager ikke nej for et svar (does not take no for an answer. Correct term: tager ikke nej for et nej)
*at få alting frem i det åbne (to get everything out in the open. Correct term: at få alting frem)
*at have sex (to have sex. Correct term: at dyrke sex)
*at svare telefonen (to answer the telephone. Correct term: at tage telefonen)
*at spørge [om] et spørgsmål (to ask [about] a question. Correct term: at stille et spørgsmål)

These phrasings may have originated from (subtitled) English-language films and television shows translated into Danish, but are also used in everyday language.

==Anglicisation of Danish sentences==
A large majority of Danes are familiar with English as a second language, but sometimes the translation from Danish to English is more Danglish:

*"I am at the beginning of my period." ("My term in office has just begun." – Falsely attributed to [[Helle Degn]], former Minister of Development Cooperation. Started as an internal, intentional joke at a Christmas party in [[Danida]] in 1993 &lt;ref&gt;[https://globalnyt.dk/content/helle-degn-fylder-60 Helle Degn fylder 60] GlobalNyt 2006-10-20&lt;/ref&gt;.)
*"Screw down a little bit the expectations"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZoLHIZEBB0| "Screw Down a little bit the Expectations" - Richard Møller Nielsen] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; ("Lower your expectations" – [[Richard Møller Nielsen]], National Football Manager)
*"The prick over the I" (Danish saying meaning "the finishing touch", or "dot the i's and cross the t's" – [[Jytte Hilden]], Former Minister of Culture)
*"Can I borrow the toilet?" ("May I use the toilet?")

==Common mistakes made by native Danish speakers when speaking English==
*Confusing "fun" with "funny." This is due to the Danish word "sjov" meaning having both meanings. ("We had a very funny time.") &lt;ref&gt;Mellish, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mistranslating "eventuelt" as "eventually" and "aktuelt" as "actually." 
*Mixing up "lose" and "drop". This is due to the Danish word "tabe" meaning having both meanings. ("I was sorry to drop so much money in the stock market, but at least I dropped a lot of weight worrying about it.") 
*Writing "costumer" instead of "customer." &lt;ref&gt;Mellish, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Confusing "prize" and "price"

==Non-translation==
Several schools have lately changed their names to become more internationally recognized. "Handelshøjskolen i København" is now known as "[[Copenhagen Business School]]" or "CBS". Of the three music conservatories offering classical music programs, the English names of [[Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus/Aalborg]] and [[Danish National Academy of Music]] deviate from their original Danish names that show strong geographical emphasis, "Det Jyske Musikkonservatorium (DJM)" and "Syddansk Musikkonservatorium (SDMK)", which are translated as "The Jutlandic Music Conservatory" and "Southern Denmark Music Conservatory" respectively. Their English acronyms "RAMA" and "DNA of Music" are also employed in such informal settings as social media, for instance, the former's annual "RAMA Festival" and the latter's Facebook page URL. 

Many English-language films such as ''[[Armageddon]]'', ''[[Toy Story]]'' or ''[[Ice Age]]'', do not translate their titles into Danish, even if the films themselves are otherwise fully translated. Menus of many global fast food chains also usually go partly or completely untranslated, such as "Double Whopper,"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">With origins in the early 20th century, a '''donor recognition wall''' (also known as a donor wall or donor display) is typically a wall-mounted display found in a centralized location of a hospital, university, museum, library, worship facility, or other [[nonprofit]] institution. It consists of a listing of names of persons or companies that contributed funds to a capital campaign or other major [[fundraising]] effort of the organization. The fundamental purposes of a donor recognition wall are to honor the major financial contributors of an organization, and to serve as an incentive for potential donors to contribute.

Traditionally, donor recognition walls consisted of header (title) lettering with the names of benefactors listed below on engraved [[brass]] panels or plaques.  Today, however, donor recognition walls can incorporate a variety of styles, materials, artistic media and interactive multimedia presentations that appear on plasma displays, touch-screen kiosks and LCD screens. Often in [[contemporary architecture]], a donor recognition wall will constitute a major [[aesthetic]] feature of a building's lobby area or main hallway.  It will frequently incorporate a prominent display of the organization's [[logo]] and [[mission statement]].

Many institutions consider a “donor wall” or some kind of comprehensive recognition piece to be the period at the end of the campaign sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paige|first=Eubanks-Barrows|title=Donor Recognition|url=http://www.adrp.net/adrpaasp-best-practices|work=The Association of Donor Relations Professionals best practices|publisher=ADRP|accessdate=23 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731202230/http://www.adrp.net/adrpaasp-best-practices|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">The '''European Parliamentary Union (EPU)''' was a private organization set up by [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], who was also its Secretary General.
It  held its preliminary conference on 4–5 July 1947 at [[Gstaad]], [[Switzerland]], and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September.

Kalergi’s aim was to draft a [[European Constitution]].  The EPU asked some 4000 members of Parliament of 13 European countries to decide for or against a European Federation in the framework of the United Nations.  The project was criticized by [[Denis de Rougemont]] and [[Duncan Sandys]], son-in-law of [[Winston Churchill]], founder of the [[European Movement]], who advocated a model based on an intergovernmental co-operation without any  loss of national sovereignty.
The EPU played a prominent role in the [[Congress of the Hague]], 7–10 May 1948.&lt;ref&gt; In: SOUQUET, Marie-Amélie. Le mouvement européen, construire la démocratie en Europe. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The second EPU Congress was held from 1 to 5 September 1948 in [[Interlaken]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_congress_of_the_european_parliamentary_union_in_interlaken_from_cahiers_du_monde_nouveau_october_1948-en-c3267549-edc8-4d24-8dd8-ebb5d0f92205.html ‘The Congress of the European Parliamentary Union in Interlaken' from Cahiers du Monde Nouveau (October 1948)] on CVCE website&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 September 1949, the EPU met for the third time in Venice and voted a resolution in favour of greater European political integration and an extension of the powers of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Consultative Assembly]] of the [[Council of Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/obj/first_resolution_adopted_by_the_epu_congress_in_venice_20_september_1949-en-5305d9b4-4c0a-476e-97bb-2101b33b7ff1.html First resolution adopted by the EPU Congress in Venice (20 September 1949)] on CVCE website&lt;/ref&gt; which had just been established. In 1949, the British MP [[Kim Mackay]] became chair of the EPU.
The creation of the Council of Europe resulted in a loss of influence for the EPU, since European parliaments now had their own intergovernmental forum in [[Strasbourg]].

On 18 May 1950,  Kalergi was the first person to be awarded the [[Karlspreis|International Charlemagne Prize]] of the City of [[Aachen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epaneurope.eu/The Paneuropaean Union] on ePaneurope website&lt;/ref&gt; In 19.-20 June 1950, [[Rheinfelden]], Switzerland, the EPU organised a Conference of German and French Parliamentarians
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-g.jp/europe/doc/EU1950-1959.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shortly afterwards, the EPU was merged with the [[European Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paneuropa.org/fr_int/geschichte.html Paneurope - la fondatrice de l'idée de l'Europe unifiée ] on Paneuropa website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eurosclerosis''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Eurosklerose'') is a term coined by German economist [[Herbert Giersch]] in the 1970s, to describe a pattern of economic stagnation in Europe that may have resulted from government over-regulation and overly generous social benefits policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eurosclerosis.asp Investopedia: Eurosclerosis Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; The term alludes to the medical term [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]], and is a rhyme of the archaic term ''neurosclerosis''.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation (1967). ''Manual of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death''. Geneva. http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/70934&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used to describe European countries of the 1970s and 1980s which had high [[unemployment]] and slow job creation in spite of overall [[economic growth]], in contrast to what the United States experienced in the same period when [[economic expansion]] was accompanied by high [[job growth]]. In its political context, the term "eurosclerosis" was used to describe a period with a perceived stagnation of [[European integration]]. The slow pace of [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]], a perceived lack of democracy and economic problems meant that negative and apathetic attitudes to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) were high.

[[Wilfried Martens]], [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] from 1981 to 1992, states in his 2008 memoirs that the period of "eurosclerosis" was brought to an end by the 1986 [[Single European Act]] which re-launched the drive to integration by framing the [[Single market of the European Union|single market]] of the EEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Martens |first= Wilfried |others= |title= Europe: I Struggle, I Overcome |year= 2008 |publisher= Springer |location= Brussels |isbn= 978-3-540-89288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an economic term, "eurosclerosis" has later been used more broadly to refer to overall [[economic stagnation]]. According to [[Paul Krugman]] and the US [[Federal Reserve]], at least one alleged victim of Eurosclerosis (France) has gone from having a lower employment than the US in 1999, to a significantly higher employment rate following the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=Cheese-eating Job Creators|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/cheese-eating-job-creators/|publisher=New York Times|date=May 21, 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krugman2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=Eurosclerosis, Then and Now|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/eurosclerosis-then-and-now/|date=January 22, 2011|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Palestine}}
{{Politics of the Gaza Strip}}
The '''Fatah–Hamas reconciliation process''' refers to a series of reconciliation attempts to resolve the hostility between Fatah and Hamas since the 2006–2007 [[Fatah–Hamas conflict (2006–07)|Fatah–Hamas conflict]] and Hamas' subsequent [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|takeover of the Gaza Strip]].

Despite a number of agreements, those attempts have as of 2016 not been successful, with Hamas still exercising full control of the Gaza Strip, despite the formation of the [[Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014|"unity government"]] in June 2014. Israel and the United States have effectively opposed reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2009/01/200912823298296434.html "Carter says Hamas must be included"]. Al Jazeera, 29 January 2009.&lt;br /&gt;"Carter said reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, the faction led by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, had been 'objected to and obstructed by the US and Israel'".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Until the [[First Intifada]], [[Fatah]] was the sole dominating party in the Palestinian political arena, including the [[PLO]]. In 1987, [[Hamas]] arose as a resistance movement against the Israeli occupation. Following the [[Oslo Accords]], the PLO, of which Fatah still was the dominant member, formally denounced armed resistance. Hamas refused to recognize Israel and opposed the Oslo Accords and subsequent agreements between the PLO and Israel. Under pressure of Israel and the international community, Fatah attempted to eliminate Hamas, especially after Mahmoud Abbas had succeeded Arafat as [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]]. Tensions mounted ahead the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]] in 2005 and culminated in the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Battle of Gaza]] in June 2007, resulting in a split of the [[Palestinian government]].

In reconciliation attempts, Hamas has mainly focussed on reform of the [[PLO]] and its inclusion in the organisation. After Hamas' victory in the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], it unsuccessfully tried to run the [[Palestinian Authority Government of March 2006|PA Government]] due to Israeli and international boycott.

Although Hamas has maintained that it is ready to conclude a long-term truce with Israel (hudna), it has vowed to never recognize Israel, because this would imply the recognition of the "Zionist occupation of Palestine", which Hamas views as an Arab Islamic country. In the view of Hamas, recognition of Israel would imply the acceptance of the expulsion of more than 700,000 Palestinians during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]]. Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel and denounce armed resistance, unlike the PLO and implicitly Fatah, has been the main reason for Israel and the international community to oppose the reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. Fatah has met with massive external pressure not to cooperate with Hamas.

==Israeli obstruction==
Israel has consistently objected to Hamas being included in any PA government. In 2009, for example, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] said that Israel would never make peace with Hamas and "cannot accept Hamas as a negotiating partner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/22/obama-lays-groundwork-peace-israel-palestinians |title=Netanyahu: Israel Will Never Make Peace With Hamas |accessdate=2015-09-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923195724/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/22/obama-lays-groundwork-peace-israel-palestinians |archivedate=September 23, 2009 |df= }}. FOXNews, 22 September 2009. On web.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; Following the April 2011 Cairo Agreement, he ruled out a peace agreement for that reason. He said: "The PA must choose either peace with Israel or peace with Hamas. There is no possibility for peace with both" and "How can you talk to us about peace when you're talking about peace with Hamas. You can choose [to make] peace with Israel or you can choose peace with Hamas".&lt;ref name=jp_pm_must_choose&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Abbas-reacts-PM-must-choose-between-peace-settlements "Abbas reacts: PM must choose between peace, settlements"]. Jerusalem Post, 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

President Abbas has consistently been under pressure not to make any deal with Hamas. In September 2013, Abbas admitted that he was under pressure from the US and Israel not to achieve unity with Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Abbas-says-peace-with-Israel-will-be-brought-to-a-referendum-for-Palestinians-everywhere-325023 "Abbas says peace with Israel will be brought to a referendum for Palestinians ′everywhere′"]. Khaled abu Toameh, Jerusalem Post, 2 September 2013&lt;br /&gt;"Abbas said that he was under pressure from the US and Israel not to achieve unity with Hamas."&lt;/ref&gt; PLC council member for Hamas "Anwar Zaboun" said that both the US and EU maintain a veto on the reconciliation.&lt;ref name=BBC_Palestinian_split&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22902880 "Palestinian split: Views from Hamas and Fatah, six years on"] (see section "Anwar Zaboun"). BBC, 17 June 2013&lt;br /&gt;- "In terms of the reconciliation, I know there is a veto from the United States of America and the European Union. There is pressure."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an Israeli official declared that Israel would cut its ties with the PA if it brought Hamas into its government.&lt;ref name=jp_pm_must_choose /&gt; In reaction to the February 2012 Doha Agreement and the announcement of a unity caretaker government composed of non-affiliated technocrats (thus without Hamas members), Netanyahu reiterated that Abbas must choose between peace with Israel and peace with hamas, but that he had chosen "to abandon the path of peace and join with Hamas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-pa-president-must-choose-between-peace-with-israel-and-peace-with-hamas-1.411414 "Netanyahu: PA President Must Choose Between Peace With Israel and Peace With Hamas"]. Barak Ravid, ''Haaretz'', 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera_070212&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/02/20122610416298264.html "Abbas to head Palestinian unity government"]. Al Jazeera, 7 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; When Abbas ten days later openly declared that the next government would remain committed to all signed obligations and agreements, rather than silently let run a non-political technocrats government, Hamas was angered&lt;ref name=alarabiya-190212&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/19/195567.html "New Palestinian government will respect PLO accords, Abbas says"]. AFP/Al Arabiya, 19 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the unity government did not emerge.

The Jerusalem Fund, 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Israel nevertheless condemned the unity government, imposed sanctions on the new PA government and ended peace talks with Abbas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/02/palestinian-unity-government-sworn-in-fatah-hamas Palestinian unity government of Fatah and Hamas sworn in].

One of the effective means of pressure at times used by Israel is [[Taxation in the State of Palestine#The tax clearance system|withholding of taxes it collects on behalf of the PA]]. Israel collectively punished the Palestinians, for example, following the formation of the 2006 PA government and the successive [[Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007|2007 unity government]], following the May 2011 reconciliation agreement and after UN applications.&lt;ref name=alhaq_seizure_of_tax&gt;[http://www.alhaq.org/publications/publications-index?task=callelement&amp;format=raw&amp;item_id=111&amp;element=304e4493-dc32-44fa-8c5b-57c4d7b529c1&amp;method=download "Israel’s retaliatory seizure of tax"], pp. 10–11.

===2005 Cairo Declaration===
{{main|Palestinian Cairo Declaration}}
On 19 March 2005, twelve [[Palestinian faction]]s, including [[Fatah]], [[Hamas]], [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP)&lt;ref name=maannews/&gt; signed the Palestinian Cairo Declaration. The Declaration reaffirmed the status of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people&lt;ref name=maannews&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=197737 "PFLP and DFLP urge Abbas to preserve the Cairo declaration, honour the call for PLO reform"]. Ma'an News Agency, 20 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; through the participation in it of all forces and factions according to democratic principles. The Declaration implied a reform of the PLO by the inclusion in the PLO of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. It also called for unity of the Palestinian factions against the Israeli occupation and avoidance of further violent interactions between the Palestinian groups.

===2006 Prisoners' Document===
{{main|Palestinian Prisoners' Document}}
In May 2006, leaders of 5 Palestinian factions in an Israeli prison, including from Fatah and Hamas, signed a ''National Conciliation Document'', known as [[Palestinian Prisoners' Document|the Prisoners' Document]]. It was written with the intention to reconcile all factions and unite them in their struggle against the Israeli occupation and form a government of national unity. It envisioned an independent Palestinian state within the [[1967 borders]], with [[al-Quds al-Shareef]] as its capital. President Abbas immediately endorsed the Document, which implicitly recognizes Israel. He demanded, however, that Hamas explicitly approve it, threatening with a national referendum on the Document. Eventually, the political leadership of all factions endorsed a revised version of the Prisoners' Document. Hamas refused, however, to ''explicitly'' recognize Israel and to forswear armed resistance within the occupied territories. Israel quickly dismissed the Document because it did not explicitly recognize Israel.

On 11 September 2006, President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh reached a tentative agreement to form a government of national unity. They agreed that the new government should be based on the Prisoners' Document.&lt;ref name=icg_report_58&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Israel%20Palestine/58_the_arab_israeli_conflict___to_reach_a_lasting_peace.pdf "The Arab-Israeli Conflict: To Reach a Lasting Peace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413235627/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Israel%20Palestine/58_the_arab_israeli_conflict___to_reach_a_lasting_peace.pdf |date=2016-04-13 }}, p. 2–4 and p. 27 (Appendix D: "The Abbas-Haniya Accord").

AP, 11 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 September, the Palestinian daily [[Al-Ayyam (Ramallah)|''al-Ayyam'']] published the text of the draft-agreement, called "Program for a new government", consisting of 7 points.&lt;ref name=icg_report_58/&gt; The accord states that the government will "respect" the agreements signed by the PLO, and support plans based on the 2002 [[Arab Peace Initiative]]. In the Abbas–Haniyeh draft agreement, Hamas for the first time recognizes the peace agreements between the PLO and Israel.

When Abbas in a speech before the UN General Assembly on 21 September claimed that the program for a new government was strictly in line with the [[2006–07 economic sanctions against the Palestinian National Authority|Quartet conditions]] (commitment to the principles of nonviolence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations, including the [[Road map for peace|Roadmap]]),&lt;ref name=quartet_2006-01-30&gt;[https://www.un.org/news/dh/infocus/middle_east/quartet-30jan2006.htm "Quartet Statement London, 30 January 2006"]. un.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc_abbas_makes_pledge&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2006/s1746860.htm "Abbas makes Israel recognition pledge"]. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), 22 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; he drew, however, strong opposition from more radical members of Hamas. The next day, Haniyeh declared that he would not head a government that recognizes Israel, but he reiterated Hamas' readiness to establish a Palestinian state in the occupied territories and to honor a long-term truce with Israel.&lt;ref name=ap_pm_wont_recognize&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2006-09/22/content_695178.htm "Palestinian PM won't recognize Israel"].

AP, 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2006, Abbas unilaterally issued a call for early parliamentary and presidential elections, displeasing Hamas.

===February 2007 Mecca Agreement===
On 8 February 2007, Fatah and Hamas sign the [[Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement]], agreeing to stop the [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|military clashes]] in the Gaza Strip and the formation of a national unity government.

===March 2008 Sana'a Declaration===
On 23 March 2008, Hamas and Fatah sign the Sana'a Declaration that called for a return of the Gaza Strip to the pre-June 2007 situation. Disagreement about the interpretation immediately appeared. Fatah said that Hamas should relinquish its hold on Gaza first, while Hamas demanded the reinstatement of the Hamas-led unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sudam |first=Mohamed |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL23831120080323 |title=Fatah and Hamas sign reconciliation deal |publisher=Reuters |date= 23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2008, reconciliation talks due to be held in Cairo called off after Hamas announced a boycott in protest at the detention of hundreds of its members by President Abbas's security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/11/08/59723.html |title=Palestinian unity talks stall after Hamas boycott |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 talks===
At the end of February 2009, Hamas and Fatah start talks in Cairo after the Israeli assault on Gaza in [[Operation Cast Lead]] that began on 27 December 2008 and ended on 18 January 2009.

On 7 March 2009, [[Salam Fayyad]] submits his resignation as prime minister to pave the way for the formation of a national unity government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7929927.stm "Palestinian PM Fayyad steps down"]. BBC News, 7 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2009, the parties reportedly reach a compromise on the issue of the [[Palestinian Security Services]], and on 15 March on holding presidential and legislative elections by 25 January 2010.

On 17 March, problems appear on the terms of a national unity government. Fatah clings to adherence to the Quartet conditions, including recognition of Israel and focus on negotiations with Israel, while Hamas wants a majority in a new government and refuses to recognize Israel.&lt;ref name=ips_talks_failing&gt;[https://electronicintifada.net/content/palestinian-unity-talks-failing/8144 "Palestinian unity talks failing"].

===2010 talks===
In February 2010, the parties, among other Palestinian groups, held talks aimed at reconciling rival factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5giwpuS1Gkek1x2yUIEJtFAFUN4ag |title=Hamas, Fatah 'join Gaza reconciliation talks' |agency=AFP |date=February 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225042235/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5giwpuS1Gkek1x2yUIEJtFAFUN4ag |archivedate=February 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, representatives from Fatah and Hamas meet in Damascus.&lt;ref name=miftah_2012&gt;[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=23330&amp;CategoryId=4 "Fateh-Hamas Reconciliation Efforts"].

After six rounds of reconciliation talks that resulted in failure, in early September 2010, Cairo did put forward a new document. The document envisioned general elections to be held in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in the first half of 2010, a reform of Palestinian security services under the Egyptian supervision and the release of political prisoners by both factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20091002/156322997.html |title=Fatah, Hamas to sign reconciliation agreement Oct. 22 in Cairo|publisher=RIA Novosti |date=October 2, 2009|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Hamas and Fatah met in Damascus.&lt;ref name=miftah_2012/&gt;

===May 2011 Cairo Agreement===
On 27 April 2011, representatives of the two factions announced an agreement, mediated by [[Egypt]], to form a joint caretaker government, with presidential and legislative elections to be held in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/27/hamas-fatah-agree-government-deal |title=''Hamas and Fatah agree to form caretaker government'' |work=The Guardian |date=April 27, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 May 2011, at a ceremony in Cairo the agreement was formally signed by the Palestinian Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] and Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/05/04/world/middleeast/AP-ML-Palestinians-Reconciliation.html?hp "Fatah and Hamas Sign Reconciliation Pact"].

On Al Mubadara&lt;/ref&gt; It also permitted the entry of Hamas into the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and holding elections to its [[Palestine National Council]] decision-making body. The Palestinian Authority was to continue to handle security in the West Bank, and Hamas in Gaza Strip. They were aimed to form a joint security committee to decide on future security arrangements.

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called the accord "a mortal blow to peace and a big prize for terror."&lt;ref name=wash-1/&gt; Israel responded to the reconciliation with a punitive [[Taxation in the State of Palestine#The tax clearance system|withholding of PA taxes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/05/west-bank-palestinian-vulnerability-exposed-once-israel-withheld-money.html "WEST BANK: Palestinian vulnerability exposed as Israel withholds money"].

Barak Ravid, ''Haaretz'', 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The United States said that it would judge the new Palestinian government by its policies and that it would have to recognize Israel, accept previous agreements with it and renounce violence. Khaled Meshal said that Hamas was prepared to work with Fatah to guide both Palestinian diplomacy and "resistance in all its forms" and that Hamas shared the goal of establishing "a Palestinian state, independent and completely sovereign, on the lands of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital, Jerusalem, without a single settler, without conceding a single inch and without conceding the right of return" of Palestinian refugees to their former homes in Israel.&lt;ref name=wash-2&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/palestinian-factions-formally-sign-unity-accord/2011/05/04/AFD89MmF_story_1.html "Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas formally sign unity accord"], page 2. ''Washington Post'', 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the negotiations regarding the formation of a unity government were suspended because of disagreements over who the Prime Minister would be. Fatah insisted on keeping Salam Fayyad. Fayyad was unacceptable for Hamas, who wanted a PM from Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/06/12/152939.html "Crisis: Fatah wants Salam Fayyad as prime minister, Hamas rejects"].

Joel Greenberg, ''The Washington Post'', 12 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The two factions were also divided over how to deal with Israel. While Fatah favored peace with Israel, Hamas rejected international demands to renounce violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/hamas-fatah-meeting-canceled-in-major-setback-to-palestinian-unity-1.368526 "Hamas-Fatah Meeting Canceled, in Major Setback to Palestinian Unity"]. The Associated Press, 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After the talks were indefinitely postponed, President Abbas focused on a bid for UN recognition for Palestinian statehood in September 2011 instead of forming a unity government. The decision was triggered by the break down of the Israeli–Palestinian peace talks after Netanyahu's refusal to renew a partial freeze on settlement construction in September 2010, and also by Israel's opposition to the Fatah–Hamas deal itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/8600134/Mahmoud-Abbas-signals-intent-to-bid-for-UN-recognition-for-Palestinian-statehood.html "Mahmoud Abbas signals intent to bid for UN recognition for Palestinian statehood"]. ''Telegraph'', 26 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2011, President Abbas expressed his concern over a unity government because of the international opposition, particularly from the US, against a government with any Hamas involvement. He suggested that such a government might be put off at all ahead of a UN vote on statehood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvnews.ca/abbas-might-delay-palestinian-unity-government-1.664384 "Abbas might delay Palestinian unity government"].

===February 2012 Doha Agreement===
{{main|Hamas–Fatah Doha agreement}}
The Doha deal, signed by Mahmoud Abbas and Khaled Mashal in February 2012, was described as a step forward in the stalled implementation of the Palestinian reconciliation agreement, signed in Cairo in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/19/195567.html |title=New Palestinian government will respect PLO accords, Abbas says |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Abbas stated that there were no political differences between Hamas and Fatah as they had reached agreement on a joint political platform and on a truce with Israel. Commenting on relations with Hamas, Abbas revealed in an interview with Al-Jazeera that "We agreed that the period of calm would be not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in the West Bank," adding that "We also agreed on a peaceful popular resistance [against Israel], the establishment of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders and that the peace talks would continue if Israel halted settlement construction and accepted our conditions."&lt;ref name=ATKJpost&gt;{{cite news|last=Abu Toameh|first=Khaled|title='No political differences between Fatah, Hamas'|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=260473|accessdate=2013-02-14|newspaper=Jerusalem post|date=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBZToI&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Zion|first=Ilan|title=Abbas: ‘Hamas wants Palestinian state with ’67 borders’|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-hamas-wants-palestinian-state-with-67-borders/|accessdate=2013-02-14|newspaper=Times of Israel|date=2012-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Government's work did not make progress, also troubled by massive Israeli raids in the West Bank following the [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers#Week 1 (12–19 June)|kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenager settlers]], and the subsequent major attacks on Gaza during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the parties signed an additional agreement in Cairo on 25 September 2014. This agreement specified the tasks and responsibilities of the new Government.

===2016 talks===
In December 2015 and January 2016 Hamas and Fatah secretly held Qatar-brokered talks in [[Doha]] to try and complement the 2014 agreement.&lt;ref name="almonitor27may"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Melhem|first1=Ahmad|title=Switzerland gets active on Palestinian reconciliation|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/05/switzerland-palestine-gaza-reconciliation-hamas-fatah.html|accessdate=17 June 2016|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks were renewed on 7-8 February. In this round of negotiations Egypt was not involved. Hamas issued a brief statement on 8 February, saying both parties reached a practical vision of a solution to be discussed and implemented. Fatah leader [[Abdullah Abdullah]] said a solution must force Hamas to cede the Gaza Strip and on 23 February, Fatah political figure [[Jibril Rajoub]] made a statement about not allowing Hamas to continue to "seize" the Gaza Strip. Hamas spokesman [[Sami Abu Zuhri]] criticized Rajoub's statement, saying it raises tensions and do not serve the reconciliation.&lt;ref name="almonitor1mar"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abu Amer|first1=Adnan|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|title=Another Hamas-Fatah reconciliation agreement bites the dust|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2016/03/palestinian-reconciliation-hamas-fatah-qatar-meeting.html#|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajoub's statements provoked condemnation from Palestinian factions, including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, all of which labeled it as detrimental to reconciliation.&lt;ref name="almonitor14march"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abu Amer|first1=Adnan |title=Will Hamas lose Gaza?|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/fatah-threats-retake-gaza-hamas-by-force.html#|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=[[Al-Monitor]]|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas demands Fatah's recognition of the events in 2007 and the salary crisis for government employees in Gaza.&lt;ref name=almonitor1mar/&gt;

[[Yousef Rizqa]], the former minister of information in the previous Hamas government, told Al-Monitor, "The future of the Doha reconciliation talks does not seem positive and we cannot build [a position] upon them in light of the internal Fatah disputes over whether or not to aim for a reconciliation. It seemed to me that the meetings did not offer convincing solutions for fundamental issues, such as the future of the [government] employees in Gaza who have not been paid since 2006 or the Rafah crossing, which is constantly being closed. In addition, Egypt has not given Fatah the green light to complete reconciliation with Hamas, because it seems Cairo will not accept Qatar’s success in a matter in which Egypt has failed."{{cn|date=June 2017}}

A Qatari official told [[Al-Monitor]] that "Fatah and Hamas agreed not to speak to the media about the details of the reconciliation and avoid statements that could cause tension, in light of past experiences that had previously impeded reconciliation because of statements issued here and there."&lt;ref name="almonitor1mar" /&gt;

Following the talks Fatah officials have threatened to retake Gaza by force. Hamas affiliated website, the [[Palestinian Information Center]] reported on 25 February that Fatah plan to retake Gaza with force by inciting an Israeli military operation and convincing Egypt to destroy the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels|tunnels between the Gaza Strip and Egypt]] to further isolate the Gaza Strip and limit its military abilities which rely in foreign aid.&lt;ref name=almonitor14march /&gt;

In two visits of Paul Garnier, [[Switzerland]] ambassador to the Palestinian Authority, visited [[Ismail Haniyeh]] and on 10 May confirmed Switzerland's intention to broker a conference on reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. Switzerland was trying to find ways to solve the Gaza government employees crisis.&lt;ref name=almonitor27may /&gt;

===2017 agreement===
{{Main|2017 Fatah–Hamas Agreement}}
On 12 October 2017, the Fatah–Hamas Agreement, organised under pressure from [[Qatar]], the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] and [[Egypt]], was signed in [[Cairo]]. In the agreement, it is stipulated that Hamas gives Fatah full civilian control of the Gaza Strip, and in return, Gaza's economic blockade would be eased. In the last few months, Hamas has been under heavy pressure by the PA. Punitive measures included cutting the salaries of PA employees living in Gaza and reducing the electricity supply to the Gaza Strip, which already suffers from an [[Gaza electricity crisis|electricity crisis]] due to the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|Israeli blockade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41591450 |title=Palestinian factions end split on Gaza|date=2017-10-12|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/hamas-fatah-sign-reconciliation-agreement-cairo-171012115017367.html|title=Hamas, Fatah sign reconciliation agreement in Cairo|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,000 Palestinian Authority police officers will be placed in the enclave.&lt;ref name="“veconomist”2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730026-latest-effort-likely-fail-palestinians-try-reconcile|title=The Palestinians try to reconcile|author=|date=5 October 2017|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the PA delegation [[Azzam al-Ahmad]] said that the [[Rafah Border Crossing|Rafah border crossing]] between Egypt and Gaza would be operated by the [[Palestinian Presidential Guard|presidential guards]] of PA President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] by November 1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4845">The '''Franz Werfel Human Rights Award''' ({{lang-de|Franz-Werfel-Menschenrechtspreis}}) is a [[human rights]] award of the German [[Federation of Expellees]]' [[Centre Against Expulsions]] project. It is awarded to individuals or groups in [[Europe]] who, through political, artistic, philosophical or practical work, have opposed breaches of human rights by [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], and the deliberate destruction of national, ethnic, racial or religious groups.

==The prize==

The foundations of the prize are considered to be the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Fourth Hague Convention]] of 1907, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] of 1948, the International Agreement on Civilian and Political Rights of 1966, the resolution of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] of 1998 as well as the consequences of the meeting of the European Council of the Heads of State and Governments in Copenhagen of 1993 and other statements issued by the [[European Union]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} 

The award is named after the famous Austrian author [[Franz Werfel]] (1890–1945), whose novel ''[[The Forty Days of Musa Dagh]]'' famously portrayed the displacement of the [[Armenians]] from [[Turkey]] and the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] of the Armenians in 1915/16.

The '''German African Party''' (in German: ''Deutsche Afrikanische Partei'') was a small anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[political party]] which existed in [[South West Africa]] (currently [[Namibia]]) from the 1930s through the 1950s.

The German African Party was created on February 8, 1939 by Martin Maier as a result of political tensions within a rightist conservative party named ''Deutscher Südwest-Bund (DSWB)'' (or “German Southwest Union”), currently disappeared as well. Like the German [[Nazi Party]] ''(National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei -NSDAP-'', or “National-Socialist Party of the German Workers”), all of these parties were overtly racist, as they only accepted members with German ancestry.

The original Grizzly fired 1 shot then broke&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt; Grizzly 2.0 fired 14 bullets before getting damaged due to the strain.&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt; According to the [[Daily Mail]], the Grizzly 2.0 performed so well that the inventor "Matthew" was able to put it to his shoulder and shot off three rounds with the rifle pressed against his cheek without hurting him.&lt;ref name="Gun-advocates-expect-flood-3D-printed-guns-result-U-S-law-changes--Canadian-designed-plastic-rifle-successfully-fires-14-rounds 2013"/&gt;

==Specification==
The “Grizzly 2.0″ has 50 percent larger barrel with a rifled bore, a larger receiver and new hammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/08/05/3d-printed-rifle-shoots-14-rounds-before-breaking/ 3D-Printed Rifle Shoots 14 Rounds Before Breaking], The Blaze, August 5, 2013. ([https://www.webcitation.org/6SXi40h4V archive])&lt;/ref&gt; In a video posted online by the creator, the Grizzly seemed to have successfully fired a Winchester Dynapoint .22-caliber bullet, like the [[Liberator (gun)|Liberator .380]]. The only metal in the Grizzly is a 1-inch roofing nail plus whatever metal is in the cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2013/07/25/3d-printed-rifle/ World's Possibly First 3D-Printed Rifle Is Fired on YouTube], Mashable, August 2013.

==Printer==
The printer used to make the rifle was a [[Stratasys]] Dimension 1200es printer&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt; costing $10,000 as of August 2013.&lt;ref name="Gun-advocates-expect-flood-3D-printed-guns-result-U-S-law-changes--Canadian-designed-plastic-rifle-successfully-fires-14-rounds 2013"/&gt; It was made using [[ABS plastic]].&lt;ref name="theverge.com"/&gt;

"Matthew" said the rifle had taken 3 days to build, and about 27 hours to print it. He revealed it took him 13 hours to print the receiver, 6.5 hours to print the barrel, 5 hours to print the stock and 2 hours to print the rifle's internal parts.&lt;ref name="nbcnews.com"/&gt;

'''Hayazn''' ({{lang-hy|Հայազն}}) is an [[Armenia]]n nationalist political party, that was founded as a civil organization in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=hy:««ՀԱՅԱԶՆ» ԵՐԻՏԱՍԱՐԴՆԵՐԻ ՄԻԱԲԱՆՈՒԹՅՈՒՆ » ՀԿ|url=https://www.e-register.am/am/companies/211115|publisher=Electronic Register, Government of the Republic of Armenia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617044452/https://www.e-register.am/am/companies/211115|archivedate=17 June 2014|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It declared itself a political party in 2013 and was registered as such in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=hy:««ՀԱՅԱԶՆ»» ԿՍ|url=https://www.e-register.am/am/companies/967390|publisher=Electronic Register, Government of the Republic of Armenia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617044548/https://www.e-register.am/am/companies/967390|archivedate=17 June 2014|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Hayazn had stated its opposition to Armenia's possible integration into the [[European Union]] or to the [[Eurasian Customs Union]] that included at the time a customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia]].&lt;ref name="arminfo"/&gt; Hayazn had also called on the Armenian government to opt out of the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Հայազն". Հայաստանը պետք է դադարեցնի մասնակցությունը Եվրոպական միության "հարևանության" ծրագրին ''(Hayazn: Armenia should stop the participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy)''|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/arm/news/135851/|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=5 December 2012|agency=''[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]''|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayazn also opposes any official recognition by Armenia of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. Instead Hayazn supports the actual unification of the Nagorno-Karabakh areas as an integral part of the Republic of Armenia, turning Karabakh into an additional Armenian province within the borders of an expanded Armenian Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Հայազն".

Hayazn also advocates in case of a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, to "liberate" historical Armenian provinces of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Gandzak]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhitchevan]], presently within the territorial areas of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=lragir/&gt;

In internal affairs, Hayazn is opposed to [[Serzh Sargsyan]]'s government and has condemned its internal and foreign policies, in particular the way it handles the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within the [[OSCE Minsk Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Հայազն" միություն.

==Activities==
Although Hayazn was not registered as a political party, and couldn't legally participate in the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]], but nonetheless it refused to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Հայազն" միությունն ընտրություններին մասնակցելու իմաստ չի տեսնում ''(Hayazn Union sees no point in participating in the parliamentary election)''|url=http://hayeli.am/%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%A1%D5%A6%D5%B6-%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%A9%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%B6-%D5%A8%D5%B6%D5%BF%D6%80%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%A9%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%B6%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%AB/|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=28 March 2012|agency=''Hayeli''|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It blamed mainstream opposition parties ([[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]], [[Armenian National Congress]], [[Heritage (Armenia)|Heritage]]) for not being "pro-people", and the government for electoral fraud which resulted in the formation of, what they call, an illegitimate government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Հայաստանում ԱԺ ընտրություններն անցել են ընտրակեղծիքներով.

In June 2011, the union started to collect signatures for the citizenship of [[Jirair Sefilian]], a Lebanese-born Armenian military commander of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. More than 4,000 signatures were gathered.&lt;ref name="sefilian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hayazn collects signatures to back up Zhirayr Sefilyan’s bid for Armenian citizenship|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/72514/Hayazn_collects_signatures_to_back_up_Zhirayr_Sefilyans_bid_for_Armenian_citizenship|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=15 June 2011|agency=''[[PanARMENIAN.Net]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship with Sefilian deteriorated, when on September 2, 2013 Hayazn members reportedly attacked and beat-up Varuszhan Avetisyan, the press secretary and member of the [[Pre-Parliament (Armenia)|Pre-Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Առավոտ Նախախորհրդարան"&gt;[http://www.aravot.am/2013/09/03/282806 Ըստ «Նախախորհրդարանի»՝ «Հայազն» կուսակցության անդամները հարձակվել են իրենց մամուլի խոսնակի վրա]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2012, Hayazn organized a protest during which several of its members burnt the [[Hungarian flag]] as an act of protest against [[Ramil Safarov]]'s release to Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungarian flag burned|url=http://www.a1plus.am/en/politics/2012/09/01/drosh|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=1 September 2012|agency=''[[A1plus]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also demanded the resignation of the Foreign Minister [[Eduard Nalbandyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hayazn Union demands immediate resignation of Armenian Foreign Minister|url=http://www.arminfo.info/index.cfm?objectid=9F51E880-F428-11E1-9CECF6327207157C|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=1 September 2012|agency=''Arminfo''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Citizens’ Fury Won’t Stop.

On May 21, 2012 Hayazn organized a parallel march in opposition to the first of its kind "Diversity march" organized by the [[LGBT]] community of Armenia. The march was stopped prematurely, because LGBT activists were afraid of their safety.&lt;ref name="hra.am"&gt;[http://www.hra.am/hy/point-of-view/2012/05/22/bazmazanutyun Բռնության սպառնալիքների պատճառով «Բազմազանության շաբաթը» չի կայանա]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, 2012, Hayazn organized a protest in front of [[Germany]]'s embassy in Yerevan by the union against the presentation of the film ''[[The Parade (film)|The Parade]]'' about gay activism in Serbia. The union stated that they would not tolerate "propaganda of immorality".&lt;ref name="panorama.am"&gt;{{cite news|title=Հայազն միություն.

Throughout spring 2013, Hayazn was a vocal opponent of leasing land in [[Syunik Province]] for Iranian pastures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest Demonstration Under "No Persian Sheep in Syunyats Gorge" Slogan|url=http://www.ecolur.org/en/news/dialog-with-officials/protest-demonstration-under-vno-persian-sheep-in-syunyats-gorgev-slogan/4575/|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=14 February 2013|agency=Ecolur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayazn took an active role in the [[2013 Armenian protests|anti-government protests throughout 2013]]. On December 2, 2013 along with several political parties, they took to the streets to protest Russia's president [[Vladimir Putin]]'s visit to Armenia and Serzh Sargsyan's decision to join the [[Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia]].&lt;ref name="arminfo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Avanesov|first=Alexandr|title=Armenian opposition to welcome Russian president with protests|url=http://www.arminfo.info/index.cfm?objectid=9C005840-5B26-11E3-9A420EB7C0D21663|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=ArmInfo|date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Temple''' in Independence, Missouri, is a house of worship and education "dedicated to the pursuit of peace".&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]], Section 156:5&lt;/ref&gt; It dominates the skyline of [[Independence, Missouri]], [[United States|USA]], and has become the focal point of the headquarters of the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20010422055040/http://cofchrist.org/news/q_and_a-churchname.asp Questions and Answers on Church Name Change]&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[temple]] was built by the [[Community of Christ]] in response to a "revelation" presented to their 1984 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] by church prophet-president [[Wallace B. Smith]]. The revelation culminated instructions shared over the course of more than 150 years by prior prophet-presidents recognized by the Community of Christ. [[Groundbreaking]] for the temple took place Friday 6 April 1990, and the completed structure was dedicated on Sunday 17 April 1994.

==Structure and building==
[[File:TempleSpireCoC.jpg|right|frame|Looking up the spire from the sanctuary of the temple.]] The temple was designed by [[Gyo Obata]] and evokes the spiral shell of the [[Chambered Nautilus|Nautilus]] with a [[stainless steel]] [[spire]] that rises {{convert|300|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;Chiat, Marilyn; ''North American Churches,'' Publications International, Ltd.:2004, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The facility displays art which comprises a collection of modern and traditional religious art from around the world. The entry to the sanctuary is through a beautifully etched glass archway depicting the Sacred Grove where [[Joseph Smith]] had his initial revelatory experience. This leads to the gently ascending worshiper's path of textured stone which spirals around its periphery.  Along the path are artworks and a fountain symbolizing the "living water" of [[Gospel of John|John]] 4:10 for meditative focus.  The temple's main sanctuary has seating for approximately 1,600.  It houses a [[Casavant Frères|Casavant]] [[pipe organ]] with 60 stops, 102 ranks, and 5685 pipes.  At the exit foyer in the mouth of the spiral, "The Field is White, Already to Harvest" (see John: 4:35) is a large stained glass wall depicting rice and wheat, that earned an American Institute of Architects award for religious art. Adjacent are the massive bronze exit doors which carry the church seal depicting the peaceful lion, lamb, and child from [[Isaiah]] 11:6 and the word "PEACE".  The wide steps open up onto a world plaza with global map of inlaid brick.

The public is welcomed to the temple, where there is a [[Daily Prayer for Peace]] at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central Time on behalf of a selected nation of the world.  A meditation chapel with paintings by Jack Garnier  of the Sacraments being performed around the world opens onto a Japanese style meditation garden and serves the needs of individuals or small groups of visitors.  The temple also contains the church archives, the Temple School, administrative offices of church headquarters, theaters used for visitors and also for meetings, presentations, and classes, a museum and gift shop.  The building has become a popular attraction with guided tours available.  Approximately 60,000 people visit the temple each year.

==Temple ministries==
[[File:Independence - RLDS Temple 01.jpg|left|thumb|The Temple as seen from the [[Temple Lot]].]]
The temple is regarded as a symbol of the church's mission and has long been closely associated with the denomination's developing theology of Zion, or the peaceable Kingdom of God, first advocated as [[basileia tou theou]] by [[Jesus Christ]]. The first major event held at the Temple prior to its dedication, was the International Women's Conference in June 1993.  The Temple has no private ceremonies and is open to everyone. The sacraments performed there are Communion, Administration to the Sick (Laying on of Hands), and Ordination.  Initially, six temple ministries centers were created in response to the building of the Temple. The temple according to Ken Robinson, former member of the First Presidency,"gives form to our commitment to Jesus Christ" and that it "is at the center of meaning and identity for members of the Community of Christ" &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Kenneth N., "A People of the Temple," The Herald, July 2006, p. 12. {{cite web |url=http://www.cofchrist.org/SharePeace/Jul06/Robinson-People-of-Temple.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070929094215/http://www.cofchrist.org/SharePeace/Jul06/Robinson-People-of-Temple.asp |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wallace B. Smith|Wallace B. Smith's]] great-grandfather and founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], visited [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] in 1831 and prophesied that a temple to the Lord would be built there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] (Community of Christ), Section 57:1d&lt;/ref&gt; The early Latter Day Saints purchased a {{convert|73|acre|ha}} parcel of land known as the "greater [[Temple Lot|temple lot]]."  At that time a portion of the property was dedicated as the site for a temple, and cornerstones were laid{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. However, the church members were driven from the county before any construction began.  The original temple site proper is now owned by the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]].

The Community of Christ's temple is built on the greater temple lot, as is the [[Auditorium (Community of Christ)|Auditorium]], the headquarters chapel of the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] and a visitor center from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

The Community of Christ also owns the [[Kirtland Temple|temple]] in [[Kirtland, Ohio]], the first temple actually built (rather than merely planned) by the Latter Day Saint movement, which continues to be a place of worship and education. As part of its educational ministry that site is open as a [[National Historic Landmark]].

The '''International Solar Alliance''' ('''ISA''') is an alliance of more than 121 countries initiated by [[India]], most of them being '''sunshine countries''', which lie either completely or partly between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The primary objective of the alliance is to work for efficient exploitation of [[solar energy]] to reduce dependence on [[fossil fuel]]s. This initiative was first proposed by [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] in a speech in November 2015 at [[Wembley Stadium]], in which he referred to sunshine countries as ''Suryaputra'' ("Sons of the Sun").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Narendra Modi's Speech at Wembley Stadium: As It Happened|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/11/13/live-blog-narendra-modis-speech-at-the-wembley-stadium/|website =Wall Street Journal|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The alliance is a [[treaty]]-based [[inter-governmental organization]]. Countries that do not fall within the Tropics can join the alliance and enjoy all benefits as other members, with the exception of voting rights.&lt;ref name = "BS1"/&gt;

The initiative was launched by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] at the [[India–Africa Forum Summit|India Africa Summit]], and a meeting of member countries ahead of the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=PM Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande to launch game changing solar alliance|url=http://economictimes.com/industry/energy/power/pm-narendra-modi-and-french-president-francois-hollande-to-launch-game-changing-solar-alliance/articleshow/49975568.cms|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=France, India to launch global solar alliance|url=http://reuters.com/article/idINKBN0TI0QR20151129?irpc=932|agency=Reuters|date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance opened for signatures in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]] in November 2016, and 121 countries have joined.

==Headquarters==
It is headquartered in India.&lt;ref name="et-16nov16"/&gt; In January 2016, [[Narendra Modi]], and the then [[President of France|French President]] [[François Hollande]] jointly laid the foundation stone of the ISA Headquarters and inaugurated the interim Secretariat at the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) in [[Gwal Pahari]], [[Gurugram]], [[India]]. The Indian government has dedicated five acres of land on the NISE campus for its future headquarters; it also has contributed {{INRConvert|1.75|b}} to the fund to build a campus and for meeting expenditures for the first five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=International Solar Alliance will be the First International and Inter-Governmental Organisation of 121 Countries to have Headquarters in India with United Nations as Strategic Partner|url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=135794|publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[National Informatics Centre]], Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance is also called International Agency for Solar Policy and Application (IASPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reports: India to announce global solar power alliance|url = http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2431974/reports-india-to-announce-global-solar-power-alliance|website = www.businessgreen.com|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The focus is on solar power utilization. The launching of such an alliance in Paris also sends a strong signal to the global communities about the sincerity of the developing nations towards their concern about climate change and to switch to a low-carbon growth path. India has pledged a target of installing 100GW by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity by 33–35% by 2030 to let solar energy reach to the most unconnected villages and communities and also towards creating a clean planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 107 'sunshine countries' could weld together ahead of Paris meet to give shape to PM's vision – The Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/107-sunshine-countries-could-weld-together-ahead-of-Paris-meet-to-give-shape-to-PMs-vision/articleshow/48796738.cms|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's pledge to the Paris summit offered to bring 40% of its electricity generation capacity (not actual production) from non-fossil sources (renewable, large hydro, and nuclear) by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = India unveils global solar alliance of 120 countries at Paris climate summit|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/india-set-to-unveil-global-solar-alliance-of-120-countries-at-paris-climate-summit|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-01|first = Arthur|last = Neslen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
it is based on world co operation.

==Geographical importance==
The area of Earth located in between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]] is called the tropical (torrid) zone. The points on the Tropic of Cancer are the northernmost points up to which the Sun can pass directly overhead. Similarly, the southernmost points are on the Tropic of Capricorn which follow the same criteria. Location at the north of the Tropic of Cancer shows the Sun appearing at the south of the zenith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the significance of the Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle?

On its first day (15 November), sixteen countries signed the Agreement: [[India]], [[Brazil]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Dominican Republic]], the [[Republic of Guinea]], [[Mali]]; [[Nauru]]; [[Niger]]; [[Tanzania]]; [[Tuvalu]]; [[Cambodia]]; [[Ethiopia]]; [[Burkina Faso]]; [[Bangladesh]] and [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name="et-16nov16"/&gt; By 17 November, Guinea Bissau, Fiji, France,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isolaralliance.org/countries_2.html|title=Allied Countries|website=isolaralliance.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On November 6, 2017 India ' s External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj held a meeting with Guinea’s Foreign Minister, Mamady Toure. During the course of this meeting, Mamady Toure handed over Guinea’s Instrument of Accession to the India-initiated International Solar Alliance (ISA).
Vanuatu and Liberia also signed the agreement.&lt;ref name = "BS1"&gt;{{cite web|title=19 countries sign up for solar alliance|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/19-countries-sign-up-for-solar-alliance-116111701463_1.html|website=Business Standard India|accessdate=14 April 2017|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, an additional 107 countries joined the agreement, including all major countries that lie between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, including [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], Argentina, Paraguay, [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[China]]. A conclave started from 30 November 2015 for the sunshine grouping, called the InSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy &amp; Application).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 107 countries to join PM and his sunshine band in November – The Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/107-countries-to-join-PM-and-his-sunshine-band-in-November/articleshow/48794733.cms|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these there are 55 other members, making a total of 121 members to the alliance.

== Initiatives and partnerships ==
The alliance has partnered with [[World Bank]] to launch Global Solar Atlas at an ISA event at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi. Global Solar Atlas is a free online tool that displays annual average solar power potential at any location in the world and thus identify potential sites for solar power generation. World Bank announced "This tool will help governments save millions of dollars on their own research and provide investors and solar developers with an easily accessible and uniform platform to compare resource potential between sites in one region or across multiple countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/01/17/new-world-bank-tool-helps-map-solar-potential|title=New World Bank Tool Helps Map Solar Potential|work=World Bank|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riccardo Puliti, Senior Director and Head of the World Bank’s Energy &amp; Extractives Global Practice said ''“The World Bank is seeing a surge of interest from our clients in solar power as a result of the dramatic cost decreases over the past few years. We hope that the Global Solar Atlas will help inform the crucial planning and investment decisions that will need to be taken over the next decade to shift to more sustainable forms of energy.”'' Piyush Goyal, Power Minister of India said ''“This new tool will assist governments and investors to obtain an initial indication of solar resource potential before carrying out their own more detailed analysis.”''

== Future targets ==
India, with the support of France, has invited nations to facilitate infrastructure for implementation of solar projects. The alliance has been committed $1 tn as investment, and it is committed to making the costs of solar power more affordable for remote and inaccessible communities. The alliance will endorse India in achieving its goal of generating 100GW of solar energy and 175GW of renewable energy by 2022. The countries shall support each other in research and development as well as other high level activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 107 &amp;#039;sunshine countries&amp;#039; may shape PM&amp;#039;s vision|url = http://liveindia.in/107-sunshine-countries-may-shape-pms-vision|website = Live India|accessdate = 2015-11-30|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208071012/http://liveindia.in/107-sunshine-countries-may-shape-pms-vision|archivedate = 8 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also seen as an alliance by the developing countries to form a united front and to undertake research and development for making solar power equipment within developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Paris climate meet: India-led global solar alliance to counter developed nations|url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/paris-climate-meet-indialed-global-solar-alliance-to-counter-developed-nations/article7916353.ece|website = The Hindu Business Line|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progress==
On June 30, 2016, the alliance entered into an understanding with the [[World Bank]] for accelerating mobilization of finance for solar energy. The Bank will have a major role in mobilizing more than US $1000 billion in investments that will be needed by 2030, to meet ISA’s goals for the massive deployment of affordable solar energy.&lt;ref name="pib-30-6-16"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=146680 | title=International Solar Alliance Cell and World Bank Signs Declaration for Promoting Solar Energy | publisher=Press Information Bureau, Govt. of India | date=30 June 2016 | accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Till date 48 countries have signed and 26 countries have ratified the Framework Agreement of the ISA. With ratifications by 15 countries, the ISA will become a treaty based inter-governmental international organisation and it will be recognized by UN legally to become fully functionable.

At the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) held in Abu Dhabi in January 2018, the government of India announced the establishment of a $350 million solar development fund to enable financing of solar projects.

'''LGBT rights under communism''' have evolved radically throughout history. In the 20th century, Marxist states and parties varied on LGBT rights, with some being among the first political parties to support LGBT rights, while others maintained anti-LGBT views. In the 21st century, communist parties in the [[Western world|West]] are generally pro-LGBT rights.

==History==

===Marxism===

==== Early history ====
Communist leaders and intellectuals took many different positions on LGBT-rights issues. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] said very little on the subject in their published works. Marx in particular commented rarely on sexuality in general. Norman Markowitz, writing for politicalaffairs.net, writes that: "Here, to be frank, one finds from Marx a refusal to entertain the subject, and from Engels open hostility to the individuals involved."&lt;ref name=Markowitz&gt;{{cite web |last1=Markowitz |first1=Norman |title=The Communist movement and gay rights: The hidden history |url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history/ |website=politicalaffairs.net |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=6 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816143523/http://politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history |archivedate=16 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because, in private, Engels criticized male homosexuality and related it to [[pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]],&lt;ref name=igor&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sexual Revolution in Russia: From the Age of the Czars to Today |pages=52–53 |author=[[Igor Kon]] |publisher=Simon and Schuster |date=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "[the ancient Greeks] fell into the abominable practice of sodomy [original German ''{{lang|de|Knabenliebe}}'', meaning "boylove" or [[pederasty]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and degraded alike their gods and themselves with the myth of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Angus |first1=Ian |last2=Riddell |first2=John |title=Engels and homosexuality |url=http://isreview.org/issue/70/engels-and-homosexuality |accessdate=4 April 2016 |work=International Socialist Review |issue=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also said that the pro-pederast movement "cannot fail to triumph. ''{{lang|fr|Guerre aux cons, paix aus trous-de-cul}}'' [war on the cunts, peace to the arse-holes] will now be the slogan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1869/letters/69_06_22.htm |title=Letters: Marx–Engels Correspondence 1869 |author=[[Friedrich Engels]] |date=22 June 1869 |work=anu.edu.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025853/https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1869/letters/69_06_22.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also referred to [[Karl Boruttau]] as a ''{{lang|de|Schwanzschwulen}}'' ([[faggot (slang)|faggot]]ty prick) in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ireland |first1=Doug |title=Socialism and Gay Liberation: Back to the Future |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue46/Ireland46.htm |work=NewPolitics |volume=XII |issue=2 |accessdate=19 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]]'' volume two is unequivocal on Marx and Engels view of homosexuality, stating that, "There can be little doubt that, as far as they thought of the matter at all, Marx and Engels were personally [[homophobia|homo-phobic]], as shown by an acerbic 1869 exchange of letter on Jean-Baptiste von Schweitzer, a German socialist rival. Schweitzer had been arrested in a park on a morals charge and not only did Marx and Engels refuse to join a committee defending him, they resorted to the cheapest form of bathroom humor in their private comments about the affair."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Homosexuality"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', Volume 2 - Marxism&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Germany]], during the [[Weimar Republic]], joined with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] in support of efforts to legalize private homosexual relations between consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Storer |first1=Colin |date=28 May 2013|publisher=I.

In the early [[Soviet Union]] the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] abolished all oppressive Czarist laws in 1917 related to sexuality. In 1917 the Soviet government also decriminalised homosexuality, and the subsequent Soviet criminal code in the 1920s did not criminalize non-commercial same-sex sexuality between consenting adults in private.  It also provided for no-fault [[divorce]] and legalized [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazard, John N. ''Unity and Diversity in Socialist Law''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside the [[Russian SSR]] and [[Ukrainian SSR]], homosexuality remained a criminal offense in certain Soviet republics in the 1920s (particularly the [[Muslim]]-dominated [[Soviet Central Asia|Soviet Republics in Central Asia]]) and Soviet policy was often inconsistent in terms of pursuing homosexual rights and wider legal/social equality for homosexual people. Official Soviet policy on homosexuality in the 1920s also fluctuated: between legal and social tolerance of homosexuals and homosexuality to state attempts to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder.

In 1933, [[Joseph Stalin]] added Article 121 to the entire Soviet Union criminal code, which made male homosexuality a crime punishable by up to five years in prison with [[penal labour|hard labor]].  The precise reason for Article 121 is in some dispute among historians.  The few official government statements made about the law tended to confuse homosexuality with [[pedophilia]] and was tied up with a belief that homosexuality was practiced only among fascists or the aristocracy.

The law remained intact until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was repealed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ad788c.html |title=Russia: Update to RUS13194 of 16 February 1993 on the treatment of homosexuals |author=[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] |work=Refworld |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savanne.ch/tusovka/en/pilot/homosexuality-russia.html |title=Anne Buetikofer — Homosexuality in the Soviet Union and in today's Russia |publisher=Savanne.ch |date=1999-04-11 |accessdate=2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[RT (TV network)|RT]]'', the law against homosexuality led to "several hundred people [being] charged with it every year" and it "was also a convenient tool for smears and was tacked onto spying allegations during the NKVD purges".&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay rights in Russia: Facts and Myths |url=http://rt.com/news/russia-gay-law-myths-951/ |accessdate=9 March 2015 |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gay men and communist party membership ====
Gay men were sometimes denied membership or expelled from communist parties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/54160.html|title=Doug Ireland: Turns out Norman Thomas's Socialist Party Came Close to Breaking the Gay Taboo in 1952|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701195402/http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/54160.html|archivedate=1 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the globe during the 20th Century, as most communist parties followed the social precedents set by the [[USSR]]. However, this was not the case in the [[West]].

Notable gay members of Communist parties include:
* [[Mark Ashton]] (founder of [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]]{{sfn|Kelliher|2014}} and [[LGBT rights]] advocate) – member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]].{{sfn|Skeates|2007}}

==== Association of communism with homosexuality by anti-communists ====
The phrase {{visible anchor|'''sexual Bolshevism'''}} originated in Weimar Germany in the 1920s by Pastor Ludwig Hoppe of Berlin as a more general term of approbation at licentiousness.&lt;ref name=Weindling&gt;Weindling, Paul.

==== Association of fascism with homosexuality by communists ====
In the early 1920s western communist party leaders propagated the view that the increase in homosexuality and the open discussion of homosexuality were caused by capitalism "in its death throes". In their view, homosexuality would vanish.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Homosexuality"/&gt;

After Hitler's seizure of power (the ''{{lang|de|[[Machtergreifung]]}}''), Marxist intellectuals correlated fascism with homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Homosexuality"/&gt; Soviet writer [[Maxim Gorky]] remarked, "Exterminate all homosexuals and fascism will vanish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newpol.org/content/socialism-and-homosexuality |title=Socialism and homosexuality |author=Thomas Harrison |work=New Politics |date=Winter 2009 |volume=XII-2 |issue=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Events leading to the association of communism with homosexuality ====

The advance of doctors, [[psychologist]]s and social workers into the arena of human [[sexuality]] during the Weimar era (as well as the [[feminist]] movement) threw up a variety of [[conspiracy theories]], especially amongst more [[conservative]] aspects of society, regarding communism and homosexuality. Any form of [[sexual revolution]] was derided as promiscuity and leading to a rise in sexually transmitted infections. The response of those who opposed "sexual Bolshevism" was to promote [[eugenics]] and [[family values]].&lt;ref name="Weindling"/&gt;

There are specific events which [[glbtq.com]] ("an encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer culture") claims to have contributed to the linkage of communism with homosexuality in the [[United States]], as well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For example, in 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]], an editor and writer at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'' and a former Communist Party member and courier in a Soviet spy ring infiltrating the American government, accused [[Alger Hiss]], head of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Endowment]], of perjury and, implicitly, of Soviet espionage. The vast media coverage of the scandal hinted that Chambers had a crush on Hiss, establishing a link between Communism and homosexuality. Chambers was only too eager to strengthen this link, declaring to the FBI that his homosexual activities had stopped once he had left the Communist Party. In addition, the 1951 flight to the Soviet Union of gay British spies [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] also helped fuel the association of homosexuality and treason in the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McCarthyism |author=Luca Prono |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/mccarthyism.html |publisher=[[glbtq.com]] |accessdate=9 March 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223070331/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/mccarthyism.html |format=PDF |year=2004 |archivedate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Cold War ====

{{see also|Lavender scare}}
During the height of the [[McCarthy era]] (in the late 1940s and early 1950s), American senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] associated homosexuality and communism as "threats to the "American way of life." In both cases, association with sickness and disease provided means of legitimating isolation from impressionable young people."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Dennis. "Gayness, multicultural education, and community." [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K2_VMQyk-ZMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA233 Beyond black and white: New faces and voices in the U.S. Schools] (1997): 233–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their sexual orientation than because they were left-winged or communist politically. George Chauncey noted that, "The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America," and homosexuality (and homosexuals) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Douglas, ed. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DztQtydwimMC American cold war culture]. Edinburgh University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy often used accusations of homosexuality as a [[smear tactic]] in his [[McCarthyism|anti-communist crusade]], often combining the [[Second Red Scare]] with the [[lavender scare]]. On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, "If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you've got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."&lt;ref&gt;Cuordileone, K.A.  "'Politics in an Age of Anxiety': Cold War Political Culture and the Crisis in American Masculinity, 1949–1960"  ''The Journal of American History'' 87 (2) (2000): 515-545&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that, in linking communism and homosexuality and psychological imbalance, McCarthy was employing guilt-by-association if evidence for communist activity was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joy |last1=Damousi |first2=Mariano Ben |last2=Plotkin |title=Psychoanalysis and Politics: Histories of Psychoanalysis Under Conditions of Restricted Political Freedom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221 |date=5 January 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-992316-8 |page=221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and [[anti-nationalism]]. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that "You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives."  Later in that same interview he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: "But look Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we?  I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government."&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections between gay rights groups and radical leftists were not merely a figment of the imaginations of [[demagogues]]. The [[Mattachine Society]], one of the earliest gay rights groups in the United States, was founded by [[Harry Hay]], a former member of the Communist Party USA, who was kicked out of the gay rights group he'd founded for his ties to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lillian Faderman |author2=Stuart Timmons |title=Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5SVsJmVxDUC&amp;pg=PA113 |year=2006 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02288-5 |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous ex-communist former Soviet agent [[Whittaker Chambers]] notably spent his time in the left-wing underground pursuing both homosexual and heterosexual affairs, but he kept his liaisons quiet since his communist associates despised homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Charles |first=Douglas M. |title=Communist and Homosexual: The FBI, Harry Hay, and the Secret Side of the Lavender Scare, 1943–1961 |journal=American Communist History |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=101–124 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group |date=5 April 2012 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14743892.2012.666097 |issn=1474-3906 |doi=10.1080/14743892.2012.666097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turn"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Harvard University Press |title=The Conservative Turn: Lionel Trilling, Whittaker Chambers, and the Lessons of Anti-Communism |author=Michael Kimmage |pages=52–54 |year=2009 |isbn=0-674-03258-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers later monogamously married the [[pacifism|pacifist]] painter [[Esther Shemitz]], working as a journalist and editor.

The [[League for the Revolutionary Party]], a communist party based in [[New York City]], issued a statement shortly after the passage of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] condemning the amendment; reaffirming their support for same-sex marriage and expressing their views on how gay liberation is essential to the communist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrp-cofi.org/statements/gaymarriage052609.html |title=Down with the Ban on Gay Marriage! |publisher=[[League for the Revolutionary Party]] |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New People's Army]], a communist [[insurgency]] within the [[Philippines]] has also made several statements supporting equal rights of same-sex couples and gay individuals; performing the first same-sex marriage in the country and officially endorsing such legislation if they were to come to power.

====Czechoslovakia====

In 1962, the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]] decriminalized same-sex sexual intercourse after scientific research of [[Kurt Freund]] led to the conclusion that homosexual orientation may not be changed.

====East Germany====

In the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet occupation zone of Germany]], the development of law was not uniform. The government of [[Thuringia]] moderated Paragraphs 175 and 175a in a manner similar to that contemplated in the draft criminal code of 1925, while in the other states (''{{lang|de|[[States of Germany|Länder]]}}'') the 1935 version of the statute remained in effect without changes. Although in 1946 the ''Committee for Law Examination'' of [[East Berlin]] specifically advised not to include §&amp;nbsp;175 StGB in a new criminal code, this recommendation had no consequences. The Provincial High Court in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (''{{lang|de|Oberlandesgericht Halle}}'', or ''{{lang|de|OLG Halle}}'') decided for [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in 1948 that Paragraphs 175 and 175a were to be seen as injustice perpetrated by the Nazis, because a [[progressivism|progressive]] juridical development had been broken off and even been reversed. Homosexual acts were to be tried only according to the laws of the Weimar Republic.

In 1950, one year after being reconstituted as the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], the Berlin Appeal Court (''{{lang|de|Kammergericht Berlin}}'') decided for all of East Germany to reinstate the validity of the old, pre-1935 form of Paragraph 175. However, in contrast to the earlier action of the {{lang|de|OLG Halle}}, the new Paragraph 175a remained unchanged, because it was said to protect society against "socially harmful homosexual acts of qualified character". From 1953 to 1957, following [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], the GDR government instituted a program of "moral reform" to build a solid foundation for the new [[socialist republic]], in which masculinity and the traditional family were championed while homosexuality, seen to contravene "healthy mores of the working people", continued to be prosecuted under Paragraph 175. Same-sex sexual intercourse was "alternatively viewed as a remnant of bourgeois decadence, a sign of moral weakness, and a threat to the social and political health of the nation."{{Ref|Evans}}

In 1954 the same court decided that Paragraph 175a in contrast to Paragraph 175 did not presuppose acts tantamount to sexual intercourse. Lewdness (''{{lang|de|Unzucht}}'') was defined as any act that is performed to arouse sexual excitement and "violates the moral sentiment of our workers." A revision of the criminal code in 1957 made it possible to put aside prosecution of an illegal action that represented no danger to [[socialism|socialist]] society because of lack of consequence. This removed Paragraph 175 from the effective body of the law, because at the same time the East Berlin Court of Appeal (''{{lang|de|Kammergericht}}'') decided that all punishments deriving from the old form of Paragraph 175 should be suspended due to the insignificance of the acts to which it had been applied. On this basis, homosexual acts between consenting adults ceased to be punished, beginning in the late 1950s.

In 1968 homosexuality was officially decriminalised in East Germany.

Gay social clubs and groups were allowed to organize themselves freely, so long as they made tenuous links with Protestant Churches. This was because the official position of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] party was to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but to otherwise ignore that LGBT relationships existed. On July 1, 1968, the GDR adopted its own code of criminal law. In it §&amp;nbsp;151 StGB-DDR provided for a sentence up to three years' imprisonment or probation for an adult (18 and over) who engaged in sexual acts with a youth (under 18) of the same sex. This law applied not only to men who have sex with boys but equally to women who have sex with girls. According to historian Heidi Minning, attempts by lesbians and gay men in East Germany to establish a visible community were "thwarted at every turn by the G.D.R. government and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED party]]." She writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Police force was used on numerous occasions to break up or prevent public gay and lesbian events. Centralized censorship prevented the presentation of homosexuality in print and electronic media, as well as the import of such materials.{{Ref|Minning}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1980s, the East German government opened a state-owned gay disco in Berlin. In 1987, the age of consent was equalized for same-sex intercourse in East Germany. On August 11, 1987 the Supreme Court of the GDR struck down a conviction under Paragraph 151 on the basis that "homosexuality, just like heterosexuality, represents a variant of sexual behavior. Homosexual people do therefore not stand outside socialist society, and the civil rights are warranted to them exactly as to all other citizens." One year later, the {{lang|de|[[Volkskammer]]}} (the parliament of the GDR), in its fifth revision of the criminal code, brought the written law in line with what the court had ruled, striking Paragraph 151 without replacement. The act passed into law May 30, 1989. This removed all specific reference to homosexuality from East German criminal law. In 1989, the German film titled ''[[Coming Out (1989 film)|Coming Out]]'' directed by [[Heiner Carow]] was exhibited on the night that the Berlin wall came down, and tells a story of an East German man coming to accept his own homosexuality, with much of it shot in the local gay bars.  This was the only East German LGBT rights film.

====Hungary====
The [[Hungarian People's Republic]] adopted the penal code of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] punished male same-sex sexual intercourse with prison up to 1 year. In 1961, male same-sex sexual intercourse above the age of 20 was decriminalized. In 1978, a new penal code lowered the age of consent to the age of 18 years old.

====Mongolia====
In 1961, same-sex sexual intercourse was decriminalized in the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

====Mozambique====

====Poland====
Same-sex sexual intercourse was always legal during the existence of the [[Republic of Poland (1944–1952)|Republic of Poland]] and the [[Polish People's Republic]].

However the government used homosexuality to blackmail homosexuals and the police harassed gay men and lesbians. Many homosexual men were arrested in 1985 in “Operation Hyacinth.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgayz.com/a-brief-history-of-gay-poland/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Operation Hyacinth]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

====Romania====
The [[Romanian People's Republic]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] adopted the Romanian Penal Code of 1937 from the [[Kingdom of Romania]], which banned public "acts of sexual inversion committed between men or between women, if provoking public scandal". In 1948, this "public" homosexuality was considerate by court, that it include all situations whatever public or private if "provoking scandal", thus homosexuality became ''de facto'' illegal. In the new Penal Code of the [[Romanian People's Republic]], old Article 431 toughens penalties to a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years.&lt;ref name="accept"&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://accept-romania.ro/lgbt-issues/legislatie/ |title=Legislație românească discriminatorie pentru LGBT – Istoric |work=ACCEPT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 already disappears the "public scandal" and any consenting sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex is criminalized.&lt;ref name="legislation"&gt;{{ro icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.suntgay.ro/ma_informez/legislatia_romaneasca/ |title=Legislația românească privind homosexualitatea |work=suntgay.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s rise to power, in 1968, the basic code was again revised, introducing [[Article 200]] and moving the infraction from the public domain into the private:&lt;ref name="legislation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.polcomtim.ro/legi/codpenal2008.pdf CODUL PENAL din 21 iunie 1968 (**republicat**) (*actualizat*)] (updated until 28 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=QjqxzR0xTvoC&amp;pg=PA315 |chapter=Gay and Lesbian Rights |title=Romania since 1989: Politics, Economics, and Society |author=Mihnea Ion Năstase |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2004 |pages=315–316 |isbn=9780739105924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet Union====
In November 1917, after the [[October Revolution]], the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] criminal code was abrogated by the [[Bolsheviks]], thus legalizing same-sex sexual intercourse between consenting adults in the [[Russian SSR]] and the later [[Ukrainian SSR]]. However this policy was not uniform across all the Soviet Republics which emerged after 1922. The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] were all created with no laws criminalising same-sex sexual intercourse. In 1923, the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] sexual intercourse between men became a criminal offense&lt;ref&gt;Healey, Dan.

In 1926, [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] criminalized male same-sex intercourse. In 1927, [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] criminalized male same-sex intercourse.

The Soviet Union sent delegates to the German [[Institute for Sexual Science]], as well as to some international conferences on human sexuality, who expressed support for the legalization of adult, private, and consensual homosexual relations.

Soviet social policy in the 1920s regarding homosexuality and homosexual rights was mixed. On the one hand homosexuality was legal in the Russian and Ukrainian Soviet Republics and certain political and civil rights in the Soviet Union were extended to homosexuals. On the other hand, there was increasing pressure from both within and outside the Soviet government to recriminalise homosexuality and to reinstate bans on homosexual intercourse. In the late 1920s Soviet medical research increasingly came to classify homosexuality as a mental disease or as a remnant of bourgeois society.

Relative Soviet tolerance for homosexuality and homosexual rights ended in the late 1920s — as Soviet society came increasingly under Stalinist control. In the 1930s, along with increased repression of political dissidents and non-Russian nationalities under Stalin, LGBT themes faced official government censorship, and a uniformly harsher policy across the entire Soviet Union. Homosexuality was officially labelled a disease.&lt;ref&gt;West, Green. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison'']. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The official stance could be summarized in the article of the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' of 1930 written by medical expert Sereisky:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Soviet legislation does not recognize so-called crimes against morality. Our laws proceed from the principle of protection of society and therefore countenance punishment only in those instances when juveniles and minors are the objects of homosexual interest ... while recognizing the incorrectness of homosexual development ... our society combines prophylactic and other therapeutic measures with all the necessary conditions for making the conflicts that afflict homosexuals as painless as possible and for resolving their typical estrangement from society within the collective
:—Sereisky, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 1930, p. 593&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1934 the Soviet government recriminalised homosexuality in the Soviet Union. On March 7, 1934, Article 121 was added to the criminal code, throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], expressly prohibited only male same-sex sexual intercourse, with up to five years of hard labor in prison. There were no criminal statutes regarding lesbianism. During the Soviet period, Western observers believed that between 800 and 1,000 men were imprisoned each year under Article 121.&lt;ref name=RUS98001.zar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscis.gov/tools/asylum-resources/resource-information-center-79 |title=Resource Information Center |publisher=[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians have noted that it was during this time that Soviet propaganda began to depict homosexuality as a sign of fascism, and that Article 121 may have a simple political tool to use against dissidents, irrespective of their true [[sexual orientation]], and to solidify Russian opposition to Nazi Germany, who had broken its treaty with Russia.&lt;ref name=Dub89-362&gt;[[#Dub89|Duberman 1989]], p.362.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a third possible reason for the anti-gay law has emerged from declassified Soviet documents and transcripts.  Beyond expressed fears of a vast "counterrevolutionary" or fascist homosexual conspiracy, there were several high-profile arrests of Russian men accused of being [[pederasts]].&lt;ref name=workers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workers.org/ww/2004/lgbtseries1007.php |work=Workers World |date=7 October 2004 |title=Can a homosexual be a member of the Communist Party? |accessdate=29 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, 130 men "were accused of being 'pederasts' – adult males who have sex with boys. Since no records of men having sex with boys at that time are available, it is possible this term was used broadly and crudely to label homosexuality."&lt;ref name=workers /&gt; Whatever the precise reason, homosexuality remained a serious criminal offense until it was repealed in 1993.&lt;ref name=workers /&gt;

The Soviet government itself said very little publicly about the change in the law, and few people seemed to be aware that it existed.  In 1934, the British Communist Harry Whyte wrote a long letter to Stalin condemning the law, and its prejudicial motivations.  He laid out a Marxist position against the oppression of homosexuals, as a social minority, and compared homophobia to racism, xenophobia and sexism.&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia'' Dan Healey, 2001, p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; While the letter was not formally replied to, Soviet cultural writer [[Maxim Gorky]] authored an article, published in both ''[[Pravda]]'' and ''[[Izvestia]]'' titled "Proletarian Humanism", that seemed to reject Whyte's arguments point by point. He rejected the notion that homosexuals were a social minority, and argued that the Soviet Union, governed by "manly proletariat", is obliged to persecute homosexuals to protect the youth from their corrupting effect. He also equated homosexuality with fascism, stating that destroying homosexuality would in turn destroy fascism.&lt;ref&gt;"Proletarian Humanism" 23 May 1934&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workers.org/ww/2004/lgbtseries1007.php |title=Can a homosexual be a member of the Communist Party?  |accessdate=28 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Justice Commissar [[Nikolai Krylenko]] publicly stated that the anti-gay criminal law was aimed at the decadent and effete old ruling classes.&lt;ref name=workers /&gt;

During [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s regime, the Khruschev government believed that absent of a criminal law against same-sex sexual intercourse, the sex between men that occurred in the prison environment would spread into the general population as they released many Stalin-era prisoners.  Whereas the Stalin government conflated [[homosexuality and pedophilia|homosexuality with pedophilia]], the Khrushchev government conflated homosexuality with the situational, sometimes forced, sex acts between male prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/35384|title=The Moscow Times — News, Business, Culture &amp; Events|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the Interior Ministry sent a secret memo to law enforcement ordering them to step up enforcement of the anti-gay criminal law.  Yet, during the late 1950s – early 1960s, Aline Mosby, a foreign reporter in Russia at the time, attributed to the more liberal attitude of the Khrushchev government to the fact that she did see some gay couples in public and that it was not uncommon to see men waiting outside of certain theaters looking for dates with male performers.&lt;ref&gt;The View from No. 13 People's Street. Aline Mosby. 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1964 Soviet sex manual instructed: "With all the tricks at their disposal, homosexuals seek out and win the confidence of youngsters. Then they proceed to act. Do not under any circumstances allow them to touch you. Such people should be immediately reported to the administrative organs so that they can be removed from society."&lt;ref name=Soviet-EraShadows&gt;{{cite web

Imprisonment for male same-sex sexual intercourse and government censorship of homosexuality and LGBT rights did not begin to slowly relax until the early 1970s. [[Venedikt Yerofeyev]] was permitted to include a brief interior monologue about homosexuality in ''[[Moscow to the End of the Line]]'' (1973).  Perhaps the first public endorsement of LGBT rights since Stalin was a brief statement, critical of Article 121 and calling for its repeal,  made in the ''Textbook of Soviet Criminal Law'' (1973).&lt;ref name=Dub89-362 /&gt; These references were characterized as being brief statements in a novel or textbook and were made by heterosexuals. Vicktor Sosnora was allowed to write about witnessing an elderly gay actor being brutally murdered in a Leningrad bar in ''The Flying Dutchman'' (1979), but the book was only allowed to be published in East Germany.  When the author was gay and, in particular, if they were seen as supporting gay rights, the censors tended to be much harsher.

Russian gay author [[Yevgeny Kharitonov (poet)|Yevgeny Kharitonov]] illegally circulated some gay fiction before he died of heart failure in 1981.  Author Gennady Trifonov served four years of hard labor for circulating his gay poems and, upon his release, was allowed to write and publish only if he avoided depicting or making reference to homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dub89|Duberman 1989]], p.363.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, a group of Russian gay men met and attempted to organize an official gay rights organization, only to be quickly shut down by the [[KGB]].  It was not until later in the ''[[Glasnost]]'' period that public discussion was permitted about re-legalizing private, consensual adult homosexual relations.

A poll conducted in 1989 reported that homosexuals were the most hated group in Russian society and that 30 percent of those polled felt that homosexuals should be liquidated.&lt;ref name=RUS98001.zar /&gt; In a 1991 public opinion poll conducted in [[Chelyabinsk, Russia|Chelyabinsk]] 30 percent of the respondents aged 16 to 30 years old felt that homosexuals should be "isolated from society," 5 percent felt they should be "liquidated," 60 percent had a "negative" attitude toward gay people and 5 percent labeled their sexual orientation "unfortunate."&lt;ref name=Soviet-EraShadows /&gt; In 1989–1990 a Moscow gay rights organization led by Yevgeniya Debryanskaya was permitted to exist, with Roman Kalinin given permission to publish a gay newspaper, ''Tema''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~moss/RGC2.html |title=Russian Gay History |publisher= |accessdate=29 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise number of persons prosecuted under Article 121 is unknown, with the first official information was released only in 1988, but it is believed to be about 1000 prosecuted a year. According to official data, the number of men convicted under Article 121 had been steadily decreasing during the Glasnost period. In 1987, 831 men were sentenced under Article 121; in 1989, 539; in 1990, 497; and in 1991, 462.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertyandsocialism.org/2011/07/19/soviet-homophobia/ |title=Soviet Homophobia |first=Igor |last=Kon |publisher=International Libertarian Socialist Alliance |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911022801/http://libertyandsocialism.org/2011/07/19/soviet-homophobia/ |date=19 July 2011 |archivedate=11 September 2012 |accessdate=29 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was formed, it adopted Yugoslav Criminal Code of 1929, a previous law of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] banned  "lewdness against the order of nature" ([[anal intercourse]]) between human beings. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to male same-sex anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ageofconsent.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/slovenia.htm |title=Slovenia Age of Consent |publisher= |accessdate=29 April 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414120423/http://www.ageofconsent.com/slovenia.htm |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.overa.rs/krivicni-zakonik-1951.html Krivični zakonik (Sl.list FNRJ br. 13/51), član 186] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103151209/http://www.overa.rs/krivicni-zakonik-1951.html |date= 3 November 2013 |quote={{lang|sr|Za protivprirodni blud između lica muškog pola, učinilac će se kazniti zatvorom do dve godine.}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, the Croatian Medical Chamber removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.

In 1974, Yugoslavia adopted [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|new federal constitution]] which resulted in the abolition of the federal penal code, allowing each socialist republic to created their own. In 1977, the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] and [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] enacted their own individual penal codes, and decriminalized male same-sex anal intercourse. Male-same-sex anal intercourse remained illegal in the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia]], excluding the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (so including [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].

In 1985, Toni Marošević became the first openly gay media person, and briefly hosted a radio show on Youth Radio ({{lang-hr|Omladinski radio}}) that dealt with marginal socio-political issues. He later revealed that he had been asked on several occasions by the [[League of Communists of Croatia]] to form a LGBT faction of the party. The first lesbian association (Lila initiative) in Croatia was formed in 1989, but ceased to exist a year later.&lt;ref name=povijest/&gt; In 1990, [[Vojvodina#History|Vojvodina was reincorporated]] into the legal system of Serbia, and male same-sex anal intercourse once again become a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.montevallo.edu/SafeZone/PDF/LGBTQ%20Timeline%202011%20PDF.pdf |title=LGBTQ Timeline |publisher= |accessdate=29 April 2017 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100051/http://legacy.montevallo.edu/SafeZone/PDF/LGBTQ%20Timeline%202011%20PDF.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlbAmn_cajYC&amp;pg=PA339 |title=The Hidden Europe: What Eastern Europeans Can Teach Us |first=Francis |last=Tapon |date=8 December 2011 |publisher=SonicTrek, Inc. |accessdate=29 April 2017 |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LGBTory''' is a Canadian [[LGBT conservatism|LGBT conservative]] organization. The group was established in 2015, as an advocacy group for [[LGBT]] supporters of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] and provincial conservative parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyxtra.com/ottawa/news-and-ideas/news/petition-ban-conservative-lgbt-group-from-ottawa-pride-parade-126125 "Petition to ban conservative LGBT group from Ottawa Pride parade"]. ''[[Daily Xtra]]'', August 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; While officially open to all LGBT supporters of conservative parties across Canada, the group was founded in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] by people associated with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] who wanted to be represented in the [[Toronto Pride Parade]].&lt;ref name="T in LGBTory" /&gt; The name was inspired by the similar British conservative group LGBTory, now called [[LGBT+ Conservatives]], which gave permission to use the name.&lt;ref name="T in LGBTory"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'T' in LGBTory represents Trans AND Tory|url=http://www.lgbtory.ca/2016/05/15/the-t-in-lgbtory-represents-trans-and-tory/|website=Policies|publisher=LGBTory|accessdate=November 15, 2017|date=May 15, 2016|quote=LGBTory was founded in 2015 by a group of Toronto Conservatives who wanted to be a presence at the Toronto Pride parade... When casting about for a name for our new group, we found a similar organization in the UK called LGBTory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
LGBTory lists its core political beliefs as supporting limited government and personal and economic freedoms, opposing despotic governments and terrorist groups that persecute minorities including LGBT people, and supporting entrepreneurs and small business owners.

==Activities==
To date, the organization's most widely publicized activity has been its participation in several of Canada's largest [[Pride parade]]s in 2015, representing the first time that an organized LGBT conservative group has participated in any of the events.

At [[Toronto]]'s [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride parade]] in June, in addition to LGBTory members the marching contingent included federal MPs [[Kellie Leitch]] and [[Bernard Trottier]],&lt;ref name=levy&gt;Sue Ann Levy, [http://www.torontosun.com/2015/06/28/important-for-pc-leader-patrick-brown-to-join-pride-parade "Important for PC Leader Patrick Brown to join Pride parade"]. ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', June 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] leader [[Patrick Brown (politician)|Patrick Brown]], MPPs [[Lisa MacLeod]] and [[Jack MacLaren]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/new-ontario-pc-leader-patrick-brown-to-march-in-torontos-pride-parade-a-party-first "New Ontario PC Leader Patrick Brown to march in Toronto’s Pride parade"]. ''[[National Post]]'', June 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and party president [[Richard Ciano]].&lt;ref name=levy/&gt; [[Ottawa]] talk radio host Nick Vandergragt subsequently criticized MacLeod on his [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] talk show for her participation, although both MacLeod and MacLaren repudiated Vandergragt's comments.&lt;ref name=cfra&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/06/29/tory-mpp-lisa-macleod-rejects-anti-pride-comments-from-ottawa-radio-host.html "Tory MPP Lisa MacLeod rejects anti-Pride comments from Ottawa radio host"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Ottawa]]'s [[Capital Pride (Ottawa)|Capital Pride]] in August, the group was faced with an online petition, signed by approximately 200 members of the city's LGBT community, demanding that the pride committee bar the group from marching.&lt;ref name=petition&gt;[http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/conservative-lgbt-group-defends-against-call-for-ban-from-pride-parade "Conservative LGBT group defends against call for ban from Pride parade"]. ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition asserted that "by not distancing themselves from politicians who are actively dismantling our rights," the group was participating in "bad faith";&lt;ref name=petition /&gt; it also claimed that by using the T in the LGBT initialism to stand for "Tory", the group was erasing [[transgender]] identities and issues.&lt;ref name=petition /&gt; The group was not banned from the parade, and marched without further incident.&lt;ref&gt;"A Pride parade for all – including Tories". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', August 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; MacLeod was again among the marchers, although no other elected MPs or MPPs joined her.&lt;ref&gt;"MPs, federal candidates take part in Ottawa's Capital Pride Parade, Aug. 23". ''[[The Hill Times]]'', August 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBTory did not directly organize a contingent at [[Vancouver Pride Festival|Vancouver Pride]], although the Conservative Party's federal [[electoral district association]] in [[Vancouver Centre]] applied to participate but then withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyxtra.com/vancouver/news-and-ideas/news/conservatives-sign-vancouver-pride-trans-pledge-113626 "Did Conservatives sign Vancouver Pride trans pledge?"]. ''[[Daily Xtra]]'', July 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The withdrawal was tied to conflicting claims about whether the group had sought an exemption from having to sign a pledge committing participating groups to respect and defend transgender equality rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyxtra.com/vancouver/news-and-ideas/news/conservative-party-sought-pride-exemption-letter-reveals-122198 "Conservative Party sought Pride exemption, letter reveals"]. ''[[Daily Xtra]]'', August 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2015, the cross-partisan advocacy group [[ProudPolitics]] published an open letter on its website endorsing the group's right to participate in LGBT pride events, stating that "we look forward to working with candidates, groups, and parties of all stripes" and that "achieving ‘lived equality’ – our vision at ProudPolitics – means that LGBTIQ+ citizens should be accepted in all parties and in every walk of life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proudpolitics.org/why_banning_conservative_lgbt_groups_is_the_wrong_way_to_go "Why banning Conservative LGBT groups is the wrong way to go"]. ProudPolitics, August 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">Before the [[Bolivian National Revolution]] of 1952, land in [[Bolivia]] was unequally distributed — 92% of the cultivable land was held by estates of 1,000 hectares or more.&lt;ref name=ts&gt;Maria Luise Wagner. "The ''sexenio'' (1946–52)". In Hudson &amp; Hanratty.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 1953, the MNR government led by president [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] decreed the [[Agrarian Reform Law (Bolivia)|Agrarian Reform Law]] (Law Decree 3464). The law abolished forced peasantry labor, and established a program of expropriation and distribution of the rural property of the traditional landlords to the Indian peasants. Only estates with low productivity were completely distributed. More productive small and medium-sized farms were allowed to keep part of their land and were encouraged to invest new capital to increase agricultural production. The Agrarian Reform Law also provided for compensation for landlords to be paid in the form of twenty-five-year [[government bonds]]. The amount of compensation was based on the value of the property declared for taxes.&lt;ref name=rr&gt;Maria Luise Wagner. "Radical reforms". In Hudson &amp; Hanratty.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the government was unable to control the occupation of land by the peasants. As a result, it could not enforce the provisions of the land reform decree to keep medium-sized productive estates intact. But the MNR eventually gained the support of the [[Unique Confederation of Rural Laborers of Bolivia|campesinos]] when the [[Ministry of Peasant Affairs]] was created and when peasants were organized into [[syndicates]]. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large supplies of arms. The peasants remained a powerful political force in Bolivia during all subsequent governments.&lt;ref name=rr/&gt;

However, in 1970 only 45% of peasant families had received title to land, although more land reform projects continued in the 1970s and 1980s.

A 1996 Agrarian Reform Law (also {{lang-es|Ley INRA}}) increased protection for smallholdings and indigenous territories, but also protected absentee landholders who pay taxes from expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 2156-5163 | volume = 15-17 | pages = 114–149 [118] | last = Fabricant | first = Nicole | title = Mapping a new geography of space and power | journal = Bolivian Studies Journal | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivian president [[Evo Morales]] restarted land reform when he took office in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;James Read,   [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5045424.stm Bolivia head starts land handout], BBC News, 4 June 2006. Retrieved 20 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2006, the Bolivian Senate passed a bill authorizing the government redistribution of land among the nation's mostly indigenous poor.  The bill was signed into law hours later, though significant opposition is expected&lt;ref&gt;"Morales signs controversial bill into law."

'''Political parties in North Korea''' are heavily tied to the function of the government. [[North Korea]] has several parties, but the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) has a stranglehold on political power.

As of the latest [[North Korean parliamentary election, 2014|election in 2014]], three parties (WPK, [[Korean Social Democratic Party]], and [[Chondoist Chongu Party]]) and one organization ([[Chongryon]]) are represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]], the country's parliament.

==Official parties in North Korea==

North Korea is a de facto [[one-party state]]. Although minor parties are allowed, they are legally required to accept the leadership of the ruling party. North Korean politics works therefore on the [[united front]] principle common in [[communist state]]s, but uncommon in allowing competing parties. The North Korean front is called the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]].

==North Korean opposition parties==

There is currently no known organized opposition within North Korea that is independently verifiable. However, there are various exiled [[dissident]] groups that oppose the regime.

British '''military operations other than war''' (MOOTW) focus on deterring war, resolving conflict, promoting peace, and supporting civil authorities in response to domestic crises. 

The MOTW strategic paradigm evolved slowly.

==Malaya==
The evolution of British tactics in the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948-1960) illustrates [[lessons learned the hard way]]; and eventually, the British developed a strategy with elements similar to "military operations other than warfare." principles. In a sense, events in Malaya anticipated the current doctrine. Ultimately, the way in which political and military leaders defined their roles and synchronized their policies and operations produced measurable results.  The British initially failed to appreciate the complex nature of counterinsurgency and equally complex measures which are required to combat it.&lt;ref name="hamby2002"&gt;Hamby, Joel E. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_32/ai_105853016/  "Civil-military operations: joint doctrine and the Malayan Emergency,"] ''Joint Force Quarterly,'' Autumn 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent operations built from a foundation consisting of what had been learned (and what had &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; been learned) in 1948-1950.&lt;ref name="hamby2002"/&gt; 

Lieutenant General Sir [[Harold Rawdon Briggs|Harold Briggs]] is credited with articulating the twin goals which have evolved into a British doctrine over the course of time. The Briggs Plan (June 1950) proposed "two key goals to accomplish in order to end the insurgency--first, to protect the population, and second to isolate them from the guerrillas."&lt;ref name="hamby2002"/&gt;

==Bosnia==
British peacekeeping troops in Bosnia in the late 1990s attended to similar objectives in order to assist the population in re-establishing "normality."&lt;ref name="brady1997"&gt;Brady, Pamela J.

The '''Murray-Darling Basin Authority''' (MDBA) is the principal government agency in charge of managing the [[Murray-Darling Basin]] in an integrated and [[sustainable development|sustainable]] manner. The MDBA is an independent [[statutory authority|statutory agency]] that manages, in conjunction with the Basin states, the Murray–Darling Basin's water resources in the national interest. The MDBA reports to the Australian Government Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources.

The MDBA is established under the federal ''Water Act (2007)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00043 |title=Water Act 2007 (Cth) |publisher=[[ComLaw]] |accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced under the [[Howard Government]] as part of the [[Water security in Australia#National Plan For Water Security|National Water Plan for Water Security]]. The ''Water Act (2007)'' was a response to the [[drought in Australia|drought]] and the potential effects of [[climate change in Australia]].&lt;ref name="smwrch1"&gt;{{cite web

The Chief Executive of the MDBA is Phillip Glyde who replaced Dr Rhondda Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Andrew is a former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] member of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from March 1983 to October 2004.

Whilst the MDBA is a Commonwealth Government agency, an inter-governmental Murray‑Darling Basin Ministerial Council (Ministerial Council) acts in an advisory role in preparing and implementing the Basin Plan by the MDBA.  This Council comprises the Commonwealth Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources (who also chairs the council) and one minister from each of the basin states (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia) and the Australian Capital Territory. The Ministerial Council introduced the [[Murray-Darling Cap]] in response to the 1995 report titled "An Audit of Water Use in the Murray-Darling Basin".&lt;ref name="wtr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/water/pubs/state_technical/nsw_tecpage.html |title=Water - New South Wales - Water Technical Report |date=13 May 2009 |work=Australian Natural Resources Atlas |publisher=Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities |accessdate=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the MDBA==
[[File:Murray-catchment-map MJC02.png|thumb|right|Map of the Murray-Darling Basin]]
With the creation of the MDBA in 2008, for the first time, a single [[inter-governmental]] body assumed responsibility for [[Environmental planning|planning]] the [[Integrated catchment management|integrated management]] of water resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. In addition to the Commission's former functions, the MDBA's role includes:

* preparing, implementing and enforcing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan
* advising the minister on the accreditation of state water resource plans
* developing a [[water right]]s information service which facilitates water trading across the Murray-Darling basin
* measuring and monitoring water resources in the basin
* gathering information and undertaking research
* educating and engaging the community in the management of the basin's resources.&lt;ref name="MDBA-about"/&gt;

The Murray–Darling Basin Authority is an integral element of the Commonwealth Government's program ''Water for the Future'' which has four priorities; namely:
# tackling [[climate change in Australia|climate change]]
# supporting healthy rivers
# using water wisely and
# securing [[Water supply and sanitation in Australia|water supplies]].&lt;ref name="MDBA-about"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The MDBA also commissions research into aquatic science and is a source of information on Australian [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater biology]].

==History==
Since 1914, there have been various intergovernmental agreements relating to Murray‑Darling water resources.&lt;ref name="smwrch1"/&gt;  Prior to the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority,  institutional arrangements for water resources management lay with the five State and Territory governments in the Basin, with little co-ordination. In response to this problem, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was established in January 1988 under the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, with a charter to efficiently manage and equitably distribute River Murray water resources. Secondly, it was to protect and improve the water quality of the River Murray and its tributaries; and lastly to advise the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council on water, land and [[environmental management]] in the Basin.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;{{cite web

The ''Water Amendment Act 2008'' was introduced in December 2008 to amend the ''Water Act 2007''.&lt;ref name="kfwa"&gt;{{cite web

As at November 2016, the MDBA is four years into the implementation phase of the Basin Plan. The MDBA has published major bodies of work including: 
* Basin environmental watering strategy
* Annual environmental watering priorities
* Constraints management strategy
* New water trade operating rules
 
The MDBA also established a water trading scheme across Basin states to increase [[Intensive farming#Water use efficiency|water use efficiency]].&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

==Murray-Darling Basin Plan==
The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was signed off by [[Tony Burke]], Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on 22 November 2012, and passed its final hurdle in the Australian Parliament on the 29 November 2012. Following is the history leading up to this significant occasion in the history of Australian water reform.

On 8 October 2010, the MDBA released a major document entitled the ''Guide to the Proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan'' outlining a plan to secure the long-term [[ecological health]] of the Murray-Darling Basin. The guide introduced cutting existing water allocations and increasing [[environmental flow]]s.&lt;ref name="cewa"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/10/12/3036291.htm | title = MDBA Chair explains water allocation cuts | author = Thomsen, Joseph | accessdate = 17 October 2010 | date = 12 October 2010 | work = [[ABC Goulburn Murray]] | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed plan was the first part of a three-stage process to address the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin; namely, over-allocation, prolonged drought, natural climate variability and climate change, leading to deteroriation of rivers, wetlands, forests and floodplains in the basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/06/3030629.htm | title = The Murray-Darling Plan explained | author = Clarke, Sarah and staff | date = 8 October 2010 | work = ABC News | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 23 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDBA is responsible for preparing and overseeing the Basin Plan, a [[Legally binding|legally enforceable]] management plan. The main aim of the Plan (passed by the Australian Parliament in November 2012) is to return around 2,750 GL to the river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mdba.gov.au/what-we-do/basin-plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority originally reported that the a volume of water as high as 7,600 gigalitres per year would bring long-term sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.theage.com.au/national/scientists-push-for-strong-plan-on-murraydarling-20101130-18fbe.html | title = Scientists push for strong plan on Murray-Darling 				 | author = Peter Ker | accessdate = 2 December 2010 | date = 1 December 2010 | publisher = The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would be the best scenario for the ecosystems of the basin but "would not be socially or economically viable".&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/paradise-possible-but-too-costly/story-fn59niix-1225936193100 | title =Paradise possible but too costly 				 | author = Lanai Vasek | accessdate = 2 December 2010 | date = 9 October 2010 | publisher = The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basin Plan sets and enforces environmentally sustainable limits on the quantities of water that may be taken from Basin [[water resource]]s. It has Basin-wide environmental, [[water quality]] and [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]] objectives and aims to develop efficient [[water trading]] regimes across the Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdba.gov.au/basin-plan-roll-out/water-quality-and-salinity |title=Murray- Darling river: Water quality management|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan includes requirements for state water resource plans and aims to improve water security for all Basin users.&lt;ref name="smr"&gt;[http://download.mdba.gov.au/FactSheet_Murrumbidgee.pdf Summary of Murrumbidgee Region From the Guide to the proposed Basin Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226095725/http://download.mdba.gov.au/FactSheet_Murrumbidgee.pdf |date=26 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Basin Plan aims to achieve a balance between environmental, economic and social considerations .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mdba.gov.au/basin-plan/plan-murray%E2%80%93darling-basin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the ''Guide to the Proposed Murray-Darling Basin Plan'' there were a significant number of protests and voiced concerns in rural towns that the MDBA visited to present the proposed plan at consultation meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/15/3039240.htm?section=justin | title = Tractor convoy as SA irrigators protest | date = 15 October 2010 | work = ABC News | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 23 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]], more than 500 people attended the Authority's first public consultation meeting in the local hotel that accommodated only 250 people.

Less than one month later, Mike Taylor, then Chair of the Authority, announced his decision to resign effective from the end of January 2011. In announcing his resignation, he cited his concerns that the Water Act made it difficult to balance the environmental and socio-economic impacts of cuts to water allocations aimed at rescuing rivers in the basin.&lt;ref name="Aust-resign"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/murray-darling-basin-boss-mike-taylor-resigns/story-e6frg6n6-1225966814825 | title = Basin authority Mike Taylor's resignation won't halt Murray-Darling water reforms, says PM | author1 = Kelly, Joe | author2 = Massola, James | date = 7 December 2010 | work = [[The Australian]] | publisher = [[News Limited]] | accessdate = 29 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC-resign"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/12/07/3086516.htm?section=justin | title = Murray-Darling boss resigns | author = Rodgers, Emma | work = ABC News | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 7 December 2010 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of crucial concern was Taylor's desire to not oversee a process that returned less than 3,000 GL to the basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/environment/water-issues/murraydarling-chair-resigns-leaving-reforms-in-turmoil-20101207-18nea.html | title = Murray-Darling chair resigns, leaving reforms in turmoil  | author1 = Ker, Peter | date = 7 December 2010 | work = [[The Age]] | publisher = Fairfax Media | accessdate = 29 January 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Julia Gillard]], and the Water Minister, [[Tony Burke]], rejected Taylor's concerns that the Water Act and the objectives of the Authority were compromised.&lt;ref name="Aust-resign"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC-PM-resign"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s3087241.htm | title = Murray-Darling Basin Authority head resigns | author1 = Colvin, Mark | author2 = Hawley, Samantha | date = 7 December 2010 | work = [[PM (ABC Radio)|PM]] | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate = 29 January 2011 | authorlink1 = Mark Colvin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208143606/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s3087241.htm|archivedate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists withdrew its support for the Murray Darling Basin Plan, who described the process as seriously flawed and a waste of taxpayers' money.&lt;ref name=WGCS_ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=Riverina mayor welcomes Murray Darling Basin Plan withdrawal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/23/3223996.htm|accessdate=23 May 2011|work=ABC News|publisher=Australia Broadcasting Corporation|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wentworth Group said they could not support the plan which they believed would cost billions and claimed that it would not fix the problems in the river system.&lt;ref name=WGCS_ABC/&gt; The Wentworth Group wanted a minimum 4000 gigalitres of water returned to the river system but the group believed that it would not happen under the draft plan.&lt;ref name=WGCS_ABC/&gt;

In June 2011, a federal parliamentary committee (chaired by independent [[Tony Windsor]]) delivered its report to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and its recommendations on water cutbacks in the basin. The committee was told river communities faced annihilation if 4,000 [[gigalitres]] was returned to the environment. The committee also reported that the health of the river system could be protected without the cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Sabra|title=Windsor report slams Murray-Darling authority|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/02/3233832.htm|accessdate=2 June 2011|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian  Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Conservation Foundation says it is disappointed by the report delivered by the inquiry into the Murray-Darling river system. The Australian Conservation Foundation believes that buybacks are the most efficient way to save the basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Om|first=Jason|title=Environmentalists angered by Murray-Darling review|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/06/02/3234171.htm|accessdate=2 June 2011|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian  Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the draft plan was finally released. The plan proposes that 2,750&amp;nbsp;gigalitres per year be cut from water allocations over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-28/draft-basin-plan-released/3698064 |title=Mixed response to Murray-Darling plan |author= |accessdate=28 November 2011 |date=28 November 2011 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by [[Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists|Wentworth Group]], the Commonwealth Government originally planned to start buying the 2,750 gigalitres of water and to increase groundwater extractions by 2,600 gigalitres at the same time in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-18/scientists-want-manipulated-basin-plan-scrapped/3781476?section=sa Scientists want 'manipulated' Basin plan scrapped] - ''ABC News'', 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the groundwater is linked to river systems, but the Plan does not count it in the models.:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wentworthgroup.org/uploads/Wentworth%20Group%20Statement%20on%20the%202011%20Draft%20Murray-Darling%20Basin%20Plan.pdf  Wentworth Group Statement on the 2011 Draft Murray-Darling Basin Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321075017/http://www.wentworthgroup.org/uploads/Wentworth%20Group%20Statement%20on%20the%202011%20Draft%20Murray-Darling%20Basin%20Plan.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The Plan does not incorporate in the modelling the impact that increasing groundwater extractions by over 2,600GL will have on surface water flows, many of the groundwater systems in the Basin are linked to river systems.

The Plan [also] sets long term diversion limits on the assumption that there is no risk to river health from climate change.|Wentworth Group Statement on the 2011 Draft Murray-Darling Basin Plan}}

In late May 2012, a revision of the plan was forwarded to state water ministers for review.&lt;ref name="mdpdts"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/201205/s3512350.htm |title=Murray-Darling plan delivered to states |author=Anna Vidot and rural reporters |accessdate=29 May 2012 |date=28 May 2012 |work=ABC Rural |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did not alter the recommendation to return 2,750 gigalitres of water to the environment by cutting water entitlements.

Following much negotiation between the Commonwealth and State governments and numerous submissions from interested stakeholders and the community,the Basin Plan finally became law in November 2012 and is now being implemented.

'''Najah Wakim''' (born 1946) is the president and one of the founders of the Lebanese leftist group the [[People's Movement (Lebanon)|People's Movement]]. He is a secular Lebanese lawyer who believes in secular Arabist ideology.

He managed to defeat [[Nasim Majdalani]] in 1972's Lebanese parliamentary elections for the Orthodox seat, and he was a supporter of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gordon| first = David C.| title = The Republic of Lebanon: Nation in Jeopardy| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq4OAAAAQAAJ| year = 1983| publisher = Westview Press Croom Helm| isbn = 978-0-86531-450-4| page = 105| quote = Criticism of the government became increasingly vocal, and the power of traditional leaders began to be seriously challenged.

However, several death threats were issued against him and several attempts were made on his life most notably on October 1, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawmaker kills assailant in Beirut home |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB72C6BEABAB018&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=1987-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-30 |quote=A Parliament member shot and killed an armed assailant who broke into his West Beirut apartment today in an apparent assassination attempt, police said.

He rejected the 1989 [[Taif agreement]] claiming it is an American-Syrian agreement that only enhanced sectarianism in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gemayel accuses Syria of sabotaging Taif Accord |url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0410/04102004LW.asp |publisher=Lebanon Wire |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2010-10-30 |quote=Former MP and the head of the People's Movement, Najah Wakim, said Taif was not "the solution for the Lebanese crisis, but a document for distributing regional and international roles in Lebanon."

Security and foreign policy matters were handed to Syria and the rest, especially economic, was assumed by the U.S.," Wakim said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wakim won the parliamentary elections in 1992 and in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Johnson| first = Michael| title = All honorable men: the social origins of war in Lebanon| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zydtz0dDntQC| year = 2001| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-1-86064-715-4| page = 238| quote = The leftist Greek Orthodox member of parliament, Najah Wakim, a vocal critic of Hariri, also won, but with a reduced share of the vote compared with his 1992 result (MEED, 13 September 1996). }}&lt;/ref&gt; He boycotted the elections in 2000, opposing Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Johnson| first = Michael| title = All honorable men: the social origins of war in Lebanon| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zydtz0dDntQC| year = 2001| publisher = I.B.Tauris| isbn = 978-1-86064-715-4| page = 246| quote = Najah Wakim, the radical Greek Orthodox member of parliament in Beirut, stood down in 2000 rather than tolerate what he described as Syrian interference in the electoral process. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his very strict opposition of the whole Lebanese regime and sectarian leaders.

But in 1998 while in parliament, Wakim voted for the election of Pro-Syrian [[President]] [[Émile Lahoud]]. He maintains strong links to Lebanese pro-Syrian figures such as [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party of Lebanon|Lebanese Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] MP [[Assem Qanso]]. 

In 1999, he founded "The People's Movement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NOW Staff |title=What if there were a second government? |url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=5785 |publisher=NOW Lebanon |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2010-10-30 |quote=A staunch Arabist who describes himself as opposed to “everything,” Wakim founded the People’s Movement or Harakat as-Sha’ab in 1999.  The People’s Movement is, admirably, one of the most confessionally diverse political parties in Lebanon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leftist group that calls for changes in the Lebanese political system and for better relationships between Arab countries. In 2001, his office was burned by arsonists who were not identified.

Najah Wakim was not involved in the pro-Syrian nor the anti-Syrian rallies in March 2005. However after the Syrian withdrawal, he attacked the [[March 14 Alliance]] claiming that the Syrian interference has been replaced with an American invasion of Lebanon. 
Even though the 2005 elections held the election law of 2000, and with an Arab political position, he fought the 2005 elections alone against the Hariri-LF-[[Hezbollah]] allied list and lost.
He also ran for the 2009 elections but lost against the sectarian allies in Beirut.
In the current Lebanese political scandal, Najah Wakim is a strict supporter to Hezbollah's arms and a great opposer to the government, who is currently considered as pro-American by many Lebanese parties. 

Najah Wakim is the author of three books: Al 'Alam Al Thalith Wal Thawra (The Third World and Revolution), Al Ayadi Al Sud (The Black Hands) which is a foray into the political corruption in Lebanon in the days of the prime minister Rafiq Al Hariri. The other book contains his speeches and essays and is called Al Wahm Wal Amal (Illusion and Hope). All three books are in Arabic.

'''Nakaluluwag''' or ''nakakaluwag'' (variants: ''nakakaluwang'' or ''nakaluluwang'') is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[ethic]] wherein the well-off are socially and morally obligated to help those in need. In [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], the term is ''nakaalwan''. It comes from the blending of the Chinese concept of ''wo'' (peace and harmony),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://il.china-embassy.org/eng/sggg/t358216.htm|title=Harmonious World: China's Ancient Philosophy for New International Order|website=il.china-embassy.org|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Malay culture of familiarity even to distant relatives and other clan members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |first=Sir Hugh Charles |last=Clifford |title=Malays |volume=17 |pages=475–478|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42854/42854-h/42854-h.htm#ar122}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Christian teaching of helping the poor.  

== Background ==
There is a traditional Chinese belief that states that in order to have peace and harmony in a kingdom or empire, there should be no extremes in wealth and poverty.  Thus, those who are wealthy should give some of their wealth to those living in destitution. Thus, the poor will not take arms and revolt against those living in opulence. 

With the introduction of Christian teachings by the Spanish missionaries starting in the 16th Century, the indigenous Filipino ethic was somehow refined to benevolence to all those in need, in general. The term and its variants have been incorporated in a number of Tagalog idioms and proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eskwela-apc-nstp.wikispaces.com/Sawikain+at+Salawikain|title=Wikispaces|website=eskwela-apc-nstp.wikispaces.com|access-date=2008-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914144824/http://eskwela-apc-nstp.wikispaces.com/Sawikain+at+Salawikain|archive-date=2008-09-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Spanish and the American colonial periods, and even the Japanese Occupation, as linguistic categorization emerges in the Filipino language as a representation of Filipino world view and causality, the concept of "nakaluluwag" further modified social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between the Filipino language and philosophy.

In some Filipino artworks, those in need are pictured as tightly clinging to what they have, and come into grips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filipinoartworks.com/custom2.html|title=Site Disabled - FreeServers|website=www.filipinoartworks.com|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesphilippines.com/searchimage.php?flagsearch=1&amp;search=poverty&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;logic=AND|title=poverty Philippines: Pictures, Photos, Images and Artworks - Displaying: 1 to 10|website=www.imagesphilippines.com|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While those who are well-off are pictured as willing to let go of some of their possessions for those in need. "Maluwag" or "maluwang" literally means lightly held, loose, or spacious. It may also imply sufficient freedom to move around or having a comfortable space to work on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sulit.com.ph/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7313|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070814214946/http://www.sulit.com.ph/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7313|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-08-14|title=Advertising link |website=OLX.ph|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term implies willingness in giving and helping: "''maluwag sa kalooban''" and those familiar with [[accounting]] concepts often substitute the term "liquid" as in "''Liquid'' ka ba ngayon? Puede bang makahiram?" ("Are you ''liquid'' at this time? Can you lend me some amount?").

Even some Filipino grade school children form small informal cooperatives and do ''paluwagan'' which is essentially a group money lending scheme. However, the term ''magpaluwal'' has become synonymous with simple money lending, while the ethic ''nakaluluwag'' involves giving. 

== Academic interpretations of Nakualuluwag ==
This Filipino ethic of giving includes some sacrifice on the part of the giver: the person giving (nakaluluwag) should at the very least, feel some discomfort. One should "get hurt" by his or her act of giving. Otherwise the essence of sacrifice will be absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dakilapinoy.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/ang-editoryal-bilang-lunsaran-ng-panunuri/|title=Ang Editoryal bilang Lunsaran ng Panunuri|date=8 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar but not identical to the Christian [[lesson of the widow's mite]] present in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|12:38-44}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|20:45-47}},{{bibleverse||Luke|21:1-4}}).

The concept also includes relativism: some may be poor but they can consider themselves "nakaluluwag" to those who are much poorer, as rendered in a Tagalog commentary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bible.claret.org/bibles/bsp_pdf/2-OLD%20TESTAMENT/4-Mga%20Propeta/2_Jeremiah/2_Jer%2020-36.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|24:1}}. Even Filipino converts to the Church of the Latter-Day Saints ([[Mormon]]) translates the phrase "the rich" as "nakaluluwag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,49-8-33-3,00.html|title=General Conference Sessions - Archive of Previous Conferences|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day|last=Saints|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those taking the [[Conflict theory]] approach to the study of society may suspect the true intentions of the "nakaluluwag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bulatlat.com/2008/02/kalayaan-midya-si-jun-lozada |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106064506/http://www.bulatlat.com/2008/02/kalayaan-midya-si-jun-lozada |archive-date=2009-01-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some consider more than the financial aspect of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abante-tonite.com/issue/apr1708/entertainment_joe.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724062604/http://www.abante-tonite.com/issue/apr1708/entertainment_joe.htm |archive-date=2010-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethic involves fulfillment in doing a social obligation.&lt;ref&gt;http://simplyrachel.onewickedsoul.com/wp/?p=172{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Filipino concept appears to be present even for the Filipino emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/55032/Engineer-sa-Pinas-janitor-sa-Canada|title=Engineer sa Pinas, janitor sa Canada|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Antonio Levy S. Ingles Jr.]] of [[De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dls-csb.edu.ph{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; this Filipino ethic is priceless and may bring about peace and harmony during times of crisis. He claims that "it is a Filipino affirmation of a sustainable [[world view]] and global care-giving ethic".

The '''Niskanen Center''' is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[think tank]] that advocates for [[environmentalism]], [[immigration]] reform, [[civil liberties]], and a [[national security|national defense]] policy based on market principles.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url = https://niskanencenter.org/about/|title = About|publisher = Niskanen Center|accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/01/29/libertarian-group-aims-to-influence-immigration-climate-change-policies/|title = Libertarian Group Aims to Influence Immigration, Climate-Change Policies|last = O'Connor|first = Patrick|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|date = January 29, 2015|accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=richardcyoung&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.richardcyoung.com/essential-news/breaking-news-new-libertarian-think-tank/|title = Breaking News: A New Libertarian Think Tank|last = Young|first = Richard C.|date = January 30, 2015|accessdate = December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center is named after the late [[William A. Niskanen]], a former economic adviser to president [[Ronald Reagan]]. The Niskanen Center states that its "main audience is Washington insiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/announcing-the-niskanen-center-summer-2016-internship-program-2/|title=Announcing the Niskanen Center Summer 2016 Internship Program - Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Niskanen Center was founded in early 2015 by [[Jerry Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-libertarian-think-tank-the-niskanen-center-launches-with-focus-on-congressional-action-300041804.html|title=Niskanen Center, New Libertarian Think Tank, Launches with Focus on Congressional Action|first=Niskanen|last=Center|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its launch, the center was composed primarily of former staffers of the [[Cato Institute]] who departed in the wake of a 2012 leadership struggle pitting [[Ed Crane (political activist)|Ed Crane]] against the [[Koch Brothers]] for control of the libertarian think tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/635229|title = The Cato Institute Switches Out Captains|publisher = [[NewsMax]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niskanen Center founder Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://kochvcato.com/author/jcogburntaylor/|title = Jerry Taylor|publisher = Koch v. Cato}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vice president Joe Coon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://kochvcato.com/author/joeycoon/|title = Joey Coon|publisher = Koch v. Cato}}&lt;/ref&gt; publicly aligned themselves with Crane during the dispute. Both departed shortly after Crane was replaced by [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] as president of Cato as part of the settlement with the Kochs.

Funding for the center includes donors who seek to counter [[libertarian conservatism|libertarian conservative]] hostility to anti-global warming measures. [[North Carolina]] businessman [[Jay Faison]], a Republican donor, made an early contribution to the Niskanen Center to spur public climate education &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/06/10/this-conservative-businessman-wants-to-change-the-gops-mind-on-climate-change/|title = This businessman thinks he can change the GOP's mind on climate change|last = Mooney|first = Chris|date = June 10, 2015|accessdate = January 16, 2016|publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has ceased all ties to the organization in recent years. Some supporters of the Niskanen Center are more traditionally aligned with [[left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] causes. They include the [[Open Philanthropy Project]], which supports the Center's work to expand legal immigration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Niskanen Immigration Policy Grant {{!}} GiveWell|url = http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/labor-mobility/niskanen-immigration|website = GiveWell|access-date = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lawrence Linden Trust for Conservation, which provided the Niskanen Center with a grant "to develop and analyze a potential economy-wide carbon tax",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lindentrust.org/about/recent_grants.php |title=Recent Grants (archived from May 2015) |publisher=Lawrence Linden Trust for Conservation |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503082117/http://www.lindentrust.org/about/recent_grants.php |archivedate=May 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a $400,000 operations grant from the [[Hewlett Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hewlett.org/grants/24454/niskanen-center|title=Grants|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and guidelines ==

{{Cleanup|reason=this subsection reads like promotional literature for the subject of the article|date=January 2016}}

The Niskanen Center focuses on producing advice on libertarian-friendly legislation and regulation by working within the existing political framework. The target audience is influential Washington insiders, rather than the general public, including policy-oriented legislators, presidential appointees, career civil servants in planning, evaluation and budget offices, congressional committee staff, engaged academics, and interest group analysts.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The Center's activities is guided by its reading of the research on the determinants of public opinion.&lt;ref name=conspectus&gt;{{cite web|url = https://niskanen.s3.amazonaws.com/Niskanen%20Center%20Conspectus.pdf|title = Niskanen Center Conspectus|publisher = Niskanen Center|accessdate = December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center seeks embrace relative policy improvements, which includes putting forth [[theory of the second best|second best]] or even third best or fourth best solutions, rather than a single, optimal one, and seeks to include the preferences of potential allies who do not share its beliefs.
== Policy areas ==

The Niskanen Center focuses on four distinct areas of public policy: climate change, foreign policy and defense, immigration reform, and technology and civil liberties.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

=== Climate change ===

The Niskanen Center advocates for the imposition of a global [[carbon tax]] for the purpose of offsetting [[global warming]] and the effects of climate change. In outlining the case for a carbon tax, Taylor proposed a revenue-neutral measure that will be enforced through a global [[tariff]] scheme to enforce compliance among participating nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf|title = The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax|last = Taylor|first = Jerry|publisher = Niskanen Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Niskanen Center also endorses the understanding of climate change as [[Anthropogenic climate change|anthropogenic]] and believes that government action is a necessary component of mitigating the risks associated with long term sea level rise and extreme weather events associated with climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://niskanencenter.org/blog/libertarian-principles-climate-change/|title = Libertarian Principles &amp; Climate Change|date = April 6, 2015|accessdate = December 10, 2015|publisher = Niskanen Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Niskanen Center's support for carbon taxation represents a nearly complete reversal of Taylor's previous advocacy at the [[Cato Institute]], where he was a vocal climate change skeptic. Taylor was the featured guest on an hour-long episode of the [[John Stossel]] show in 2009 in which he advanced arguments against anthropogenic global warming and opposed government action to address climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW_UWzyXEsI|title = Stossel&amp;nbsp;– Global Climate Change |date= December 10, 2009|publisher = ''[[YouTube]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor explained his shift in a 2015 interview with Vox.com, indicating that he had "fundamentally switched" his previous beliefs on the issue after seeing new scientific evidence and the more general strengthening over time of the case for the dangers of climate change, as well as arguments from fellow libertarians about responses to the challenge of climate change that were consistent with and even required by a libertarian political stance.&lt;ref name=vox&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.vox.com/2015/5/12/8588273/the-arguments-that-convinced-this-libertarian-to-support-a-carbon-tax|title = he arguments that convinced a libertarian to support aggressive action on climate|last = Roberts|first = David|date = May 12, 2015|accessdate = December 18, 2015|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-pope/let-the-dialogue-resume_b_7173440.html|title = Let the Dialogue Resume!|date = April 29, 2015|accessdate = December 10, 2015|last = Pope|first = Carl|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor's first doubts on the issue came when he discovered that scientists on whom he had relied to come to the opinion that climate change would not be as great a problem as the [[scientific consensus on climate change]] suggests were privately aware with problems in their public stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="OTMtaylorInterview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Brooke|authorlink1=Brooke Gladstone|title=How to Turn Climate Change Skeptics Into Advocates|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/turn-climate-change-skeptics-advocates?tab=transcript|accessdate=October 27, 2017|work=[[On the Media]]|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, while debating climate activist [[Joe Romm]], he based part of his argument on the fact that the world had not warmed as much as [[NASA]] climate scientist [[James Hansen]] had predicted it would in his 1988 congressional testimony.&lt;ref name="OTMtaylorInterview"/&gt; Romm pointed out that the reason for Hansen's high estimate for warming over the intervening time period was that global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions had grown much more slowly than Hansen had predicted, and that observed warming had actually been entirely consistent with Hansen's projections for a scenario in which global emissions were at the levels that had actually occurred.&lt;ref name="OTMtaylorInterview"/&gt; When Taylor followed up on this with scientists allied with Cato on whom he had relied in the past, they "seemed to be fully aware of the problems with their narratives but they didn't care. Look, I'm not a scientist but I had trusted these scientists to well inform me on the matters, and I can no longer really trust them."&lt;ref name="OTMtaylorInterview"/&gt;

Robert Bradley of the [[Institute for Energy Research]], a former colleague of Taylor's during his time as a climate skeptic, has countered that Taylor's shift coincides with his appeal for donors in the climate activist community to "financially father" his new institute following the break from Cato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.masterresource.org/niskanen-center/taylor-vs-taylor-1/|title = Jerry Taylor: Old vs. New (what would Bill Niskanen say?)|last = Bradley|first = Robert|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 the Niskanen Center announced the founding of a new Center for Climate Science under the direction of Dr. [[Joseph Majkut]], a climatologist who previously served on the staff of Sen. [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] (D-RI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/124026|title = Conservative-to-Conservative Outreach Heats Up Climate-Science Debate|date = December 1, 2015|last = Geman|first = Ben|accessdate = January 16, 2016|publisher = ''[[National Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Climate Science publishes analysis of climatology research in support of anthropogenic theories of global warming. Majkut has sought to position the Niskanen Center as an opponent of the Cato Institute's Dr. [[Patrick J. Michaels]], a prominent skeptic within the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/is-there-a-divergence-between-climate-models-and-temperature-data/|title=Is There a Divergence between Climate Models and Temperature Data? - Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===

The Niskanen Center argues for expanding [[immigration to the United States]]. In particular, they have argued for protecting the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program in the United States, increasing low-skilled immigration, and getting the United States to increase its refugee intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://niskanencenter.org/blog/four-ways-to-provide-legal-pathways-for-lesser-skilled-immigrants/|title = Four Ways to Provide Legal Pathways for Lesser-Skilled Immigrants|last = Bier|first = David|date = June 9, 2015|accessdate = December 18, 2015|publisher = Niskanen Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://niskanencenter.org/blog/six-reasons-to-welcome-syrian-refugees-after-paris/|title = Six Reasons to Welcome Syrian Refugees After Paris|last = Bier|first = David|publisher = Niskanen Center|date = November 16, 2015|accessdate = December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Good Ventures]], a private foundation run by [[Facebook]] co-founder [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and his wife Cari Tuna, made a $360,000 grant to the Niskanen Center in October 2015 to support its work on immigration policy, specifically the hiring of an Immigration Policy Counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/niskanen-center-support-for-research-on-immigration-policy|title = Niskanen Center&amp;nbsp;— Research on Immigration Policy|date = October 1, 2015|accessdate = December 18, 2015|publisher = [[Good Ventures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant was made as part of the [[Open Philanthropy Project]], a spinoff of a collaboration between Good Ventures and charity evaluator [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes/labor-mobility/niskanen-immigration|title = Niskanen Immigration Policy Grant|publisher = Open Philanthropy Project|date = October 1, 2015|accessdate = December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.immigrationadvocates.org/nonprofit/jobs/item.6503-Immigration_Policy_Counsel_Niskanen_Center|title = Immigration Policy Counsel, Niskanen Center |accessdate = December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology and civil liberties ===
The Niskanen Center advocates a civil libertarian position on issues of privacy, cybersecurity, surveillance, and technology policy. Some of their issue areas include robotics and automation (in particular commercial drones and autonomous vehicles), [[encryption]] and cybersecurity, commercial outer space policy, and issues relating to the [[Internet of Things]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RESEARCH-PAPER_EncryptionEconomicBenefits.pdf|title = Encryption, Trust, and the Online Economy: An Assessment of the Economic Benefits Associated with Encryption|date = November 9, 2015|access-date = |website = |publisher = Niskanen Center|last = Hagemann|first = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.capx.co/the-future-of-transportation-autonomous-electric-and-looped/|title = The Future of Transportation: Autonomous, Electric, and Looped|date = December 29, 2015|access-date = |website = CapX|publisher = |last = Hagemann|first = Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/news/future-space-commercialization/|title=The Future of Space Commercialization |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department advocates for light-touch policy approaches to emerging technologies.

==== Automation and the future of work ====
In June 2017 the Niskanen Center published two posts on how automation interplays with American politics. While the center is optimistic about the long-run benefits of automation, the center did express concern about the potential short-run political repercussions.&lt;ref name="niskanencenter.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/21st-century-automation-time-truly-different/|title=21st Century Automation: Is This Time Truly Different? |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The debate is often cast between the "job elimination deniers" and the apocalyptic doomsayers, but there is a great deal of substance and nuance that is lost in such a (mis)characterization. The real questions are what the intervening period of dislocation looks like, who gets hurt the hardest, and what the short-term political ramifications of this dynamic transformation means for the people experiencing those changes first hand.&lt;ref name="niskanencenter.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second post examined potential policy reforms that could be used to ameliorate those risks. These included reforming housing policies, education policies, and social safety net provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/21st-century-automation-policy-responses/|title=21st Century Automation: Policy Responses |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civil liberties ====
In particular, the technology and civil liberties department focuses on reforming government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Remembering September 11th: Where We Were, Where We Are, and Where We're Heading|url = http://townhall.com/columnists/ryanhagemann/2015/09/11/remembering-september-11th-where-we-were-where-we-are-and-where-were-heading-n2050670/page/full|website = townhall.com|access-date = January 21, 2016|first = Ryan|last = Hagemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; As discussed in the department's blog:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As technology has advanced, the idea of total surveillance has leaped from the pages of fiction into reality. Americans are now confronted with a near-Orwellian surveillance system that threatens to abscond with the basic civil liberties guaranteed to every American under the auspices of the U.S. Constitution. Where once courts produced warrants in the public forum, the process has now become opaque as secret courts ordering secret warrants under secret interpretations of law have become a way of life. Under such a system, there can never be a presumption of innocence, or the guarantee of a free and open exchange of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About {{!}} Panopticontra|url = https://panopticontra.com/about/|website = Panopticontra|access-date = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Foreign policy and defense ===
The Center's Foreign Policy and Defense department is led by Matt Fay and focuses on reforming the spending and appropriations practices of the Department of Defense and U.S. armed forces. Fay, in his blog ''Dollars and Defense'', notes that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Pentagon often makes ill-advised choices about future needs, and Congress pushes programs that create jobs in individual districts but do little to improve America's security. Moreover, the Department of Defense is a bureaucracy. It is subject to any number of pathologies from which all bureaucracies suffer. In fact, given its size, it is even more likely to fall prey to dysfunction. Scarcity can provide discipline. It can force useful tradeoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About {{!}} Dollars &amp; Defense|url = https://dollarsanddefense.com/about/|website = Dollars &amp; Defense|access-date = January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Poverty and welfare ===
The Center's Poverty &amp; Welfare department is currently headed by Samuel Hammond, who earned his bachelor's degree in economics with honors from Saint Mary's University and his master's in economics from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/staff/3319/|title=Poverty and Welfare Analyst |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond's work focuses on improving the efficiency of the United States' welfare system, and has examined the role of welfare state in the United States,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/what-is-the-welfare-state-for/|title=What Is the "Free Market Welfare State" For? |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/how-our-broken-welfare-system-threatens-economic-growth/|title=How Our Broken Welfare System Threatens Economic Growth |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the merits of a child allowance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/bad-arguments-child-allowance/|title=Bad Arguments Against a Child Allowance |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; universal basic income,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/ubi-pro-work/|title=The Pro-work Case for Universal Basic Income |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dependency (or lack thereof) of immigrants on government programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/report-myth-government-dependent-immigrant/|title=Report: The Myth of the Government-Dependent Immigrant |publisher=Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its poverty and welfare department, the Niskanen Center is also a part of the Economic Security Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://economicsecurityproject.org/|title=Economic Security Project|website=Economic Security Project|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to "comprehensively explore the merits of a universal basic income."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/press-release-niskanen-center-joins-economic-security-project/|title=Niskanen Center Joins the Economic Security Security Project|publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==

The Niskanen Center was founded and is led by [[Jerry Taylor]], who formerly worked at the [[Cato Institute]], where he served as director of natural resource studies, assistant editor of ''[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]'' magazine, senior fellow, and then vice president. Before that, Taylor was the staff director for the energy and environment task force at the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC).&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; [[Will Wilkinson]], who also previously worked at the Cato Institute, is the Niskanen Center's Vice President of Policy.

Advisory Board members include [[Yoram Bauman]], [[Tom G. Palmer]], [[John H. Cochrane]], [[Tyler Cowen]], [[Grover Norquist]], [[Reihan Salam]], [[Virginia Postrel]], [[Matt Zwolinski]], and [[Jacob T. Levy]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

The Niskanen Center also has several prominent senior fellows, including Steven Teles, Jacob T. Levy, Ed Dolan, and Linda Chavez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/about/|title=About |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy and political theory ==
The Niskanen Center has sought to differentiate itself from other think tanks on the [[Conservatism in the United States|political right]] by espousing a position of strategic compromise, including on issue areas that break from doctrinaire [[noninterventionism|noninterventionist]] and [[free market|free-market]] positions. In addition to taking an aggressive stance in favor of climate change action and [[carbon tax]]es, the center generally supports the maintenance of a more robust welfare state [[safety net]] in exchange for other market reforms. Vice President for Policy Will Wilkinson advocates a [[social democracy]]-style system that incorporates the position of [[liberalism|liberal]] political philosopher [[John Rawls]]. This ideal mirrors European states such as [[Denmark]] that pair free trade liberalism and labor market reform with heavy unemployment benefits and a public healthcare system.&lt;ref name="de-denmark"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/double-edged-denmark/|last=Wilkinson|first=Will|title=Double Edged Denmark |date=October 15, 2015|publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=November 26, 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, the Niskanen Center published a post on the "libertarian case" for [[democratic socialism|socialist]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]]. As Wilkinson wrote, "The libertarian case for Bernie Sanders is simply that Bernie Sanders wants to make America more like Denmark, Canada, or Sweden ... and the citizens of those countries enjoy more liberty than Americans do. No other candidate specifically aims to make the United States more closely resemble a freer country."&lt;ref name="lib-case-for-bernie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/is-there-a-libertarian-case-for-bernie-sanders/|last=Wilkinson|first=Will|title=Is There a Libertarian Case for Bernie Sanders?|date=February 11, 2016|publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor seconded this position, asserting that there is a "case to be made that Sanders has been the most libertarian candidate in the presidential race" and calling for a "more thoughtful re-draft of the Sanders agenda." Taylor further linked this case for Sanders to a broader reformulation of political libertarianism, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Were libertarians to ungrudgingly accept the case for a more adequate social safety net (a case, after all, accepted to some extent by libertarian heroes F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman) and give up on their blanket, dogmatic opposition to all regulation and market intervention (a perfect example is their remarkable hostility to mainstream climate science), they'd find a ticket to intellectual respectability. They would also find a ticket to political relevancy&amp;nbsp;— something that is being well demonstrated by the Bernie Sanders campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is There a Future for Libertarianism?|url=http://www.realclearpolicy.com/blog/2016/02/23/is_there_a_future_for_libertarianism_1563.html|last=Taylor|first=Jerry|website=RealClearPolicy|publisher=RealClear Media Group|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Their arguments for Sanders provoked a heated discussion by other libertarian commentators about whether there was a case to be made for Bernie Sanders. [[Megan McArdle]] countered that the thought of backing Sanders was "fun, but not convincing." "We heard a similar argument about Obamacare spurring entrepreneurship, which sounded splendid except for the total lack of evidence that national health care schemes had caused entrepreneurship to surge anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-02-19/a-libertarian-case-for-sanders-it-s-fun-but-not-convincing|title=A Libertarian Case for Sanders? It's Fun But Not Convincing|last=McArdle|first=Megan|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2018|website=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Chicago economist [[John H. Cochrane|John Cochrane]] echoed this assessment by noting the political dangers of "libertarians for Sanders" position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-libertarian-case-for-bernie-sanders.html|title=The Grumpy Economist: The Libertarian Case for Bernie Sanders|first=John H.|last=Cochrane|date=February 12, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the argument put forward by Wilkinson and Taylor may have been more of a thought exercise in relative tradeoffs between aspects of economic freedoms. As written by Wilkinson in the post:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The biggest problem with my particularist, data-first libertarian argument for Bernie Sanders is that Bernie Sanders doesn't seem to actually understand that Denmark-style social democracy is funded by a free-market capitalist system that is in many ways less regulated than American capitalism.&lt;ref name="lib-case-for-bernie" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This critique had been outlined in an earlier piece by Wilkinson, in which he wrote: "The lesson Bernie Sanders needs to learn is that you cannot finance a Danish-style welfare state without free markets and large tax increases on the middle class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/double-edged-denmark/|title=Double-Edged Denmark |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical exercise or not, the idea of a "libertarian case for Bernie Sanders" helped contribute to a debate among libertarians about ideological priors during the 2016 election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/13/is-there-a-libertarian-case-for-bernie-sanders/|title=Opinion {{!}} Is there a libertarian case for Bernie Sanders?|website=Washington Post|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Niskanen Center has challenged some of the engrained policy ideas of the right-leaning American libertarian orbit, including on the role of the welfare state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/libertarian-principles-niskanen-and-welfare-policy/|title=Libertarian Principles, Niskanen, and Welfare Policy |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and government in market economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/good-government-can-reconcile-economic-freedom-welfare-state/|title=Good Government Can Reconcile Economic Freedom and the Welfare State |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2016 U.S. elections, the Niskanen Center also began to focus on the importance of institutions in protecting economic and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/liberalism-beyond-markets/|title=Liberalism Beyond Markets |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has included examinations of legitimacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/care-whether-trump-legitimate-winner-election/|title=Should We Care Whether Trump Was the Legitimate Winner of the Election? |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/26/15697178/legitimacy-trump-presidency-resist-corruption-constitution|title=It may be time to disobey the commander in chief|work=Vox|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sovereignty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/sovereign-myth/|title=The Sovereign Myth |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political discourse,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/lowering-the-stakes/|title=Three Ways to Lower the Stakes of Political Disagreement |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/the-why-and-how-of-reasonable-disagreement/|title=The Why and How of Reasonable Disagreement |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role of protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/op-ed-walking-better-shouting/|title=Op-ed: Why Walking Out Is Better Than Shouting Down |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship between socialism and fascism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/the-shortcut-to-serfdom/|title=The Shortcut to Serfdom |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political resentment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/liberalism-needs-resentment/|title=Why Liberalism Needs Resentment |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nepotism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://niskanencenter.org/blog/government-laws-not-son-laws/|title=A Government of Laws, Not Son-in-Laws |publisher= Niskanen Center|website=niskanencenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other issues.

=== Critiques of philosophical approaches ===
The Niskanen Center's rejection of the traditional libertarian position on free markets in favor of [[regulatory state|regulated]] [[mixed economy|mixed markets]], and its embrace of an incremental approach to achieve political victories, has come under broader criticism, particularly on the global warming issue. Robert Bradley of the [[Institute for Energy Research]] and former colleague of Taylor called upon the Niskanen Center to abandon its current name and claim to the "libertarian" label, noting that the late [[William A. Niskanen]] was personally skeptical of many of the climate change policies that they now advocate.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bradley, "Jerry Taylor Old vs. New: What would Bill Niskanen say? [https://www.masterresource.org/niskanen-center/taylor-vs-taylor-1/]; Robert Bradley, "Jerry Taylor: Climate Change as Political Theater" [https://www.masterresource.org/debate-issues/taylor-on-climate-1998/]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been campaigns in the United Kingdom for its government to open up the large amounts of data it has for greater public usage without prohibitively large fees. Currently{{when|date=September 2016}} some UK public sector data are released under a Creative Commons compatible licence.

[[Crown copyright#United Kingdom|Crown Copyright]] has been a long-standing copyright protection applied to official works, and at times artistic works, produced under royal or official supervision. ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's Technology section began a "Free Our Data" campaign, calling for data gathered by authorities at public expense to be made freely available for reuse by individuals.
In 2010 with the creation of the Open Government Licence and the [[Data.gov.uk]] site it appeared that the campaign had been mostly successful.
On 12 January 2011 the [[Coalition Government]] revealed that it was planning to establish a [[Public Data Corporation]] (PDC). The goal being to make the UK Government data provided in a much more consistent fashion as well as freeing more data for public and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/public-data-corporation-free-public-data-and-drive-innovation|title=Public Data Corporation to free up public data and drive innovation|accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the PDC was later dropped in favour of grouping a number of government data providing organisations to form the [[Public Data Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-advisory-groups/public-data-group|title=Public Data Group|publisher=gov.uk|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Met Office===
The [[Met Office]] is the national [[weather]] service. Its main role is to produce forecast models by gathering all the information from [[weather satellite]]s in space and observations on earth. The principal weather products for UK customers are 36-hour forecasts from the newly-operational 1.5&amp;nbsp;km resolution UKV model covering the UK and surroundings (replacing the 4&amp;nbsp;km model), 48-hour forecasts from the 12&amp;nbsp;km resolution NAE model covering [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]], and 144-hour forecasts from the 25&amp;nbsp;km resolution global model (replacing the 40&amp;nbsp;km global model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/weather-forecasting |title=Met Office Atmospheric numerical model configurations |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of other products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad, provided for [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa. This main bulk of data are then passed on to companies who acquire it. Data are stored in the Met Office's own [[PP-format]].
The Met Office held the base data involved in the [[Climatic Research Unit hacking incident]] and released information to the public alongside the [[Climatic Research Unit]] when pressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/copenhagen-climate-change-confe/6678469/Climategate-University-of-East-Anglia-U-turn-in-climate-change-row.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=2011-01-12|title=Climategate University of East Anglia U-turn in climate change row|location=London|first=Robert|last=Mendick|date=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordnance Survey===
[[Ordnance Survey]] has been subject to criticisms. Most criticism centres on the point that Ordnance Survey possesses a virtual government monopoly on geographic data in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1726229,00.html|title=Give us back our crown jewels|work=The Guardian|date=2006-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while, although a government agency, since 1999 it has been required to act as a [[Trading Fund]] or commercial entity. This means that it is supposed to be totally self-funding from the commercial sale of its data and derived products - whilst at the same time it is supposed to be the public supplier of geographical information. In 1985 the "Committee of Enquiry into the Handling of Geographic Information" was set up in order to “advise the Secretary of State for the Environment within two years on the future handling of geographic information in the UK, taking account of modern developments in information technology and market needs”. The Committee's final report was published under the name of its chairman, [[Roger Chorley, 2nd Baron Chorley|Roger Chorley]], in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/21/5/571.full.pdf+html|author=Chorley, R.R.E.|date=1987|title=Handling Geographic Information. Report of the Committee of Enquiry|work=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stressed the importance of widely available geographic information to the UK and recommended a loosening of government policies on distribution and cost recovery.

Ordnance Survey historical works are generally available, as the agency is covered by [[Crown Copyright]]: works more than fifty years old, including historic surveys of Britain and Ireland and much of the New Popular Edition, are in the public domain. However, finding suitable originals remains an issue as Ordnance Survey does not provide historical mapping on 'free' terms, instead marketing commercially 'enhanced' reproductions in partnership with Landmark Information Group.&lt;ref name="PublicData.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicdata.eu/es/dataset/landmark-historic-ordnance-survey-national-grid-1-10560-maps|title=Landmark Historic Ordnance Survey National Grid 1:10,560 Maps|publisher=PublicData.eu|accessdate=2014-01-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104035413/http://publicdata.eu/es/dataset/landmark-historic-ordnance-survey-national-grid-1-10560-maps|archivedate=2014-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be contrasted with, for example, the approach in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in more recent times, where [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] claims regular copyright over its mapping (and over digital copies of the public domain historical mapping).

===Transport Direct===
[[Transport Direct]] is a division of the [[UK]] [[Department for Transport]] to develop better information technology systems to support public transport. Traveline has created a comprehensive database of all public transport movements in the United Kingdom and it is used to power the [[Transport Direct Portal]]. Since the launch of the Portal in December 2004 there have been growing calls for the [[public transport timetable|public transport schedule]] data, which is generally owned by the transport operator, to be made available as [[Open data]].

The development of Traveline and Transport Direct has created a number of comprehensive national datasets to support the [[Transport Direct Portal]]. The assessment of accessibility to services by public transport was made a requirement for the [[Local Transport Plan]]s in 2004. Measuring the level of accessibility required the use of the data collected by Traveline.&lt;ref name="MVA Consultancy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvaconsultancy.com/news/2004/SteveNorrisAccession.htm|title=Steven Norris at Launch of DfT's ACCESSION Software|publisher=MVA Consultancy|accessdate=2010-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115201157/http://www.mvaconsultancy.com/news/2004/SteveNorrisAccession.htm|archivedate=2008-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This data are being used by an increasing number of 3rd parties, including [[Google Transit]] (South East Traveline Region)&lt;ref name="Google Trip planning for Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/11/google-transit-trip-planning-in-europe.html|title=Google Trip planning for Europe|publisher=Google|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and East Anglia / East Midlands Traveline Regions.&lt;ref name="Autumn updates for Google Transit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2009/11/autumn-updates-for-google-transit.html|title=Autumn updates for Google Transit|publisher=Google|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mySociety]]'s [[Mapumental]] accessibility product.&lt;ref name="Say hello to Mapumental"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysociety.org/2009/06/01/say-hello-to-mapumental/|title=Say hello to Mapumental|publisher=My Society|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010 increasing amounts of data has become available as [[Open Data]] including NaPTAN and NPTDR.

===Environment Agency===
Environment Agency provides Open data are through its [http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/catalogue/#/catalogue Spatial Data Catalogue]. [[Lidar]] and other survey datasets are also available through its [http://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey/#/survey Survey Open Data] web portal.

===United Kingdom Hydrographic Office===
The [[UK Hydrographic Office]] is another data holder in the UK who has been listed by Free Our Data as a government office which is charging for the use of its data that Free Our Data believes should be opened for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/ordnancereply.php|title=Ordnance Reply|accessdate=2011-01-12|publisher=Free Our Data.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Hydrographic Office has data on tidal patterns and the position of astronomical bodies used in navigation, as well as being the primary holder of data for nautical charts, not just in the UK but also in many foreign locations, covering features such as bathymetry (depth), wrecks, underwater cables and pipelines, navigation buoys and lighthouses, and coastal features of interest to the mariner. Some of the hydrographic survey data is now being made available through the [https://www.gov.uk/inspire-portal-and-medin-bathymetry-data-archive-centre MEDIN] portal as a result of the EU's INSPIRE initiative.

==History==
In March 2006 ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's Technology section began a "Free Our Data" campaign, calling for the raw data gathered by Ordnance Survey (not to mention data gathered on its behalf by local authorities at public expense) to be made freely available for reuse by individuals and companies, as happens, for example, with such data in the USA. However, Ordnance Survey claimed that the quality of the freely available government mapping in the USA is low or variable because of funding issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/ordnancereply.php|title=Free Our Data: Articles: the Ordnance Survey official response|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 7 April 2006 the [[Office of Public Sector Information]] (OPSI) received a complaint from the data management company Intelligent Addressing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060715152154/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/advice/psi-regulations/complaints/SO-42-8-4.pdf OPSI]&lt;/ref&gt; Many, although not all, complaints were upheld by the OPSI, one of the conclusions being that Ordnance Survey "is offering licence terms which unnecessarily restrict competition". Negotiations between Ordnance Survey and interested parties are ongoing with regard to the issues raised by the OPSI report, Ordnance Survey being under no obligation to comply with the report's recommendations.

In June 2006 the Free our data campaign asked "In an age when it is not seen as appropriate for the public sector to run power stations or railways, why is it running nationalised industries in what should be the most dynamic sector of all, the web-based knowledge economy?" And said that "The question lies at the heart of our campaign, which argues that government’s role should be to collect and administer high-quality raw data, but make it freely available to everyone to create innovative services". Transport Direct's chief executive, Nick Ilsley, said that research by the department prior to Transport Direct’s launch had showed the private sector was not interested in providing a one-stop all-purpose site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/blog/2006/06/why-is-the-government-trying-to-corner-the-market-for-travel-direction-sites/|title=Why is the government trying to corner the market for travel-direction sites?|work=Free our data|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, [[Cabinet Office]] Minister [[Hilary Armstrong]] commissioned [[Ed Mayo]] and [[MySociety]] director Tom Steinberg to draft a "Power of Information Review" on how the government could serve the public's information needs better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2007/070405_power.asp?ID=251|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125194854/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/newsroom/news_releases/2007/070405_power.asp?ID=251|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-11-25|title=The Power of Information Review: online advice sites could improve citizen empowerment|publisher=Cabinet Office|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting report led Cabinet Minister [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]], MP to create a 'Power of Information Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofinformation.wordpress.com/about/|title= Power of Information Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since August 2007, Ordnance Survey has contracted the [[Political lobbying#United Kingdom|political lobbying]] company [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=AS_Biss_%26_Co Mandate Communications]&lt;ref&gt;{{UK Parliament | date= 1 May 2008| place= Written Questions | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-05-01b.202287.h |column=668W| speaker= [[Greg Clark]]|title= Ordnance Survey: Mandate Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help campaign against the free data movement and discover which politicians and advisers support Open Data or have questioned Ordnance Survey policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/21/politicsandtechnology|title=Ordnance Survey hires PR company to lobby politicians|date=21 August 2008|first=Michael|last=Cross|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 MySociety requested to OPSI that the dataset should be made available for re-use as [[Open Data]] rather than at a charge of £7,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/unlocking-service/2008/09/15/NationalPublicTransportDataRepository|title=National Public Transport  Data Repository|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=2010-03-27|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081023122318/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/unlocking-service/2008/09/15/NationalPublicTransportDataRepository|archivedate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008 [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] MP, [[Parliamentary Secretary]] at the [[Cabinet Office]] said that &lt;!-- what? --&gt;pledged to turn upside down the British public's "recipient relationship" with official information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/apr/03/freeourdata.politics|title=Report backs freer use of data|accessdate=2010-03-27 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Michael | last=Cross | date=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Power of Information Taskforce Report' was published by the Cabinet Office in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poit.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/poit/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/poit-report-final-pdf.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100413152047/http://poit.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/poit/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/poit-report-final-pdf.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-13|title=Poer of Information Task Force Report|publisher=Cabinet Office|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that although the National Public  Transport Data Repository, described itself as ‘Crown Copyright’ investigations showed this database is not actually government data and that the NPTDR charges significant fees for use. The report suggested that there should be a presumption in favour of information which has been created by public sector bodies being available for re-use.  They also suggested that there should be a clear and consistent copyright and licensing rules applied making it easy to work with data from multiple sources in the public sector. They recommended a 'Crown Commons' style approach with "highly permissive licensing scheme that is transparent, easy to understand and easy to use, modelled on the 'Click Use' licence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/corp/assets/publications/reports/power_information/poi_interim.pdf|title=Power of Information Taskforce Report|page=24|publisher=Cabinet Office|accessdate=2010-03-27|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081229162456/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/corp/assets/publications/reports/power_information/poi_interim.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in February 2009 Tom Watson MP from the Cabinet Office advised that the UK government would put [[Open-source software]] on equal footing for procurement; stating that "Procurement decisions will be made on the basis on the best value for money solution to the business requirement, taking account of total lifetime cost of ownership of the solution, including exit and transition costs, after ensuring that solutions fulfil minimum and essential capability, security, scalability, transferability, support and manageability requirements." and "Where there is no significant overall cost difference between open and non-open source products, open source will be selected on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/feb/24/opensource-internet|title=UK government puts open source software on equal footing for procurement|work=The Guardian|date=2009-02-24|accessdate=2010-03-27|location=London | first=Charles | last=Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 Tom Watson MP mused on his website under the title "Wacky terms and conditions" about why the DirectGov version of the transport direct portal included this condition: “you may retrieve and display Content from the Website on an electronic visual display device, print individual pages on paper (but not photocopy them)”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2009/08/directgov-terms-and-conditions/|title=Directgov terms and conditions|work=Tom Watson MP|accessdate=2010-03-27|date=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 Sir [[Tim Berners Lee]] and Professor [[Nigel Shadbolt]] who had been appointed by Gordon Brown to advise the Government on how to make data more accessible to the public were invited to Number 10 Downing Street to present their early findings to the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20595|title=PM welcomes Sir Tim Berners-Lee to Downing Street|publisher=Number10|accessdate=2010-03-28|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091005122636/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20595|archivedate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 Tom Watson MP questioned why railway timetables were the train operators' private intellectual property. He asked Junior transport minister [[Chris Mole]]: "Does not my hon. Friend think that the timetable data belong to the people, and that we should make them available for free?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm091022/debtext/91022-0001.htm|title=Rail Services|work=Hansard|date=2009-10-22|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed an [[Early Day Motion]] that read "That this House calls on the Government to ensure that transport timetables for rail and bus operators are made freely available for re-use, using an open standards format, thus enabling voluntary and commercial organisations to publish the data on their own digital platforms". It was signed by 32 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=39457|title=RAIL AND BUS TIMETABLES|publisher=Parliament|date=2009-10-29|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 the then Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]] announced that "mid-scale" data from Ordnance Survey would be made available for free reuse, including commercial applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page21343|title=Ordnance Survey to open up data - PM|date=17 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122233331/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page21343|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeourdata.org.uk/blog/2009/11/gordon-brown-announces-os-maps-to-be-free-online/|title=Gordon Brown announces OS maps to be free online|work=Free our data|date=2009-11-08|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; from April 2010. A consultation was held inviting responses between 23 December and 17 March by the Department of Communities and Local Government.

In December 2009 Local Transport Today reported that 'Data release could spark transport IT innovations". The magazine reported that "Among the data to be made accessible through the site are trunk road traffic volumes, the National Public Transport Access Node (NaPTAN) database and the National Public Transport Data Repository (NPTDR)". A DfT spokeswoman was reported to say: “We will seek to embrace new technology to enable partners to provide exciting, user-focused services such as recently seen with satellite navigation and iPhone applications,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?id=18440&amp;StartRow=1|title=Data release could spark transport IT innovations|work=Local Transport Today|date=2009-12-18|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010 a new government web-service, [[data.gov.uk]] was unveiled which would "offer reams of public sector data, ranging from traffic statistics to crime figures, for private or commercial use". The aim of the project was to "kickstart a new wave of services that find novel ways to make use of the information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22218|title=One-stop shop for Government data launched|work=Number10|date=2010-01-21|accessdate=2010-03-28|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202201223/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22218|archivedate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US had recently launched [[data.gov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8470797.stm|title=Tim Berners-Lee unveils government data project|work=BBC News|date=2010-01-21|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] had created the London Data Store the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.london.gov.uk/blog/hectic-times|title=Hectic Times|work=London Data Store|date=2010-02-15|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced that the NaPTAN dataset was to be immediately made available from the data.gov.uk site as [[Open Data]], as well as confirming an impending release of [[Ordnance Survey]] data. In his speech he observed that at present public transport timetables and real-time running information was owned by the operating companies but that the government would work to free it up. He also said that "from today we will make it a condition of future franchises that this data will be made freely available".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22897|title=Speech on Building Britain’s Digital Future|publisher=Number10|date=2010-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-27|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100401162337/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page22897|archivedate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March 2010 a [[Freedom of Information request]] was made to the Department for Transport inquiring about arrangements that had been made for the release of cycling data that was being collected for the portal at public expense. It requested information about any claims the [[Ordnance Survey]] would have over the data and if so the terms, and prices charged for making the data available to Ordnance Survey customers. Also the cost to a Local Authority for adding their area to the planner and for notes of any meetings of project boards and working parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/transport_direct_cycle_journey_p|title=Transport Direct Cycle Journey Planner|work=What do they know|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response was published on 1 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/transport_direct_cycle_journey_p#incoming-78421|title=Transport Direct Cycle Journey Planner|work=WhatDoTheyKnow|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2010 Ordnance Survey released&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2010/April/OpenData.html|title=Ordnance Survey launches OS OpenData in groundbreaking national initiative|publisher=Ordnance Survey|date=2010-04-01|accessdate=2010-04-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510090746/http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/media/news/2010/April/OpenData.html|archivedate=2011-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the brand ''[http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/ OS OpenData]'', under an attribution-only licence compatible with [[Creative Commons Licenses|CC-by]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/licence/docs/licence.pdf|title=OpenData Licence Terms and Conditions|publisher=Ordnance Survey|format=pdf|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups and individuals had campaigned for this release of data, but some were disappointed when some of the profitable datasets were not included - withheld for the counter-argument that if licensees do not pay for OS data collection then the government would have to be willing to foot a £30m p.a. bill, to obtain the future economic benefit of sharing the highly detailed mapping produced by the UK's national agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data|title=The Ordnance Survey has opened up its map data for free after a long campaign.

June 2010 saw [[Transport for London]] release a substantial amount of its data for free reuse, even in commercial settings. This did not include the roundel or Underground schedules, though the Underground data was released in the following months. Following the release of this data numerous "apps" for phones and online facilities appeared that made use of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7830412/London-transport-data-opened-to-app-developers.html|title=London transport data opened to app developers|accessdate=2011-01-12|publisher=Telegraph|first=Conrad|last=Quilty-Harper|date=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan-Germanism''' ({{lang-de|Pangermanismus}} or ''{{lang|de|Alldeutsche Bewegung}}''), also occasionally known as '''Pan-Germanicism''', is a [[pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] [[political ideology|political idea]]. Pan-Germanists originally sought to unify all the [[German-speaking Europe|German]] and possibly also [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking peoples]] in a single [[nation-state]] known as ''Großdeutschland''.

Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the [[unification of Germany]] when the [[German Empire]] was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Austria (Kleindeutsche Lösung/Lesser Germany),&lt;ref name="Kirk2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Kirk|title=Nazism and the Working Class in Austria: Industrial Unrest and Political Dissent in the 'National Community'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sZl5taldxYC&amp;pg=PA21|date=8 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52269-4|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first half of the 20th century in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the German Empire. From the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, since 1891 organized in the [[Pan-German League]], had adopted openly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] and [[racism|racist]] ideologies, and ultimately gave rise to the foreign policy ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' pursued by [[Nazi Germany]] under Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]] from 1938, one of the [[Causes of World War II|primary factors leading to the outbreak of]] [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440618/Pan-Germanism |title=Pan-Germanism (German political movement) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Origins and Political Character of Nazi Ideology

As a result of the disaster of World War II, Pan-Germanism was mostly seen as a taboo ideology in the postwar period in both [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]]. Today, Pan-Germanism is mainly limited to some nationalist groups in Germany and Austria.

== Etymology ==
The word ''pan'' is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word element meaning "all, every, whole, all-inclusive". The word "German" in this context derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] "Germani" originally used by [[Julius Caesar]] referring to tribes or a single tribe in northeastern [[Gaul]]. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], it acquired a loose meaning referring to the speakers of [[Germanic languages]] (alongside '[[Almain]]' and '[[Teuton]]') most of whom spoke dialects ancestral to [[German language|modern German]]. In English, "Pan-German" was first attested in 1892. In German, there exists a synonym "''Alldeutsche Bewegung''" which is a [[calque]] using German instead of Latin and Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com (pan-, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins (before 1860) ==

The red border shows the limits of the Confederation. Note that both Prussia and Austria controlled non-Confederation lands.]]
Pan-Germanism's origins began with the birth of [[Romantic nationalism]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] and [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] being early proponents. [[Germans]], for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a [[Kleinstaaterei|patchwork of states]] following the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] with the [[Peace of Westphalia]].

Advocates of the ''Großdeutschland'' (Greater Germany) solution sought to unite all the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking people in Europe]], under the leadership of the German Austrians from the [[Austrian Empire]]. Pan-Germanism was widespread among the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionaries of 1848]], notably among [[Richard Wagner]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref name="dagbladet.no"/&gt; Writers such as [[Friedrich List]] and [[Paul de Lagarde|Paul Anton Lagarde]] argued for German hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, where German domination in some areas had begun as early as the 9th century AD with the [[Ostsiedlung]], Germanic expansion into Slavic and Baltic lands. For the Pan-Germanists, this movement was seen as a [[Drang nach Osten]], in which Germans would be naturally inclined to seek [[Lebensraum]] by moving eastwards to reunite with the German minorities there.

The ''[[Deutschlandlied]]'' ("Song of Germany"), written in 1841 by [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]], in its first stanza defines ''Deutschland'' as reaching "From the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] to the [[Neman River|Memel]] / From the [[Adige]] to the [[Little Belt|Belt]]", i.e. as including [[East Prussia]] and [[South Tyrol]].

Reflecting upon the [[First Schleswig War]] in 1848, [[Karl Marx]] noted that "by quarrelling amongst themselves, instead of confederating, Germans and Scandinavians, both of them belonging to the same great race, only prepare the way for their hereditary enemy, the [[Slavs|Slav]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |year=1994 |title=The Eastern Question |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5h9SOoU3bsEC |location= |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] |isbn=0-7146-1500-5 |accessdate=1 November 2013 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The German Question ==
{{Main article|German Question|Unification of Germany}}
{{Quote|''There is, in political geography, no Germany proper to speak of. There are Kingdoms and Grand Duchies, and Duchies and Principalities, inhabited by Germans, and each separately ruled by an independent sovereign with all the machinery of State. Yet there is a natural undercurrent tending to a national feeling and toward a union of the Germans into one great nation, ruled by one common head as a national unit.''|source=''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1866&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1866/07/01/79809602.pdf |title=The Situation of Germany |format=PDF |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |date= 1 July 1866 |accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	
By the 1860s the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]] had become the two most powerful states dominated by [[German language|German-speaking]] élites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire—like the [[Holy Roman Empire]]—was a [[multi-ethnic]] state, but the German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; its re-shaping into the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities—especially the [[Hungarians]]. Under [[Prussia]]n leadership, [[Otto von Bismarck]] would ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of the northern German lands. After Bismarck excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany in the [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] of 1866 and (following a few other events over the next few years), the [[unification of Germany]], established the Prussian-dominated [[German Empire]] ("Second Reich") in 1871 with the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule. After World War I the Pan-Germanist philosophy changed drastically during the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler. Pan-Germanists originally sought to unify all the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking populations of Europe]] in a single [[nation-state]] known as ''Großdeutschland'' (Greater Germany), where "German-speaking" was sometimes taken as synonymous with [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking]], to the inclusion of the [[Frisian languages|Frisian]]- and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking populations of the [[Low Countries]], and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism and Globalisation: Conflicting Or Complementary. D. Halikiopoulou. p51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bismarck had excluded Austria and the German Austrians from his creation of the [[Kleindeutschland]] state in 1871, integrating the German Austrians nevertheless remained a strong desire for many people of both Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="DPSO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most radical Austrian pan-German [[Georg Schönerer]] (1842–1921) and [[:de:Karl Hermann Wolf|Karl Hermann Wolf]] (1862–1941) articulated Pan-Germanist sentiments in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; There was also a rejection of [[Roman Catholicism]] with the [[Away from Rome!]] movement (ca 1900 onwards) calling for German-speakers to identify with [[Lutheran]] or [[Old Catholic]] churches.&lt;ref name="Mees 2008"/&gt; The Pan-German Movement gained an institutional format in 1891, when [[:de:Ernst Hasse|Ernst Hasse]], a professor at the [[University of Leipzig]] and a member of the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]], organized the [[Pan-German League]], an ultra-nationalist&lt;ref name="Hobsbawm1987"&gt;{{cite book|author= Eric J.

The organization achieved great support among the educated [[middle class|middle]] and upper class; it promoted German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside [[German Empire|Germany]]. In his three-volume work, "Deutsche Politik" (1905–07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe. The [[Munich]] professor [[Karl Haushofer]], [[:de:Ewald Banse|Ewald Banse]], and [[Hans Grimm]] (author of the novel ''[[Volk ohne Raum]]'') preached similar [[expansionism|expansionist]] policies.

After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolutions of 1848/49]], in which the liberal nationalistic revolutionaries advocated the Greater German solution, the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866) with the effect that Austria was now excluded from Germany, and increasing ethnic conflicts in the multinational Habsburg Monarchy, a German national movement evolved in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Kurt |last=Bauer |title=Nationalsozialismus: Ursprünge, Anfänge, Aufstieg und Fall |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=2008 |page=41 |language=German |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n9L1GyROMi0C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=deutschnationalismus+in+%C3%B6sterreich+k%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz#v=onepage&amp;q=deutschnationalismus%20in%20%C3%B6sterreich%20k%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the radical [[German nationalist]] and [[anti-semite]] [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer|Georg von Schönerer]], organisations such as the ''Pan-German Society'' demanded the annexation of all German-speaking territories of the Danube Monarchy to the German Empire, and fervently rejected Austrian patriotism and a pan-Austrian identity. Schönerer's völkisch and racist German nationalism was an inspiration to Hitler's [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Wladika |title=Hitlers Vätergeneration: Die Ursprünge des Nationalsozialismus in der k.u.k.

In 1933, [[Austrian National Socialism|Austrian Nazis]] and the national-liberal [[Greater German People's Party]] formed an action group, fighting together against the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] regime which imposed a distinct Austrian national identity and in accordance said that Austrians were "better Germans", while [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] adopted a policy of appeasement towards Austrian-born Hitler's annexing of Austria to Nazi Germany and called Austria the "better German state", but he still struggled to keep Austria independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945 |last= Morgan |first= Philip |year= 2003 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 0-415-16942-9 |page= 72 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVGAZJWJOWkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; With "[[Anschluss]]" of Austria in 1938, the historic aim of Austria's German nationalists was achieved.&lt;ref name="Bideleux"&gt;{{Citation |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A history of eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=355 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IuW7T8wfNGAC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=pan+german+society+sch%C3%B6nerer#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of Nazi Germany and the events of [[World War II]] in 1945, the ideas of pan-Germanism and an ''Anschluss'' fell out of favour due to their association with Nazism and allowed Austrians to develop their own national identity. Nevertheless, such notions were revived with the German national camp in the [[Federation of Independents]] and the early [[Freedom Party of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Anton |last=Pelinka |title=Jörg Haiders "Freiheitliche" – ein nicht nur österreichisches Problem |work=Liberalismus in Geschichte und Gegenwart |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2000 |language=German |page=233 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NWmudq4s4GAC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=deutschnational+freiheitliche#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Germanism in Scandinavia ==
The idea of including the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]-speaking Scandinavians into a Pan-German state, sometimes referred to as '''[[Pan-Germanicism]]''',&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pedersen. Germany, France, and the integration of Europe: a realist interpretation. Pinter, 1998. P. 74&lt;/ref&gt; was promoted alongside mainstream pan-German ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams. ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester, England, UK: Manchester University Press, 1993. P. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Grimm]] adopted Munch's anti-Danish Pan-Germanism and argued that the entire peninsula of [[Jutland]] had been populated by Germans before the arrival of the [[Danes]] and that thus it could justifiably be reclaimed by Germany, whereas the rest of [[Denmark]] should be incorporated into [[Sweden]]. This line of thinking was countered by [[Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae]], an archaeologist who had excavated parts of [[Danevirke]], who argued that there was no way of knowing the language of the earliest inhabitants of Danish territory. He also pointed out that Germany had more solid historical claims to large parts of France and England, and that [[Slavs]]—by the same reasoning—could annex parts of [[Former eastern territories of Germany|Eastern Germany]]. Regardless of the strength of Worsaae's arguments, pan-Germanism spurred on the German nationalists of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] and led to the [[First Schleswig War]] in 1848. In turn, this likely contributed to the fact that Pan-Germanism never caught on in Denmark as much as it did in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

World War I became the first attempt to carry out the Pan-German ideology in practice, and the Pan-German movement argued forcefully for expansionist imperialism.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1 Cyprian Blamires ABC-CLIO, 2006. pp. 499–501&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat in [[World War I]], the influence of German-speaking elites over [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was substantially reduced in size. [[Austria-Hungary]] was split up. A Rump-Austria, which to a certain extent corresponded to the [[Austria-Hungary#Linguistic distribution|German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary]] (a complete split into language groups was impossible due to multi-lingual areas and language-exclaves) adopted the name "[[German Austria]]" ({{lang-de|link=no|Deutschösterreich}}) in hope for union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. Union with Germany and the name "German Austria" was forbidden by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] and the name had to be changed back to Austria.

It was in the post-World War I period that the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], under the influence of the [[stab-in-the-back myth]], first took up German nationalist ideas in his ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref name="Blamires"/&gt; Hitler met [[Heinrich Class]] in 1918, and Class provided Hitler with support for the 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Hitler and his National Socialist friends shared most of the basic pan-German visions with the Pan-German League, but differences in political style led the two groups to open rivalry. The German Workers Party of Bohemia cut its ties to the pan-German movement, which was seen as being too dominated by the upper classes, and joined forces with the [[German Workers Party]] led by [[Anton Drexler]], which later became the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (Nazi party) that was to be headed by Adolf Hitler from 1921.&lt;ref name="Levy2"&gt;Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 1, Richard S. Levy, 529–530, ABC-CLIO 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi propaganda also used the political slogan ''Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer'' ("One people, one Reich, one leader"), to enforce pan-German sentiment in Austria for an "[[Anschluss]]".

The ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' ("Back Home to the Reich") initiative was a policy pursued by the [[Nazis]] which attempted to convince the [[ethnic Germans]] living outside of [[Nazi Germany]] (such as in [[Austria]] and [[Sudetenland]]) that they should strive to bring these regions "home" into a [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland#Later influence|Greater Germany]]. This notion also led the way for an even more expansive state to be envisioned, the [[Greater Germanic Reich]], which Nazi Germany tried to establish.&lt;ref name="elvert1"&gt;Elvert 1999, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; This pan-Germanic empire was expected to [[Annexation|assimilate]] practically all of [[Germanic languages|Germanic Europe]] into an enormously expanded Greater Germanic Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany plus the [[Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|areas annexed into the ''Großdeutsche Reich'']]), the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[zone interdite#zone of intended German settlement|areas in north-eastern France]] considered to be historically and ethnically Germanic, [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], at least the [[German-speaking Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref name="Rich401402"&gt;Rich 1974, pp. 401–402.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable exception was the predominantly [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] United Kingdom, which was not projected as having to be reduced to a German province but to instead become an [[Political alliance|allied]] seafaring partner of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Strobl 2000, pp. 202–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastern ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' in the vast stretches of Ukraine and Russia were also intended for future integration, with [[Generalplan Ost|plans for them]] stretching to the [[Volga]] or even beyond the [[Urals]]. They were deemed of vital interest for the survival of the German nation, as it was a core tenet of [[National Socialist Ideology|national-socialist ideology]] that it needed "living space" (''[[Lebensraum]]''), creating a "pull towards the East" (''[[Drang nach Osten]]'') where that could be found and [[colonization|colonized]], in a model that the Nazis explicitly derived from the American [[Manifest Destiny]] in the [[American frontier|Far West]] and its clearing of native inhabitants.

{{see also|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|Expulsion of Germans after World War II|Former eastern territories of Germany|Reunification of Germany}}
The defeat of Germany in [[World War II]] brought about the decline of Pan-Germanism, much as [[World War I]] had led to the demise of [[Pan-Slavism]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Parts of Germany itself were devastated, and the country was divided, firstly into Soviet, French, American, and British zones and then into [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. To add to the disaster, Germany suffered even larger territorial losses than it did in the First World War, with vast [[former eastern territories of Germany|portions of eastern Germany]] directly annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Poland]]. The scale of the Germans' defeat was unprecedented; Pan-Germanism became taboo because it had been tied to racist concepts of the "[[master race]]" and ''[[Nordicism]]'' by the [[Nazi party]]. However, the [[reunification of Germany]] in 1990 revived the old debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/1308186237768/FPOe-Parteitag-Straches-neue-Heimat-und-der-Boulevardsozialismus|work=[[Der Standard]]|title=Straches "neue" Heimat und der Boulevardsozialismus|date=16 June 2011|accessdate=28 June 2011|language=German|first=Gerhard|last=Zeilinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perillaldehyde''', or perilla aldehyde, is a natural [[organic compound]] found most abundantly in the annual herb [[perilla]], but also in a wide variety of other plants and essential oils.  It is a [[monoterpene|monoterpenoid]] containing an [[aldehyde]] functional group.

Perillaldehyde, or volatile oils from perilla that are rich in perillaldehyde, are used as [[food additive]]s for flavoring and in perfumery to add spiciness.  Perillaldehyde can be readily converted to [[perilla alcohol]], which is also used in perfumery. It has a mint-like, cinnamon odor and is primarily responsible for the flavor of perilla.

The [[oxime]] of perillaldehyde is known as [[perillartine]] or ''perilla sugar'' and is about 2000 times sweeter than sucrose and is used in Japan as a [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]].

'''Privatization in Croatia''' refers to political and economic reforms which include the [[privatization]] of state-owned assets in [[Croatia]]. Privatization started in the late 1980s under Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ante Marković]] and mostly took place in the 1990s after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], during the presidency of [[Franjo Tuđman]] and the rule of his party [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), and continued in the 2000s with the privatization of large state enterprises. Many aspects of the privatization process are still seen as controversial as the political and economic turmoil, coupled with the events of the simultaneous [[Croatian War of Independence|1991–95 independence war]], are thought to have led to a degree of [[criminal activity]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Early privatization ==
The privatization process in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] was initiated during the government of Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ante Marković]].&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;Patrick Heenan, Monique Lamontagne: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9qCOAwAAQBAJ Central and Eastern Europe Handbook], Routledge, 2014, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he introduced a privatization program, with newly passed federal laws on privatization allowing company management boards to initiate privatization, mainly through internal share-holding schemes, initially not tradeable in the stock exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Milica Uvalic: [https://books.google.com/books?id=k0kTMaCj0qgC Investment and Property Rights in Yugoslavia: The Long Transition to a Market Economy], Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the law put an emphasis on "insider" privatization to company workers and managers, to whom the shares could be offered at a discount. Yugoslav authorities used the term "property transformation" when referring to the process of transforming public ownership into private hands.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;

Separate privatization laws in individual republics soon replaced the federal law.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;{{when|date=May 2015}} [[SR Croatia|Republic of Croatia]] replaced the federal law on privatization with its own privatization law in April 1991. The new law stipulated compulsory privatization and the elimination of public ownership, while publicly owned enterprises were to be transformed into joint-stock or limited liability companies.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;William Bartlett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VFiFAgAAQBAJ Europe's Troubled Region: Economic Development, Institutional Reform, and Social Welfare in the Western Balkans], Routledge, 2007, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; These new laws in Croatia and Slovenia were interpreted as tacit nationalization, a tendency of both governments to first re-nationalize public property in order to later proceed with privatization.&lt;ref&gt;Milica Uvalic: [https://books.google.com/books?id=k0kTMaCj0qgC Investment and Property Rights in Yugoslavia: The Long Transition to a Market Economy], Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Croatia gained independence, [[Economy of Croatia|its economy]], as well as the whole [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav economy]], was in the middle of recession. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence|1991–95 war]], infrastructure sustained massive damage, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. Privatization and transformation from a [[planned economy]] to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;International Business Publications: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qND3Dii7qjIC Croatia Investment and Trade Laws and Regulations Handbook], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main events ==
During the rule of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), Croatia initiated its privatization program in 1992 when companies began arranging sales of shares to their employees. Privatization revenues and two thirds of unsold shares were then transferred to the Development Fund, while the remainder of unsold shares was transferred to the Pension Fund and the Disability Insurance Fund, both controlled by the state.&lt;ref name=Handbook2&gt;Patrick Heenan, Monique Lamontagne: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9qCOAwAAQBAJ Central and Eastern Europe Handbook], Routledge, 2014, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Privatization often involved appointing new managers close to HDZ, or even the party's leading members,&lt;ref&gt;William Bartlett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VFiFAgAAQBAJ Europe's Troubled Region: Economic Development, Institutional Reform, and Social Welfare in the Western Balkans], Routledge, 2007, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; a trend which discouraged foreign investors.&lt;ref name=Handbook2/&gt; The state also took full ownership of over 100 important large companies and appointed new managers there, who were also often members of the ruling party.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;

With the end of the war in 1995, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment, accompanied by public distrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected people at below-market prices,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Istvan Benczes:[https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were common to reforms that took place in most post-communist [[transition economy|transition economies]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul Estrin: ''The Impact of Privatization in Transition Economies'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 2007, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary method of privatization in Croatia was [[Management buyout|management employee buyouts]], while the secondary method used was [[voucher privatization]]. In 1991 the private sector's share of GDP was 25 percent, and its share of employed workforce was 22 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Estrin: ''The Impact of Privatization in Transition Economies'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 2007, p. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; The method of privatization contributed to the increase of state ownership because unsold shares were transferred to state funds. In 1999 the private sector's share in GDP reached 60 percent, which was significantly lower compared to other former socialist countries.&lt;ref&gt;Istvan Benczes:[https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206&lt;/ref&gt; The government retained 1-30% shareholdings in privatised firms in 33,4% of firms, and above 30% in 7,6% firms, much higher than other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Estrin: ''The Impact of Privatization in Transition Economies'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a Ministry of Privatization was established with Ivan Penić as its first minister.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt; The privatization program was criticized by Croatian economists who characterized it as [[crony capitalism]]. The ruling party was particularly criticised for transferring enterprises to a group of privileged owners connected to the party.&lt;ref&gt;William Bartlett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VFiFAgAAQBAJ Europe's Troubled Region: Economic Development, Institutional Reform, and Social Welfare in the Western Balkans], Routledge, 2007, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian president [[Franjo Tuđman]] was also a target of critics and allegations of [[nepotism]] and the likelihood that he personally profited. An alleged statement about 200 wealthy families that would manage Croatian economy is at times attributed to him, although others note that there is no evidence that Tuđman ever said that.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Domović: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/131778 Autentičnost sintagme „200 obitelji“]&lt;/ref&gt;

The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace. As of 2000, roughly 70 percent of Croatia's major companies were still state-owned, including water, electricity, oil, transportation, telecommunications, and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7601">'''Reginald Hawkins''' (1923–2007) was a civil rights activist in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], NC for most of his life. He was the first African-American to run for Governor of North Carolina. He fought to desegregate Charlotte schools and businesses. His son-in-law was [[Hamaas Abdul Khaalis]] whose [[1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre|family was murdered in 1973]] and who went on to commit the [[1977 Hanafi Siege]].

Reginald Hawkins was born in [[Beaufort, North Carolina|Beaufort, NC]] in 1923. He served as captain in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]]. After completing his time in the service he attended [[Howard University]] where he got his degree in dentistry in 1948. He also received his MA of Divinity from [[Johnson C. Smith University|Johnson C Smith University]] in 1973. He married Catherine Richardson while he was still in dental school and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/charlotte/obituary.aspx?n=reginald-armistice-hawkins&amp;pid=94263646|title=Dr. Reginald Armistice Hawkins's Obituary on Charlotte Observer|website=Charlotte Observer|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights advocacy==
Hawkins and members of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] differed over the best way to end school desegregation. Kelly Alexander wanted to sue the city of Charlotte over civil injustice. Hawkins believed that a confrontational approach was best through utilizing media coverage to help mobilize citizens, arguing  "The only way to move forward is to engage bigots in direct controversy within their own community.&lt;ref name="jfl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reginald Hawkins (1923-2007)|url=http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/reginald-hawkins-1923-2007/|website=North Carolina History Project|publisher=The John Locke Foundation|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make his point  about the only way to move forward, Hawkins escorted Dorthy Counts, a young black girl to Harding High School, a white school in Charlotte. On September 4, 1957 Hawkins and Counts walked through a shower of spit and insults to integrate the first Mecklenburg County School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clclt.com/charlotte/the-militant-dentist-dr-reginald-hawkins/Content?oid=3003665|title=The Militant Dentist: Dr. Reginald Hawkins|last=Wright|first=Emiene|website=Creative Loafing Charlotte|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His actions that day created a lot of stir in both the white and African- American neighborhoods,creating  a national name for Hawkins. From then on Hawkins became a prominent civil rights activist in Charlotte. In 1961 Hawkins  led a [[boycott]] of Irwin Avenue Junior High School. He urged African-American Students to stay home instead of attending a second rate educational institution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to his disagreement with NAACP policies and in an attempt to distance himself from their "communist" label, Hawkins resigned his membership in 1958 and created the Mecklenburg Organization for Political Affairs (MOPA). MOPA used community activists within the African -American community to call for desegregation. Members took part in marches, picketing, protests, boycotts, and sit-in's, usually near schools or hospitals in the Charlotte area.Hawkins work helped successfully integrate many restaurants downtown including those in Belk's and Ivey's department stores.&lt;ref name="jfl" /&gt;

In 1962 Hawkins filed suit against the North Carolina Dental Society for discrimination due to the fact they would not let him practice at [[Charlotte Memorial Hospital]]. He frequently led demonstrations outside the Mercy, Charlotte Memorial , Presbyterian and Good Samaritan hospitals in the Charlotte area. These demonstrations usually attracted a lot of press and generated controversy in the medical community. Hawkins continued to protest by writing [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] claiming that the hospitals were breaking their nondiscrimination policy that was one of the conditions of them receiving federal funding. By the end of 1962 the [[Department of Health]] ordered Memorial to desegregate their maternity and dentistry wards. Hawkins continued to protest until 1963 when the hospital declared an open door policy for all patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On November 22, 1965 four bombs exploded across Charlotte in the span of about 15 minutes. Hawkins home was hit as well as the homes of [[Kelly Alexander Sr]], president of the NAACP, [[Frederick D Alexander|Fred Alexander]], first African American City Council man, and [[Julius L. Chambers|Julius Chambers]], a civil rights lawyer. The bombings caught the attention of the local news and put Charlotte into the violent category that cities like [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] had already been placed in.

==Politics==
In 1968 Hawkins announced his campaign for governor of North Carolina. His political actions had earned him many friends but also many enemies. He lost the Democratic primary to [[Robert W. Scott]] in a three-way race, earning 18.52% of the vote; Scott went on to win the election. He ran again governor again in 1972 and lost in the Democratic primary, winning 8.16% of the vote in a six-way race; the winner of the primary, [[Skipper Bowles]], lost in the general election to Republican candidate [[James Holshouser]]. Even though he did not win, Hawkins' campaigns were symbolically important, showing that African-Americans did have the ability to run for office and try to make political changes.

Throughout his life Hawkins was an ardent supporter of equal rights and integration. He continued his work, giving speeches and calling for change right up until his death in 2007.

'''Samisdat Publishers, Ltd.''' was a small [[Canada|Canadian]] [[publishing house]], founded in 1977, and owned and operated by [[Ernst Zündel]], the German-born [[Holocaust denier]], during the 1980s and 1990s. It was based in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], and is now defunct.

The name was taken from [[samizdat]], a practice in the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet bloc]] countries of covertly distributing documents which would have been impossible to publish openly.

Most of the books and pamphlets published by Samisdat Publishers were associated in some way or another with Holocaust denial or promotion of Nazism.

:''This article is about the Slovenian political party, active between 1989 and 1991. For the political party, established in the [[Julian March]] in 1946, see [[Slovene Democratic Union, Italy]].

The '''Slovenian Democratic Union''' ({{lang-sl|Slovenska demokratična zveza}}, acronym '''SDZ''') was a [[Slovenia]]n [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[political party]], active between 1989 and 1991, during the [[democratization]] and the secession of the [[Republic of Slovenia (1990-1991)|Republic of Slovenia]] from [[Yugoslavia]].

The party was founded on 11 January 1989 in the [[Cankar Hall]] in [[Ljubljana]], and [[Dimitrij Rupel]] was elected as its president. It was one of the first political party established in opposition to the [[Communist]] regime. It was founded mostly by intellectuals around the alternative journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]'' and it was initially called Slovenian Democratic Union of Reason.

In December 1989, it joined the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], together with the [[Social Democratic Party of Slovenia]], the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], the [[Slovenian People's Party]] and the [[Greens of Slovenia]]. In April 1990, the coalition won the first free elections in Slovenia after [[World War II]], gaining around 55% of the popular vote. The Slovenian Democratic Union received around 9,5% of the vote, becoming the third largest party in the coalition and the fifth in the [[Slovenian National Assembly]]. Despite the relatively modest result, members of the party covered several key positions in the new cabinet led by the Christian Democrat [[Lojze Peterle]], such as the Ministry of Interior, Defence, Justice, Information. Besides, the party member [[France Bučar]] was elected president of the [[Slovenian Parliament]].

After the independence of Slovenia, the party split into two. Its [[left liberal]] wing, led by the president Dimitrij Rupel, founded the [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]], while the conservative wing, led by the minister of justice [[Rajko Pirnat]] established the centre-right [[National Democratic Party (Slovenia)|National Democratic Party]]. In the election of 1992, both parties suffered a defeat. The Democratic Party gained 5,01% of the popular vote, and in 1994, most of its members joined the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]]. The National Democratic Party obtained 2,18% of the vote and no seats in Parliament. In 1993, the National Democrats joined the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], and in 1995 they switched to the [[Slovenian Social Democratic Party]].

Despite its relatively small popular support, the Slovenian Democratic Union was one of the most influential parties in Slovenia between 1988 and 1991. After its dissolution, its former members have become influential members of other political formations.

The legal successors of the Slovenian Democratic Union are the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] and the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia.

'''State motorcyclists' rights organizations''' (SMROs) exist in about 32 US states, 25 of which call themselves "ABATE of (state name)," the rest going by various other names.  SMROs advocate for a point of view in motorcycling that is, in general, opposed to mandatory helmet laws, required motorcycle safety inspections, mandatory rider training and licensing, and other similar regulation.  Instead SMROs favor optional or voluntary motorcycle rider safety education, training, and licensing, and greater public awareness of motorcyclist safety issues.  They also favor stronger penalties for car driver infractions such as right of way violations, or when drivers are at fault in accidents that harm motorcycle riders.   SMRO activities include lobbying legislatures, letter writing campaigns, and paying for public service announcements and political advertisements.  To carry out lobbying at the national level, a coalition of SMRO's created the Motorcycle Riders Foundation (MRF) to lobby in Washington DC.  The SMROs and MRF are often allied with the [[American Motorcyclist Association]] (AMA) on legislative issues.

==ABATE==
ABATE is an acronym which originally stood for "A Brotherhood Against Totalitarian Enactments" and alternatively stands for "American Bikers Against Totalitarian Enactments", "A Brotherhood Aimed Towards Education", "American Bikers for Awareness, Training &amp; Education", "American Bikers Aimed Towards Education", "American Bikers Advocating Training &amp; Education" with other combination used.

==Concept==
The concept of ABATE began with Lou Kimzey, editor of ''[[Easyriders]]'' magazine in 1972. He and others saw the need for bikers to organize to fight against federal and state restrictions on motorcycling. Some 35 years later, most states have a state motorcyclists' rights organizations (SMRO), either called ABATE or some other name. October 1977 Lou Kimzey and ''Easyriders'' were relinquishing the organization to the people attending the meeting in Sacramento.

In 1986, many ABATE organizations met at what became the "Meeting of the Minds" conference. This conference began the process of SMROs working together and eventually led to the founding of the Motorcycle Rider's Foundation (MRF) which is considered a Motorcycle Rights Organization (MRO) based in Washington DC. This group of SMROs acted to eliminate federal helmet law requirements, make sure motorcycles are part of [[transportation planning]] and ensure that motorcycles are allowed on all public roads. 

MRF is an organization set up in Washington DC to watch over motorcycle legislation and to take action when the federal government has an agenda that would not be motorcycle friendly. SMRO's including ABATE work with the MRF and most have a state officer involved in the MRF. ABATE organization use the MRF to share state information, and get more information on a federal level as well as information from other states. Most SMRO and ABATE groups work with other (MRO) groups besides the MRF, such as the American Motorcyclist Association. Many ABATE organizations have websites, and most often list the other groups they are involved with, work with, from national MRO groups, insurance programs, lawyers, and rider training or safety and education programs. 

ABATE was formed in response to keep motorcycle choppers, with extended front ends that were deemed unsafe, on the road; but now SMROs deal with a large variety of motorcycling related issues. [[Motorcycle safety training]], health insurance issues and road engineering with respect to motorcycles are all areas dealt with by ABATE organizations. Many states' rider training programs are either run by or administered by ABATE organizations. ABATE of Arizona runs a [[Motorcycle Awareness Program]] or MAP.

ABATE groups also are involved in charity events like Toy Runs, food drives and first responder/EMT training. But ABATE is still a political organization exerting political clout through the activities of member motorcyclists. ABATE chapters exist in most states. ABATE is not a motorcycle club, nor is it a Harley riders only organization.

==Motorcycle Awareness Program==
The '''Motorcycle Awareness Program (MAP)''', commonly referred to as The MAP Program or Share The Road Program, is an American creation of the combined efforts of various state motorcyclists' rights organizations. This program is geared toward teaching the driving public to maintain a greater awareness of the motorcyclists with whom they share the road. The success of the program has led to similar initiatives throughout the world.

===Arizona===
ABATE of Arizona's MAP, is coordinated by the State Safety Officer of the organization, and is presented with the help of many members of the MRO's (ABATE and MMA of AZ) and Motorcycle Clubs throughout Arizona.

MAP Certified Instructors guest lecture in [[driver's education]] classes throughout the region. The lecture includes information about how to "Share the Road" with motorcycles, vulnerability of motorcyclists, instructional videos and handouts, and an on-site riding demonstration to help visualize information presented. 

Funding for the MAP Program is provided by the membership of ABATE of Arizona, through their various fund raising events and membership dues. Additionally, some product and advertising funds are provided by the Motorcycle Safety Fund, made up of one dollar added registration tax on motorcycles within the state, through the Governor's Office of Highway Safety.

==Criticism==
ABATE chapters have been criticized for the appearance of hypocrisy in their road safety message, in that while their public service advertisements aimed to get drivers to be more aware of motorcycles are helpful, the chapters undermine that message by opposing mandatory helmet laws, and by appearing to encourage alcohol consumption while riding.

The traffic and commuting beat columnist for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Michael Dresser, wrote in July 2007 that, "While ABATE &lt;nowiki&gt;[of Maryland's]&lt;/nowiki&gt;  message is great, there are some problems with the messenger. &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ABATE's arguments against helmet laws are largely based on the dubious premise that they violate individual rights or invade privacy. Gimme a break. Maryland has invested billions or dollars to build a public road system. So if the state decides to require users of that network to take steps to avoid spilling the contents of their skulls on public pavement, it is well within its rights."  Dresser further criticizes the practice of holding the majority of Maryland ABATE chapter meetings in bars, pointing out his observation that one meeting place is at an open air bar where motorcycle riders can often be seen consuming alcohol before noon.  Dresser contrasts this with the [[Motorcycle Safety Foundation]], which has urged riders to not consume even one drink before riding, saying that even a road-legal blood alcohol level of 0.05% increases a rider's risk by 40 times, due to the greater challenge of motorcycle riding compared to driving a car.&lt;ref name=Dresser7July2007&gt;Dresser (7 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  

In response to a deluge of counter-points and demands for an apology, Dresser ran a second column in which he offered 7 point-by-point rebuttals to the letters from ABATE members.  Among the objections were that Dresser was unfairly perpetuating a stereotype of rowdy, irresponsibly-drunk bikers, and that due to this negative stereotype, the ABATE chapter had been turned down by more than 40 taverns before they found one to accept them.  Members also said that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] also met in taverns to plan the revolution.   Dresser was also criticized for emphasizing the helmet law issue, when in fact Maryland ABATE had made increased penalties for [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] violators a top legislative priority, and had assisted handicapped people in getting [[disabled parking permit]] license plates.  In response to readers who emphasized the freedom of choice argument against helmet laws, Dresser replied that, "Freedom is a much-abused word. There are essential freedoms -- free speech, free press, habeas corpus, religion, the ballot, to name a few -- that are worth fighting for. Then there's simply foolish behavior we're used to getting away with."&lt;ref name=Dresser16July2007&gt;Dresser (16 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week, Dresser ran a third column in which he quoted letters from motorcyclists who were also uncomfortable with ABATE's anti-helmet law position, and from some ABATE members who agreed that the organization was excessively focused on alcohol consumption at their gatherings.  Several other correspondents told anecdotes of helmet laws saving riders' lives, and others noted that the image of motorcyclists was not only harmed by hard-drinking middle-aged [[Types of motorcycle#Cruiser|cruiser]] riders, which they saw as the ABATE demographic, but also by packs of young males speeding and doing stunts on [[Types of motorcycle#Sport bike|sport bikes]].&lt;ref name=Dresser23July2007&gt;Dresser (23 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''state secrets privilege''' is an [[Evidence (law)|evidentiary rule]] created by [[United States]] legal [[precedent]]. Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a [[legal case]] based solely on [[affidavits]] submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct" /&gt;&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Julie Hilden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Zajac" /&gt; ''[[United States v. Reynolds]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = United States v. Reynolds |vol = 345 |reporter = U.S. |opinion = 1 |pinpoint = paragraph 8 |court =  |year = 1953 |url= http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/345/345.US.1.21.html | quote= the privilege against revealing military secrets, a privilege which is well established in the law of evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involved military secrets, was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege.

Following a claim of "state secrets privilege", the court rarely conducts an ''[[in camera]]'' examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine. This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt; The privileged material is completely removed from the litigation, and the court must determine how the unavailability of the privileged information affects the case.&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;

==Function==

The purpose of the state secrets privilege is to prevent courts from revealing state secrets in the course of civil litigation (in criminal cases, the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]] serves the same purpose). The government may intervene in any civil suit, including when it is not a party to the litigation, to ask the court to exclude state secrets evidence. While the courts may examine such evidence closely, in practice they generally defer to the [[Executive (government)|Executive Branch]]. Once the court has agreed that evidence is subject to the state secrets privilege, it is excluded from the litigation. Often, as a practical matter, the plaintiff cannot continue the suit without the privileged information, and drops the case. Recently, courts have been more inclined to dismiss cases outright, if the subject matter of the case is a state secret.&lt;ref&gt;See Mohamed et al v Jeppesen Dataplan Inc 614 F.3d 1070 (9th cir 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinguished from other legal doctrines===

The state secrets privilege is related to, but distinct from, several other legal doctrines: the principle of non-justiciability in certain cases involving state secrets (the so-called "[[Totten v. United States|Totten Rule]]");&lt;ref&gt;Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; certain prohibitions on the publication of classified information (as in ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'', the [[Pentagon Papers]] case); and the use of classified information in criminal cases (governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act).

==History==

===Origins===
The doctrine was effectively imported from [[British law]] which has a similar privilege.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt; It is debatable whether the state secrets privilege is based upon the President's powers as [[commander-in-chief]] and leader of [[foreign policy]] (as suggested in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'') or derived from the idea of separation of powers (as suggested in ''[[United States v. Reynolds]]'').&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt; It seems that the US privilege "has its initial roots in [[Aaron Burr|Aaron Burr's]] [[Burr conspiracy|trial for treason]]". In this case, it was alleged that a letter from General [[James Wilkinson]] to President [[Thomas Jefferson]] might contain state secrets and could therefore not be divulged without risk to national security.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;

===Supreme Court recognition in United States v. Reynolds===
{{Main|United States v. Reynolds}}
The privilege was first officially recognized by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''United States v. Reynolds'', {{ussc|345|1|1953}}. A military airplane, a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]], crashed. The widows of three civilian crew members sought accident reports on the crash but were told that to release such details would threaten national security by revealing the bomber's top-secret mission.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julie Hilden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Zajac"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Dean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman" /&gt; The court held that only the government can claim or waive the privilege, but that it “is not to be lightly invoked” and that there “must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the
department which has control over the matter, after actual personal
consideration by that officer.”&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt; The court stressed that the decision to withhold evidence is to be made by the presiding judge and not the executive.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;

In 2000, the accident reports were declassified and released, and it was found that the assertion that they contained secret information was fraudulent. The reports did, however, contain information about the poor condition of the aircraft itself, which would have been very compromising to the Air Force's case. Many commentators have alleged government misuse of secrecy in this landmark case.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Hampton. [https://fas.org/sgp/news/2003/03/iaf031403.html Supreme Court Filing claims Air Force, government fraud in 1953 case: Case could affect 'state secrets' privilege] ''Inside the Air Force'' March 14, 2003. Retrieved May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this ruling, a case might still be subject to judicial review since the privilege was intended to prevent certain, but not all, information to be precluded.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;

===Recent use===
According to former [[White House Counsel]], [[John Dean]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While precise numbers are hard to come by (because not all cases are reported), a recent study reports that the "Bush administration has invoked the state secrets privilege in 23 cases since 2001." By way of comparison, "between 1953 and 1976, the government invoked the privilege in only four cases."&lt;ref name="John Dean"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Henry Lanman reports in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;the [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] reported that while the government asserted the privilege approximately 55 times in total between 1954 (the privilege was first recognized in 1953) and 2001, it's asserted it 23 times in the four years after Sept. 11."&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald ITT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, at least one article has retracted these figures, finding they were based on erroneous information:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Correction: In this article, we incorrectly reported that the government invoked the state secrets privilege in 23 cases since 2001. The figure came from the 2005 Secrecy Report Card published by OpenTheGovernment.org. The privilege was actually invoked seven times from 2001 to 2005, according to the corrected 2005 report card, which is not an increase from previous decades.&lt;ref name="Susan Burgess" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lanman continues to cite two political science professors at the [[University of Texas-El Paso]] who concluded that
&lt;blockquote&gt;courts have examined the documents' underlying claims of state secrecy fewer than one-third of the times it has been invoked. And ... courts have only actually rejected the assertion of the privilege four times since 1953.&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the privilege is increasingly used to dismiss entire court cases, instead of only withholding the sensitive information from a case.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt; Also in 2001, [[George W. Bush]] issued [[Executive Order 13233]] extending the accessibility of the state secrets privilege to also allow ''former'' presidents, their designated representatives, or representatives designated by their families, to invoke it to bar records from their tenure.&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;

An article in the ''New York Times'' in August 2007, on a lawsuit involving [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] concluded that the unprecedented frequency with which the Bush administration invoked the principle has made judges more skeptical and willing to ask the government to validate its claims. In the words of Tom Blanton, director of the [[National Security Archive]] at [[George Washington University]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;What seems clear is that until a year or two ago, the judges rarely even questioned it when the government raised the 'state secrets' claim. It was a neutron bomb &amp;ndash; no plaintiffs left standing. But we're now seeing that judges are starting to actually look behind the government's secrecy claims and see what's really there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/31/us/nationalspecial3/31swift.html?ref=us|title=U.S. Cites ‘Secrets’ Privilege as It Tries to Stop Suit on Banking Records|last=Lichtblau|first=Eric|date=August 31, 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Since 2001, there has been mounting criticism of the state secrets privilege. Such criticism generally falls into four categories:

===Weak external validation of executive assertion of privilege===
Many commentators have expressed concern that the courts never effectively scrutinize executive claims of privilege.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt; Lacking independent national security expertise, judges frequently defer to the judgment of the executive and never subject executive claims to meaningful scrutiny.

===Executive abuse of the privilege to conceal embarrassing facts===
Commentators have suggested that the state secrets privilege might be used as often to prevent disclosure of embarrassing facts as to protect legitimate secrets.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Julie Hilden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0625,hentoff,73574,6.html Congress and Judges Gagged Arlen Specter and a CIA torture victim know &amp;ndash; Only the Oval Office decides what the law is] by [[Nat Hentoff]], [[Village Voice]], June 19th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Hentoff" /&gt; Or, in the words of Professors William G. Weaver and Robert M. Pallitto in an article in the [[Political Science Quarterly]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he incentive on the part of administrators is to use the privilege to avoid embarrassment, handicap political enemies, and to prevent criminal investigation of administrative action.&lt;ref name="Susan Burgess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070213122925-44818.pdf House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425200847/http://oversight.house.gov/Documents/20070213122925-44818.pdf |date=2007-04-25 }} Testimony of William G. Weaver, J.D., Ph.D. Senior Advisor, [[National Security Whistleblowers Coalition]] and
Associate Professor University of Texas at El Paso, Inst. for Policy and Econ. Development and Dept. of Political Science, February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In several prominent cases, the evidence that the government successfully excluded was later revealed to contain no state secrets: ''United States v. Reynolds'', ''Sterling v. Tenet'', ''Edmonds v. Department of Justice'', and the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''.

===Expansion into a justiciability doctrine===
Some academics and practitioners have criticized the expansion of the state secrets privilege from an evidentiary privilege (designed to exclude certain pieces of evidence) to a justiciability doctrine (designed to exclude entire lawsuits). Under its original formulation, the state secrets privilege was meant only to exclude a very narrow class of evidence whose revelation would harm national security. However, in a large percentage of recent cases, courts have gone a step further, dismissing entire cases in which the government asserts the privilege, in essence converting an evidentiary rule into a justiciability rule. The government response has been that in certain cases, the subject of the case is itself privileged. In these cases, the government argues, there is no plausible way to respond to a complaint without revealing state secrets.

===Elimination of judicial check on executive power===

[[Glenn Greenwald]] alleges that the Bush administration attempted to expand [[executive power]], as evidenced by the [[unitary executive theory]] propagated by [[John Yoo]]. The theory suggests that the President, as [[Commander-in-Chief]], cannot be bound by Congress or any law, national or international. By invoking the state secrets privilege in cases involving actions taken in the [[war on terror]] (i.e. [[extraordinary rendition]], [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|allegations of torture]], [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|allegedly violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]]),&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy In Focus" /&gt;  Greenwald opines the administration tried to evade [[judicial review]] of these claims of exceptional [[war powers]]. In effect, this is preventing a judicial ruling determining whether there is a legal basis for such expansive executive power.&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald ITT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/05/snapshots-of-us-under-bush.html Snapshots of the U.S. under the Bush administration] by Glenn Greenwald, Unclaimed Territory, May 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With that in mind, applying this privilege makes [[impeachment]] the only possible means left for [[US Congress|Congress]] to exercise their duty to uphold the [[checks and balances]] constitutionally intended to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susan Burgess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat Hentoff"/&gt;

==Calls for reform==
{{see also|State Secrets Protection Act}}

In recent years, a number of commentators have called for legislative reforms to the state secrets privilege.&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert M 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The State Secrets Privilege: Expanding Its Scope Through Government Misuse" by Carrie Newton Lyons, 11 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 99 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  These reforms center around several ideas:

#Requiring judges to review each piece of evidence that the executive claims is subject to the privilege.&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="State Secrets Privilege 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"State Your Secrets" by Lou Fisher. Legal Times, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Requiring the executive to craft alternative evidence that is not subject to the privilege, for the opposing party to use in place of the original, privileged evidence.&lt;ref name="State Secrets Privilege 2007"/&gt;  Such substitute evidence should only be required when it is possible to do so without harming national security.
#Prohibiting courts from dismissing claims on the basis of the state secrets privilege until after they have reviewed all available evidence.
#Permitting the court to appoint an outside expert to scrutinize the evidence for national security content.&lt;ref name="Robert M 2007"/&gt;
#Excluding illegal government action from the definition of "state secrets," or otherwise allowing the court to address the legality (instead of just the secrecy) of government conduct. This would prevent the government from using the state secrets privilege to conceal its illegal conduct.&lt;ref name="Robert M 2007"/&gt;

On January 22, 2008, Senators [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] and [[Arlen Specter]] introduced {{USBill|110|S|2533}}, the [[State secrets protection act|State Secrets Protection Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Court cases==

===''United States v. Reynolds''===
{{main|United States v. Reynolds}}

In ''United States v. Reynolds'' (1953), the widows of three crew members of a [[B-29 Superfortress]] bomber that had crashed in 1948 sought accident reports on the crash, but were told the release of such details would threaten national security by revealing the nature of the bomber's top-secret mission. The Supreme Court ruled that the executive branch could bar evidence from the court if it deemed that its release would impair national security. In 1996, the accident reports in question were declassified and released, and when discovered in 2000 were found to contain no secret information. They did, however, contain information about the poor condition of the aircraft itself, which would have been very compromising to the Air Force's case. Many legal experts have alleged government abuse of secrecy in this landmark case.&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman"/&gt;

===Richard Horn===
Former DEA agent Richard Horn brought a suit against the CIA for bugging his home. The case was dismissed because of the privilege.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Zajac"/&gt;

Richard Horn's case was reinstated on July 20, 2009, by U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth on the basis that the CIA had engaged in fraud on the court.

On March 30, 2010, as a result of a multimillion-dollar settlement agreement between Horn and the government, Lamberth dismissed the underlying case with prejudice. Subsequently, later that same year, in a September 22 order, Lamberth issued a final order vacating his earlier opinions and orders finding that CIA lawyers, Tenet, and Brown had committed fraud on the court. Lamberth also specifically ordered that a sentence be removed from his March 30, 2010 Memorandum.  The removed sentence had stated that "allegations of wrongdoing by the government attorneys in this case are not only credible, they are admitted".

===Notra Trulock===
In February 2002, it was invoked in the case of [[Notra Trulock]], who launched a [[defamation]] suit against [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] scientist [[Wen Ho Lee]], charged with stealing nuclear secrets; [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] stated that national security would be compromised if Trulock were allowed to seek damages from Lee; though it resulted in the case being dismissed, another suit was launched directly attacking then-FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]] for interfering and falsely invoking the state secrets privilege.

===Sibel Edmonds===
{{main|Sibel Edmonds}}

The privilege was invoked twice against Sibel Edmonds.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive Misconduct"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Zajac"/&gt; The first invocation was to prevent her from testifying that the Federal Government had foreknowledge that Al-Qaeda intended to use airliners to [[September 11, 2001 attacks|attack the United States on September 11, 2001]]; the case was a $100 trillion action filed in 2002 by six hundred 9/11 victims' families against officials of the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] government and prominent Saudi citizens. The second invocation was in an attempt to derail her personal lawsuit regarding her dismissal from the FBI, where she had worked as a post-9/11 translator and had been a [[whistleblower]].

===Thomas Burnett===
The privilege was invoked in ''Thomas Burnett vs. Al Barka Investment &amp; Development Corporation'' (Civil No. 04ms203) a motion to quash a subpoena for the testimony of Sibel Edmonds. The government's motion to quash based on state secrets privilege was granted in part.

===''Sterling v. Tenet''===
{{main|Jeffrey Alexander Sterling}}

Jeffrey Sterling was an [[African-American]] CIA agent who started a racial discrimination suit. It was thrown out on account of this privilege.&lt;ref name="Carrie Newton Lyons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew Zajac"/&gt;

===Nira Schwartz===
The privilege was invoked in ''Schwartz vs. TRW'' (Civil No. 96-3065, Central District, Cal) a Qui-Tam claim by Schwartz. Intervention and assertion of the state secrets privilege, by the government, resulted in case dismissal.

===Crater Corporation===

The privilege was invoked in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] case of ''Crater Corporation vs. [[Lucent Technologies]] Inc.'' and AT&amp;T Company, ([https://web.archive.org/web/20051210085312/http://fedcir.gov/opinions/04-1349.pdf ''Crater Corp. v. Lucent Technologies''], September 7, 2005). Crater was prevented from proceeding with discovery in its [[patent infringement]] case (U.S. Patent No. 5,286,129) by the United States' assertion that discovery could cause "extremely grave damage to national security". The infringement case centered on wet-mate underwater [[fiber optic]] coupling devices beneath the sea.

===''ACLU vs. NSA''===
{{main|American Civil Liberties Union v. National Security Agency}}

On May 26, 2006, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] filed a motion to dismiss ''[[ACLU v. NSA]]'', the ACLU's lawsuit against the NSA by invoking the state secrets privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA Lawsuit - Stop Illegal Surveillance|url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/index.html|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=1 June 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221642/http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/index.html|archivedate=1 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, 2006, the case was dismissed. In a different case in Michigan, brought by the ACLU against the NSA on behalf of various scholars, journalists, attorneys, and national non-profit organizations, Judge Anna Diggs Taylor ruled on August 17, 2006, that the program was unconstitutional and should be halted. She upheld the doctrine but ruled that the government's public statements concerning the operation were admissible and constituted sufficient proof for the case to continue without any privileged evidence or discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Strikes Down NSA Warrantless Surveillance Program|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/federal-court-strikes-down-nsa-warrantless-surveillance-program|website=American Civil Liberties Union|date=17 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 6, 2007, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Taylor's decision, ruling 2-1 that the ACLU could not produce evidence to prove that the ACLU had been wrongfully wiretapped by the NSA and therefore did not have the standing to bring such a case to court, regardless of the legality question. On February 19, 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear the ACLU's appeal.

===''Center for Constitutional Rights et al. v. Bush et al.''===

On May 27, 2006, the Justice Department moved to preempt the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] (CCR) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060615072224/http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/reports/report.asp?ObjID=YmERLgnGvJ&amp;Content=777 challenge] to warrantless domestic surveillance by invoking the state secrets privilege. The Bush Administration is arguing that CCR's case could reveal secrets regarding U.S. national security, and thus the presiding judge must dismiss it without reviewing the evidence.

===''Hepting v. AT&amp;T''===
{{main|NSA call database|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|Hepting v. AT&amp;T}}

In April 2006, the Bush administration took initial steps to use the state secrets rule to block a lawsuit against [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] and the [[National Security Agency]] brought by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|title=U.S. trying to halt suit against NSA|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6066688-7.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6066688&amp;subj=news|website=CNET News|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119135205/http://news.com.com/2061-10789_3-6066688.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6066688&amp;subj=news|archivedate=19 January 2013|date=28 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EFF alleged that the government has secret computer rooms conducting broad, illegal surveillance of American citizens.&lt;ref name="Glenn Greenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Lanman"/&gt; Testifying at a January 29, 2008, [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearing on reform of the state secrets privilege, EFF attorney [[Kevin Bankston]] contended that the administration's interpretation of the privilege was overly broad, and failed to properly consider the evidentiary procedures provided for by Section 1806(f) of the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Khalid El-Masri===
{{main|Khalid El-Masri|Extraordinary rendition}}

In May 2006, the illegal detention case of [[Khalid El-Masri]] was dismissed based on the privilege, which was invoked by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).  [[Khalid El-Masri]] alleged that he was falsely held by the CIA for several months (which the CIA acknowledges) and was beaten, drugged, and subjected to [[torture]], [[degrading treatment|degrading]] and [[inhuman treatment|inhuman]] while in United States  [[command and control|captivity]]. He was ultimately released by the CIA with no charge ever being brought against him by the United States government. Judge [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Ellis&amp;nbsp;III]] of the [[U.S. District Court]] dismissed the case because, according to the court, the simple fact of holding proceedings would jeopardize state secrets, as claimed by the CIA.&lt;ref name="El-Masri Rendition Case"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/25606prs20060519.html&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20070303_MASRI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 9, 2007, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] declined to hear an appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision, letting the doctrine of state secrets privilege stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |title=Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Torture Appeal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/washington/10scotus.html?ref=us |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maher Arar===
{{main|Maher Arar|Extraordinary rendition}}

The privilege was invoked against a case where [[Maher Arar]], a wrongfully-accused and tortured victim, sought to sue [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] for his role in deporting Arar to [[Syria]] to face torture and extract false confessions. It was formally invoked by [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[James B. Comey]] in legal papers filed in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]]. The invocation read, "Litigating [the] plaintiff's complaint would necessitate disclosure of classified information", which it later stated included disclosure of the basis for detaining him in the first place, the basis for refusing to deport him to Canada as he had requested, and the basis for sending him to Syria.

===''Jane Doe et al. v. CIA''===
On January 4, 2007, District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain ordered the dismissal of ''Jane Doe et al. v. CIA'', 05 Civ. 7939 based on the state secrets privilege. Jane Doe and her children sued the CIA for money damages after her husband's covert employment with the CIA was "terminated immediately for unspecified reasons".&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/jud/statesec/doe010407.pdf Jane Doe vs. CIA] Jan. 4, 2007; USDJ Laura Taylor Swain&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era''''' is a 2012 book about the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] and its response to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|world financial crisis]] written by journalist [[Michael Grunwald]]. He describes the discussions and debates that led to the government's anti-recession measures such as the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA). Taking a positive review of the President's efforts, Grunwald defends the economic measures as full of important, long-term investments while charging [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] opponents as being hypocritical and self-serving. The book was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] on August 14, 2012.&lt;ref name=impat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2012/bc1014jb.html|date=14 October 2012|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|first=Judah|last=Bellin|title=The Politics of Impatience|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt;

Grunwald had previously served as a journalist for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as well as the author of the 2007 non-fiction work ''The Swamp: The Everglades, Florida, and the Politics of Paradise''. The title of his new book intentionally refers back to the '[[New Deal]]' policies of [[POTUS|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a matter also much discussed in the book itself.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; Supportive reviews ran in publications such as ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg View]]'',&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'',&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; and ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'',&lt;ref name=kirkus/&gt; while negative reviews appeared in publications such as [[Reason.com]] and ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=impat/&gt;&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:Barack Obama signs American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 17.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed the ARRA into law on February 17, 2009. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] stood directly behind him.]]

Grunwald describes the goals of the Obama administration as finding a "direction, not a destination." Thus, he details the debates and discussions behind anti-recession measures as about "[[metamorphosis]]" as well as [[fiscal stimulus]]. President Obama took office in January 2009, Grunwald writes, and enacted a "down payment on long-term goals" in the short political time space that Obama had, using Obama's "one shot to spend boatloads of money pursuing his vision." As Grunwald states, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA) took shape based on a conscious desire to recreate the [[public works]] projects undertaken by [[POTUS|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].&lt;ref name=impat/&gt;

In addition, he writes about how Obama, in a particular contrast to Roosevelt, actively participated in the transition between his team and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. The new President, as he details, publicly supported the past [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] as well as measures to assist the beleaguered [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. auto industry]]. Grunwald also notes Obama’s choice of [[Rahm Emanuel]] as [[White House Chief of Staff]] as a prime example of Obama's effort to create a revamped version of [[Bill Clinton]]'s insider policy team, with their [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian macro-economic view]] represented.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

[[File:ARRA in Rhode Island.JPG|thumb|right|250px|This [[Middletown, Rhode Island]] road project, like many others across the U.S., took place in August 2009 as part of the ARRA program.]]

Grunwald details how one administration adviser described the process as "[s]omeone would make a single phone call, and suddenly it’s, 'All righty. Put a billion dollars over there'." Grunwald negatively portrays the objections of Republicans to the government spending increases as seizing an opportunity to oppose the new President.&lt;ref name=impat/&gt; He argues that they opposed even things that they supposedly called for in the past, such as [[tax cuts]], by refusing to co-operate at all, with Grunwald charging that [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] knew they could portray themselves positively on the side of fiscal restraint should the economy falter further.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

Ultimately, Grunwald accounts how Obama's $787 billion stimulus package amounted to about 4% of America’s [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] while, during the [[Great Depression]], the biggest stimulus in any year amounted to just about 1.5% of GDP. The President's early, pre-[[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration]] plan, at $300 billion, increased given the particularly frustrating [[unemployment]] situation. Early 2009 data had presented losses of around 800,000 a month.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

He writes that critics of ARRA correctly view it as using economic tools to alter American society, implementing particular school reforms, measures supporting [[Low-carbon power|low-carbon energy]], health care regulations, and the like all in ways that shift more control to the [[executive branch]] and away from state and local governments. He quotes economist [[Larry Summers]]' observation that governments inherently make bad [[venture capital]]ists. However, Grunwald defends this overlying Obama policy as a set of bold investments, especially in regards to spending on untested new technologies, that will set up large future gains.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

==Reviews==

''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' ran a negative review by writer Judah Bellin. He wrote, "[T]he stimulus provided sound basis for opposition: in addition to the well-publicized failures of Solyndra and Ener1, numerous infrastructure projects faced local obstacles and delays, leading to Obama’s memorable admission that 'shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected'." He also argued that "Obama comes across as similarly unaware of the limits of top-down planning" in the book as well as that the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] provided a rejoinder to President Obama's economic policy vision.&lt;ref name=impat/&gt;

[[File:US EmpStatsBLS Jan09-Sept12.PNG|thumb|right|300px|This image shows U.S. employment statistics changes from January 2009 to September 2012.]]

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' published a positive review, describing the book as a "cogent reality check" as well as a "pointed, in-the-trenches study whose thrust will be borne out with time.&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/michael-grunwald/new-new-deal/|title=The New New Deal by Michael Grunwald|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' also ran a supportive review, the news-magazine stating that the book "does a meticulous job, casting much new light on the advance thinking... both before the election and, especially, during the long transition". In addition, ''The Economist'' concluded:
{{quote|"The truth is that no one really knows yet how well spent the longer-term parts of the immense Recovery and Reinvestment Act will turn out to have been. But no writer has yet gone this far, at least in unraveling where the money has gone. ''The New New Deal'' is the most interesting book that has been published about the Obama administration. Even Republicans should read it."&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560529|title=The big promise|publisher=''[[The Economist]]''|accessdate=October 21, 2012|date=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The editor-in-chief of ''[[The Politico]]'', John Harris, praised the book, arguing that it "demolishes cliches and vividly reframes our thinking about President Obama and his stimulus package through a gripping narrative." Harris also wrote, "Even if everyone doesn't agree with Grunwald's provocative conclusions, every serious reader will see in Grunwald’s book a vindication of serious journalism, at a time when we need it." ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg View]]'' columnist Frank Wilkinson also commented on Grunwald's "excellent book", saying that he viewed Grunwald as "a crisp and engaging writer".&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|title=What Does Politico’s Editor Really Think of the Stimulus?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/what-does-politico-s-editor-really-think-of-the-stimulus-.html|first=Francis|last=Wilkinson|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=October 21, 2012|publisher=''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg View]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Cavanaugh]] wrote for ''[[reason.com]]'' blasting the book and what he viewed as the author's "[[chutzpah]]"; he commented that Grunwald expressed "no knowledge of economics beyond what figures in headlines, which is probably worse than knowing no economics at all." He also stated that the book's only strength was its "rotisserie league party wonkery" given that it otherwise, in his view, "goes on for nearly half a thousand frequently repetitive pages of text, all explicating a convoluted set of theories." Cavanaugh argued:
{{quote|"Given the three years of economic stagnation that followed, Grunwald here is ignoring the real story, arguably the most important news story of our time: The credit unwind never ended... since the putative end of the recession, the suffering of Americans at the level of the street, the family, and the retail store has continued unabated, and over a greater time duration (another calculation Grunwald doesn't engage)."&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2012/09/05/americans-too-dumb-to-vote-says-time-nat|title=Americans Too Dumb to Vote, Says Time National Correspondent|author=[[Tim Cavanaugh]]|publisher=[[Reason.com]]|date=September 5, 2012|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''theory shell''', a type of theory argument, is employed in the activity of [[Lincoln-Douglas]] and [[policy debate]].  Theory in LD debate is all about proposing rules to abide by.  As such, theory debaters argue that theory comes before substantive debate as theory helps to determine if the debate, in the first place, is skewed or even worth debating on. A theory shell seeks to do this by criticizing something the opponent did that had not followed your(the person using the shell) vision of how the debate should work.  The means of how they are justified are usually in the terms of fairness and education.  Theory shells are used by many competitors in the high school circuit and continue to be a popular argument used in LD and policy debate.

A theory argument consists of 4 major parts: the interpretation, violation, standards and the voter(s).  A theory shell helps to organize these theory arguments into a more collective idea that can be debated upon in a round.  Shells are usually organized into groups denoted by an alphabetical letter - A for the interpretation, B for the violation, etc - and are read both on/off case.

==Interpretation==
The interpretation is the first part of a theory shell.  Similar to the advocacy text run on an alternate plan(counterplan); the interpretation is the statement of a particular rule that all debaters must abide by.  This can tell us what we can and cannot do as well as describe how this impacts the quality of the debate (refer to fairness and education).  

Solid interpretations are not too vague.  Referencing a nib (necessary but insufficient burden) by saying that 'nibs are bad' is too vague and is open for easy interpretation by the opposing side. This allows for the opponent to easily contest the violations of the shell (which will be discussed later).   When creating a shell you must be specific of what rule cannot be broken by highlighting what they cannot do.

Another thing to think about when creating theory shells is about being 'prescriptive and not descriptive'.  A shell states what you cannot do rather than just explaining a rule.  Going back to the same example with the nibs; saying that 'nibs are bad' just claims that they are bad and goes no further into what the debaters should do instead.  This is especially important because debate itself is [[comparative]] meaning that even if a world with nibs is bad, it could mean that a world without them is even worse.  This interpretation does not effort into describing what should be done along with offering no basis for the status quo opening the room up for interpretation.  Thus, theory shells describe what a debater should do(not just a claim on if something is 'good' or 'bad').  An example interpretation for something called disclosure theory (the idea that all debaters must disclose) would be 'all Debaters must, on the page with their name and the school they attend, disclose the tag-lines, full citations, and the first and last three words of any pieces of evidence read in their case which they have read in their case in a previous round on the (NDCA) wiki at least one hour before the round'.

==Violation==

The next step of a shell after the interpretation is the violation.  The violation is pretty straightforward; it establishes how the opponent violated or deviated from the given interpretation.

The most common method for locating and providing a violation is just to bring something up from the opponents case.  If, in the negative's constructive, the neg reads that the aff must prove that it is feasible and that the we ought to take the aff action, they clearly violate the nib interpretation.  

Also, another way to provide a violation is by asking them in crossfire(cx).  Referencing back to disclosure theory; if you get the neg or aff to concede to not having disclosed, then you would just have to bring it up in your next speech in order to carry it across the flow.  This allows for the judge to recognize the violation helps to establish a clear basis of argumentation for your case.  Using direct examples and clear concessions are important to a strong shell.  Some abusive debaters even manipulate the wording of the shell to get a violation from their opponent.  This strategy becomes hard though when your violation is too specific.

==Standards==

Next, after the violations, come the standards.  Providing just a rule for the debate isn't enough.  They require arguments and justifications, which are essentially the standards.  Just like contentions in a traditional case, the standards act as the justification for the shell.  Standards themselves are divided into 3 parts:the tag, warrant and the internal link.

====Tag====

The tag is designed to provide a summary of the argument.  Tags for standards are usually one to two words long, with common tags including “ground, predictability, reciprocity, strategy skew, topic literature, etc.”  Tags are important in helping to differentiate different standards as well as helping to weigh the various impacts in the shell.  In the contention analogy, the tag “Contention 1: Giving adolescents autonomous medical choices saves lives” indicates to the judge to the judge that the contention will be about protecting lives without going into the micro analysis of how that will happen. A standard tag like “ground” does the same by indicating the types or quality of the arguments you have access to improves when the interpretation is adopted, without going into the specifics of how it happens.

====Warrant====

The warrant is the second part of a standard and basically justifies a world with or without the interpretation.  For example, if you were making an argument on 'ground' you would say how your opponent gives you no ground.  This, in some occasion, involves evidence and provides a look at a world that excludes the given interpretation.  Impacting these claims out to fairness and education are also common as it provides reasons of why they should be considered.

====Internal Link====

Much like any link in debate, an internal link is the establishment of the standards(tags) to the given voters.  Much of the time they are obvious - proving that not disclosing leads to 'no research' can be linked to a lack of education from the round - but it is still important to prove these links.  This is because many judges won’t evaluate theory without internal links, and having good internal links helps with weighing between theory impacts when your opponent doesn’t fully develop on their own.

==Voters==

The final part of a theory shell are the voters.  Your voter finishes up your shell; you've detailed your rule, showed how your opponent violated it and provided why it was good, but you need to justify why your judge should vote on, or even consider, your rule.  The voter explains to your judge why your shell is important and most often uses both fairness and education as grounds to do so.  Voters are often warranted in terms of duties that are inherent to judging or the goals of debate as an activity. There are many other voters, other than fairness and education, that are employed as voters in order to justify your shell.

The '''Zheleznovodsk Communiqué''', also known as the '''Zheleznovodsk Declaration''' or '''Zheleznovodsk Accords''', is the joint peace [[communiqué]] mediated by [[President of Russia|Russian President]], [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[President of Kazakhstan|Kazakh President]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] in [[Zheleznovodsk]], [[Russia]] on September 23, 1991 with an intention to end the three-year-long hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region, still an autonomous oblast of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]].&lt;ref name=Ulster&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaceagreements.ulster.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Agreements/agree.pl?full=617"|title= The Transitional Justice Peace Agreements Database. Record 617 |date=|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although consensus was reached, the treaty was never ratified.

==Background==
The [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|conflict]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of Azerbaijan SSR which started in early 1988&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/news/newsid_3681000/3681079.stm | script-title=ru:Карабах: хронология конфликта |trans-title=Karabakh: Chronology of the conflict | publisher= [[BBC News]] | author =  | date=2005-08-29| accessdate=2010-04-14|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; had developed unmitigated and claimed lives of many civilians, interior troops and army.

==Mediating mission==
With consent from the authorities in Azerbaijan and Armenia, Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev led a mediating mission on September 20–23 visiting [[Baku]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Stepanakert]] (Khankendi) and [[Yerevan]]. Taking the principles of [[territorial integrity]], non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign states, observance of civil rights as the starting point, breakthrough was achieved on September 22 when Armenia renounced all its claims to Azerbaijani territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/23/world/armenia-yielding-claim-on-enclave.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Armenia%20Yielding%20Claim%20on%20Enclave&amp;st=cse | title= ARMENIA YIELDING CLAIM ON ENCLAVE | publisher= [[The New York Times]] | author = Bill Keller | date=1991-09-23 | accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the parties to agree to a joint communique the next day, committing both sides to disarm and withdraw militias, allow return of [[refugee]]s and [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]], re-establish Soviet-era administrative order of the Nagorno-Karabakh [[oblast]] and set up delegations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. [[Soviet army]] and internal troops would still remain in the conflict zone and the process would be supervised by Russian and Kazakh officials. The peace communiqué was discussed with participation of Y. Shaposhnikov, V.Barannikov, S. Voskanyan, M. Gezalov, V. Dzhafarov, [[Robert Kocharian|R. Kocharian]], L. Petrosian, M. Radayev and was signed by [[Boris Yeltsin]] (Russian Federation), [[Ayaz Mutalibov]] (Azerbaijan), [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] (Kazakhstan) and [[Levon Ter-Petrosian]] (Armenia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/nagorny-karabakh/keytexts6.php|title= Zheleznovodsk Declaration |date= September 23, 1991 |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;


After, Azerbaijan motivated its actions by [[1991 Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopter shootdown|the crash of Azerbaijani MI-8]] helicopter with Russian, Kazakh observers and Azerbaijani high-ranking state officials on board when it was shot down over [[Karakend]] village of [[Martuni District (NKAO)|Martuni District]] in uninvestigated circumstances in November 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stopping Wars and Making Peace: Studies in International Intervention |last1=Eichensehr |first1=Kristen |last2=Reisman |first2=W.Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= Leiden, The Netherlands|isbn= 978-90-04-17855-7 |page=54 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjcSb5Yw2_UC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=November+20+Azerbaijan+helicopter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ak-6S6C1KoWKlweHo4SWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
