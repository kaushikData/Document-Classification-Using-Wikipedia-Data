'''''391''''' was an arts and literary magazine created by [[Francis Picabia]], published between 1917 and 1924 in [[Barcelona]], [[Zurich]] and [[New York City]].

==History and profile==
''391'' first appeared in January 1917 in [[Barcelona]], published by {{Ill|Josep Dalmau i Rafel|ca}}, founder of [[Galeries Dalmau|Les Galeries Dalmau]], and continued to be published until 1924.&lt;ref name="sas"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Brooker|author2=Sascha Bru|author3=Andrew Thacker|author4=Christian Weikop|title=The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=19 May 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965958-6|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was created by the [[Dada]]ist Francis Picabia. Picabia produced the first four issues, which Dalmau published.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; He was assisted in assembling the magazine by [[Olga Sacharoff]], a Georgian emigre residing in Barcelona.

The title of the magazine derives from [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s New York periodical ''[[291 (journal)|291]]'' (to which Picabia had contributed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aránzazu Ascunce Arenas|title=Barcelona and Madrid: Social Networks of the Avant-Garde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLnlK0xs0mQC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=15 November 2014|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-61148-425-0|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bore no relation to its contents. Despite Picabia's renown as an artist, it was mostly literary in content, with a wide-ranging aggressive tone, possibly influenced by [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. There were contributions by two men new to Dada: [[Man Ray]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. However ''391'' remained essentially the expression of the inventive, energetic and wealthy Picabia, who stated of it: ''"Every page must explode, whether through seriousness, profundity, turbulence, nausea, the new, the eternal, annihilating nonsense, enthusiasm for principles, or the way it is printed. Art must be unaesthetic in the extreme, useless and impossible to justify."''

Starting from its fifth issue the magazine was published in New York City.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; Its eighth issue was published in Zurich.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt; Then the magazine was published in [[Paris]] until 1924 when its last issue, number 19, was distributed.&lt;ref name=sas/&gt;

The notion of '''affective design''' emerged from the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI)&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D. A. (1986). Design principles for human-computer interfaces. In D. E. Berger, K. Pezdek, &amp; W. P. Banks (Eds.). Applications of cognitive psychology: Problem solving, education, and computing. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; and more specifically from the developing area of [[affective computing]].&lt;ref name = 'picard'&gt;Reynolds, C. and Picard, R. (2001) Designing for Affective Interactions. In Proceedings of 9th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, 5–10 August 2001, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. [online], available: http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Affective design involves designing interfaces to enable human-computer interactions where emotional information is communicated by the user in a
natural and comfortable way - the computer processes the emotional information and may adapt or respond to try to improve the interaction in some way.&lt;ref name = 'picard' /&gt;

==Aims==
Affective computing aims to deliver affective interfaces&lt;ref name = 'picard' /&gt; capable of eliciting certain [[Emotions|emotional experiences]] from users.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, J. and Wright, P. (2004). What is enjoyment doing to HCI? In ECCE'12: Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Cognitive. European Association of Cognitive Ergonomics, Le Chesney, France.  pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, affective design attempts to define the subjective emotional relationships between consumers and [[Product (business)|products]] and to explore the affective properties that products intend to communicate through their physical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Carliner, S. (2000) "Physical, Cognitive, and Affective: A Three-Part Framework for Information Design” [online], available: https://web.archive.org/web/20061231230832/http://saulcarliner.home.att.net/id/newmodel.htm [accessed 10 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to deliver [[Virtual artifact|artefacts]] capable of eliciting maximum [[physio-psychological]] pleasure consumers may obtain through all of their [[senses]].

'''''Antibirth''''' is a 2016 American-Canadian [[psychedelic film|psychedelic]] [[body horror|body horror film]] written and directed by Danny Perez, and starring [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Meg Tilly]], [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]], [[Maxwell McCabe-Lokos]] and [[Emmanuel Kabongo]]. The film follows a drug-addled woman in a remote [[Michigan]] town who becomes pregnant after taking a strange drug. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2016. The film was released in the United States on September 2, 2016, by [[IFC Midnight]].

==Plot==
Lou ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a hard-partying [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in a run-down trailer outside a rural [[Michigan]] town where women have recently been going missing. She awakens one morning after a party at an abandoned warehouse and finds herself experiencing bizarre symptoms akin to those experienced during pregnancy. Her friend, Sadie ([[Chloë Sevigny]]) believes she is pregnant and not telling her about it, despite Lou's claims that she hasn't had sex with anyone in nearly a year. Lou also believes that it is impossible for her to get pregnant after an upsetting incident six months earlier when she miscarried in a club while on the toilet. After getting a ride from her friend Luke ([[Emmanuel Kabongo]]) to her cleaning job at a motel, she encounters an eccentric stranger, Lorna ([[Meg Tilly]]), who is staying in one of the hotel rooms.

Meanwhile, Gabriel ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]), Sadie's drug dealer and boyfriend, is keeping a woman hidden in his apartment who has had a grotesque physical reaction to a new and strange drug Gabriel and his friend Warren have been selling to locals. It is revealed that Sadie, who had a child many years ago, is working to try to reunite with her estranged offspring, though Gabriel is doubtful it will ever happen. In addition to running drugs (including unstable, experimental drugs, some of which turned an underling's skin inside out upon sampling it), Gabriel works as a pimp; during an encounter between a sex worker and a client, a strange man, apparently familiar to Gabriel and later revealed to be Isaac, watches the intercourse take place, noting his interest in the encounter.

One afternoon, Lou loses consciousness and has bizarre [[hallucination]]s in which figures from Funzone, a local [[family entertainment center]] give her a vaginal exam. She awakens to find her stomach protruding, and a [[boil]] formed on her foot, which leaks a clear fluid after she cuts it open with a knife. When Lou regains consciousness, Lorna arrives at her trailer unannounced, and asks her if she's experienced a series of odd symptoms and mental fogginess; she claims to be [[clairvoyant]],and have noticed that Lou seemed troubled when she had met her at the motel. The two have lunch at the Funzone, and Lorna confesses that she was abducted by an unknown entity while enrolled in the [[military]], an event which led to her being discharged when she questioned her authorities. Lou confronts Warren, who works at the Funzone, about the night before she began experiencing her symptoms; he admits that Gabriel has been "trading" women, mostly runaways, to a mysterious man named Isaac in exchange for drugs to sell.

At her trailer, Lorna shows Lou a scar on her forearm, where she claims an [[Implant (medicine)|implant]] was inserted and then forcibly removed while she was in the military. Sadie arrives the next day, and suggests Lou see a doctor, but Lou insists she is not experiencing a pregnancy. Lou, Sadie, and Lorna go to visit the abandoned warehouse where the party had occurred the night before her symptoms began. There, she has a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of being injected with a drug by Gabriel at the party. Sadie then confesses that Gabriel had used Lou as a test subject for the new drug—an experimental hormone for women—that he has been selling.

Back at Lou's trailer, Lorna attempts to give Lou a [[cesarian section]] to remove the growth in her stomach.  Instead, Lou gives birth to a grotesque, animated disembodied head. Just after the birth, Gabriel and Isaac arrive at the trailer along with another [[SWAT]] member who shoots Lorna. Isaac reveals that the military is investigating a way to create a new race that can survive the toxic atmosphere of space (which he has been to several times) and that her lifestyle of hard-drinking and drug use, as well as his secretly pumping toxins into her home, provided an ample womb for their experiment. He tells Lou that she can help him build a new, superior race, but she refuses to continue. As he explains this, arms begin to emerge from her vagina, followed by the whole of her [[cytoskeleton]], leaving her flesh an empty shell. The headless creature attacks and kills both Gabriel and Isaac. A [[SWAT]] member enters the trailer after hearing a commotion, and sees the trailer covered in blood, as the full-bodied creature stands in the kitchen, holding its head in its hands.

==Production==
The movie started from a desire by Perez to do something more focused on narrative than his usual work.&lt;ref name="creatorproject"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Furino|first1=Giaco|title=Director Danny Perez on Fever-Dream Feature Film 'Antibirth' [Interview]|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/director-danny-perez-antibirth-interview|website=The Creators Project|publisher=Vice|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In designing the feature, Perez sought to work with a female lead, telling Daily Dead "narratively and visually I'm more interested in that." He created a script to deliberately "subvert a lot of female archetypes", specifically subverting the idea of how pregnancy is usually depicted as "this image of women as glowing in gestational bliss and being so happy".&lt;ref name="Dailydeadsubvert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wixson|first1=Heather|title=Sundance 2016 Interview: Writer/Director Danny Perez Discusses ANTIBIRTH|url=http://dailydead.com/sundance-2016-interview-writerdirector-danny-perez-discusses-antibirth/|website=Dailydead|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No one really talks about the more gruesome aspects of pregnancy and what it does to the body."&lt;ref name="Dailydeadsubvert"/&gt; In creating the narrative, Perez was also inspired by various [[conspiracy theory]] enthusiasts as well as "weird UFO [[YouTube]] videos".&lt;ref name="creatorproject"/&gt;

From the beginning, Perez wrote the film with Natasha Lyone in mind, whom he was personally friends with,&lt;ref name="creatorproject"/&gt; with her officially signing on in  May 2014 along with [[Chloë Sevigny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/kaleidoscope-boards-sevigny-horror/5071942.article|title=Kaleidoscope boards Chloe Sevigny horror Antibirth|website=Screen Daily|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=May 17, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 64% based on 28 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/antibirth |title=Antibirth (2016) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/antibirth |title=Antibirth Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling it "good old body horror movie. It's got the suggestion of pregnancy, so you're dealing with the undertones of a woman's mixed feelings about her own capacity to give life, but if you don't want to go there it's really just gross as hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3377678/sundance-review-antibirth-gross-hell/|work=Bloody-Disgusting|title=[Sundance Review] 'Antibirth' is Gross as Hell!|author=Topel, Fred|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Guardian]]'' also gave the film a positive review, drawing comparisons to ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' and [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[The Brood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/27/antibirth-review-film-sundance-2016-natasha-lyonne-cronenberg-dude|work=The Guardian|title=Antibirth review - Natasha Lyonne makes a splash in whacked-out Dude-meets-Brood|author=Hoffman, Jordan|accessdate=January 28, 2016|date=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as resembling a "[[meth]] fever dream."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/movies/antibirth-natasha-lyonne-and-chloe-sevignys-sundance-reunion.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|title='Antibirth,' Natasha Lyonne and Chloë Sevigny's Sundance Reunion|author=Barnes, Brooks|date=January 26, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying, "There are at least six different movies in ''Antibirth'', and none of them work in tandem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/sundance-film-review-antibirth/|work=Consequence of Sound|title=Sundance Film Review: Antibirth|author=Roffman, Michael|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''artnet Magazine'', June 5, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A computerized international database that captures information about lost and stolen art, antiques, and collectables, the ALR is a London-based, independent, for profit corporate offspring of the New York-based, nonprofit [[International Foundation for Art Research]] (IFAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifar.org/home.php|title=International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR)-IFAR Home Page|website=www.ifar.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of functions served by ALR has grown as the number of its listed items has increased. The database is used by collectors, the art trade, insurers, and law enforcement agencies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artloss.com/content/home Art Loss Register] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501083655/http://www.artloss.com/content/home |date=May 1, 2010 }}: [http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525120830/http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business |date=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, IFAR helped create the Art Loss Register (ALR) as a commercial enterprise to expand and market the database. IFAR managed ALR's U.S. operations through 1997. In 1998 the ALR assumed full responsibility for the IFAR database although IFAR retains ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifar.org/about.php|title=IFAR Retains Ownership of Art Loss Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the database comprised only 20,000 items, but it grew in size nearly tenfold during its first decade.&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, Simon. (2006). ''Museum of the Missing, p. 8.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houpt, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first steps towards ALR began with the establishment of IFAR in New York in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/08/archives/art-group-is-set-up-to-judge-attribution.html?sq=international%2520foundatin%2520for%2520art%2520research&amp;scp=13&amp;st=cse   "Art Group Is Set Up To Judge Attribution,"] ''New York Times.'' May 8, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other explicit goals, IFAR was created to compile information about stolen art.&lt;ref name="yarrow"&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the growth of international art thefts, IFAR began publishing the "Stolen Art Alert" in 1976.

By 1990, IFAR was updating its catalogue of stolen art 10 times a year.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;  The magnitude of the problem overwhelmed what had grown to be over 20,000 manual records. While IFAR had been very successful in recording the details of losses, that was only a good first step.

In 1991, the ALR was established in London as a commercial company, earning fees from insurers and theft victims. Its founding shareholders included insurance and auction houses, which some think is a conflict of interest [[Christie's#cite note-72]]. The majority of shares are owned by its founder, [[Julian Radcliffe]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/arts/design/tracking-stolen-art-for-profit-and-blurring-a-few-lines.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 Tracking Stolen Art, for Profit, and Blurring a Few Lines, ''New York Times'', September 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Significant capital investment was needed so that IFAR could be computerised and so that the database made available to worldwide law enforcement agencies and others.  

==Development==
In response to the growth and development of IFAR, museum officials revised some policies based on an assumption that discussing theft would scare away potential donors. The AFR initially formed a partnership with the ALR, but, they later split after disagreements over strategy and issues of control.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The change from policies of secrecy to ones which emphasize openness was gradual, mirroring an expectation that publicizing theft is likely to promote recovery.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt; The ALR has been widely criticised for its methods and for the actions of its chairman, [[Julian Radcliffe]]. The Register has consistently lost money but for the personal cash infusions of its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/08/01/optical-due-diligence-art-loss-register-claims-to-vet-ancient-art-does-it/|title=Art Loss Register Claims to Vet Ancient Art, Does it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1990''': Artworks stolen from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston includes [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]]'s [[The Concert (Vermeer)|Concert]], three [[Rembrandt]]s and five works by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]].&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;
* '''1989''': IFAR received reports of about 5,000 thefts.&lt;ref name="yarrow"/&gt;
* '''2003''': ALR obtains information about a Sisley stolen from the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Orléans]] in Orleans. The museum was unable to afford the fee and the Sisley has not been recovered.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Criticism of methods==
The approach adopted by the ALR has been criticised. The Register has contacted owners of stolen art saying it had information, but not revealing it until a fee was paid. In another instance the ALR lied to Sotheby’s saying that paintings were not stolen. The paintings were then shipped to London, where they were seized.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The ALR has likened this approach to the police misleading a suspect during an investigation.

{{nihongo|'''Art Olympia'''|アートオリンピア|}} is an international open art [[competition]] organized by Art Olympia Executive Committee and co-organized with Living National Treasure Museum.

==History==
It is held every two years after the first edition of Art Olympia in 2015. Its concept is to discover talented artists around the world and support their activities. Judges consist of international key personalities involved with art. A points system is used to judge artworks, in which the score is based on the total number of points received from all the judges. At the first Art Olympia, the 22nd Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, [[Ryohei Miyata]], a painter, [[Hiroshi Senju]], and a director of [[Gagosian]] Gallery in New York, [[Kara Vander Weg]] and more were invited as judges.

The '''''Avanton Gold Cone''''' or '''''Avanton Cone''''' ({{lang-fr|Cône d'Or d'Avanton}} or {{lang-fr|Cône d'Avanton}}) is a late [[Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]], belonging to the group of [[Golden hats]], only four of which are known so far. 

The Avanton Cone was the second such object to be discovered (after the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt]]). It was found in 1844 in a field near the village of [[Avanton]], about 12 km north of [[Poitiers]], [[France]]. The object was damaged; comparison with other finds suggests that a part (the brim) is missing. The remaining part of the Avanton cone is 55 cm long and weighs 285 g. Originally dated to the Middle Bronze and suggested to be a [[phallic symbol|fertility symbol]], it now appears to be of later date and more complex function (see [[Golden hats]]).

The Avanton Cone is on display in the [[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], near [[Paris]].

It was first awarded in 1954, on the bicentenary of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], and continues to be awarded annually with exceptions in 2003, 2006 and 2012.

The Medal was instituted in 1954 to commemorate the founding of the RSA over two hundred years earlier, and has been awarded to a variety of individuals for their outstanding contributions to the advancement of design in industry and society.  In the RSA's current account of design, that contribution is interpreted as the most effective use of design to increase the resourcefulness of people and communities.

==Summary==
''Casino'' covers the period through the seventies to early eighties when the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] controlled certain [[Las Vegas]] casinos. Pileggi focuses on the story of [[Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal]], a [[Chicago]] bookmaker working for organized crime, and his friend, partner and also Mafia member, [[Anthony Spilotro]].

The book is the basis for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/ IMDB: Casino]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[1995 in film|1995]]) directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. The screenplay for ''Casino'' was by Pileggi and Scorsese. Although Pileggi had already written the book and wanted it published in advance of the film version, Scorsese persuaded him to forgo the usual chronology and to release the book after the film.&lt;ref name="Baxter p337"&gt;{{cite book|author=Baxter, John |title=De Niro: A Biography|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main protagonists/antagonists of Rosenthal and Spilotro were portrayed as [[Ace Rothstein]] and [[Nicky Santoro]] by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Joe Pesci]]. [[Sharon Stone]], playing Rothstein's wife, Ginger, was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (lost to [[Susan Sarandon]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112641/awards IMDB: Casino: Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Circus''''' ({{lang-ru|Цирк}}; [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;Tsirk) is a 1936 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[melodrama]]tic [[comedy]] [[musical film|musical]] [[film]]. It was directed by [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] and Isidor Simkov   at the [[Mosfilm]] studios. In his own words, it was conceived as "an eccentric comedy...a real side splitter."&lt;ref name="rimgaila"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rimgaila Salys|title=The Musical Comedy Films of Grigorii Aleksandrov: Laughing Matters|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=cDk8d2UMRLwC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=Tsirk,+Circus+Aleksandrov&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FkIvhUIAt2&amp;sig=e62SbgwIOOwR3-EIxKwjg9IHPME&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdwLzeuaLRAhXIcBoKHQw2BSw4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tsirk%2C%20Circus%20Aleksandrov&amp;f=false|year=2009|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-841-50282-3|pages=121–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starring the glamorous and immensely popular [[Lyubov Orlova]] (Aleksandrov's wife), the first recognized star of Soviet cinema and a gifted singer, the film contains several songs which instantly became Soviet classics. The most famous is the "[[Wide Is My Motherland|Song of the Motherland]]" (Широка страна моя родная).&lt;ref name="rimgaila"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/experimentinfilm00unse#page/169/mode/2up|page=169|publisher=The Grey Walls Press Ltd.|title=Experiment in the Film|editor=Roger Manvell|year=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was based on a comedy written by [[Ilf and Petrov]] and [[Valentin Kataev]] and performed by [[Moscow music hall]], ''Under the Circus Dome'' (''Под куполом цирка''), which was seen and liked by Aleksandrov.&lt;ref name="rimgaila"/&gt; They made the play into the plot, but during the initial film shooting they went to America. Upon return, they disliked the director's interpretation, and after a conflict they abandoned the work, forbade the mention of their names in the credits, and further work on the plot was continued by [[Isaac Babel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://orlovamegastar.ru/circus-4.html "Пять интересных фактов о легендарном фильме "Цирк"], May 25, 2013 (retrieved July 19, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilfipetrov.ru/ Сайт поклонников творчества Ильи Ильфа и Евгения Петрова ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Orlova, Patterson and Stolyarov.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Closing scene of the movie: Marion hugs tight her Russian husband Ivan and son Jimmy.]]
Orlova plays an [[United States|American]] [[circus]] artist who, after giving birth to a [[African American|black]] baby (played by [[James Lloydovich Patterson]]), immediately becomes a victim of [[Racism in the United States|racism]] and is forced to stay in the circus, but finds refuge, love and happiness in the [[USSR]]. Her black son is embraced by friendly Soviet people. The movie climaxes with a [[lullaby]] being sung to the baby by representatives of various Soviet [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] taking turns.&lt;ref name="rimgaila"/&gt;

The film was digitally colorized in 2011 in Russia.

The '''''Communion of the Apostles''''', or '''''Institution of the Eucharist''''' is a painting of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Federico Barocci]] located at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome. It was commissioned for the family chapel of [[Pope Clement VIII]] Aldobrandini and completed between 1603 and 1608.&lt;ref name=Apostasy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=The apostasy of Michelangelo in a painting by Federico Barocci|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=Spring 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=27–34|jstor=23206723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was most likely the sight of Barocci's ''Presentation of the Virgin'' in the Chiesa Nuova at its unveiling in 1603 that led to the commission of the ''Communion'' four months later. On 13 August 1603 the pope communicated with the minister to [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere]], duke of Urbino, Giacomo Sorbolongo, about acquiring an altarpiece from Barocci.{{efn|Stasera uerso il tardi il Papa mi ha fatto chiamare, et quando sono stato dent'ro, mi ha detto ridendo, che se bene era cosa leggieri, per la quale mi hauea fatto dimandare, era per'o un suo gusto et seguit'o, come fa fabricare una Capella qui nella Minerua in memoria de' suoi, Padre, Madre et fratelli, et desiderando, che nell'altare di essa ci fosse il quadro fatto da uallente huomo, se bene qui ce ne sono et in particulare ha Iseppino, non dimeno si sodisfarebbe assai hauerlo di mano del Baroccio.}} At this time the [[Cavaliere d'Arpino]] was the pope's most important artist; the letter goes on to ask that d'Arpino not be told of the commission.{{efn|desidera non si sappia da altri tal pratica, massime per rispetto d'Iseppino}}&lt;ref name=Verstegen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=Federico Barocci, Federico Borromeo, and the Oratorian Orbit|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2003|volume=56|issue=1|pages=56–87|doi=10.2307/1262258|jstor=1262258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffael 066.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Detail from the ''School of Athens'', Michelangelo as Heraclitus]]
The commission was completed entirely in [[Urbino]] and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by [[Cherubino Alberti]] with a ''Triumph of the Holy Cross''.&lt;ref name=Emiliani&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emiliani|first1=Andrea|title=Federico Barocci (Urbino 1535-1612)|date=1985|publisher=Nuova Alfa Editoriale|location=Bologna|pages=376–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches.&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|last2=Wohl|first2=Alice Sedgwick|last3=Wohl|first3=Hellmut|last4=Montanari|first4=Tomaso|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521781879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design,&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene.&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Thomas|title=Color and the Exchange of Ideas between Patron and Artist in Renaissance Italy|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2000|volume=82|issue=2|pages=298–308|doi=10.2307/3051378|jstor=3051378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barocci quotes from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' by inserting the portrait of [[Heraclitus]], which many believe is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]]. Significantly, he depicts [[Judas Iscariot]] using Michelangelo's portrait.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Morten Steen|title=In Michelangelo's Mirror|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271056401|pages=148–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUI9xD9ghpgC|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt;

Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler ''Crucifixion'' (Museo del Prado, Madrid).&lt;ref name=Spear&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spear|first1=Richard|title=Scrambling for Scudi: Notes on Painters' Earnings in Early Baroque Rome|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=310–320|doi=10.2307/3177346|jstor=3177346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[crucifix]] of Ferdinand and Sancha''' ({{lang-es|crucifijo de don Fernando y doña Sancha}}) is an [[ivory carving]] from ''circa'' 1063, today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]. It was part of an offering by King [[Ferdinand I of León]] and [[Sancha of León|Queen Sancha]] to furnish the basilica of [[San Isidoro de León]]. It is the earliest known crucifix from Spain depicting the [[body of Christ]]. Although earlier Spanish crucifices of gold, ivory and wood are known, they are all without images. The official inventory of the royal gift describes the crucifix as "a cross of ivory with the image of our crucified Redeemer".&lt;ref&gt;Gómez-Moreno (1947), 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 52&amp;nbsp;cm high, 34.5&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, with the width of the cross beams being 7&amp;nbsp;cm. The image of Christ is 305&amp;nbsp;mm tall.

The figure of Christ is shown with its heading reclining to the left, its large eyes wide open and encrusted with [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], and sporting a beard and moustache. (Jet eyes were common at the time in ivory sculptures of the region.) Each foot is shown nailed individually to the cross. The fingers of Christ's right hand are missing. His ''perizonium'' (loin cloth) covers him to the knees and is tied at his waist. The legs and torso are perfectly vertical. There is a small space behind the body so the piece could serve as a [[reliquary]], as was typical.

On the obverse of the cross are intertwined images of plants and animals, and of humans either ascending to paradise or descending to hell. Above the image of Christ is the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;IHSNAZA&lt;br&gt;RENUSREX&lt;br&gt;IUDEORU&lt;/center&gt;
which transaltes "[[INRI|Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews]]", the citation placed on the cross according to the [[Four Gospels]]. Above the inscription on the ivory is a representation of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Christ]] carrying a cross. At the base of the cross, below the crucified figure, is a figure of [[Adam]], and below that the inscription:
&lt;center&gt;FREDINANDUSREX&lt;br&gt;SANCIAREGINA&lt;/center&gt;
indicating the commissioners of the work, King Ferdinand and Queen Sancha. The reverse of the cross bears plant figures, in the centre the [[Agnus Dei]], and at the four extremities of the arms the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]].

'''''Deep in My Heart''''' is a 1999 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on a true story, starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Lynn Whitfield]] and directed by [[Anita W. Addison]]. Bancroft received a [[primetime Emmy]] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her role. 

==Plot==
In [[Boston]] in the early 1960s, Geraldine Cummins was walking home alone from the movies when she was jumped and raped by a black man. Stunned, she returned home to her husband Bob, stating she had been raped. Sometime later, she finds she is pregnant. She keeps the baby for a few reasons: she is Catholic and she harbors a small hope that it could be her husband's baby. As the baby is black girl, she fears the social isolation she would receive and what people would think of her. She is heartbroken, but decides to give up her daughter. She names her newborn daughter Barbara Anne Cummins and gives her to foster mother Corrine Burrel, a black woman in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]].

Seven years later, Barbara is a happy little girl. A few months later, a social worker comes into their home and informs Corrine that Barbara will be adopted by Annalise and Paul, white people living in Wisconsin. Corrine seeks legal action, looking to adopt Barbara for herself, but as she is divorced with no job and many children, she is turned down.

Annalise becomes worried about Barbara's very detached nature and suggests to Paul they move to a suburban neighborhood where Barbara could be around other black kids. Paul is angry that they have to change everything for a child he did not want, but agrees, only to leave them after moving. Barbara has once again receded into herself after the neighborhood children make fun of her for being black with a white mother. Over the years until she is 16, she is alone without her mother or friends. At 16 she meets Don, a football playing choirboy. She falls in love with him and ultimately gets pregnant. 

Years later, in the middle of Barbara's third pregnancy, the doctor suggests she look into her birth family history for medical reasons. This leads her in search for her mother. She visits Corrine and later contacts the agency in charge of her adoption. By reading her adoption records, she comes to know the truth about her birth and her biological mother. After a night of contemplation, she decides to seek out her birth mother. 

Revitalized by the happiness of knowing she was wanted by both her birth mother and foster mother, Barbara reconciles with Annalise. Anxiously, Gerry and her 3 grown children wait at the airport for Barbara's arrival. Finally, after 34 years, mother and daughter meet. Barbara is angry as to why Gerry gave her up if she loves her, asking if it would have made a difference if she had been born white. Gerry says she only wanted the best for Barbara, to be with people who could teach her courage, which she could not, because Gerry felt ashamed for being raped and having a black daughter, though she loved her. Gerry apologizes to Barbara and the two reconcile as mother and daughter. Later, at a family reunion, Corrine, Gerry and Annalise meet again for the first time. The film ends with a picture of the entire side of Barbara's family, her mothers, her uncles, her brothers and sisters, her children, and her nieces and nephews, and Barbara no longer feels alone.

'''Dracula's Guest''' is a [[short story]] by [[Bram Stoker]] and published in the short story collection ''[[Dracula's Guest and Other Weird Stories]]''.

== Origin ==

It is widely believed that "Dracula's Guest" is actually the deleted first chapter from the original ''[[Dracula]]'' manuscript, which the publisher felt was superfluous to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It was originally excised owing to the length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers of what is considered my husband's most remarkable work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Leslie S. Klinger]], who had access to Stoker's original ''Dracula'' manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page xii&lt;/ref&gt; while researching his 2008 book ''The New Annotated Dracula'', saw evidence of "Dracula's Guest" having been deleted from the manuscript, such as a deleted sentence of Harker commenting that his throat is "still sore from the licking of the gray wolf's file-like tongue"&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 39, note 99&lt;/ref&gt; and the first and second chapters of the finished novel being labeled in the manuscript as "ii"&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 9, note 1&lt;/ref&gt; and "iii".&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 40, note 1&lt;/ref&gt; Klinger ultimately concludes the following:

{{blockquote|And so what may we make of ["Dracula's Guest"]? Without the name "Dracula" appearing in the title and [Dracula's] message [sent to the narrator], there would be very little to connect this traveler's tale with [the novel ''Dracula'']. The style is completely different; the narrator shares few characteristics with Jonathan Harker; and the action somehow fails to connect the story set forth in [''Dracula'']. However, there are numerous references in the [''Dracula''] Manuscript to some version of the tale eventually published as "Dracula's Guest." Most likely, a different draft — one that identified the narrator as Harker — was included in ... an early version of [the ''Dracula'' manuscript]. It may be that Stoker's publisher requested that the book be shortened, or the publisher (or Stoker) may have felt that the "stylistic" aspects of the narrative were more important than its veracity. For whatever reason, the material was excised, and only later did Stoker return to the material and work it into its published form.&lt;ref&gt;Klinger, page 515, note 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Plot summary ==

"Dracula's Guest" follows an Englishman (whose name is never mentioned, but is presumed to be [[Jonathan Harker]]) on a visit to [[Munich]] before leaving for [[Transylvania]]. It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned "unholy" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.

After a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801. Inscribed on the back of the tomb "graven in great Russian letters" is: "The dead travel fast", which was an ode to the fable "[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]".

The Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a "beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as "being grasped as by the hand of a giant") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.

The Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.

Military horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is "[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]".
They also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. "See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.

When the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of "dangers from snow and wolves and night" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.

The [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] [[rock relief]] '''Fıraktın relief''' (or ''Fraktın'') is located roughly 50&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Kayseri]] in the [[Kayseri Province|province of the same name]] in southern [[Turkey]], at Fıraktın on the bank of the Enzel Dere, a tributary of the [[Zamantı River|Zamantı Irmağı]]. [[Strabo]] called the place ''Dastarkon''.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The relief is in a steep valley, between [[Mount Erciyes]] and the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]] east of [[Develi]]. The valley was historically an important route into [[Cilicia]] (and from there into [[Syria]] via the Gezbeli and Küçük Gezbeli passes). A [[Mycenaean pottery|Mycenaean vase]] was found nearby, which probably came via Cilicia.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Goetze: ''Kulturgeschichte Kleinasiens''. C. H. Beck, München 1974, S. 182. {{ISBN|9783406013515}}  [https://books.google.com/books?id=iY6SwMfNjIoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Firaktin&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Firaktin&amp;f=false bei GoogleBooks]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1939, five reliefs from Hittite times were discovered in this location, more than in any other spot in Anatolia. The other four reliefs are [[Hanyeri relief|Hanyeri]], [[İmamkullu relief|İmamkullu]] and [[Taşçı reliefs|Taşçı A and B]].&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, pp. 59–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The relief is about 1.3 m x 3.2 m and was made in the 13th century BC, in the time of the Hittite empire. It faces northwest, towards Mount Erciyes, which like all mountains was worshiped in Hittite times. The relief is in three parts.

The left section shows the [[List of Hittite kings|Hittite king]] [[Hattusili III]] (right) making an offering to the [[weather god]], pouring water from a kind of beaked flagon into a vessel on the ground. Between them there is an altar like structure, with a grooved, conical item on top, probably offering-bread. Both the god and the king wear pointed hats, which symbolised divinity. From this, it can be concluded that the image was probably made after Hattusili's death in the reign of his son and successor [[Tudhaliya IV]], since the Hittite kings were considered divine after their deaths. The weather god holds a crook in his hands. In front of each of their heads are hieroglyphic symbols, naming the depicted individuals.

[[File:Puduhepa.jpg|thumb|The Sun goddess &amp; Puduhepa]]
In the middle scene is his wife, [[Tawannanna]] [[Puduhepa]] (right), making a [[libation]] to the Sun goddess [[Hebat]]. There is an altar between these two figures as well, with a bird or a bird-shaped vessel on top of it. The depiction gets rougher on the right end; probably the work was not finished.

The third part of the relief consists of massive [[Luwian hieroglyphs]]. The continue the description of the queen which begins beside her head, "Daughter of the land of [[Kizzuwatna]], beloved by the divine."&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt;

[[File:Firaktin2Kayseri.jpg|thumb|Copy at the Kayseri Museum]]
A concrete copy of the relief can be viewed at the Kayseri Museum, as well as a plaster cast in the [[Pergamonmuseum]] in Berlin.

'''Gavari''' is a 40-day ecstatic dance drama tradition dedicated to the [[Shakti]] [[avatar]] ''Gavari'' (aka ''Gavri'' or ''Gauri''), the principal deity of [[Mewar|Mewar's]] [[Bhil people|Bhil tribe]] in [[Rajasthan]], India. The Mewari Bhils honor Gavari as the creative protective spirit animating all life; and they perform this ritual annually to invoke, experience and celebrate Her powers.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58471382|title=Culture and customs of India|last=Henderson|first=Carol|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=0313305137|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=141|oclc=58471382}}&lt;/ref&gt; This centuries-old ceremonial cycle employs austere discipline, [[Religious ecstasy|enraptured trance]], and wild theatrics to also convey ancient myths, historic events, tribal lore, and satiric political commentary. Among all the world’s folk performance traditions, it is quite unique, especially with respect to its epiphanous energy, scale, duration, ascetic rigour and inspirational messaging as well as its still mysterious [[provenance]] and genesis.

== The Gavari Season ==
[[File:Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe.jpg|Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe|right|thumb]]
Each year, ''bhopa'' [[Shamanism|shamans]] from Mewar's Bhil communities petition the Goddess to permit their villagers to perform the Gavari ritual and to accompany them for the weeks of touring. The average wait time for her consent is about 4–5 years, and once the ritual cycle begins, she must also be successfully invoked before each daily ceremony. Only when she visibly possesses one or more troupe members can the dance dramas begin and the ritual proceed.

Each of the 25-25 participating communities forms and dispatches its own Gavari company of 20-80 members. The troupes crisscross Mewar performing more than 600 day-long village ceremonies in all. In total, Gavari troupes in total can play to over a quarter of a million people annually.

In the final days, each troupe returns to its home village for a last performance and closing ceremonies. The cycle ends with an immersion rite to return the Goddess’s fertility to their waters and all night raucous celebrations.

A Gavari troupe repertoire may include 10-15 classic traditional tales and new ones are still evolving, but the overarching themes are the sacredness of the natural world, radical human equality, and the feminine nature of the divine.  These values are reflected in traditional Bhil society where the environment is revered, hierarchy is abhorred, and women enjoy greater rights and status than in communities outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Aparna|date=2008-06-01|title=The status of women among the scheduled tribes in India|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535707001254|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|series=Behavioral Dimensions of the Firm Special Issue|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1202–1217|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2006.12.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/tribes/bhiltribe.html|title=Bhil tribal communities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.indianmirror.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gavari’s many mythic dramas, two of the most popular and often repeated are ''Badalya Hindawa'' (The Banyan Swing) and ''Bhilurana'' (King of the Bhils).

''Badalya Hindawa'' recounts how the Goddess re-greened the Earth after a life-erasing flood and fiercely defends it thereafter from greed, stupidity and harm. The playlet features a powerful guru who loses his disciples beneath a sacred [[banyan]] tree and demands that the local king destroy it as an illicit source of power. The unnerved king complies and has the tree cut down. The Goddess and her [[devi]] sisters are outraged at this desecration and slip into his court disguised as acrobatic dancers to exact revenge. They lure the king close with their artistry, reveal their true nature, indict him for cowardice and sacrilege, and mortally terminate his reign.

[[File:Gavari_Bhilurana_scene_showing_Queen_Victoria_leading_Brit_invasion.jpg|alt=Bhilurana scene of British invaders|right|thumb|''Bhilurana: on left the British invaders, on right Bhils preparing to resist. The green parasol marks the Empress of India, Queen Victoria; the red Goddess Kali, the Bhils’ secret power source.'']]  ''Bhilurana'' is the tale of a composite leader representing five centuries of Bhil resistance to intrusions of all kinds. The play compresses and conflates the armed might of Turkic, Mughal and British invaders and depicts Goddess-inspired Bhil warriors finally driving them all away with daring ambushes, sabotage and shrewd [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]].

Both plays end with celebration, salutations to the Goddess, and clear warnings to interlopers to never violate Nature or their sovereignty again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gavari - Mewar’s electrifying tribal dance-drama: An Illustrated Introduction|last=Agneya|first=Harish|publisher=Tuneer Films|year=2014|isbn=978-9352123292|location=India|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari drama emphasis inspired [[improvisation]] over rehearsal and memorisation. The beginnings and ends of Gavari dramas are known, but how things transpire in between is highly mutable. There are no scripts and many players are illiterate farmers and labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bhils|title=Bhils - Dictionary definition of Bhils {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plays can continue for hours, contain long soliloquies and dialogues, and are only performed by a particular troupe once on four or five years. This intuitive improvisational approach fosters great creative diversity and different villages may present the same stories in many very different ways.  Players strive to perform in a receptive trance known as ''[[Bhava samadhi|bhava]]'', which resembles the fluid creative state that musicians and athletes call "flow" or "[[Flow (psychology)|the zone]]".

=== Characters ===

[[File:Gavari Budia player invoking the role's tutelary spirit.jpg|Budia player|right|thumb]]Depending on the day and the plays selected a single Gavari troupe can present dozens of different characters - goddess avatars, gods, demons, historical figures, sacred animals, corrupt officials, etc. The only constant roles, which exist outside the dramas, are the '''Budia''' figure, his twin '''Rai''' devi consorts and '''Kutkadia''', the  [[master of ceremonies]].

Women are not allowed to tour as actors with the troupe due to the 4-5 day [[Menstrual taboo|menstrual isolation]] Bhil women observe each month. Consequently, all female characters are portrayed by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Budia embodies a powerful fusion of Shaivite and demonic energies and is a vital protective Gavari figure. He is distinguished by his dramatic horse hair-fringed mask, sacred staff and twin Rai consorts. In each day’s Gavari ceremony the Budia character has three main duties: circling the arena during opening invocations in the opposite direction as the dancers to seal in and protect the energy field they are generating; patrolling the arena perimeter during dance drama sequences to prevent audience members from entering the players' area or shaman circle unless they are clearly entranced; and periodically holding court at the arena’s edge with his Rai escorts to accept offerings on behalf of the troupe and confer blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gallery/the-many-faces-of-budia/|title=The Many Faces of Budia – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Gavari village has its own iconic Budia mask, which is treated as a sacred object and often handed down for generations.

== History ==

=== Bhils ===

{{Main|Bhil people}}
One of India’s oldest and largest tribes, the [[Bhil people]] have primarily lived in the belt extending across contemporary [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]] for at least 4,000 years.  About 10 million Bhils live in India today, but only the ±7% who reside in [[Mewar]] participate in the Gavari tradition.

=== Origin ===
There are many speculative theories about Gavari's genesis, but its true age and origin are unknown.

According to one hypothesis, it may have begun in rural Mewar at the end of the 16th century, when Mewaris largely regained control of their lands and lives from the Mughals in [[Battle of Haldighati#Aftermath|1579]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/469652456|title=Medieval India : from Sultanat to the Mughals|last=...|first=Chandra, Satish, 1922-|date=2005|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=|isbn=8124110662|edition=Revised|location=New Delhi|pages=121–122|oclc=469652456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/airavat/mughal-mewarconflict|title=mughal-mewarconflict - airavat|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rajput court gratefully awarded their mountain-dwelling Bhil brethren both unprecedented recognition and vast tracts of fertile agricultural land. The latter boon gradually drew most Bhils out of their forest encampments and began their transition to village agriculture. The 16th century hypothesis thus holds that this settling down of a semi-nomadic people created a nostalgia for their more adventurous heritage. Others assert that Gavari began in the 3rd or 4th century in Gujarat,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and still others that it as old as Bhil culture itself and dates back four millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Rajasthan_State_Gazetteer_History_and_cu.html?id=ngZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Rajasthan State Gazetteer: History and culture|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=Directorate, District Gazetteers, Government of Rajasthan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=199, 205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50712988|title=Fairs and festivals of Indian tribes|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Discovery Pub.

==Religious and shamanic aspects==
=== Invocations ===
[[File:Gavari ritual invocation gear.jpg|right|thumb|Ritual implements for invocation rites]]
Gavari troupes perform two  distinct invocation rituals.  The first is used to ask the Goddess to permit a village to perform the Gavari cycle. This invocation is held in every Mewari Bhil community on or shortly before the full moon in the Hindu month of ''[[Shravana]]'', which usually falls in August as the monsoon planting season ends.

The second is to confirm Her presence and participation at the start of each day's performance. Both invocations require [[Incense in India|incense]], flowers. [[chant]]ing, [[Madal|''madal'' drum]] and ''thali'' cymbal music, a [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[trishula]], and the kindling of a ''[[dhuni]] fire''.

Initial sanction invocations are usually held in a darkened sanctuary attended by a small group of ''bhopa'' shamans, village elders and veteran Gavari players. Other villagers gather outside to await Her decision which is delivered by a possessed trembling ''bhopa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=phRzAGYR9swC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=bhils+trance+invocatons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lfm8IUce62&amp;sig=GflvrHHPlRD5qRsjax96avnf7HY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMgMLayq7VAhUmR48KHWbKDuQQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=bhils%20trance%20invocatons&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Sociology of Religion: Sociology of religions in India|last=Nayar|first=V.

Typical reasons for refusal include discord in the village, shrine disrepair, a poor monsoon, a crop blight, etc., which must be dealt with satisfactorily before petitioning Her again.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gavari-introduction/|title=Gavari Introduction – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily confirmation invocations are performed around an altar in the centre of the Gavari arena where shamans, musicians and senior players gather in a tight circle. The rest of the players and occasionally villagers dance counterclockwise around this core to create a welcoming energy field. A guardian  Budia figure circles the dancers in the opposite direction to seal in their energy and protect it from misuse. The Goddess spirit's arrival and presence is signaled by one or more ''bhopas'' falling into trembling [[Bhava samadhi|''bhava'' trance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://udaipurtimes.com/gavri-the-opera-of-mewar/|title=‘Gavri’ the Opera of Mewar|date=2010-09-28|work=UdaipurTimes.com|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other requisite ritual instruments used after Her manifestation include peacock feather [[sceptre]]s to dramatize and distribute possession's quivering energetic power, and heavy ''saankal'' chains with which trance-elated participants often beat their backs.

===Possession and Trance===
Successful invocations have several visible effects. First they connect the village shaman(s) to the Goddess spirit so they can audibly articuiate Her concerns, requests and will.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hqwYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT77&amp;lpg=PT77&amp;dq=bhils+trance+invocatons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVyok1tXBk&amp;sig=Pv_mXXmCO_9yS2FyLPXdy1HBJyw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMgMLayq7VAhUmR48KHWbKDuQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhils%20trance%20invocations&amp;f=false|title=Disappearing Peoples?: Indigenous Groups and Ethnic Minorities in South and Central Asia|last=Brower|first=Barbara|last2=Johnston|first2=Barbara Rose|date=2016-09-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315430393|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they infuse the Gavari players with creative inspiration to ably enact their roles. Finally, they can overwhelm some villagers with a sense of wonder, grace and bliss. Entranced villagers may be welcomed into the shaman circle or approached for healings and blessings by other members of the crowd. Those possessed often later report feelings of great exhilaration and selfless unity with all surrounding life. Such experiences reinforce Bhils' belief in Gavari's power, their own inalienable equality, and the sacredness of the natural world.

== Social and Cultural Significance ==

[[File:Gavari_comedic_playlet_satirizing_urban_traders.jpg|alt=Greedy urban traders|right|thumb|Satiric skit mocking fat traders who come to fleece the villagers]]
In Gavari, the beauty and power of the natural world are the ultimate expression of divinity. Wilful or heedless damage to its diversity, health or future is thus regarded as not only short-sighted and suicidal, but also criminal and blasphemous.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gavari.info|title=Mewar Gavari – Mewar's ecstatic tribal folk opera|website=gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such views are the seed [[Seven generation sustainability]] among many indigenous tribes and their current widespread battles to safeguard water resources, endangered ecosystems and [[biocultural diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/news/2014/11/11-indigenous-resistance-movements-you-need-to-know|title=11 Indigenous resistance movements you need to know {{!}} rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/environment/year-of-clout-10-stories-of-indigenous-environmental-influence-in-2015/|title=Year of Clout: 10 Stories of Indigenous Environmental Influence in 2015 - Indian Country Media Network|website=indiancountrymedianetwork.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari is righteously egalitarian and disrespectful of unjust authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58471382|title=Culture and customs of India|last=E.|first=Henderson, Carol|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=0313305137|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=156|oclc=58471382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its dramas vividly depict and celebrate the dispatching of powerful officials, gurus and merchants either by the mocking scorn of villagers or the sword of the Goddess in a protective maternal rage. No authority figure is spared and some playlets happily lampoon kings,  Hindu gods like [[Krishna]], and even charlatan ''Bhopa'' shamans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandalia|first=Hemendra S I N G H|title=Tribal Dance-drama Gavari : Theatre of Subversion and Popular Faith|url=https://www.academia.edu/31877270/Tribal_Dance-drama_Gavari_Theatre_of_Subversion_and_Popular_Faith|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The healthy skepticism such skits reflected and encouraged in [[Rajsamand district|rural Mewar]], along with other similar art forms/practices in the subcontinent helped birth India's [[Right to Information Act, 2005|2005 Right to Information Act]], which has been journalistically hailed as "the most significant change to Indian democracy since Independence" &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140313/jsp/opinion/story_18068459.jsp|title=The invisible history of people's movements|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari's itinerant format continues to closely network and promote solidarity among Mewar's scattered rural villages as well as their constituent castes and religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49276478|title=South Asian folklore : an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|others=Claus, Peter J., Diamond, Sarah, 1966-, Mills, Margaret Ann.|year=|isbn=0415939194|location=New York|pages=239|oclc=49276478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rich mythic and historical repertoire also helps keep tribal youth aware of their heritage.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Gavari’s comedic skits on farm finance, greedy middlemen and corrupt merchants offer villagers wry lessons in real world commerce and economic self-defense, especially with regard to crop brokers, [[moneylender]]s, [[Usury|credit scams]], and urban conceptions of wealth.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Gavari tightens inter-community bonds with its month of itinerant village visitations and solidifies Bhils’ sense of responsibility for a world far beyond their neighboring fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although only Bhils play roles in the ceremony, Gavari performances also internally solidify communities by involving all castes, communities and age groups in the preparations and audience delight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/keeping-history-alive-dramatically/article2273799.ece|title=Keeping history alive dramatically|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gavari tradition at home has fallen on hard times&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rajasthan's government schools now forbid Bhil students to be [[truancy|truant]] to accompany their village Gavari troupes on their month-long pilgrimages. This alone is potentially lethal since Gavari has no scripts or schools and the only way to learn its ceremonies, arts and stories is as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] participant. 
Add to this the accelerating exodus of working age youth to metro centers in search of employment and the average size and number of rural Gavari troupes continues decline.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/609982250|title=Tribal culture, continuity, and change : a study of Bhils in Rajasthan|last=1973-|first=Majhi, Anita Srivastava,|date=2010|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=|isbn=8183242987|location=New Delhi|pages=150|oclc=609982250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also positives. Local Bhil organizations are also becoming more active in promoting Gavari and its core values.

[[File:Artemis found in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The Greek goddess [[Artemis]]; color reconstruction of a first century AD statue found in [[Pompeii]], an imitation of Greek statues of the sixth century BC. Reconstructed using analysis of trace pigments.]]
The exhibition is based on the result of research on ancient polychromy, conducted especially by the Classical archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] since the early 1980s, based on earlier works by Volkmar von Graeve. Working together with Raimund Wünsche, the director of the [[Glyptothek]] at [[Munich]], Brinkmann developed the concept for the exhibition, culminating in the original Munich show in 2003. It displayed copies of ancient sculpture in their reconstructed painted appearance that had been produced during his studies, as well as new reconstructions created especially for the exhibition, in conjunction with the originals or comparable ancient sculptures. Soon, it began to travel to other cities in [[Germany]] and beyond.

Since 2007, the exhibition and underlying research receive support from [[:de:Stiftung Archäologie|a foundation]] created by the government of [[Bavaria]], as well as private donations. After the original German catalogue produced for the 2003 Munich exhibition, new editions were issued for later showings, most recently for the 2010 one in Berlin. An English catalogue was published for the 2008 showing in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]] at [[Harvard University]]. In 2007  the Colored Gods formed part of the exhibition ''Color of Life – Polychromy in Sculpture from Antiquity to the Present'' at the [[Getty Villa]] in [[Los Angeles]], with contributions in the respective catalogue.

==Buddhist art==

'''Buddhist art''' originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the centuries following the life of the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world. Buddhist art traveled with believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century CE due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside     [[Hinduism]].

A common visual device in Buddhist art is the [[mandala]]. From a viewer's perspective, it represents schematically the ideal universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blume|first1=Nancy|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://asiasociety.org/exploring-mandala|website=Asia Society|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Cristian|title=Mandala|url=https://www.ancient.eu/mandala/|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of aspirants and adepts, a spiritual teaching tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction. Its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] saw the mandala as ''"a representation of the center of the unconscious self,"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm Carl Jung and the Mandala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024061549/http://www.netreach.net/~nhojem/jung.htm |date=October 24, 2009 }} Retrieved January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and believed his paintings of mandalas enabled him to identify emotional disorders and work towards wholeness in personality.&lt;ref&gt;See C G Jung: ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp.186–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutanese art==
{{Main article|Bhutanese art}}
[[File:Bhutanese thanka of Mt. Meru and the Buddhist Universe.jpg|thumb|upright|Bhutanese [[thanka]] of [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mt. Meru]] and the Buddhist Universe, 19th century, [[Trongsa|Trongsa Dzong]], [[Trongsa|Trongsa, Bhutan]]]]

'''Bhutanese art''' is similar to the [[art of Tibet]]. Both are based upon [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], with its pantheon of divine beings.

The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are [[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]]. The former is a branch of the [[Kagyu|Kagyu School]] and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 [[Je Khenpo]] (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma order is known for images of [[Padmasambhava]], who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially [[Pema Lingpa]], to find. The [[Terton|treasure finders]] ([[Terton|''tertön'']]) are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art.

Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.

Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name ''Kham-so'' (made in [[Kham]]) even though they are made in Bhutan, because the technique of making them was originally imported from the eastern province of [[Tibet]] called Kham. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings.

The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive “spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom’ is defined as the art of ''Zorig Chosum'', which means the “thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan”; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in [[Thimphu]] is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the ‘[[Folk Heritage Museum]]’ in Thimphu. There is also a ‘Voluntary Artists Studio’ in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:&lt;ref name="Brown, p. 104"&gt;Brown, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arts&gt;{{cite web|title= Bhutan:Arts &amp; Crafts|url=http://www.tourism.gov.bt/about-bhutan/arts-crafts|accessdate=June 7, 2010|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan:Government of Bhutan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodian art==
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|thumb|right|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]] ([[Angkor]])]]
{{Main article|Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian art|Khmer sculpture}}
'''Cambodian art''' and the culture of [[Cambodia]] has had a rich and varied history dating back many centuries and has been heavily influenced by [[India]]. In turn, Cambodia greatly influenced [[Thailand]], Laos and vice versa. Throughout Cambodia's long history, a major source of inspiration was from religion. Throughout nearly two millennium, a Cambodians developed a unique [[Khmer people|Khmer]] belief from the syncreticism of indigenous [[animistic]] beliefs and the Indian religions of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Indian culture and civilization, including its language and arts reached mainland Southeast Asia around the 1st century CE. It is generally believed that seafaring merchants brought Indian customs and culture to ports along the gulf of Thailand and the Pacific while trading with China. The first state to benefit from this was [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]. At various times, Cambodia culture also absorbed elements from [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Laos|Lao]], and [[Thailand|Thai]] cultures.

===Visual arts of Cambodia===
[[File:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|thumb|left|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Cambodia|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE]]

The history of [[Visual arts of Cambodia]] stretches back centuries to ancient crafts; Khmer art reached its peak during the [[Angkor]] period. Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include textiles, non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Pottery|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

'''Khmer sculpture''' refers to the stone sculpture of the [[Khmer Empire]], which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in [[Angkor]], which served as the seat of the empire.

By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.
[[File:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9971.jpg|thumb|Relief from Angkor]]

The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. And they are always represented with great iconographic precision, clearly indicating that learned priests supervised the execution of the works. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the [[aristocracy]] through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.

The sculptures are admirable images of a gods, royal and imposing presences, though not without feminine sensuality, makes us think of important persons at the courts, persons of considerable power. The artists who sculpted the stones doubtless satisfied the primary objectives and requisites demanded by the persons who commissioned them. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeed in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.

==Chinese art==
{{Main article|Chinese art|Chinese painting|Chinese ceramics|Chinese jade|Chinese calligraphy}}
'''Chinese art''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) has varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology. Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s. Chinese art is art, whether modern or ancient, that originated in or is practiced in China or by Chinese artists or performers.

In the [[Song Dynasty]], poetry was marked by a lyric poetry known as [[Ci (poetry)|Ci]] (詞) which expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. Also in the Song dynasty, paintings of more subtle expression of landscapes appeared, with blurred outlines and mountain contours which conveyed distance through an impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. It was during this period that in painting, emphasis was placed on spiritual rather than emotional elements, as in the previous period. [[Kunqu]], the oldest extant form of Chinese opera developed during the Song Dynasty in [[Kunshan]], near present-day Shanghai. In the [[Yuan dynasty]], painting by the Chinese painter [[Zhao Mengfu]] (趙孟頫) greatly influenced later Chinese landscape painting, and the Yuan dynasty opera became a variant of Chinese opera which continues today as [[Cantonese opera]].

{{Main article|Indian art|Indian painting|Rangoli}}
'''Indian art''' can be classified into specific periods, each reflecting certain religious, political and cultural developments. The earliest examples are the [[petroglyph]]s such as those found in [[Bhimbetka]], some of them dating to before 5500&amp;nbsp;BC. The production of such works continued for several millenniums. 

The art of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] followed. Later examples include the carved [[column|pillars]] of [[Ellora]], Maharashtra [[States and territories of India|state]]. Other examples are the [[fresco]]es of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Ellora Caves]].

The contributions of the [[Mughal Empire]] to Indian art include [[Mughal painting]], a style of miniature painting heavily influenced by [[Persian miniature|Persian miniatures]], and [[Mughal architecture]]. 

During the [[British Raj]], [[modern Indian painting]] evolved as a result of combining traditional Indian and European styles. [[Raja Ravi Varma]] was a pioneer of this period. The [[Bengal School of Art|Bengal school of Art]] developed during this period, led by [[Abanindranath Tagore|Abanidranath Tagore]], [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]] and [[Nandalal Bose]].

One of the most popular art forms in [[India]] is called [[Rangoli]]. It is a form of [[sandpainting]] decoration that uses finely ground white powder and colours, and is used commonly outside homes in India.

The visual arts (sculpture, painting and architecture) are tightly interrelated with the non-visual arts. According to [[Kapila Vatsyayan]], "Classical Indian architecture, sculpture, painting, literature (kaavya), music and dancing evolved their own rules conditioned by their respective media, but they shared with one another not only the underlying spiritual beliefs of the Indian religio-philosophic mind, but also the procedures by which the relationships of the symbol and the spiritual states were worked out in detail."

Insight into the unique qualities of Indian art is best achieved through an understanding of the philosophical thought, the broad cultural history, social, religious and political background of the artworks.

Specific periods: 	

*[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] of the ancient period (3500 [[BCE]] – present)
 	
*Islamic ascendancy (712–1757 [[Common Era|CE]])

*The colonial period (1757–1947)

*Modern and Postmodern art in India 

*Independence and the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] period (Post-1947)

==Indonesian art==

'''Indonesian art''' and culture has been shaped by long [[interaction]] between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. [[Indonesia]] is central along ancient [[Trade route|trading routes]] between the Far East and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of [[eastern religions|religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and Islam, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia is not generally known for paintings, aside from the intricate and expressive [[Bali]]nese paintings, which often express natural scenes and themes from the traditional dances.

[[File:Kenyah mural painting.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] mural painting in Long Nawang, [[East Kalimantan]].]]
Other exceptions include indigenous [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] paint designs based on, as commonly found among [[Austronesian]] cultures, endemic natural motifs such as ferns, trees, dogs, hornbills and human figures. These are still to be found decorating the walls of Kenyah Dayak [[longhouse]]s in [[East Kalimantan]]'s Apo Kayan region.

Indonesia has a long-he [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s, but the art-form particularly flourished from the 8th century to the 10th century, both as stand-alone works of art, and also incorporated into temples.

[[File:Borobudur Relief Panel I.b119, 0972.jpg|right|thumb|Relief sculpture from [[Borobudur]] temple, c. 760–830&amp;nbsp;AD]]
Most notable are the hundreds of meters of relief sculpture at the temple of [[Borobudur]] in central [[Java]]. Approximately two miles of exquisite relief sculpture tell the story of the life of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and illustrate his teachings. The temple was originally home to 504 statues of the seated Buddha. This site, as with others in central Java, show a clear Indian influence.

Calligraphy, mostly based on the [[Qur'an]], is often used as decoration as Islam forbids naturalistic depictions. Some foreign painters have also settled in [[Indonesia]]. Modern Indonesian painters use a wide variety of styles and themes.

===Balinese art===
{{Main article|Balinese art}}
[[File:Kerta Gosa, Ramayana Scene, Bali 1543.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Balinese painting of [[Ramayana]] scene from Kerta Gosha, depicting Rama versus Dasamukha (Ravana).]]
'''Balinese art''' is art of [[Hindu]]-[[Java]]nese origin that grew from the work of artisans of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Kingdom]], with their expansion to [[Bali]] in the late 13th century. From the 16th until the 20th centuries, the village of Kamasan, Klungkung (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the 20th century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art. Ubud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silversmiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes Balinese art as, "... a highly developed, although informal Baroque folk art that combines the peasant liveliness with the refinement of classicism of Hinduistic Java, but free of the conservative prejudice and with a new vitality fired by the exuberance of the demonic spirit of the tropical primitive". Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''&lt;ref name="Eiseman"&gt;

In the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.

This groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in the mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.&lt;ref name="Geertz-Images_of_Power"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;

More importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art.

==Japanese art==

'''Japanese art''' and architecture is works of art produced in Japan from the beginnings of human habitation there, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present. Japanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture in wood and bronze, ink painting on silk and paper, and a myriad of other types of works of art; from ancient times until the contemporary 21st century.

The art form rose to great popularity in the metropolitan culture of [[Edo]] (Tokyo) during the second half of the 17th century, originating with the single-color works of [[Hishikawa Moronobu]] in the 1670s. At first, only [[India ink]] was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century [[Suzuki Harunobu]] developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce ''[[nishiki-e]].''
[[File:Hiroshige Snow falling on a town.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroshige]], ''Snow falling on a town'', c. 1833, [[ukiyo-e]] print]]
{{nihongo|'''Japanese painting'''|絵画|Kaiga}} is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. As with the history of Japanese arts in general, the history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas.

The origins of painting in Japan date well back into [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan's prehistoric period]]. Simple stick figures and geometric designs can be found on [[Jōmon period]] pottery and [[Yayoi period]] (300&amp;nbsp;BC – 300&amp;nbsp;AD) ''[[dōtaku]]'' bronze bells. [[Mural]] paintings with both geometric and figurative designs have been found in numerous [[tumulus]] from the [[Kofun period]] (300–700&amp;nbsp;AD).

Ancient '''Japanese sculpture''' was mostly derived from the [[idol worship]] in [[Buddhism]] or animistic rites of [[Shinto]] deity. In particular, sculpture among all the arts came to be most firmly centered around Buddhism. Materials traditionally used were metal—especially [[bronze]]—and, more commonly, wood, often [[lacquer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]], or brightly painted. By the end of the [[Tokugawa period]], such traditional sculpture – except for miniaturized works – had largely disappeared because of the loss of patronage by Buddhist temples and the nobility.

''[[Ukiyo]]'', meaning "floating world", refers to the impetuous young culture that bloomed in the urban centers of [[Edo]] (modern-day Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] that were a world unto themselves. It is an ironic allusion to the [[homophone]] term "Sorrowful World" (憂き世), the earthly plane of death and rebirth from which Buddhists sought release.

==Korean art==
[[File:Geumgangjeondo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeong Seon]], ''General View of Mt. Geumgang'' (금강전도, 金剛全圖), Korea, c.1734]]

{{Main article|Korean art|Korean painting|Korean calligraphy}}
'''Korean art''' is noted for its traditions in pottery, music, calligraphy, painting, sculpture, and other genres, often marked by the use of bold color, natural forms, precise shape and scale, and surface decoration.

While there are clear and distinguishing differences between three independent cultures, there are significant and historical similarities and interactions between the arts of [[Korea]], China and Japan.

The study and appreciation of [[Korean art]] is still at a formative stage in the West. Because of [[Korea]]’s position between China and Japan, Korea was seen as a mere conduit of Chinese culture to Japan. However, recent scholars have begun to acknowledge Korea’s own unique art, culture and important role in not only transmitting Chinese culture but assimilating it and creating a unique culture of its own. ''An art given birth to and developed by a nation is its own art.''

Generally, the history of '''Korean painting''' is dated to approximately 108 C.E., when it first appears as an independent form. Between that time and the paintings and frescoes that appear on the [[Goryeo]] dynasty tombs, there has been little research. Suffice to say that til the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty the primary influence was Chinese painting though done with Korean landscapes, facial features, Buddhist topics, and an emphasis on celestial observation in keeping with the rapid development of Korean astronomy.

Throughout the history of Korean painting, there has been a constant separation of monochromatic works of black brushwork on very often mulberry paper or silk; and the colourful folk art or ''min-hwa'', ritual arts, tomb paintings, and festival arts which had extensive use of colour.

This distinction was often class-based: scholars, particularly in [[Confucian art]] felt that one could see colour in monochromatic paintings within the gradations and felt that the actual use of colour coarsened the paintings, and restricted the imagination. Korean folk art, and painting of architectural frames was seen as brightening certain outside wood frames, and again within the tradition of Chinese architecture, and the early Buddhist influences of profuse rich thalo and primary colours inspired by [[Indian art|Art of India]].

'''Contemporary art in Korea:''' The first example of [[Western-style oil painting]] in Korean art was in the self-portraits of Korean artist [[Go Hui-dong|Ko Hu i-dong]] (1886-1965). Only three of these works still remain today. these self-portraits impart an understanding of medium that extends well beyond the affirmation of stylistic and cultural difference. by the early twentieth century, the decision to paint using oil and canvas in Korea had two different interpretations. One being a sense of enlightenment due to western ideas and art styles. This enlightenment derived from an intellectual movement of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Ko had been painting with this method during a period of Japans' annexation of Korea. During this time many claimed his art could have been political, however, he himself stated he was an artist and not a politician. Ko stated "While I was in Tokyo, a very curious thing happened. At that time there were fewer than one hundred Korean students in Tokyo. All of us were drinking the new air and embarking on new studies, but there were some who mocked my choice to study art. A close friend said that it was not right for me to study painting in such a time as this."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kee|first=Joan|date=April 2013|title=Contemporary Art in Early Colonial Korea: The Self Portraits of Ko Hui-dong|url=|journal=Art History|volume=36|pages=392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Korean pottery''' was recognized as early as 6000 BCE. This pottery was also referred to as comb-patterned pottery due to the decorative lines carved onto the outside. early Korean societies were mainly dependent on fishing. So, they used the pottery to store fish and other things collected from the ocean such as shellfish. Pottery had two main regional distinctions. Those from the East coast tends to have a flat base, whereas pottery on the South coast had a round base. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Early Korean History|url=|journal=Early Korean history|volume=|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laotian art==
{{Main article|Lao art}}
[[File:Lan Xang - Seated Buddha - bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lan Xang]] bronze Buddha, 17th century [[Laos]]]]
[[File:Stone carving in Kathmandu.jpg|thumb|Stone carvings, called Chaityas, seen even in street corners and courtyards of [[Kathmandu]]|298x298px]]
'''Laotian art''' includes [[Lao ceramics|ceramics]], [[Lao Buddhist sculpture]], and [[Lao music]].

Lao Buddhist sculptures were created in a large variety of material including gold, silver and most often [[bronze]]. Brick-and-mortar also was a medium used for colossal images, a famous of these is the image of ''Phya Vat'' (16th century) in [[Vientiane]], although a renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha. Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha. The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late 18th century. Today it serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early 19th century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many beautiful Lao Buddhist sculptures are carved right into the [[Pak Ou caves]]. Near ''Pak Ou'' (mouth of the Ou river) the ''Tham Ting'' (lower cave) and the ''Tham Theung'' (upper cave) are near [[Luang Prabang]], Laos. They are a magnificent group of caves that are only accessible by boat, about two hours upstream from the center of [[Luang Prabang]], and have recently become more well known and frequented by tourists.The caves are noted for their impressive [[Buddhist]] and [[Laotian art|Lao]] style sculptures carved into the cave walls, and hundreds of discarded [[Buddhist]] figures laid out over the floors and wall shelves. They were put there as their owners did not wish to destroy them, so a difficult journey is made to the caves to place their unwanted statue there.

==Nepalese art==
{{see also|Culture of Kathmandu|Culture of Nepal}}
The ancient and refined traditional '''culture of [[Kathmandu]]''', for that matter in the whole of '''[[Nepal]],''' is an uninterrupted and exceptional meeting of the [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] ethos practiced by its highly religious people. It has also embraced in its fold the cultural diversity provided by the other religions such as [[Jainism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].

==Thai art==
{{Main article|Thai art}}
[[File:Suphannahongsa bow.jpg|thumb|left|The bow of [[Royal Barge Procession|Royal Barge]] Suphannahong of Thailand. |222px]]
'''Thai art''' and [[Thai art|visual art]] was traditionally and primarily [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] and Royal Art. Sculpture was almost exclusively of [[Buddha image]]s, while painting was confined to [[illustration]] of books and decoration of buildings, primarily [[palace]]s and temples. Thai [[Buddha image]]s from different periods have a number of distinctive styles. Contemporary Thai art often combines traditional Thai elements with [[modern art|modern]] techniques.

Traditional Thai paintings showed subjects in two [[dimension]]s without [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. The size of each element in the picture reflected its degree of importance. The primary technique of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] is that of apportioning areas: the main elements are isolated from each other by space transformers. This eliminated the intermediate ground, which would otherwise imply perspective. Perspective was introduced only as a result of Western influence in the mid-19th century.

The most frequent narrative subjects for paintings were or are: the [[Jataka]] stories, episodes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the Buddhist [[heaven]]s and [[hell]]s, and scenes of daily life.

The Sukhothai period began in the 14th century in the [[Sukhothai kingdom]]. Buddha images of the Sukhothai period are elegant, with sinuous bodies and slender, oval faces. This style emphasized the spiritual aspect of the Buddha, by omitting many small [[anatomy|anatomical]] details. The effect was enhanced by the common practice of [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] images in metal rather than [[Wikt:carving|carving]] them. This period saw the introduction of the "walking Buddha" pose.

Sukhothai artists tried to follow the canonical defining marks of a Buddha, as they are set out in ancient [[Pāli|Pali]] texts:
*[[Human skin|Skin]] so smooth that dust cannot stick to it; 
*[[human leg|Leg]]s like a deer;
*[[Thigh]]s like a [[banyan tree]];
*[[Shoulder]]s as massive as an elephant's head;
*Arms round like an elephant's trunk, and long enough to touch the knees;
*Hands like lotuses about to bloom;
*[[Fingertip]]s turned back like petals;
*[[human head|head]] like an egg;
*Hair like scorpion stingers;
*[[Chin]] like a mango stone;
*[[Human nose|Nose]] like a parrot's beak;
*[[Earlobe]]s lengthened by the earrings of royalty;
*[[Eyelash]]es like a cow's;
*[[Eyebrow]]s like drawn bows.

Sukhothai also produced a large quantity of [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[ceramic]]s in the [[Sawankhalok]] style, which were traded throughout south-east Asia.

==Tibetan art==
[[File:Amazing sand mandala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Sand mandala]] displaying its materials]]
{{Main article|Tibetan art|Sand mandala}}

'''Tibetan art''' refers to the art of [[Tibet]] and other present and former [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] kingdoms ([[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], Nepal, and [[Sikkim]]). Tibetan art is first and foremost a form of [[sacred art]], reflecting the over-riding influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on these cultures. The Sand Mandala ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]: ''kilkhor'') is a [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] tradition which symbolises the transitory nature of things. As part of [[Buddhist]] canon, all things material are seen as transitory. A sand [[mandala]] is an example of this, being that once it has been built and its accompanying ceremonies and viewing are finished, it is systematically [[Art destruction|destroyed]].

As [[Mahayana Buddhism]] emerged as a separate school in the 4th century BC it emphasized the role of [[bodhisattva]]s, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to [[Nirvana]] in order to assist others. From an early time various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the [[Vajrayana]] (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity [[Chenrezig]] (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a [[Yidam]], or 'meditation Buddha' for Vajrayana practice.

Tibetan Buddhism contains [[Tantric Buddhism]], also known as [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism for its common symbolism of the ''vajra'', the diamond thunderbolt (known in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] as the [[dorje]]). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations/imaginations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities ([[yidam]]s) to [[mandala]]s and all kinds of ritual implements.
[[File:Mantras caved into rock in Tibet.jpg|thumb|In [[Tibet]], many [[Buddhist]]s carve mantras into rocks as a form of devotion.]]
A visual aspect of Tantric Buddhism is the common representation of [[wrathful deities]], often depicted with angry faces, circles of flame, or with the skulls of the dead. These images represent the ''Protectors'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]. [[dharmapala]]) and their fearsome bearing belies their true compassionate nature. Actually, their wrath represents their dedication to the protection of the [[dharma]] teaching as well as to the protection of the specific tantric practices to prevent corruption or disruption of the practice. They are most importantly used as wrathful psychological aspects that can be used to conquer the negative attitudes of the practitioner.

Historians note that [[Chinese painting]] had a profound influence on Tibetan painting in general. Starting from the 14th and 15th century, Tibetan painting had incorporated many elements from the Chinese, and during the 18th century, Chinese painting had a deep and far-stretched impact on Tibetan visual art.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the Qing Dynasty, "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

==Vietnamese art==
[[File:Ngoc Lu bronze drum surface.gif|thumb|upright|Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface, 2nd to 3rd century BCE]]

{{Main article|Vietnamese art}}
'''Vietnamese art''' is from one of the oldest of such cultures in the Southeast Asia region. A rich artistic heritage that dates to prehistoric times and includes: silk painting, sculpture, pottery, ceramics, woodblock prints, architecture, music, dance and theatre.
[[File:To Ngoc Van thieu nu ben hoa hue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tô Ngọc Vân, ''Thiếu nữ bên hoa huệ (Young Woman with Lily)'', 1943, oil]]
[[Vietnamese art|Traditional Vietnamese art]] is art practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists, from ancient times (including the elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums]]) to post-[[History of Vietnam|Chinese domination]] art which was strongly influenced by [[Buddhist art|Chinese Buddhist art]], among other philosophies such as [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The art of [[Champa]] and [[French art]] also played a smaller role later on.



The Chinese influence on Vietnamese art extends into [[Vietnamese ceramics|Vietnamese pottery and ceramics]], calligraphy, and traditional architecture. Currently, Vietnamese lacquer paintings have proven to be quite popular.

The [[Nguyễn dynasty]], the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam (c. 1802–1945), saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.

Despite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyễn dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyễn dynasty.

Beginning in the 19th century, [[modern art]] and French artistic influences spread into Vietnam. In the early 20th century, the École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (Indochina College of Arts) was founded to teach European methods and exercised influence mostly in the larger cities, such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx Art History – A Brief History Of Vietnam Fine Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304044904/http://vietnamartist.com/ArtHistory/Arthistory5.aspx |date=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel restrictions imposed on the Vietnamese during France's 80-year rule of Vietnam and the long period of war for national independence meant that very few Vietnamese artists were able to train or work outside of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="vcw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ngoc|first=Huu|year=2000|title=Modern Painting: Tracing the Roots|journal=Vietnam Cultural Window|publisher=Thế Giới Publishers|volume=29|url=http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|accessdate=April 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306013739/http://www.thegioipublishers.com.vn/en/magazines/detail.php?cat=1&amp;idmagazines=267|archivedate=March 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}} [http://www.particulargallery.com/Articles/Articles5.aspx Full text available here]&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt; Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.&lt;ref name="vcw"/&gt;

Modern Vietnamese artists began to utilize French techniques with many traditional mediums such as silk, lacquer, etc., thus creating a unique blend of eastern and western elements.

===Vietnamese calligraphy===
Calligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using [[Chinese characters]] along with [[chữ nôm]]. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based [[Quốc Ngữ]], which has proven to be very popular.

In the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the [[Tết|Lunar New Year]], people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.

==Filipino art==

[[Philippines|Filipino]] identity was born at the same time as its creation, Mainly from its Pre-Colonial/Pre-Philippines Cultures that merged with the influenced of the Colonizers and Chinese traders that melted and evolved to its own unique Classical Filipino Identity. Before the Philippines was born, It was a divided set of nations, islands and tribes being ruled by their own specific Social Kings, Chieftains, Lakans, Datus, Rajahs and Sultans.  Every nation has its own identity and some are even part of a larger Empire outside of the modern day map of what is now the Philippines, for example; [[Manila]] was once part of the [[Bruneian Empire]]. Another example is many parts of the modern day [[Mindanao]] is [[theorized]] to be part of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit empire]] with its capital being located in [[East Java]] in the modern day [[Indonesia]]. The Advent of the Colonial arrival to the islands started The modern day Philippines, as it was during that time that what is now a united islands of today now known as the Philippines was created. The [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] influenced has been felt throughout [[Southeast Asia]] through trade, even before the Colonization of the region specifically [[Ming dynasty]] and other earlier dynasties as early as the 9th century. But it was during the Spanish colonization that modern day Chinese Filipino signature-mark on what is now the Philippines was developed. These cultures the melted from pre-colonial internal and external influence is very evident in the Pre-modern arts and tradition of the Philippines. Paintings of [[José Honorato Lozano]] has clear indication of East and West influence.
[[File:0201jfSan Agustin Church Museum Manilafvf 07.jpg|thumb|Filipino Baroque is Baroque incorporating motifs based on Filipino Culture, Environment  and everyday life ]]
Kutkut art is another technique of combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces existed today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. ''Kut-kut'' is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques—sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of these ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines, multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Filipino signature is also very evident in architecture. One famous examples of this is how the Philippines intentionally adapted the [[Baroque]] style of architecture which is famous in Europe at that time to the earthquake-prone environment of the Philippines with ornamentation portraying Philippine culture, environment and everyday life incorporating local motifs, for example; using things such as Banana leaves which is very common in the Philippines. This became known as the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines|Filipino Baroque]] with the [[Earthquake Baroque]] being its famous variant that is present in the famous churches of the Philippines. Some Pre-Colonial art has made its way to the modern Filipino society especially in the Mindanao and other uncolonized parts of the Philippines one example of this is the [[Sarimanok]] symbolism on art.

[[Image:Jean-Baptiste Regnault 001.jpg|thumb|200px|''Education of Achilles''. 1780/1790]]
'''Jean-Baptiste Regnault''' (9 October 1754 &amp;ndash; 12 November 1829) was a [[France|French]] [[Painting|painter]].

==Biography==
Regnault was born in [[Paris]], and began life at sea in a merchant vessel. At the age of fifteen his talent attracted attention, and he was sent to [[Italy]] by M. de Monval under the care of [[Jean Bardin|Bardin]]. After his return to Paris, Regnault, in 1776, won the [[Prix de Rome|Grand Prix]] for his painting ''Alexandre and Diogène'', and in 1783 he was elected [[Académie des beaux-arts|Academician]]. His diploma picture, the ''Education of [[Achilles]] by [[Chiron]]'', is now in the [[Louvre]], as also the ''Christ taken down from the Cross'', originally executed for the royal chapel at [[Fontainebleau]], and two minor works&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the ''Origin of Painting'' and ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] praying [[Venus (god)|Venus]] to give Life to his Statue''.

Besides various small pictures and allegorical subjects, Regnault was also the author of many large historical paintings; and his school, which reckoned amongst its chief attendants [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin|Guérin]], [[Louis-Philippe Crépin|Crepin]], Lafitte, [[Merry-Joseph Blondel|Blondel]], [[Robert Lefèvre]], [[Henriette Lorimier]] and Alexandre Menjaud, was for a long while the rival in influence of that of [[Jacques-Louis David|David]].

Besides Merry-Joseph Blondel, Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, Robert Lefèvre, and Henriette Lorimier, Jean-Baptiste Regnault's students include: [[Godefroy Engelmann]],  [[Louis Hersent]], [[Charles Paul Landon]], [[Hippolyte Lecomte]], [[Jacques Réattu]], [[Jean-Hilaire Belloc]].

Jean-Baptiste Regnault was married first to Sophie Meyer, then Sophie Félicité Beaucourt.

He died in Paris. He is buried in [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]].

'''Joanne Francis''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Pamela Salem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/articles/2005/09/30/pamela_salem_interview_feature.shtml|title= Interview with Pamela Salem|publisher=''BBC'' | date = 2005-09-30| accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appears on screen between 16 June 1988 and 3 January 1989.

==Storylines==
Joanne is first seen in [[Albert Square]] in June 1988. She is a member of the [[gangster]] organisation known as [[The Firm (EastEnders)|The Firm]], and is sent to [[Walford]] by Mr Vinnicombe (The Firm's boss) to manage Strokes Winebar, which is actually a facade for an illegal [[gambling]] den. Her arrival upsets [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), as he had thought that he was being given managerial status. Despite initial hostility, Joanne and Den prove to be a good team and build up a strong working relationship.

Den, however, is too unpredictable for the Firm's liking, and after his best friend's wife, [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), is raped by rival wine-bar owner, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), he goes against the Firm's orders and instigates a revenge attack without their approval. With the help of another member of The Firm, [[Brad Williams (EastEnders)|Brad Williams]] (Jonathan Stratt), he has Willmott-Brown's winebar set on fire. This leads to a police investigation, putting Strokes under surveillance and The Firm under suspicion. In order to put the police off, The Firm decide that Den has to take the blame for the [[arson]]. Den unwillingly does so following pressure from Joanne, and then goes into hiding to avoid arrest. However, The Firm's real agenda is to lure Den into a false sense of security before killing him, thus stopping him implicating them for their heinous crimes. Realising this, Den manages to escape The Firm and goes on the run, but when The Firm trace him to his hideout, he is forced to turn himself in to the police in order to avoid being killed. Den is sent to [[Dickens Hill]] prison, leaving The Firm to assume that it will only be a matter of time before Den divulges his knowledge about their criminal antics. Actually, Den has no intention of [[grassing]], but the investigating officer, D.I. West, decides to play up to The Firm's fears, spreading rumours that Den is on the verge of implicating them. [[Gregory Mantel]] ([[Pavel Douglas]]), a superior member of The Firm, makes plans to have Den eradicated from within prison. Joanne does not believe that Den is an informant and she tries to do everything she can to stop her associates from setting up a hit on him, even going above Mantel's head and relaying her doubts to Mr Vinnicombe, which earns her the wrath of Mantel, but manages to spare Den's life temporarily.

Joanne moves into a flat in Albert Square and continues running Strokes, but her position is put in jeopardy when a new Detective Inspector, [[Bob Ashley (EastEnders)|Bob Ashley]] ([[Robin Lermitte]]), starts to take umbrage with her presence in Walford. He begins putting pressure on Brad Williams to frame The Firm, threatening him with prison unless he obliges. Brad divulges the whereabouts of evidence that will show Joanne's criminal dealings, enabling him to get rid of her and close down Strokes. Sensing her imminent downfall, Joanne considers resigning from The Firm. This does not please Mantel, he reminds her not to 'rock the boat' or else she will meet the same fate as her late husband. It is revealed that Joanne's husband had also been employed by The Firm, and his association had led to his untimely demise. So Joanne flees, stealing thousands of pounds of The Firm's money in the process. Her exit is nearly halted by a speeding car, driven by Brad, who has been instructed by Mantel to eliminate her. Brad misses his target and she manages to escape unharmed. Her last appearance is in January 1989. Strokes closes down soon after.

==Character creation and development==

===Background===
One of the most popular characters in the early years of ''EastEnders'' was [[Den Watts]], played by [[Leslie Grantham]].&lt;ref name="insidestory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith|first= Julia|authorlink= Julia Smith|author2=Holland, Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders - The Inside Story]] |year=1987|publisher=Book Club Associates|isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was deemed so popular by the producers of the serial, that when Grantham announced he was quitting the soap in November 1987, creators [[Julia Smith]] and [[Tony Holland]] devised a storyline that would keep the character on screen for a further year, while only requiring Grantham to commit to a couple of months filming.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done by sending Den to prison on remand and mixing the previously filmed prison storyline in with the current happenings in [[Albert Square]]. On screen, the build-up to Grantham's exit occurred throughout 1988, as Den, always portrayed as a petty criminal with shady connections, was recruited to work for the more serious East End organised crime operation, known as [[The Firm (EastEnders)|The Firm]]. Various characters were introduced as part of the storyline.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Among them was Joanne Francis, a middle classed "hard woman", who was brought in to be the manager of Strokes winebar, a facade for an illegal gambling den owned by The Firm.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

===Casting===
Actress [[Pamela Salem]] was given the role of Joanne. Salem had known Grantham for many years prior to her casting.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-36292-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before ''EastEnders'' went to air, Grantham had served time in [[Wormwood Scrubs]] prison for the murder of a taxi driver, and occasionally actors were brought in to entertain the prisoners. Among the visiting actors were [[Louise Jameson]] (who later went on to play [[Rosa di Marco]]) and Salem.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Both actresses were instrumental in introducing Grantham to acting while he was in prison, and helping him to enroll in drama school upon his release. Salem had already auditioned for a part in ''EastEnders'', [[Jan Hammond]], the mistress of Den Watts. She was unsuccessful, and that part went to [[Jane How]]; however, Grantham later persuaded the casting director of ''EastEnders'' to give Salem the role of Joanne.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

{{Muhammad cartoons}}

The '''''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy''' (or '''Muhammad cartoons crisis''') ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henkel |first=Heiko |title=Fundamentally Danish? The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis as Transitional Drama |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-knowledge |date=Fall 2010 |volume=VIII |series=2 |url=http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194639/http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began after the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, most of which depicted [[Muhammad]], a principal figure of the religion of [[Islam]]. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. Muslim groups in [[Denmark]] complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis. The tip of an Iceberg", Japanese religion |last=Jensen |first=Tim |year=2006 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam has a strong tradition of [[aniconism]], and it is considered [[Islam and blasphemy|highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions]] to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish [[imam]]s visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the ''Jyllands-Posten'', and other information some of which was found to be falsified.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt;&lt;ref name="HH80-84" /&gt;

As a result, the issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching "Buy Danish" campaigns and other displays of support. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.

Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] described the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the [[Denmark in World War II|Second World War]]. The incident came at a time of heightened political and social tensions between [[Islam by country|Muslim majority countries]] and [[Western world|Western countries]], following several, high-profile [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist attacks]] in the West{{mdash}}including the [[September 11 attacks]]{{mdash}}and Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as [[American occupation of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolize the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.

Supporters said that the publication of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] regardless of the validity of the expression, that it was important to openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as [[Islamophobic]], racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.

=== Debate about self-censorship ===
On 16 September 2005, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]], who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name=hansen&amp;hundevadt&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=John |title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne |year=2006 |publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-7692-092-5 |first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bluitgen |first=Kåre |title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv |year=2006 |publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk |isbn=978-87-638-0049-5 |page=268 |url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |others=Anonymous illustrator |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of reprisals.

One artist agreed to assist anonymously; he said that he was afraid for his and his family's safety.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bluitgen, one artist declined due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the [[Carsten Niebuhr]] Institute at the [[University of Copenhagen]]; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 October 2004 |title=Overfaldet efter Koran-læsning |publisher=TV 2 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202822/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 September 2005 |title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam") |newspaper=Politiken |url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |accessdate=19 March 2013 |language=Danish |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195043/http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed refusals from these first three artists to participate was seen as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of violence from [[Islamist]]s, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 February 2006 |title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |first=Flemming |last=Rose |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923211833/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication ===

At an editorial meeting of ''Jyllands-Posten'' ("The [[Jutland]] Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted the idea of asking the members of the newspaper illustrators union if they would be willing to draw Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. [[Flemming Rose]], culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

15 illustrators responded to the letter; three declined to participate, one did not know how to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and one said he was afraid.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 12 drawings had been submitted{{mdash}}three from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17" /&gt; The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for ''Jyllands-Posten.'' In the end, editor-in-chief [[Carsten Juste]] decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Peter Hervik]], a professor of Migration Studies, has since written that the results of this experiment disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Carsten Juste has said that the survey "lacked validity and the story fell short of sound journalistic basis."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Hervik said that this, along with the fact that the most controversial cartoons were drawn by the newspaper's staff cartoonists, demonstrates that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;

Rose wrote the editorial which accompanied the cartoons in which he argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, so he thought it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the [[Tate gallery]] in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian [[Frank Hvam]] said in an interview with ''Jyllands-Posten'' that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and "called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;

On 30 September 2005, ''Jyllands-Posten'' published an article entitled "''Muhammeds ansigt''" ("The face of Muhammad")  incorporating the cartoons.&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Flemming |last=Rose |date=29 September 2005 |title=Muhammeds ansigt |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |language=Danish |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225235648/http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article consisted of the 12 cartoons and an explanatory text, in which Rose wrote:

{{quote|Modern, secular society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with contemporary democracy and freedom of speech, where one must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is of minor importance in the present context.&amp;nbsp;... we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end. That is why ''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'' has invited members of the Danish editorial cartoonists union to draw Muhammad as they see him.|Flemming Rose|&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt" /&gt;}}

Later, Rose explained his intent further in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt; The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket'' ('The Threat from  the Darkness'') condemning Islamic spiritual leaders "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; In October 2005, ''Politiken'', another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profetens ansigt: Ingen selvcensur blandt tegnere (''The prophet's face: No Self Censorship among illustrators'') |newspaper=Politiken |date=20 October 2005 |page=Section 2, page 3 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description of the cartoons ===
{{Main|Descriptions of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons}}

The 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts, one deliberately evades the issue and depicts a school child in Denmark named Muhammad rather than the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], one is based on a Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Response ===

The immediate responses to the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |title=The Cartoons That Shook the World |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624082203/https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to [[Jytte Klausen]], "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame."&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berlingske-Tidende'' criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. ''Politiken'' attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17" /&gt; On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the publication, a group of Islamic leaders formed a protest group. [[Raed Hlayhel]] called a meeting to discuss their strategy, which took place in Copenhagen a few days after the cartoons appeared.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Faith Community and four mosques from around the country were represented. The meeting established 19 "action points" to try to influence public opinion about the cartoons. [[Ahmed Akkari]] from an  mosque in Aarhus was designated the group's spokesman. The group planned a variety of political activities, including launching a legal complaint against the newspaper,  writing letters to media outlets inside and outside Denmark, contacting politicians and diplomatic representatives, organising a protest in Copenhagen, and mobilising Danish Muslims through text messages and mosques.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A one-day strike and sleep-in were planned, but never took place.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A peaceful protest, which attracted about 3,500 demonstrators, was held in Copenhagen on 14 October 2005.&lt;ref name=Klausen186&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received petitions from Danish imams, eleven ambassadors from Muslim-majority countries{{mdash}}Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Morocco{{mdash}}and the Head of the Palestinian General Delegation&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; asked for a meeting with Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 12 October 2005. They wanted to discuss what they perceived as an "on-going smearing campaign in Danish public circles and media against Islam and Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Hervik, 2012, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter, the ambassadors mentioned the issue of the Muhammad cartoons, a recent indictment against [[Radio Holger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark targets extremist media |date=17 August 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Thomas |last=Buch-Andersen |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and statements by MP [[Louise Frevert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ordene på Louise Freverts hjemmeside |date=30 September 2005 |language=Danish |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211101846/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |archivedate=11 December 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minister of Culture [[Brian Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mikkelsen blæser til ny kulturkamp |date=25 September 2005 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |publisher=TV2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215173141/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |archivedate=15 February 2006 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded:

{{quote|We deplore these statements and publications and urge Your Excellency's government to take all those responsible to task under law of the land in the interest of inter-faith harmony, better integration and Denmark's overall relations with the Muslim world.|Letter from 11 ambassadors|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from 11 ambassadors |url=http://www.rogerbuch.dk/jpabrev.pdf |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013004346/http://www.rogerbuch.dk/jpabrev.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The government answered with a letter without addressing the request for a meeting: "The freedom of expression has a wide scope and the Danish government has no means of influencing the press. However, Danish legislation prohibits acts or expressions of blasphemous or discriminatory nature. The offended party may bring such acts or expressions to court, and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |title=Official response to ambassadors from A.F.Rasmussen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219083657/http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2006 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refusal to meet the ambassadors was later prominently criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davidsen-Nielsen |first=Hans |title=Danske ambassadører leverer skarp kritik af Fogh |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |accessdate=19 September 2013 |newspaper=Politiken |date=19 December 2005 |language=Danish |last2=Surrugue |first2=Stéphanie |last3=Parker Astrup |first3=Tanja |last4=Emborg |first4=Rasmus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055618/http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hervik wrote, "While it is certainly true that the prime minister did not have a legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from ''Jyllands-Posten'''s editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those.

After trying to engage the Danish government diplomatically, Egyptian foreign minister [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] and the secretary-generals of the  OIC and the Arab League sent letters to the [[OSCE]], [[OECD]], and [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|EU foreign policy coordinator]] complaining about Danish inaction.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 67" /&gt;

=== Judicial investigation of ''Jyllands-Posten'' (October 2005 – January 2006) ===
On 27 October 2005, representatives of the Muslim organisations which had complained about the cartoons in early October filed a complaint with the Danish police claiming that ''Jyllands-Posten'' had committed an offence under section 140 and 266b of the [[Danish Criminal Code]], precipitating an investigation by the public prosecutor.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |title=Official Response by the Danish Government to the UN Special Rapporteurs |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |date=24 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218054430/http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |format=PDF |language=Danish |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish [[case law]] extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan" /&gt; In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.&lt;ref name=rigsadvokat /&gt;

In December, after failing to make any progress with the Danish government or the newspaper, the "Committee for Prophet Honouring" decided to gain support and leverage outside of Denmark by meeting directly with religious and political leaders in the Middle East. They created a 43-page dossier (commonly known as the [[Akkari-Laban dossier]], after two leading imams ({{lang-ar|ملف عكّاري لبن}})) containing the cartoons and supporting materials for their meetings.&lt;ref name=clash&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |date=1 February 2006 |title=Alienated Danish Muslims Sought Help from Arabs |newspaper=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307221716/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dossier, finalised for the group's trip to Lebanon in mid-December, contained the following:&lt;ref name=Thomsen&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Per Bech |title=Muhammed-krisen – Hvad skete der, hvad har vi lært? |year=2006 |publisher=People's Press |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-7055-002-6 |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblen.info/Ressourcer/5679.pdf The dossier (PDF in arabic)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223335/http://www.biblen.info/Ressourcer/5679.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} (page visited on 7 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts{{mdash}}including Helle Lykke Nielsen{{mdash}}who have examined the dossier said that it was broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to.&lt;ref name="HH80-84"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is), that the cartoons are the result of a contest, and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the Liberal Party). The imams also claimed to speak on behalf of 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Additions such as the "pig" photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt; Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned ''Jyllands-Posten''.&lt;ref name=clash /&gt;

The OIC issued a condemnation of the cartoons: "[We express our] concern at rising hatred against Islam and Muslims and condemned the recent incident of desecration of the image of the Holy Prophet Mohamed."

[[Naser Khader]], a Muslim Danish MP, founded an organisation called [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark]] in response to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that there is a real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pipes |first=Daniel |title=Naser Khader and Flemming Rose: Reflections on the Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=[[Middle East Quarterly]] |date=Fall 2007 |volume=XIV |issue=4 |pages=59–66 |url=http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920205949/http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |archivedate=20 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, I was so fascinated with this logical force in the Islamic mindset that I could not see the greater picture. I was convinced it was a fight for my faith, Islam." Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad. We have not changed our position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ahmad Akkari, Danish Muslim: I was wrong to damn Muhammad cartoons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/ahmad-akkari-islam-danish-cartoons-muhammad |accessdate=10 March 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082552/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/09/ahmad-akkari-islam-danish-cartoons-muhammad |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Aniconism in Islam|Depictions of Muhammad}}

The [[Qur'an]] condemns idolatry, and this has led some Islamic scholars to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; this is known as [[aniconism]]. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition about this is not uniform.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John L. |title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979413-3 |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193700/https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history. In practice, images of Muhammad have been made on many occasions, generally in a restricted and socially regulated way; for example, they are often stylised or do not show Muhammad's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muhammad: A Very Short Introduction |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-151027-0 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Brown |first=Jonathan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502081332/https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Muslim communities, views about pictorial representations have varied: [[Shi'a Islam]] has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures while [[Sunni Islam]] generally forbids any pictorial representation of living beings, albeit with some variation in practice outside a religious context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voices of Islam |year=2007 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-98732-9 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RNTAHx95RqQC&amp;pg=PA29 |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt |editor=Vincent J.

==== Insulting Muhammad ====
In Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the [[University of Granada]], "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]] maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day."&lt;ref name=Soage&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soage |first=Ana Belen |title=The Danish Caricatures Seen from the Arab World |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |year=2006 |volume=7 |series=3 |pages=363–369 |doi=10.1080/14690760600819523 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Quran itself, "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." &lt;ref name=Soage /&gt; Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general.

Peter Hervik said that the cartoon controversy must be seen in the context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002.&lt;ref name=Hervik&gt;{{cite book |last=Hervik |first=Peter |title=The Annoying Difference: The Emergence of Danish Neonationalism, Neoracism, and Populism in the Post-1989 World |year=2011 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-0-85745-100-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BivtnsLX5FgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that ''Jyllands-Posten'' and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Hervik /&gt; Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=Marion G. |last2=Özcan |first2=Esra |title=The Political Iconography of Muhammad Cartoons: Understanding Cultural Conflict and Political Action |journal=PS: Political Science and Politics |date=April 2007 |volume=40 |series=2 |doi=10.1017/S104909650707045X |at=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish Muslim politician Naser Khader said, "Muslims are no more discriminated against in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe&amp;nbsp;... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake.

The incident occurred at a time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |title=West Beginning to See Islamic Protests as Sign of Deep Gulf |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=21 March 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107223659/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=7 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests in a wide variety of local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===== Cartoons as a political tool in the West =====

Some commentators see the publications of the cartoons as part of a deliberate effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 March 2006 |title=Islam and globanalisation |newspaper=Al-Ahram |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |last=Dabashi |first=Hamid |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625133913/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Andrew Mueller wrote, "I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that&amp;nbsp;...

{{quote|the critique of 'Muslim fundamentalism' has become a cornerstone in the definition of European identities. As well as replacing anti-communism as the rallying point for a broad 'democratic consensus' (and, in this shift, remaking this consensus), the critique of Islamic fundamentalism has also become a conduit for imagining Europe as a moral community beyond the nation. It has emerged as a banner under which the most diverse sectors of society can unite in the name of 'European' values.}}

===== Use by Islamists and Middle-Eastern governments =====
Some commentators believed that the controversy was used by Islamists competing for influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Olivier |last=Guitta |date=20 February 2006 |title=The Cartoon Jihad-The Muslim Brotherhood's project for dominating the West |newspaper=Weekly Standard |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/704xewyj.asp?pg=1 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nelly |last=Van Doorn-Harder |date=23 February 2006 |title=Behind the cartoon war: radical clerics competing for followers |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0223/p09s01-coop.html |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054247/http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0223/p09s01-coop.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 March 2006 |title=Islamic Activism Sweeps Saudi Arabia |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Faiza |last=Saleh Ambah |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/22/AR2006032202305.html |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921063615/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/22/AR2006032202305.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jytte Klausen wrote that the Muslim reaction to the cartoons was not a spontaneous, emotional reaction arising out of the clash of Western and Islamic civilisations.

===== Racism and ignorance =====

One controversy that arose around the cartoons was the question of whether they were racist.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 7–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modood |first=Tariq |last2=Hansen |first2=Randall |last3=Bleich |first3=Erik |last4=O'Leary |first4=Brendan |last5=Carens |first5=Joseph H. |title=The Danish Cartoon Affair: Free Speech, Racism, Islamism, and Integration |at=The Danish Cartoon Controversy: A Defence of Liberal Freedom |journal=International Migration |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=44 |issue=5 |year=2006 |issn=0020-7985 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] "on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", [[Doudou Diène]], saw xenophobia and racism in Europe as the root of the controversy, and partly criticised the government of Denmark for inaction after the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=13 February 2006 |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of Muslim and Arab peoples in various parts of the world (E/CN.4/2006/17) |first=Doudou |last=Diène |publisher=UNCHR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |quote=Politically and from the standpoint of the morality of international relations, the Danish Government, against the backdrop of an alarming resurgence of defamation of religions, especially Islamophobia but also anti-Semitism and Christianophobia, failed to show the commitment and vigilance that it normally displays in combating religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred and promoting religious harmony. |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190308/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aurel Sari has since said that the special rapporteur's interpretation was wrong and that "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons can be regarded as racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" although "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights." This means that the Danish authorities probably could have prohibited the drawings' dissemination if they had chosen to.&lt;ref =Sari&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sari |first=Aurel |title=The Danish Cartoons Row: Re-Drawing the Limits of the Right to Freedom of Expression? |journal=Finnish Yearbook of International Law |year=2006 |volume=16 |pages=365–398 |ssrn=1317702}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randall Hansen]] said that the cartoons were clearly anti-Islamic, but that this should not be confused with racism because a religion is a system of ideas not an inherent identity.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 7–16" /&gt; [[Tariq Modood]] said that the cartoons were essentially racist because Muslims are in practice treated as a group based on their religion, and that the cartoons were intended to represent all of Islam and all Muslims in a negative way, not just Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 1–7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modood |first=Tariq |last2=Hansen |first2=Randall |last3=Bleich |first3=Erik |last4=O'Leary |first4=Brendan |last5=Carens |first5=Joseph H. |title=The Danish Cartoon Affair: Free Speech, Racism, Islamism, and Integration |at=The Liberal Dilemma: Integration or Vilification? |journal=International Migration |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=44 |issue=5 |year=2006 |issn=0020-7985 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Bleich said that while the cartoons did essentialise Islam in a potentially racist way, they ranged from offensive to pro-Muslim so labelling them as a group was problematic.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 17–22"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modood |first=Tariq |last2=Hansen |first2=Randall |last3=Bleich |first3=Erik |last4=O'Leary |first4=Brendan |last5=Carens |first5=Joseph H. |title=The Danish Cartoon Affair: Free Speech, Racism, Islamism, and Integration |at=On Democratic Integration and Free Speech: Response to Tariq Modood and Randall Hansen |journal=International Migration |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=44 |issue=5 |year=2006 |issn=0020-7985 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' said  Muslims were not targeted in a discriminatory way, since unflattering cartoons about other religions or their leaders are frequently printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 2006 |title=The limits to free speech – Cartoon wars |newspaper=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5494602 |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205063803/http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5494602 |archivedate=5 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] posited that the cartoons were inspired by a spirit of "ordinary racism under cover of freedom of expression" and that they must be seen in the context of Jyllands-Posten agenda of incitement against immigrants in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=June 2006 |title=A View from the West —Noam Chomsky interviewed by Torgeir Norling |url=http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/200606--.htm |publisher=Noam Chomky official website |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702152807/http://chomsky.info/interviews/200606--.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 2006, the cartoonist [[Kurt Westergaard]] who drew the "bomb in turban" cartoon{{mdash}}the most controversial of the 12{{mdash}}said:

{{Quote|There are interpretations of [the drawing] that are incorrect. The general impression among Muslims is that it is about Islam as a whole. It is not.

Many Muslims saw the cartoons as a sign of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star [[Amr Khaled]] urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known&amp;nbsp;... Do not say that this is the task of the ''ulema'' (religious scholars){{mdash}}it is the task of all of us."&lt;ref name=Soage /&gt; Ana Soage said, "the targeting of a religious symbol like Muhammad, the only prophet that Muslims do not share with Jews and Christians, was perceived as the last in a long list of humiliations and assaults: it is probably not a coincidence that the more violent demonstrations were held in countries like Syria, Iran and Libya, whose relations with the West are tense."&lt;ref name=Soage /&gt; [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a prominent Islamic theologian, called for a day of anger from Muslims in response to the cartoons. He supported calls for a UN resolution that "categorically prohibits affronts to prophets{{mdash}}to the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Dispatch No.1089: Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi Responds to Cartoons of Prophet Muhammad: Whoever is Angered and Does Not Rage in Anger is a Jackass – We are Not a Nation of Jackasses |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |work=Jihad &amp; Terrorism Studies Project |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=9 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150258/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |archivedate=9 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Double standards =====

Ehsan Ahrari of ''[[Asia Times Online|Asia Times]]'' accused some European countries of double standards in adopting [[Laws against Holocaust denial|laws that outlaw Holocaust denial]] but still defended the concept of freedom of speech in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahrari |first=Ehsan |title=Cartoons and the clash of 'freedoms' |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HB04Aa01.html |date=4 February 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Asia Times Online]] |publisher=Asia Times Online Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-holocaust or genocide denial laws were in place in Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Israel, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, and Romania in 2005.

===== Relationship between the Liberal West and Islam =====

[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote in the online magazine ''Slate'' that "while beginning with a commendable European desire to assert basic liberal values," the controversy was an alarming sign of the degree of cultural conflict between Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and their broader populations, and advocated a measured and prudent response to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2006 |last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |title=Europe vs. Radical Islam |newspaper=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907121835/http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helle Rytkonen wrote in ''Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007'' that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as a simple matter of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Rytkonen 2007, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] wrote in ''Slate'' that official reaction in the West{{mdash}}particularly the United States{{mdash}}was too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark and the right to free speech. He said, "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' ''feelings''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Stand up for Denmark! |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |work=Slate |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925164659/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kristol]] also wrote that the response of Western leaders, with the exception of the Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" to fight back against the "assault" on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristol |first=William |title=Oh, the Anguish!

Flemming Rose said he did not expect a violent reaction, and talked about what the incident implies about the relationship between the West and the Muslim world. He said, 

{{quote|I spoke to [historian of Islam] Bernard Lewis about this, and he said that the big difference between our case and the Rushdie affair is that Rushdie is perceived as an apostate by the Muslims while, in our case, Muslims were insisting on applying Islamic law to what non-Muslims are doing in non-Muslim countries. In that sense, he said it is a kind of unique case that might indicate that Europe is perceived as some kind of intermediate state between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

==== Freedom of speech, political correctness and self-censorship ====

One of the principal lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohammed Saif-Alden Wattad, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2010_2/dr-mohammed-saif-alden-wattad.pdf "ISLAM, TERRORISM AND MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETIES"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Sam Sailor |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed in response to the perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said: 

{{Quote|When I wrote the accompanying text to the publication of the cartoons, I said that this act was about self-censorship, not free speech. Free speech is on the books; we have the law, and nobody as yet has thought of rewriting it. This changed when the death threats were issued; it became an issue of the Sharia trumping the fundamental right of free speech.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}} 

Rose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between political correctness and self-censorship{{mdash}}which he considered more dangerous. He said: 

{{Quote|There is a very important distinction to be made here between what you perceive as good behavior and a fear keeping you from doing things that you want to do&amp;nbsp;... A good example of this was the illustrator who refused to illustrate a children's book about the life of Mohammed. He is on the record in two interviews saying that he insisted on anonymity because he was afraid.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens wrote that it is important to affirm "the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Cartoon Debate: The Case for Mocking Religion |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |accessdate=4 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=4 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010093541/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story.

I refuse to argue politely why freedom of expression, reason and humour should be respected". She said that those things are part of a healthy society and that deeply held feelings or beliefs should not be exempt from commentary, and that those offended had the option of ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mikich |first=Sonia |title=What next, bearded one?

Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University wrote that in a liberal democracy freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its way of life is threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peetush |first=Ashwani K. |title=Caricaturizing Freedom: Islam, Offence, and The Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=Studies in South Asian Film and Media |date=May 2009 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=173–188 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |accessdate=15 November 2012 |doi=10.1386/safm.1.1.173_1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001221527/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.&lt;ref name="Leveque" /&gt;  In Canada a human rights commission investigated ''[[The Western Standard]]'', a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danish cartoon complaint rejected |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |accessdate=10 June 2013 |newspaper=National Post |date=7 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324103700/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |archivedate=24 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about the role of government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahn |first=Robert |title=Tragedy, Farce or Legal Mobilization?

==Early life==
Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in [[Karnal]], India, but her official date of birth was altered to 1 July 1961 to allow her to become eligible for the matriculation exam.&lt;ref name="Salwi, 2004"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Salwi |first1=Dilip M |title=Did you know Kalpana was called Monto? |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/feb/20spec.htm |accessdate=20 August 2017 |work=[[Rediff.com]] |date=20 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170820195308/http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/feb/20spec.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Kalpana liked to draw pictures  of airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://harrisonpublishing.net/pdf/book/kalpana_book.1.1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;After getting a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from [[Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh|Punjab Engineering College]],India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from [[the University of Texas at Arlington]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Chawla  | first = Kalpana  | title = MS Thesis Optimization of cross flow fan housing for airplane wing. installation  | publisher = University of Texas at Arlington  |page=97  | date = 1984  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and a [[PhD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Chawla  | first = Kalpana  | title = PhD Thesis Computation of dynamics and control of unsteady vortical flows.  | publisher = University of Colorado at Boulder  |page=147  | date = 1988  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

==Career==
In 1988, she began working at NASA, where she did [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) research on [[V/STOL|vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL)]] concepts. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as Vice President and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems.&lt;ref name=NASAbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalpana Chawla (PH.D)|work=Biographical Data|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/chawla.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chawla held a Certificated Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher =I Love India|title=Kalpana Chawla|url=http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/kalpana-chawla.html|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, Chawla applied for the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]].&lt;ref name=bioreview&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Book Review: Biography of Kalpana Chawla |author=Basu, Biman |url=http://www.niscair.res.in/jinfo/sr/2012/SR%2049%285%29%20%28Book%20Review%29.pdf |magazine=[[Science Reporter (magazine)|Science Reporter]] |pages=40–41 |date=May 2012 |access-date=2013-07-06 |quote=Born on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, Haryana}}&lt;/ref&gt; She joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1996.

=== First space mission ===

Her first space mission began on November 17, 1997, as part of the six-astronaut crew that flew the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] flight [[STS-87]]. Chawla was the first Indian woman to fly in space. She spoke the following words while traveling in the weightlessness of space, "You are just your intelligence." On her first mission, Chawla traveled over 10.4 million miles (16737177.6 km) in 252 orbits of the earth, logging more than 372 hours (15 Days and 12 Hours) in space.&lt;ref name=NASAbio /&gt; During STS-87, she was responsible for deploying the Spartan satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by [[Winston Scott]] and [[Takao Doi]] to capture the satellite. A five-month NASA investigation fully exonerated {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of flight crew and ground control. After the completion of [[STS-87]] post-flight activities, Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to work on the space station.

=== Second space mission ===
In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of [[STS-107]]. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners. On January 16, 2003, Chawla finally returned to space aboard [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|ill-fated STS-107 mission]]. The crew performed nearly 80 experiments studying earth and [[space science]], advanced technology development, and astronaut health and safety. During the launch of [[STS-107]], ''Columbia''{{'}}s 28th mission, a piece of foam insulation broke off from the [[Space Shuttle external tank]] and struck the left wing of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]]. Previous shuttle launches had seen minor damage from foam shedding,&lt;ref name="foam strikes"&gt;{{cite web |author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board |title=6.1 A History of Foam Anomalies (page 121)|date=August 2003 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/akamai.netstorage/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter6.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some engineers suspected that the damage to ''Columbia'' was more serious. [[NASA]] managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Columbia's problems began on left wing|url=http://staugustine.com/stories/020203/new_1299125.shtml |publisher=Associated Press via staugustine.com |author=Marcia Dunn |date=February 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Columbia'' re-entered the [[atmosphere of Earth]], the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-04-shuttle-investigation_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|title=Molten Aluminum found on Columbia's thermal tiles|accessdate=August 13, 2007 | work=USA Today | date=March 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the aftermath of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. Construction of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) was put on hold; the station relied entirely on the Russian [[Roscosmos State Corporation]] for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with [[STS-114]] and 41 months for crew rotation.

==Death==

Chawla died in the Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster which occurred on February 1, 2003, she was killed, along with the other six crew members, when the ''Columbia'' disintegrated over [[Texas]] during [[re-entry]] into the [[Earth's atmosphere]], shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, STS-107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Correspondent|first=A|title=Space Shuttle Explodes, Kalpana Chawla dead|url=http://www.rediff.com/us/2003/feb/01kalp.htm|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her two missions in space, Chawla had logged a total of "30 days, 14 hours, and 54 minutes in space". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/17056-kalpana-chawla-biography.html|title=Kalpana Chawla: Biography &amp; Columbia Disaster|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chawla's remains were identified along with the rest of the crew members and were cremated and scattered at National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.

==Personal Life==
Chawla is survived by her husband of almost 20 years before her death, J. P. Harrison. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/16/us/loss-shuttle-mood-shuttle-disaster-families-lost-more-than-mere-heroes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellar received praise for her performance in the first film,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilikehorrormovies.com/2011/12/grudge-2004.html?m=1|title=Karen Davis {{!}} ilikehorrormovies|website=www.ilikehorrormovies.com|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of them referenced her performances as the reason for the film's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041021/REVIEWS/40922015/1023|title=The Grudge Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2004) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=rogerebert.suntimes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her appearance in ''The Grudge 2'', she received praise again but also received mixed reviews due to the character's surprise death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRyH7gS__WI|title=The Grudge 2 Movie CLIP - Chased in the Hospital|publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting==
Before Gellar was cast, numerous other actresses were suggested, such as [[Selma Blair]]; the two of them had previously starred together in the teen movie ''[[Cruel Intentions]]''. The role eventually went to Gellar, who was known for her work in horror films such as ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' and ''[[Scream 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Grudge (2004)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391198/trivia|accessdate=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kira Heorhiyivna Muratova''' ({{lang-uk|Кіра Георгіївна Мура́това}}; née '''Korotkova''', 5 November 1934 – 6 June 2018&lt;ref&gt;[https://meduza.io/news/2018/06/06/umerla-rezhisser-kira-muratova Умерла Кира Муратова]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kira-muratova-dead-renowned-ukrainian-director-was-83-1117898 Kira Muratova, Renowned Ukrainian Director, Dies at 83]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] award-winning [[film director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[actress]], known for her unusual directorial style. Her films underwent a great deal of [[Film censorship|censorship]] in the [[Soviet Union]].

Muratova spent most of her artistic career in [[Odessa]], creating her films with local studios, mostly casting local actors.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kira Korotkova was born in 1934 in [[Soroca]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] (present-day [[Moldova]]) to a [[Jewish]] mother&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilegalisti.ro/ilegalist/5158 Illegal Communist Movement in Prewar Romania]: Natalia Reznic Korotkova (1906–1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observatorcultural.ro/articol/viata-si-moartea-unui-comunist-basarabean-iuri-korotkov-tatal-kirei-muratova/ Viața și moartea unui comunist basarabean Iuri Korotkov, tatăl Kirei Muratova]&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Russians|Russian]] father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2005/05/weird-and-wild/ Jonathan Rosenbaum]&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were both active communists and members of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]]. Her father participated in the anti-fascist guerilla movement in World War II, was arrested by Romanian forces and shot after interrogation. After the war, Kira lived in [[Bucharest]] with her mother, a [[gynaecologist]], who then pursued a government career in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Socialist Romania]].

In 1959, Kira graduated from the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] in [[Moscow]], specializing in directing. Upon graduation Korotkova received a director position with the [[Odessa Film Studio]] in Odessa, a port city at the [[Black Sea]] near to her native [[Bessarabia]]. She directed her first professional film in 1961 and worked with the studio until a professional conflict made her to move to [[Leningrad]] in 1978. There she made one film with [[Lenfilm]] Studio, but returned to Odessa afterwards. Muratova's films came under constant criticism of the Soviet officials due to her idiosyncratic film language that did not comply with the norms of [[socialist realism]]. Film scholar Isa Willinger has compared Muratova's cinematographic form to the Soviet Avant-garde, especially to Eisenstein's montage of attractions.&lt;ref name="IsaWillinger"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isawillinger.de/Chapter10.htm|title=Willinger, Isa (2013): "Circus Tricks and Eisenstein's 'Montage of Attractions': Traces of the Russian Film-Avant-garde in Muratova's Oeuvre".|accessdate=2015-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several times Muratova was banned from working as a director for a number of years each time.

Kira married her fellow Odessa studio director Oleksandr Muratov in the early 1960s and co-created several films with him. The couple had a daughter, Marianna, but soon divorced and Muratov moved to Kiev where he started work with [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]]. Kira Muratova kept her ex-husband's surname despite her later marriage to Leningrad painter and production designer Evgeny Golubenko.

===Post-Soviet period===
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}
In the 1990s, an extremely productive period began for Muratova. Ever since she has been shooting a feature film every two or three years, often working with the same actors and crew. Two actresses Muratova has repeatedly cast are [[Renata Litvinova]] and [[Natalya Buzko]]. Usually, Muratova's films are productions of Ukraine or co-productions between Ukraine and Russia, though the films are always in the [[Russian language]] (although Muratova could speak [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and did not object to the [[Ukrainianization]] of [[Ukrainian cinema]]&lt;ref&gt;Більше читайте тут: https://tsn.ua/glamur/rezhiser-kira-muratova-ya-na-boci-cogo-narodu-ya-z-maydanom-341183.html&lt;/ref&gt;). Muratova supported the [[Euromaidan]] protesters and the following [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Більше читайте тут: https://tsn.ua/glamur/rezhiser-kira-muratova-ya-na-boci-cogo-narodu-ya-z-maydanom-341183.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Muratova films have been premiering at International Film Festivals in Berlin, Cannes, Moscow, Rome, Venice and others. Next to [[Aleksandr Sokurov]], Muratova is considered to be the most idiosyncratic contemporary Russian-language film director. Muratova's works can be seen as postmodern, employing [[eclecticism]], parody, discontinuous editing, disrupted narration and intense visual and sound stimuli.&lt;ref name="IsaWillinger" /&gt;

===Recognition and awards===
{{Expand section|date=April 2013}}
It was only during ''[[Perestroyka]]'' that Muratova received wide public recognition and first awards. In 1988, the [[International Women's Film Festival Créteil]] (France) showed a first retrospective of her works. Her film ''[[Among Grey Stones]]'' was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/365/year/1988.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Among Grey Stones |accessdate=2009-07-31|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, her film ''[[The Asthenic Syndrome|Asthenic Syndrome]]'' won the [[Jury Grand Prix]] at the [[Berlinale]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1990/03_preistr_ger_1990/03_Preistraeger_1990.html |title=Berlinale: 1990 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-03-16 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, she was awarded the [[Leopard of Honour]] for her life oeuvre at The [[Locarno International Film Festival]] (Switzerland) and in 2000, she was given the Andrzej Wajda Freedom Award.&lt;ref name="IsaWillinger"/&gt;
In 1997, her film ''[[Three Stories (film)|Three Stories]]'' was entered into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1997"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/02_programm_1997/02_Programm_1997.html |title=Berlinale: 1997 Programme |accessdate=2012-01-14 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her 2002 film ''[[Chekhov's Motifs]]'' was entered into the [[24th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2002 |title=24th Moscow International Film Festival (2002) |accessdate=2013-03-31 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328141921/http://moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2002 |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her film ''The Tuner'' was shown at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2004. Her films received the Russian [[Nika Awards|"Nika" prize]] in 1991, 1995, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2013.
In 2005, a retrospective was shown at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York City. In 2013, a full retrospective of her films was shown at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tempelman|first=Olaf|date=January 2013|title=Voor alles en iedereen ongrijpbaar|publisher=[[De Volkskrant]]|issue=International Film Festival Rotterdam|page=12|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kubachi ware''' is the name given to a style of [[Persian pottery]]. Though it takes its name from the town of [[Kubachi (urban-type settlement)|Kubachi]] in [[Dagestan]], modern-day [[Russia]], scholars believe that Kubachi ware pieces were created during the [[Safavid]] Period in the northwestern part of what is now Iran.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golombek|first1=Lisa|title=Persian Pottery in the First Global Age: The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|date=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004260927|pages=168–81|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-V2NAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=golombek+kubachi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZqOtXxQTv&amp;sig=l13RWTnlVmhuwpeq0YVFNiSKIBo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI4uzv_d7dxgIVQoosCh07uw3J#v=onepage&amp;q=golombek%20kubachi&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nishapur]], [[Tabriz]], [[Mashhad]], and [[Isfahan]] have all been put forth as possible places of origin for Kubachi ware.

Kubachi ware is made of [[Fritware|stonepaste]] (also known as fritware). The decoration varies; some have turquoise glazes with black figures, perhaps in imitation of Chinese [[celadon]]. Others are blue on white, similar to [[Chinese ceramics|Ming porcelain]].&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title=Dish|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O85923/dish-unknown/|website=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue and white Ming porcelain was widely copied in Persia. The subject matter of Kubachi pieces includes humans, plants, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=PM|last2=Lambton|first2=Ann KS|last3=Lewis|first3=Bernard|title=The Cambridge History of Islam|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521291380|pages=729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the pottery, especially the use of [[polychrome]], reveals [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] influence, imitating the [[Iznik pottery|ceramics of Iznik]].&lt;ref name="Christie's"&gt;{{cite web|title=A SAFAVID BLUE AND WHITE "KUBACHI" POTTERY DISH|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-safavid-blue-and-white-kubachi-pottery-5671753-details.aspx|website=Christie's|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lane 1939"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lane|first1=Arthur|title=The So-Called "Kubachi" Wares of Persia|journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs|date=1939|volume=75|issue=439|pages=156–7, 160–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unsurprising given that Tabriz, one of the manufacturing centers of Kubachi ware, was located along trade routes with the Ottomans and was invaded by them several times.

==Origin of name==
The town of Kubachi, located in the [[Caucasus]], was the site of a large collection of 15th- and 16th-century [[pottery]]. Starting in the 1870s, many of these ceramic pieces were bought by collectors from Europe and North America and later donated to large museums.&lt;ref name="Later Persian Pottery on Encyclopædia Britannica'"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=George|title=Later Persian Pottery|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/pottery/Later-Persian#ref599991|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the town has stuck with this group of ceramics despite the fact that they were not manufactured in Kubachi.

==Place of origin== 
The earliest outside visitors to Kubachi assumed the works to be made locally, but this view was quickly discredited.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; Several competing theories about their place of origin have since been put forth; it has been suggested that the works are actually the products of multiple cities' workshops.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt;

Petrofabric analysis suggests that Tabriz may have been the place of production for many works of Kubachi ware.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"/&gt; Black-and-turquoise Kubachi ware has been associated with Nishapur via petrofabric analysis.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; Still other works have been identified with Masshad via inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt; The style of the figures on some of the works suggests a link with Isfahan.&lt;ref name="Golombek 2013"/&gt;

'''''Liberation''''' ({{Lang-no|'''Frigjøring'''}}) is a 1974 painting by the Norwegian artist [[Odd Nerdrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artprice.com/marketplace/1214457/odd-nerdrum/painting/liberation|title=Odd Nerdrum – Liberation|work=Artprice.com|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a room with a mattress where a couple have sexual intercourse with the [[woman on top]] of the passive man.

Nerdrum's art from the period 1968–1983 is characterized by everyday [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and left-wing politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Blom|first1=Hege|last2=Reisegg|first2=Øyvind|url=https://snl.no/Odd%20Nerdrum|title=Odd Nerdrum|language=Norwegian|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liberation'' was created in this context, where the radical left propounded a [[sexual revolution]] as a way to create a [[socialism|socialist]] utopia by politicizing every aspect of human life, especially sexuality. Nerdrum made several paintings on the topic of what was considered sexual liberation. The most famous of these are ''Liberation'' from 1974 and ''Spring'' (''Vår'') from 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ebbestad Hansen|first=Jan-Erik|year=1996|title=Fenomenet Nerdrum|language=Norwegian|location=Oslo|publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]]|page=83|isbn=82-05-24492-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was first presented at [[Høstutstillingen]] in 1974. It was exhibited at the Oslo gallery Kunstnerforbundet in 1976 as part of the exhibition Odd Nerdrum Malerier ("Odd Nerdrum Paintings").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blomqvist.no/Kunsthandel/Moderne-contemporary-og-eldre-kunst/Nerdrum-Odd-Frigjoering-1974|title=Nerdrum, Odd - Frigjøring 1974|language=Norwegian|publisher=Blomqvist Kunsthandel|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London Psychogeographical Association.jpg|thumb|200px|logo of the East London Section of the London Psychogeographical Association]]

The '''London Psychogeographical Association''' ('''LPA'''), sometimes referred to as the ''London Psychogeographical Committee'', is an organisation&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.unpopular.demon.co.uk/lpa/elpan001/001weareback.html We're Back]', ''LPA Newsletter'', No.1 Imbolc 1993 p1&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to [[psychogeography]]. The LPA is perhaps best understood in the context of [[psychogeographical]] [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

==London Psychogeographical Institute==
The LPA was first mentioned in 1957 by the British artist [[Ralph Rumney]], as one of the organisers of the "First Exhibition of Psychogeography" in Brussels, which included his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/chronology/1957.html Situationist International Online]&lt;/ref&gt; According to many accounts the group (which was also referred to as the London Psychogeographical Institute, Society or Committee) eventually merged into the [[Situationist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jeremy|title=The situationist city|url=http://www.sfbg.com/lit/aug02/sit.html|work=The Guardian Literary Supplement|accessdate=7 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040319114543/http://www.sfbg.com/lit/aug02/sit.html|archivedate=19 March 2004|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumney was in fact the only member of the 'Association'.

==LPA East London Section==
In the 1990s, the LPA was reinvoked as the LPA East London Section by [[Fabian Tompsett]], using the pseudonym Richard Essex, who published a series of newsletters and pamphlets under its name, as well as the writers grouped around the multiple user name [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]], including [[Stewart Home]]. Activities of the ELS also included trips to destinations of psychogeographical interest and the organisation of [[three sided football]] matches.

This version of the LPA has been described by the writer [[Iain Sinclair]], whose work is often described as [[psychogeography|psychogeographical]], as useful in "branding" that kind of practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/147_iainsinclair.shtml Fortean Times Magazine | Articles |]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504215741/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/147_iainsinclair.shtml |date=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spoiledink.com/FEATURES/author_interviews_007.php Edit Red Writing Community]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508072216/http://www.spoiledink.com/FEATURES/author_interviews_007.php |date=May 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Barry Hugill wrote an article for ''[[The Observer]]'' covering the LPA. He depicted their ideas as "so cranky that to mention [[Peter Ackroyd|Mr Ackroyd]]'s name in the same breath is to invite a writ." However he also states that "the psychogeographers fear that in 2000 there may be an attempt to perpetuate [[patriarchy]] through the [[ritual murder]] of a top member of royalty." &lt;ref&gt;'Cultists' Go Round in Circles', Barry Hugill, ''The Observer'' Sunday 28 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Luther Blissett, Stewart Home and other psychogeographical groups is said to involve the issuing of numerous leaflets and letters under a series of aliases, both personal and organisational, and the description of interactions, including collaborations and feuds, between both these and other, real people and groups (for example between Luther Blissett and the parapolitical researcher [[Larry O'Hara]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/feud.htm Stewart Home: Feuds]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last LPA Newsletter was issued around the year 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5988">'''Lumino Kinetic art''' involves, as the name suggests, light and movement.  It is a subset and an art historical term in the context of the more established [[kinetic art]], which in turn is a subset of [[new media art]].  The historian of art [[Frank Popper]] views the evolution of this type of art as evidence of "aesthetic preoccupations linked with technological advancement" and a starting-point in the context of high-technology art.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; [[László Moholy-Nagy]] (1895–1946), a member of the [[Bauhaus]], and influenced by [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] can be regarded as one of the fathers of Lumino kinetic art. [[Light sculpture]] and moving sculpture are the components of his ''Light-Space Modulator'' (1922–30), One of the first [[Light art]] pieces which also combines [[kinetic art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=1649&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate bio] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatjecantz.de/controller.php?cmd=artdictionary&amp;id=32] Retrieved January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the term itself are multiple. There was an early [[cybernetic art]]ist, [[Nicolas Schöffer]], who developed walls of light, prisms, and video circuits under the term in the 50s.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux&gt;{{cite web |title= Glossary - Kinetic art|url= http://www.newmedia-art.org/english/glossaire.htm|work= |publisher= New Media Encyclopedia|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artist/engineer [[Frank Malina]] came up with the [[Lumidyne]] system of lighting (CITE), and his work ''Tableaux mobiles'' (moving paintings) is an example of Lumino Kinetic art of that period.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux/&gt;  Later, artist [[Nino Calos]] worked with the term "Limino-kinetic paintings. (CITE). Artist [[György Kepes]] was also experimenting with lumino-kinetic works.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ellis D Fogg]] is also associated with the term as a "lumino kinetic sculptor".
In the 1960s various exhibits involved Lumino Kinetic art, inter alia ''Kunst-Licht-Kunst'' at the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven in 1966, and ''Lumière et mouvement'' at the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne|Musée d'Art Moderne]] &lt;!-- pls check validity of link --&gt; de la Ville de Paris in 1967.&lt;ref name=Nouveaux/&gt;

Lumino Kinetic art was also aligned with [[Op art]] in the late 60s because the moving lights were spectacular and psychedelic.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title= Summer of love: psychedelic art, social crisis and counterculture in the 1960s|last= Grunenberg|first= Christoph  |authorlink= |author2=Jonathan Harris |year= 2005|publisher= Liverpool University Press, 2005|location= |isbn= 0-85323-919-3|page= |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lfXljzVwkJcC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=%22lumino%22+art&amp;lr=&amp;ei=AbV-SqKFKpmSywSK5tjACg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lumino%22%20art&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 August 2009}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Popper]] views it as an art historical term in the context of kinetic art; he states that "there is no lumino kinetic art after the early 70s; it stands as a precursor to other contemporary cybernetic, robotic, new media-based arts, and is limited to a very small number of (male) European avant-garde artists (part of the [[New Tendencies]] movement)".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Mary-Ellis Bunim''' (July 9, 1946 – January 29, 2004) was an American [[television producer]] and co-creator of [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]''.

==Biography==
A native of Massachusetts, Bunim began her career in daytime dramas.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mary-Ellis Bunim, 57, a Producer and Pioneer in Reality TV |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/03/business/mary-ellis-bunim-57-a-producer-and-pioneer-in-reality-tv.html |accessdate=July 10, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She oversaw more than 2,500 hours of programming as executive producer of ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' (1974–1981), ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (1981–1984), ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'' (1984–1987) and ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' (1989–1990). She subsequently developed numerous shows in her job as VP of tape programs for New World Entertainment.

Bunim founded Bunim-Murray with business partner [[Jonathan Murray]]. Agent Mark Itkin of the William Morris Agency put the two together to develop a scripted soap opera for MTV. When that was too expensive, they decided to try an unscripted soap and ''The Real World'' was born. "We knew within 20 minutes of shooting that we had a show," Bunim said.

Her company, [[Bunim/Murray Productions]], spearheaded the [[reality television|reality show]] genre. Among the numerous other reality programs and reality game show programs that Bunim co-created over the years, include: ''Road Rules''; ''Love Cruise''; ''Making the Band''; ''[[The Challenge (TV series)|The Challenge]]'' (formerly known as ''Real World/Road Rules Challenge'' and spun off from ''The Real World'' and ''Road Rules''); the reality feature film, ''[[The Real Cancun]]''; the real-life daily syndication, ''[[Starting Over (TV series)|Starting Over]]''; as well as Fox's ''[[The Simple Life]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

==Death==
Bunim died in Los Angeles at 57, after a lengthy battle with [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/30/obit.bunim/index.html|title='Real World' co-creator dies|date=January 31, 2004|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/reality-tv-s-founder-producer-bunim-dies-1117899295/ ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Bunim and Murray were inducted into the [[Television Academy Hall of Fame]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flaherty |first1=Mike |title=Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray: Hall of Fame Tribute |url=https://www.emmys.com/news/hall-fame/mary-ellis-bunim-jonathan-murray-hall-fame-tribute |accessdate=July 10, 2018 |publisher=[[Emmys]] |date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nadia Davids grew up in Cape Town, South Africa.

In June 2008, she received a [[PhD]] in Drama from the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT) for her [[thesis]] entitled "Inherited Memories; Performing the Archive", which explored the history, memory and trauma of forced removals from [[District Six]] under the [[Group Areas Act]] during the [[Apartheid]] era in South Africa, through the lens of performance.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

She held a [[Mellon Fellowship]] between 2000 and 2005, and was a Visiting Scholar at [[UC Berkeley]] (2001) and [[New York University]] (2004–05).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wicombandthetranslocal.wordpress.com/speakers/nadia-davids/ "Zoe Wicomb and the Translocal: Scotland and South Africa"] (13 September 2012), University of York.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was one of ten playwrights participating in the New York-based [[Women's Project Theater]]’s Playwrights' Lab for 2008–10.&lt;ref name=women&gt;[http://wptheater.org/lab/playwrights/ Playwrights], Women's Project Theater.&lt;/ref&gt;

She took up a full-time lecturing position in the Drama Department at the [[Queen Mary University of London]] in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sed.qmul.ac.uk/staff/davidsn.html "Dr Nadia Davids, PhD (Cape Town), Lecturer in Drama"], Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Davids was elected president of PEN South Africa, taking over tenure from [[Margie Orford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pensouthafrica.co.za/nadia-davids-and-members-of-the-board-thank-margie-orford/|title=Nadia Davids and Members of the Board Thank Margie Orford {{!}} PEN South Africa|last=LindsayC|website=pensouthafrica.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Davids’ research sits at a nexus between Postcolonial Studies, Performance Studies and Live Performance. Her work contributes to the performative reimagining of South African archives and stages questions around trauma, cultural memory, the (im)materiality of the archive, of race, place and gender. Through themes of place, home, exile, resistance, and restitution, she examine material loss, engage with performative tactics of re-construction of place through memory, and suggest an ideological flow between oral history, witnessing, and theatre. She reference different contexts in which these experiences have been formed — [[District Six]], slavery, colonialism, apartheid, immigration, post-9/11 racial/ethnic profiling, interstitial creolized identity formation-through various creative practices: theatre, short stories, documentary and screenplays. In this, she disrupts the assumed boundary between theoretical and practical work, insisting instead on a relationship of reciprocal intellectual and creative exchange.
Her work is disseminated through a variety of forms (journal articles, live performances, published play texts, film documentaries, a novel) to a range of audiences (commercial, academic/educational).

''At Her Feet'' (2002–12) — a one-woman show centred on Cape Muslim women’s identities post 9/11 performed by acclaimed South African actor [[Quanita Adams]], and ''Cissie'' (2008–11) — a play exploring feminist biography, the historiography of District Six, and archival storytelling through the theatrical imagining of anti-apartheid activist [[Cissie Gool]]’s life - serve as good examples. Both works have garnered theatre awards and nominations (five [[Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards]], one [[Noma Award|Noma]], one Naledi), and have been staged internationally (in Africa, Europe, the United States at venues such as [[Market Theatre (Johannesburg)|Market Theatre]], [[Baxter Theatre]], [[Southbank Centre]], and at the [[National Arts Festival|Grahamstown National Arts Festival]], Afrovibes, and the [[London Book Fair]]). The plays are studied at a range of universities (University of Cape Town, [[Stanford]], [[New York University]], [[SOAS]], [[University of Warwick]] and [[York University]]) and are high-school set-works throughout South Africa. They are understood within these contexts as opening up unexpected spaces in which the lives of South African — specifically Muslim Cape Tonian — women, assume the central focus. 
''At Her Feet'' was one of the first theatrical works to emerge in response to 9/11 and one of the only plays that narrates the lives of Cape Tonian Muslim women.

Davids was awarded a [[Philip Leverhulme Prize]] for her current research on Prestwich Place, a slave-burial ground Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sed.qmul.ac.uk/newsevents/news/items/116056.html "Leverhulme Success for our Academics"], Queen Mary University of London, 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her play ''At Her Feet'' was first performed at the Arena Theatre, Cape Town, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchpublications.qmul.ac.uk/publications/staff/25196.html Publications: Nadia Davids], Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-10-12-bristling-energy "Bristling energy"], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 12 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moira Richards, [http://www.womenwriters.net/spring07/at_her_feet1.htm (Spring 2007) "Review: ''At Her Feet''"], Women Writers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muslims&gt;[http://framingmuslims.org/related-events/235-at-her-feet-by-nadia-davids-southbank-centre-london-3-5-october-2012.html {{"'}}At Her Feet' by Nadia Davids, Southbank Centre London, 3–5 October 2012"], ''Framing Muslims'', 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Seddon, [http://www.oulitnet.co.za/teater/atherfeet.asp "''At Her Feet'' is enlightening, deserves to be seen"], LitNet, 30 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her play ''Cissie'', about the life and memory of Cape Town activist [[Cissie Gool]], debuted at the National Arts Festival in [[Grahamstown]] in July 2008.

''At Her Feet'' and ''Cissie'' are studied at a number of universities including [[University of Cape Town|UCT]], [[University of the Western Cape|UWC]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[UCLA]] and [[SOAS]].

Her first novel, ''An Imperfect Blessing'', was published in April 2014 by Random House Struik-Umuzi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://umuzi.bookslive.co.za/blog/2013/10/02/umuzi-acquires-acclaimed-playwright-nadia-davids-debut-novel-an-imperfect-blessing/ "Umuzi Acquires Acclaimed Playwright Nadia Davids’ Debut Novel, ''An Imperfect Blessing''"], ''Books Live'', 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in December 2014 was announced as one of three books shortlisted for the [[Etisalat Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://prize.etisalat.com.ng/2014-shortlist-announced/ "2014 Shortlist Announced"], Etisalat Prize for Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabinews.com/the-etisalat-prize-is-a-real-force-for-good-nadia-davids/ "The Etisalat Prize is a real force for good – Nadia Davids"], ''Sabi News'', 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was longlisted for the Sunday Times Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2015/04/06/the-2015-sunday-times-barry-ronge-fiction-prize-longlist/ "The 2015 Sunday Times Barry Ronge Fiction Prize Longlist"], Books Live, 6 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortlisted for the UJ Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookslive.co.za/blog/2015/05/18/the-shortlists-for-the-20142015-university-of-johannesburg-prizes-for-south-african-writing-english/ "The Shortlists for the 2014/2015 University of Johannesburg Prizes for South African Writing (English)"], Books Live, 18 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most recent play ''What Remains'', about slavery, the Cape, the haunted city, and the now, was staged at the Arena Theater in Cape Town in April 2016. It was directed by Jay Pather and featured [[Quanita Adams]], Faniswa Yisa, Shaun Oelf and Ameera Conrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/south-africa/article/UCT-Drama-Showcases-New-Nadia-Davids-Play-WHAT-REMAINS-at-the-Arena-Theatre-20160414|title=UCT Drama Showcases New Nadia Davids Play WHAT REMAINS at the Arena Theatre|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|date=14 April 2016 |access-date=3 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nakhchivan Buzkhana''' is an ice-house located in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]].  It is one of the largest [[Ice house (building)|ice-houses]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. The ice-house is located on the southern side of the city of Nakhchivan, also near the [[Imamzadeh complex in Nakhchivan|Imamzadeh complex]]. There is also another ice-house with similar architectural structure in [[Ordubad]], Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=" impnakhchivanaz"/&gt; There are different ideas on date of built of the ice-house. Academician A.Salamzadeh and K.Mammadzade proclaims that the buzkhana was built in the beginning of XIV century. But it is also accepted that it was built during the reign of Shah Abbas in the XVII century. According to Arif Azizov, the honored architect of the Autonomous Republic and director of the Nakhchivan Scientific-Restoration Production Department, the ice-houses were built on the banks of the rivers historically. &lt;ref name="anl"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan buzxanası|url= http://www.anl.az/down/meqale/azerbaycan/azerbaycan_mart2009/71356.htm|publisher= anl.az |language= az|accessdate=8 February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; 
==Design==
The monument is in rectangular form. Its length is 20 meters, width is 9 meters, and height is 9.6 meters. A ventilation system was installated. It allowed the use of ice reserves efficiently in summer.&lt;ref name="anl"/&gt; There are six small domes on the roof. Typical features of the Nakhchivan ice-house are natural construction from bricks, the light and dynamic design scheme.&lt;ref name=" impnakhchivanaz"/&gt;  
The ice was destroyed as a result of intensive erosion. In 2013, it was restored by the instruction of the Chairman of the Supreme Assembly of the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].&lt;ref name="impnakhchivanaz"/&gt;

In ancient times, local residents used ice-houses to protect themselves and their personal food products against heat in summer.&lt;ref name="impnakhchivanaz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan şəhər buzxanası|url= http://imp.nakhchivan.az/index.php/asagi-slayd/89-naxc-van-s-h-r-buzxanas|publisher= imp.nakhchivan.az |language= az|accessdate=8 February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Ice was made during winter months. Drinking water of the river was shed into the cellar to make it ice. Usage of straw was protecting melt of the ice.&lt;ref name="naxcivantv"&gt;{{cite web|title= Naxçıvan inciləri: Buzxanalar-Fotolar |url= http://naxcivantv.az/index.php/x-b-rl-r/940-buzxana.html|publisher= naxcivantv.az|language= az|accessdate=8 February 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century local residents started using refrigerators in their houses, which decreased the use of ice-houses.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Peter Max''' (born '''Peter Max Finkelstein''', October 19, 1937) is an American artist known for using bright colours in his work.  Works by Max are associated with the visual arts and culture of the [[1960s]], particularly [[psychedelic art]] and [[pop art]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
In 1938, Max's parents fled [[Berlin]], Germany, his place of birth, to escape the fomenting Nazi movement, settling in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], where they lived for the next ten years. In 1948, the family moved to [[Haifa]], [[Israel]] where they lived for several years. From Israel, the family continued moving westward and stopped in [[Paris]] for several months—an experience that Max said greatly influenced his appreciation for art.

===1950s===
Max and his parents first settled in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn]] in 1953 where he attended [[Lafayette High School (New York City)|Lafayette High School]], where he was classmates with future actor [[Paul Sorvino]]. In 1956, Max began his formal art training at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Manhattan]], studying anatomy, figure drawing and composition under [[Frank J. Reilly]] who had studied at the League alongside [[Norman Rockwell]].&lt;ref name='ArtofPeterMax'&gt;{{cite book | last = Riley II | first = Charles A. | authorlink = Charles A.

===1960s===
In 1962, Max started a small Manhattan arts studio known as "The Daly &amp; Max Studio," with friend [[Thomas Aquinas Daly|Tom Daly]]. Daly and Max were joined by friend and mentor [[Don Rubbo]], and the three worked as a group on books and advertising for which they received industry recognition. Much of their work incorporated antique photographic images as elements of collage. Max's interest in astronomy contributed to his self-described "Cosmic '60s" period, which featured what became identified as psychedelic, counter culture imagery. Max's art was popularized nationally through TV commercials such as his 1968 "un cola" ad for the soft drink [[7-Up]] which helped drive sales of his art posters and other merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8-eLMuCdfI |title='&amp;#39;7-Up video'&amp;#39; |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Max invited [[Satchidananda Saraswati]] to New York in 1966{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} for a two-day visit which turned into a permanent residence for Satchidananda, who became surrounded by many students who formed Integral Yoga International.

Max appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' on August 15, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;"Television Log," Long Beach (CA) Press Telegram, 15 August 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; He was featured on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]]'s September 5, 1969 edition under with the heading "Peter Max: Portrait of the artist as a very rich man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=1969 June 6 Life Magazine - The Moon - Edward Villella |url=http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1790 |title='&amp;#39;Life Magazine Cover'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lifemagazineconnection.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128080414/http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1790 |archivedate=2013-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, many of Max's products and posters were featured in the exhibition "The World of Peter Max," which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_world_of_Peter_Max.html?id=Z0ZOAAAAYAAJ |title='&amp;#39;The World of Peter Max exhibition'&amp;#39; |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Postal Service]] commissioned Max to create the 10-cent postage stamp to commemorate the [[Expo '74]] World's Fair in [[Spokane]], Washington, and Max drew a colorful psychedelic scene with a "Cosmic Jumper" and a "Smiling Sage" against a backdrop of a cloud, sun rays and a ship at sea on the theme of "Preserve the Environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iqzero.net and Dick Sine |url=http://usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=301eaf56af1c4d75326e4d40eeea8153a89ce7f5 |title='&amp;#39;Expo 74 Postage Stamp'&amp;#39; |publisher=Usstampgallery.com |date=1974-04-18 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 4, 1976, Max began his [[Statue of Liberty]] series leading to his efforts with [[Chrysler]] CEO [[Lee Iacocca]] to help in the restoration of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-11-12/entertainment/os-ppl-peter-max-in-orlando-20101108_1_statue-of-liberty-painting-lady-liberty-pop-artist-peter-max |title='&amp;#39;Statue of Liberty series'&amp;#39; |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, "Peter Max Paints America" was commissioned by the ASEA of Sweden. The book project commemorated the [[United States Bicentennial]] and included the following foreword: "Peter Max Paints America is based on works of art commissioned by ASEA of Sweden on the 200th anniversary of the founding of the United States of America, in sincere recognition of the historic bonds of friendship between the people of Sweden and the people of the United States, recalling that Sweden was one of the first countries to extend its hand in friendship to the new nation."&lt;ref name='PeterMaxPaintsAmerica'&gt;{{cite book | last = Zurbel | first = Victor | authorlink = Victor Zurbel | coauthors = | title = Peter Max Paints America | publisher = Acropolis Books Ltd., New York | year = 1976 |edition= 1st | location = | page = 1 | isbn = 0-87491-042-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Max's art work was first associated with the [[Counterculture|counter culture]], [[Neo-Expressionism|neo-expressionism]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfineartgallery.com/artists/max/max_bio.html|title=Peter Max (German/American, b. 1937)|publisher=American Fine Art Editions, Inc.|accessdate=22 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223065912/http://www.americanfineartgallery.com/artists/max/max_bio.html|archivedate=23 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Psychedelic movement#In popular culture|psychedelic movement]]s in graphic design during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He is known for using bursts of color, often containing much or all of the visible spectrum. His work was influenced by others. Max's repeated claims, varying in detail, to have worked on [[Yellow Submarine (film)|''Yellow Submarine'']] have been denied by the production team.&lt;ref&gt;Hieronimus, Robert R.

Max works in multiple media including painting, drawing, etchings (including aquatint), collage, print making, sculpture, video and digital imagery. He also includes "mass media" as being another "canvas" for his creative expression.&lt;ref name="ArtofPeterMax"/&gt;

Max often uses American icons and symbols in his artwork. He has created paintings of presidents [[Gerald Ford|Ford]], [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] in addition to his ''100 Clintons''—a multiple portrait installation. Additional commissions have included the creation of the first "Preserve the Environment" postage stamp, in honor of the World's Fair in Spokane, WA, border murals at the entry points Canada and Mexico by the US General Services, and exhibitions in over 40 museums and 50 galleries worldwide.,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He often features images of celebrities, politicians, athletes and sporting events and other pop culture subjects in his artwork.&lt;ref name="ArtofPeterMax"/&gt;

One of [[Continental Airlines]]' [[Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft (registered N77014) sported a livery designed by Max.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Max Collector|url=http://www.themaxcollector.com/2010/08/continental.html|publisher=Themaxcollector.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His artwork was featured on CBS's ''[[The Early Show]]'' where his "44 Obamas," commemorating [[Barack Obama]], the 44th President of the United States, was debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3682403n|title=Painter Peter Max At Work|publisher=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper Collins in 2013 published a book of the artist's memoirs and thoughts called ''The Universe of Peter Max''. In it, he relates stories of his life as well as descriptions and thoughts surrounding of some of his artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Universe of Peter Max|last = Max|first = Peter|publisher = Harper Design|year = 2013|asin = B007679EDY|location = United States|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Max is an [[environmentalist]], [[veganism|vegan]] and supporter of [[human rights|human]] and [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Eric|title=Peter Max Receives Preserve Putnam Award|url=http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2009-09-24/Enterpise/Peter_Max_Receives_Preserve_Putnam_Award.html|publisher=Putnam County Courier|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218001023/http://www.putnamcountycourier.com/news/2009-09-24/Enterpise/Peter_Max_Receives_Preserve_Putnam_Award.html|archivedate=18 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Jolia|title=One on One With Peter Max|url=http://www.vegetariantimes.com/features/901|publisher=Vegetarian Times|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011052349/http://www.vegetariantimes.com/features/901|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Max had a nine-year-long relationship with musician and model [[Rosie Vela]] that ended in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pooley |first=Eric |date=Nov 3, 1986 |title=Facing The Music |journal=New York Magazine  |publisher=New York Media, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1997, Max pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal district court to charges of concealing more than $1.1 million in income from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with the sales of his works between 1988 and 1991. The plea came two days before he was to go on trial on an 11-count conspiracy and tax fraud indictment. Under the deal, he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS and a charge of tax evasion, telling a federal judge that he had taken payments in cash, deposited customers' checks into his personal account and arranged other transactions to avoid tax liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/11/nyregion/pop-artist-peter-max-pleads-guilty-to-charges-of-tax-fraud.html|title=Pop Artist Peter Max Pleads Guilty to Charges of Tax Fraud|date=11 November 1997|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, he was sentenced to two months in prison and a $30,000 fine.

In 2002, Max contributed to rescue efforts for [[Cincinnati Freedom]], a cow that escaped from an Ohio slaughterhouse. The cow jumped over a six-foot fence while the slaughterhouse workers were on break and eluded capture for eleven days. Max donated $180,000 worth of his art to benefit the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, part of a chain of events which finally led to the cow being sent to Farm Sanctuary in [[Watkins Glen, New York]], a permanent home where the cow remained for the rest of its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Cincinnati Freedom: The Legendary Cow Who Escaped a Slaughterhouse|url=https://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/remembering-cincinnati-freedom-the-legendary-cow-who-escaped-a-slaughterhouse/|publisher=onegreenplanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max lives in [[New York City]] and has two adult children, Adam Cosmo Max and Libra Astro Max.

The '''history of photography in Japan''' begins in the 19th century and has continued to be a prominent art form into the present era.

==19th-century photography==

===Importation of Photography===
[[File:Shimazu by ichiki.jpg|thumb|240px|Ichiki's [[daguerreotype]] of [[Shimazu Nariakira]], the earliest surviving Japanese photograph]]
In 1848 (Edo era), a camera for daguerréotype was imported by a Dutch ship to Japan (Nagasaki, 長崎).  It is said that this was the first camera in Japan.  During Edo era, the import and the export had been prohibited (''sakoku'', 鎖国) by the Edo Government (''Edobakufu'', 江戸幕府), except that only Dutch ships had been permitted to export and import various goods at Nagasaki Port.  Therefore, the first camera was introduced at Nagasaki.  This camera was imported by Ueno Toshinojō (1790–1851, 上野俊之丞) and in 1849 passed to [[Shimazu Nariakira]] (1809–1858, 島津斉彬), who later would become a feudal lord (''[[daimyō]],'' 大名) of [[Satsuma Domain]] (薩摩藩, now ''Kagoshima-ken'').

In Satsuma Domain, detailed study with respect to photography had been done, but it took almost ten years from the acquisition of the first camera to taking the first photograph.  In 1857, SHIMAZU Nariakira's photograph was taken by [[Ichiki Shirō]] (1828–1903, 市来四郎) and UJUKU Hikoemon (宇宿彦右衛門) (daguerréotype).  This is said to be the first photograph taken by Japanese and still exist and can be seen at ''Shōko Shūseikan'' (尚古集成館, Kagoshima-city, Japan).

[[File:Ueno Hikoma.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait of Ueno Hikoma, c. 1870s]]
In 1854, [[Convention of Kanagawa]] (日米和親条約, ''Nichi-Bei Washin Jōyaku'', "America-Japan Treaty of Amity and Friendship") was concluded between U.S. and Japan, [[Anglo-Japanese Friendship Treaty]] (日英和親条約, ''Nichi-Ei Washin Jōyaku'') was concluded between Britain and Japan, and [[Treaty of Shimoda]] (日露和親条約, ''Nichi-Ro Washin Jōyaku'') was concluded between Russia and Japan.  The treaties opened the Japanese ports of Shimoda (in Shizuoka Prefecture), Hakodate (in Hokkaido Prefecture) and Nagasaki to the trade.  In 1858, [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States – Japan)]] (日米修好通商条約).was concluded between U.S. and Japan and opened the port of Kanagawa, but soon the port of Yokohama (横浜), which is close to Kanagawa, opened for the trade with foreign countries in exchange to the port of Kanagawa.  The trade based on these treties began in 1858 at Yokohama, Nagasaki and Hakodate.  This is called ''Kaikoku'' (開国, to open the nation for foreign countries and trades) in Japanese language.  Thanks to ''Kaikoku'', more and more cameras and other photography-related equipment and materials had been imported to Japan.  Further some foreign photographers, such as [[Felix Beato]] came to Japan and took many photographs of Japan.

In 1862, [[Ueno Hikoma]] (1838–1904, 上野彦馬) opened his photo studio in Nagasaki and [[Shimooka Renjo]] (1823–1914, 下岡蓮杖) opened his photo studio in Noge (野毛, soon later included within Yokohama), in the same year, but independently. The open of these two photo studios for portraits indicated the new era of Japanese photography.

===Professional Photographers in Meiji Era===

After the opening of Ueno Studio and Shimooka Studio, around the turning point between Edo Era and Meiji Era (1868), several new photo studios were opened, such as that of [[Kuichi Uchida]] (1844–1875, 内田九一) in 1865 in Osaka and in 1866 moved to Yokohama, that of Yohei Hori (or HORI Masumi, 1826–1880, 堀与兵衛 (堀真澄)) in 1865 in Kyoto, that of Kōkichi Kizu (1830–1895, 木津幸吉) in 1866 in Hakodate, that of [[Rihei Tomishige]] (1837–1922, 冨重利平) in Yanagawa, Chikugo in 1866 and that of [[Yokoyama Matsusaburō]] (1838–1884, 横山松三郎).

[[File:Meiji Emperor.jpg|thumb|Portrait of the Meiji Emperor (御真影) by Uchida Kuichi, 1873. Albumen silver print]]
Among these photographers (Shishin-shi, 写真師), Uchida Kuichi is most famous for his photographs of Meiji Emperor (明治天皇) in 1872 and 1873, which photographs have been called Goshin'ei (御真影) and were used as public portraits of Meiji Emperor.  "真(shin)" means "true" and "影(ei)" means "(photographic) image" or "portrait" and "御(go)" means honorific prefix for "真影".  In Meiji Era, only very limited persons, such as prime ministers, could meet Meiji Emperor in person and most Japanese people in Meiji Era had no chance to see Meiji Emperor.  But Meiji Emperor's image was necessary for him to govern Japan and Japanese nations.  Therefore, Meiji Government prepared "御真影" and used "御真影" for Emperor's governance and Meiji Government's governance.

As other photographers, Kakoku Shima (1827–1870島霞谷) and [[Ryū Shima]] (1823–1899,  島隆) should be mentioned. They were a husband and a wife and began taking photography together around 1863 or 1864, and Ryū Shima was called the first woman professional photographer.

Further, around the 1860s and 1900, Yokohama-shashin (Yokohama Photo, Photographs selling or distributing in Yokohama, 横浜写真) was very popular.  Yokohama-shashin was a photograph of Japanese scenery, Japanese people (especially Japanese women) and Japanese cultures and a very widely used souvenir especially for foreign people.  Among photographers for Yokohama-shashin, [[Felix Beato]] and [[Kusakabe Kimbei]] (1841–1934, 日下部金兵衛) were very famous.

Because of Kaikoku, many foreign people came to Japan.  Further, after Meiji Ishin (Meiji Government was established in 1868), many Japanese were able to travel within Japan without breaking laws and began to travel within Japan.  Yokohama was a suitable place to visit both for foreign people and Japanese people, and Yokohama-shashin attracted such travellers very much.

Two main characteristics of Yokohama-shashin were;
#a well-decorated album-style photographs, and
#hand-colored photographs.

But towards the end of the 19th century, picture post cards, which were much cheaper than Yokohama-shashin, became very popular and were widely used in Japan, and many amateur photographers were emerging, who liked to take pictures by themselves than to buy expensive Yokohama-shashin.  These were the major reasons for Yokohama-shashin to decline.

In the 1880s, photographers in a new generation and new types began their activities.  [[Reiji Esaki]] (1845–1910, 江崎礼二), who took photographs of experimental torpedo explosion in Sumida river in 1883, and [[Kazuma Ogawa]] (1860–1929, 小川一眞), who not only took photographs but also was the managers of a printing factory, were particularly famous among them.

In the 1860s and 1870s, many photographs of Hokkaidō were taken, which photographs are called Hokkaidō Kaitaku Shashin (Photographs of Developments in Hokkaidō, 北海道開拓写真).  In the 1860s and 1870s, Hokkaidō was under the development by the Japanese Government.  The Government in Tokyo needed detailed reports of the development in writing, and they thought reports with photographs should be better and the Government requested some photographers to take photographs of the development in Hokkaidō.  Such photographers included [[Tamoto Kenzō]] (1832–1912, 田本研造), Kōkichi Ida (1846–1911, 井田侾吉), Raimund von Stillfried-Ratenicz (1839–1911), [[Seiichi Takebayashi]] (1842–1908, 武林盛一) and [[Sakuma Hanzō]] (1844–1897, 佐久間範造).

===Emerging Amateur Photographers===
Around the middle of the 1880s, photographers (写真師) began to use gelatin dry plates very widely.  Before the spread of gelatin dry plates, the wet collodion process (湿式コロジオン法) was ordinary process for photography in Japan and to use this process was very difficult in technical points and also it costs a considerable sum of money.  It means almost no amateur photographers can exist without gelatin dry plates.

Two famous examples of earliest amateur photographers in Japan were as follows;
*[[Kamei Koreaki]] (1861–1896, 亀井茲明), who was a count and studied aesthetics in England and Germany, took photographs of the Sino-Japanese War (日清戦争) in 1895.
*[[Kashima Seibei|Kajima Seibei]] (1866–1924, 鹿島清兵衛) took many photographs in the 1890s, such as a life-size portrait of Manzaburō Umewaka (NO (能) actor) and a big-size photograph of Mt. Fuji.

Wide spread of gelatin dry plates and small-sized cameras led to the era of prominent amateur photographers in the 20th century in Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10727">[[Image:Pierre Lévy.jpg|250px|thumb|Pierre Lévy]]
'''Pierre Lévy''' ({{IPA-fr|levi|lang}}; born 1956 in [[Tunis]]) is a [[French people|French]] philosopher, [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]] and [[media scholar]] who specializes in the understanding of the cultural and cognitive implications of digital technologies and the phenomenon of human collective intelligence.

He introduced the [[collective intelligence]] concept in his 1994 book ''L'intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace'' (''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'').&lt;ref&gt;L'intelligence collective. Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace, Paris, La Découverte, 1994 ({{ISBN|2-7071-2693-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy's 1995 book, ''Qu'est-ce que le virtuel?'' (translated as ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'') develops philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s conception of "the virtual" as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001, he wrote the  book ''Cyberculture''.

Pierre Lévy currently teaches at the communication department of the [[University of Ottawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032913/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and received several awards and academic distinctions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Life and work==
Pierre Lévy is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of [[cyberspace]] and digital communications. Lévy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''.&lt;ref&gt;''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'' {{ISBN|0-7382-0261-4}} Perseus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1990 Lévy published a book about the merging of digital networks and [[Hypertext|hypertextual]] communication. Levy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates [[wikinomics]], and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Pierre|title=Collective Intelligence|year=1997|publisher=Plenium Trade|location=New York and London|isbn=0306456354|pages=215–220|quote=.  In the fourth space, "the subject of knowledge is shaped by its encyclopedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1998 Lévy was Professor at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis|University of Paris VIII]], where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about [[cyberculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Terry|title=Thinking at the Edge of the Galaxy: Pierre Levy's World Projection|journal=Boundary|year=1999|volume=2|series=26|issue=3|pages=63–85|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/journals/boundary/v026/26.3cochran.html|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Revue virtuelle]]'' project of the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the chapter [[Interactivity]] from his book ''Cyberculture'' (2001), Lévy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that [[interactivity]] is a vague term that "has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system".&lt;ref&gt;Lévy, Pierre. "Cyberculture". Univ. of Minnesota Press. 2001, p. 228. ({{ISBN|0816636109}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'' Lévy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from [[real time (media)]] interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Current project==
Lévy's current project focuses on the development of an [[Information Economy MetaLanguage]] (IEML) for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for [[semantic]] addressing of digital documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032920/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Álvaro |first=Sandra |url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_ieml-projecte-per-a-un-nou-humanisme-entrevista-a-pierre-levy/ |title=IEML: A PROJECT FOR A NEW HUMANISM.

==Influences==
While a work of creative fiction, the series is "heavily inspired by" [[Jennie Livingston]]'s 1990 documentary, ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/columns/pose-fx-season-finale-mother-of-the-year-1202880972/ |title=The Revolutionary Happiness of ''Pose'' |last=Framke |first=Caroline |date=July 23, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=September 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the houses and characters are based on, or named after, real people, and several people featured in the documentary also make cameos in the series, such as [[Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza]], the inventor of [[voguing]], who plays a judge on the pilot episode, and Sol Pendavis Williams, of the House of Pendavis.&lt;ref name="Venable"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/pose-fx-paris-is-burning/|title=The Mind-Blowing 1990 Documentary You Must See Before Watching ''Pose'' |last=Venable |first=Malcolm |date=May 29, 2018 |work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators and producers of the series such as "Murphy, Canals and writer/producer Janet Mock all consider ''Paris Is Burning'' a text that helped inform not only the show, but also their identities when they first saw it."&lt;ref name="Venable"/&gt;

{{quote|''Pose'' also expands on one of ''Paris Is Burning''{{'}}s subtler themes. At various points in the film, Livingston contrasts the drag performers with ordinary, affluent New Yorkers, walking down busy Manhattan sidewalks. It’s often hard to tell which of these two groups is more “real”, which of them are fashion models or Wall Street power players and which are simply costumed as such. Pose elaborates on those subtle distinctions with a subplot involving Stan (Evan Peters), a rising star in the Trump organization with an obnoxious boss (James Van Der Beek), a pretty wife (Kate Mara), and a secret relationship with Angel (Indya Moore), a trans woman. The show aims to capture some of the diversity of New York in the ’80s, while also emphasizing the idea that, whether rich or poor, everyone in the city is pretending, in one way or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17416736/paris-is-burning-ryan-murphy-pose-netflix-streaming-recommendation |title=Get ready for Ryan Murphy’s ''Pose'' by watching ''Paris is Burning'' this weekend |last=Murray |first=Noel |date=June 1, 2018 |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=September 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

''Voguing and the House Ballroom Scene of New York'' by Chantal Regnault is also an inspiration for the series.{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{or|date=November 2018}} It was first published by Soul Jazz Books in 2011, and reprinted in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Regnault |first1=Chantal |title=Voguing and the House Ballroom Scene of New York |date=2011 |publisher=Soul Jazz Books |isbn=9780955481765 |url=https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr/product/voguing-voguing-and-the-house-ballroom-scene-of-new-york-city-1989-92-photographs-by-chantal-regnault-introduction-by-tim-lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The series has been met with a positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds a 97% approval rating with an average rating of 7.67 out of 10 based on 60 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Charged with energy, poise, and confidence, ''Pose'' pirouettes between artistic opulence and deliciously soapy drama to create a fresh new addition to Ryan Murphy's lexicon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/pose/s01|title=Pose: Season 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 75 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/pose|title= Pose: Season 1|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a positive review, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}}s Richard Lawson was effusive describing the series as "an engaging portrait of dark days met with merriment. Pain and perseverance are sewn together to create something humble yet fabulous—and, it should be shouted over all the show’s loud and glorious clamor, very much long overdue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Richard |title=''Pose'' Is Bold, Necessary Melodrama |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/pose-fx-ryan-murphy-review |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=September 29, 2018 |date=May 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similarly favorable critique, ''Vulture''{{'}}s Matt Zoller Seitz praised the series' ambition, aesthetic, and spotlight on minorities saying, "it shows American audiences a world that has never been visualized on television at this length and at such an obviously grand budget level. The camera swings and swoops, glides and tumbles as in a [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]] epic like ''[[Gangs of New York]]''; in both the outdoor street scenes and indoor crowd scenes, it’s obvious that FX has spared no expense to get the clothes, the cars, the streets, the business signs, and even the distinctive yellow-brown glow of streetlights correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Seitz |first1=Matt Zoller |title=''Pose'' Is the Culmination of Ryan Murphy’s Entire Career |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/06/pose-fx-review.html |website=Vulture |accessdate=September 29, 2018 |date=June 5, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more mixed assessment, ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s gave the series two-and-a-half stars out of four and described it far less approvingly saying, "good intentions don't always lead to good TV, and a couple episodes in, that appears to be the case with ''Pose''. This certainly isn't bad TV — Murphy isn't about to leave his longtime home with a turkey — but it's often bland TV, and oddly enough, stock TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gay |first1=Verne |title=''Pose'': Formulaic drama, despite innovative casting |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/pose-review-1.18831003 |website=[[Newsday]] |accessdate=September 29, 2018 |date=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a negative evaluation, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Willa Paskin was outright dismissive saying, "It's a TV show from one of the most canny creators working today, yet as a viewing experience it can feel like an object lesson." He continued on specifically criticizing the show's character development saying, "So many of the people on ''Pose'' are strong women, trans paragons, and this comes at the expense of them being recognizably flawed human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paskin |first1=Willa |title=Ryan Murphy’s ''Pose'' Has Fallen Into the "Strong Character" Trap |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/05/ryan-murphys-pose-reviewed.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=September 29, 2018 |date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensibility''' refers to an acute [[perception]] of or responsiveness toward something, such as the [[emotion]]s of another.  This concept emerged in eighteenth-century Britain, and was closely associated with studies of [[sense perception]] as the means through which knowledge is gathered. It also became associated with [[sentimentality|sentimental]] [[moral philosophy]].

==Origins==
One of the first of such texts would be [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690), where he says, "I conceive that Ideas in the Understanding, are coeval with Sensation; which is such an Impression or Motion, made in some part of the Body, as makes it be taken notice of in the Understanding."&lt;ref&gt;J. Locke, An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding (London, 1690), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Cheyne (physician)|George Cheyne]] and other medical writers wrote of "The English Malady," also called "[[hysteria]]" in women or "[[hypochondria]]" in men, a condition with symptoms that closely resemble the modern diagnosis of [[clinical depression]]. Cheyne considered this malady to be the result of over-taxed nerves.  At the same time, theorists asserted that individuals who had ultra-sensitive nerves would have keener senses, and thus be more aware of beauty and moral truth. Thus, while it was considered a physical and/or emotional fragility, sensibility was also widely perceived as a virtue.

==In literature==
Originating in philosophical and scientific writings, sensibility became an English-language literary movement, particularly in the then-new genre of the novel. Such works, called sentimental novels, featured individuals who were prone to sensibility, often weeping, fainting, feeling weak, or having fits in reaction to an emotionally moving experience. If one were especially sensible, one might react this way to scenes or objects that appear insignificant to others. This reactivity was considered an indication of a sensible person's ability to perceive something intellectually or emotionally stirring in the world around them. However, the popular sentimental genre soon met with a strong backlash, as anti-sensibility readers and writers contended that such extreme behavior was mere histrionics, and such an emphasis on one's own feelings and reactions a sign of [[narcissism]]. [[Samuel Johnson]], in his portrait of Miss Gentle, articulated this criticism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
She daily exercises her benevolence by pitying every misfortune that happens to every family within her circle of notice; she is in hourly terrors lest one should catch cold in the rain, and another be frighted by the high wind. Her charity she shews by lamenting that so many poor wretches should languish in the streets, and by wondering what the great can think on that they do so little good with such large estates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Samuel. ''[[The Idler (1758–1760)|The Idler]]'', No. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
Objections to sensibility emerged on other fronts.  For one, some conservative thinkers believed in ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' concepts, that is, knowledge that exists independent of experience, such as innate knowledge believed to be imparted by God.  Theorists of the ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' distrusted sensibility because of its over-reliance on experience for knowledge.  Also, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, anti-sensibility thinkers often associated the emotional volatility of sensibility with the exuberant violence of the French Revolution, and in response to fears of revolution coming to Britain, sensible figures were coded as anti-patriotic or even politically subversive.  [[Maria Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Leonora (novel)|Leonora]],'' for example, depicts the "sensible" Olivia as a villainess who contrives her passions or at least bends them to suit her selfish wants; the text also makes a point to say that Olivia has lived in France and thus adopted "French" manners.  [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' provides a more familiar example of this reaction against the excesses of feeling, especially those associated with women readers, and many critics have seen the novel as a critique of the "cult" of sentimentalism prevalent in the late eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sensibility: An introduction|last = Todd|first = Janet|publisher = Methuen|year = 1986|isbn = 9780416377200|location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effusive nature of many sentimental heroes, such as Harley in [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''[[The Man of Feeling]],'' was often decried by contemporary critics as celebrating a weak, effeminate character, which ultimately contributed to a discrediting of previously popular sentimental novels (and to a lesser extent, ''all'' novels) as unmanly works. This concern coincided with a marked rise in the production of novels by women writers of the period, whether they chose to write in a sentimental mode or not, and played a significant role in larger debates about gender, genre, literary value, and nationalist political aims during the last decade of the eighteenth century and the first decades of the nineteenth, when the "National Tale" emerged in the wake of the French Revolution and England's ongoing conflict—and highly fraught Union—with Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Equivocal Beings: Politics, Gender, and Sentimentality in the 1790s--Wollstonecraft, Radcliffe, Burney, Austen.|last = Johnson|first = Claudia|publisher = Chicago UP|year = 1995|isbn = 978-0226401843|location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bardic Nationalism: The Romantic Novel and the British Empire|last = Trumpener|first = Katie|publisher = Princeton UP|year = 1997|isbn = 978-0691044804|location = Princeton|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Southampton]] Operatic Society began life in 1924 as the Guild of the Above Bar Congregational Church and is the oldest musical society in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sotonopera.org/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512005017/http://www.sotonopera.org/history.html |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }} Southampton Operatic Society website history page&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Edith Ashdown, the daughter of a Southampton businessman and a member of the Above Bar Congregational Church, gathered her friends (including Evelyn Thorne who ran a local ladies’ choir) to perform a musical play ''Princess Juju''. This was well received so they decided to form a society and present ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' by [[Edward German]] at the Watts Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sotonopera.org/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512005017/http://www.sotonopera.org/history.html |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next five years, the society alternated between dramatic and musical productions under the title of Southampton Above Bar Musical and Dramatic Society but in 1930 it separated into two distinct bodies - operatic and dramatic. {{citation needed|date=March 2009}} The latter group, The Southampton Amateur Dramatic Society (SADS) no longer exists.

The [[Second World War]] curtailed the activities of the society between 1939 and 1945 but it soon reformed to perform “Merrie England” once more in 1946. {{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The works of [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] soon became the society’s annual offering &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotonopera.org/shows.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1980 that it began to perform two shows a year – even then it did not perform the full set of G&amp;S operettas until its production of [[The Grand Duke]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotonopera.org/shows.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1978 it has added musicals and classical operas to its repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotonopera.org/shows.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Several past members have moved onto the professional stage including [[Barry Clark (singer)|Barry Clark]], Valerie Nunns, Anne Osborne. and [[Claire Rutter]] (who is Vice President of the Society).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotonopera.org/whoarewe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 a junior section was formed in an effort to introduce younger members to its ranks and this has been a successful development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debyoutheatre.org&lt;/ref&gt; Now called Debut Youth Theatre it too has been the launch pad for several professional careers, notably [[Rae Baker]], [[Nyle Wolfe]], [[Laura Carmichael]] and, Simon Pontin.

Since 1998 the Society has been a regular contestant at the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]] held annually at [[Buxton Opera House]] and has won several awards, most recently for the Best Concerted Item in for 'The Matter Trio' from [[Ruddigore]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotonopera.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stirrup jar''' is a style of pottery vessel which originated during the Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haskell|first=Halford W.|date=1985|title=The Origin of the Aegean Stirrup Jar and Its Earliest Evolution and Distribution (MB III-LBI)|jstor=504326|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=221–229|doi=10.2307/504326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such vessels were sometimes decorated with painted designs or ornamentation. Early examples of the stirrup jar have been recovered from [[Rhodes]] dating to c. 1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Octopus Style' stirrup jar|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/o/octopus_style_stirrup_jar.aspx|work=The British Museum|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of inscribed [[Kydonia]]n stirrup jars have been recovered from several archaeological sites on [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cydonia|url=http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html#fieldnotes|work=The Modern Antiquarian|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirrup jars were originally intended for use as containers for oil and wine. The early stirrup jars were sparsely decorated and featured a three handled arrangement, disc hole, spout horns, and the shape of a false neck and spout. Traditionally stirrup jars were divided into two versions: a small, fine ware version suggesting a specialized use and a large, coarse ware version.&lt;ref name=haskell&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=504326 | title=The Origin of the Aegean Stirrup Jar and Its Earliest Evolution and Distribution | last=Haskell | first=Halford W. | journal=American Journal of Archaeology | series=2 |date=April 1985 | volume=89 | pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The features found suggest that the stirrup jar could have been economically valuable. The arrangement of the stirrup jar suggests a stopper was used to secure the contents. The disc holes and third handle may have been used to secure a tag to the vessel suggesting a commercial importance and resale value. The locations where stirrup jars have been found in reflect the fact that the popularity of this vessel type spread quickly throughout the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and the use of the stirrup jar to identify a specific commodity became important.&lt;ref name="haskell" /&gt;

'''Talking animals''' are a common theme in [[mythology]] and [[Folklore|folk tales]], as well as [[children's literature]]. Fictional talking animals often are [[anthropomorphic]], possessing human-like qualities but appearing as a creature. The usage of talking animals enable storytellers to combine the basic characteristics of the animal with human behavior, to apply metaphor, and to entertain children.

There are a number of alleged real-life [[talking animal]]s.

== Talking creatures which are still creatures ==

The creature retains its original form without much change, other than being able to speak. Sometimes it may only speak as a narration for the reader's convenience. The rabbits in ''[[Watership Down]]'' who, except for the ability to discuss their actions, behave exactly as normal rabbits, also come under this category, as do characters from animated films like ''[[Happy Feet (film)|Happy Feet]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]''.

[[File:Oz Billina byKoehne.jpg|right|thumb|Billina, a talking chicken in Oz, by [[André Koehne]]]]

The talking creature concept is featured within much traditional literature, such as in [[Aesop's Fables]], and several mythologies, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] and [[Vedic mythology|Indian]] mythologies. A notable example from the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition is the talking [[serpent (Bible)|serpent]] from the [[Book of Genesis]], which tempts [[Eve]] to eat the forbidden fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s include apparent talking creatures that prove to be [[shapeshifting|shapeshifted]] people, or even [[ghost]]s.  The fairy tales ''[[How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon]]'' and ''[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]'' have the hero aided by a fox and a wolf respectively, but in the similar tale ''[[The Golden Bird]]'', the talking fox is freed from a spell to become the heroine's brother, and in ''[[The Bird 'Grip']]'', the fox leaves the hero after explaining that it was the [[Grateful dead (folklore)|dead man]] whose debts the hero had paid.

Whether shape-shifted or merely having the magical ability to speak, the talking creature is perhaps the most common trait of [[fairy tale]]s.  The motif is certainly present in many more tales than fairies.&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 55, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angelos London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous modern [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories intermix human and creature characters.  In [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[Land of Oz]], creatures (such as the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger) talk.  The chicken Billina gains the ability to talk when she is swept away by a storm to land near Oz, as do other animals, and Toto, it is explained in a [[retcon]], always had the ability since arriving in Oz, but never used it. In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', the world of Narnia is ruled by a talking lion by the name of [[Aslan]], and many small characters are talking woodland animals, both of which interact with both the humans of Narnia, and the children who act as the protagonists of the books.

== Creatures that portray humans ==

Most people in the industries of [[professional]] [[illustration]], [[cartoon]]ing, and [[animation]] refer to these types of creature characters as '''talking animals''',&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Orban, ''Ethical Diversions: The Post-Holocaust Narratives of Pynchon, Abish, DeLillo, and Spiegelman'', New York, London: Routledge, 2005, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[funny animal]]s''' or '''anthropomorphic characters'''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker (ed.), ''Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2014, pp. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the mainstream news media and members of [[furry fandom]] more commonly refer to this variety of talking animals as '''furries'''. The earliest example of talking creatures portraying humans, as opposed to talking creatures portraying creatures, was in [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (''Fables of Bidpai''), which was set in a world of talking creatures who represent human morals and behavior. A good [[Western World|Western]] example of the genre is [[Henryson]]'s ''[[Fabillis]]''. The webcomic "Anima: Age of the Robots" ([[Anima (webcomic)]]) uses anthropomorphism to portray an alternate world as modern as ours, but inhabited by creature-lookalikes. The intelligent robots they have made rebel and threaten the creatures. This serves as a warning to mankind's thoughtless pursuit of technological advancement.

'''''The Crystal Ball''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]] completed in 1902.&lt;ref name="johnwillilamwaterhouse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/pictures/crystal-ball-1902/|title=The Crystal Ball|accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Waterhouse displayed both it and ''[[The Missal]]'' in the [[Royal Academy]] of 1902.  The painting shows the influence of the Italian Renaissance with vertical and horizontal lines, along with circles "rather than the pointed arches of the Gothic".&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;Hobson, Anthony. 1989.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Faction is beginning to develop a real signature in imaginative, contemporary and visceral versions of the classics. Amid the current debate between the rise of new writing and lack of classical work on London stages, this enterprising and determined company is doing us all a service. – The Stage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/factions-2015-rep-season-romeo-julietthe-talented-mr-ripleyjoan-arc/|title=The Faction;s 2015 rep season: ''Romeo and Juliet''/''The Talented Mr Ripley''/''Joan of Arc''|work=The Stage|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing the [[Schaubühne]] Berlin at [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06778234|title=The Faction Theatre Company Limited – Overview|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Leipacher created The Faction Theatre Company in 2008.  The Faction became a registered charity in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1145820&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title=Charity overview|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first production was ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at the [[Brockley Jack Theatre]], London, in October 2008. The Faction is now led by two artistic directors; Mark Leipacher and Rachel Valentine Smith, and is supported by a core ensemble of eleven actors and associate artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefaction.org.uk/ensemble|title=thefaction|website=thefaction.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During The Faction's formative years, they toured across the UK, played studio theatres across London, and established an open-air season in [[Brockwell Park]]. They were then invited to be an associate ensemble of the [[New Diorama Theatre]]. With the support of their 5-year relationship at The New Diorama, The Faction was able to trial a more permanent model of working in [[repertory theatre]], with a core ensemble.  

Since 2012, The Faction have produced five annual sell-out repertory seasons, engaging with over 26,000 audience members and 4,000 students. In 2016, The Faction partnered with [[Selfridges]] to create an auditorium in their [[Oxford Street]] store for Shakespeare 400 celebrations, where they produced a version of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/richard-brownliemarshall/much-ado-about-nothing-at_b_11759604.html|title=''Much Ado About Nothing'' At Selfridges|website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faction took their work even further afield later that year, in partnership with the [[British Council]], and the [[American University of Beirut]], producing and co-directing an Arabic premiere production of ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2016/Pages/malik-lear.aspx|title=AUB – 2016 – ''Al-Malik Lear'' adds Lebanese twist to Shakespearean tragedy|website=www.aub.edu.lb|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Shakespeare, The Faction have produced work by other classic writers such Cervantes, Euripedes, Gorky, Lorca and Schiller. They also bridge the divide between classics and new writing by engaging some of the UK's most exciting and emerging writers. To date, this has included Ranjit Bolt (''Three Sisters''), Gareth Jandrell (''Thebes'', published by Bloomsbury Methuen Drama), Emily Juniper (''[[Miss Julie]]'' and ''[[Vassa Zheleznova (play)|Vassa Zheleznova]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jun/13/rewriting-classical-theatre-women-faction-maxim-gorky-vassa-zheleznova|title=Rewriting classical theatre: 'Female characters are sad, have babies or talk about men'|last=Saner|first=Emine|date=2016-06-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-05|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two unique projects: ''Reptember'' and ''Demetrius''.  

''Reptember'' is an [[Off West End]] award-nominated project, consisting of 12 classic texts adapted for solo performance by some of our most promising playwrights, including Jessica Sian and Will Gore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newdiorama.com/whats-on/reptember|title=New Diorama|last=http://feastcreative.com|first=Feast Creative|website=newdiorama.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Demetrius'' is an ongoing portmanteau project to complete [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s [[Demetrius (play)|final unfinished work]]. Established writers such as April de Angelis, Glyn Maxwell and Simon Reade complete a "unit" before passing the baton to up and coming writers like Jon Brittain and Daniel Kanaber.

'''World Intellectual Property Day''' is observed annually on 26 April.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt; WIPO web site, [http://www.wipo.int/ip-outreach/en/ipday/ ''World Intellectual Property Day – 26 April'']. Consulted on 20 April 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; The event was established by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in 2000 to "raise awareness of how [[patent]]s, [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s and [[Industrial design right|design]]s impact on daily life" and "to celebrate creativity, and the contribution made by creators and [[innovator]]s to the development of societies across the globe".&lt;ref name="WIPO"/&gt; 26 April was chosen as the date for World Intellectual Property Day because it coincides with the date on which the [[Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization]] entered into force in 1970. [[File:WIPO Celebrates Visionary Innovators.jpg|thumb|An exhibition showing the [[intellectual property]] (IP) behind [[Steve Jobs]]’ innovations opened to the public at [[WIPO]] on 30 March 2012 and ran through to ''World Intellectual Property Day'' on 26 April 2012.

== History ==
Following a statement made at the Assembly of the Member States of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in September 1998, the Director General of the National [[Algeria]]n Institute for Industrial Property (INAPI) proposed on 7 April 1999 the [[institutionalisation]] of an [[international observance|international day]] for intellectual property, with the aim of 
:"[setting up] a framework for broader mobilization and awareness, [opening up] access to the promotional aspect of innovation and [recognizing] the achievements of promoters of [[intellectual property]] throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt; Letter of 7 April 1999 from Amor Bouhnik, Director General of the National Algerian Institute for Industrial Property, to the Director General of WIPO (Ref: 027 DG/MS/99) in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_7.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of an International Day for Intellectual Property. Proposal by the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria |accessdate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031222105430/http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_7.htm |archivedate=22 December 2003 |df=dmy-all }}'', WO/GA/24/7, 10 August 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 1999, the Chinese delegation to the WIPO proposed the adoption of the "World Intellectual Property Day"
:"in order to further promote the awareness of intellectual property protection, expand the influence of intellectual property protection across the world, urge countries to publicize and popularize intellectual property protection laws and regulations, enhance the public [[legal awareness]] of intellectual property rights, encourage invention-innovation activities in various countries and strengthen international exchange in the intellectual property field".&lt;ref&gt; Letter dated 9 August 1999 from Jiang Ying, Commissioner of the [[State Intellectual Property Office|State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China]], to Dr. [[Kamil Idris]], Director General of World Intellectual Property Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, in World Intellectual Property Organization web site, ''{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/ga24_8.htm |title=WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Fourth (14th Ordinary) Session, Geneva, 20 to 29 September 1999, Institutionalization of a World Intellectual Property Day.

In October 1999, the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) approved the idea of declaring a particular day as a World Intellectual Property Day.&lt;ref&gt; World Intellectual Property Organization, [http://www.wipo.int/documents/en/document/govbody/wo_gb_ga/doc/ga26_2.doc ''WIPO General Assembly, Twenty-Sixth (12th Extraordinary) Session, Geneva, 25 September to 3 October 2000, Memorandum of the Director General''], WO/GA/26/2, 26 July 2000. &lt;/ref&gt;
