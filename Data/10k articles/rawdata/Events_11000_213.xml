'''All Hands And Hearts - Smart Response''' is a U.S.-based, [[501(c)3]] non-profit organization. Founded in September 2005, All Hands provides relief to residents in areas affected by natural disasters in the U.S. and internationally. In late 2017 All Hands Volunteers merged with the Happy Hearts Fund, founded by Czech supermodel and philanthropist, [[Petra Němcová]], to become All Hands and Hearts - Smart Response.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dujour.com/cities/petra-nemcova-happy-hearts-fund-and-all-hands-volunteers/|title=Petra Nemcova's Happy Hearts Fund and All Hands Volunteers - DuJour|date=2017-12-07|work=DuJour|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[Mattapoisett, Massachusetts]].

==History==

The organization that would become All Hands Volunteers was co-founded on September 6, 2005 by internet entrepreneur [[Darius Monsef]] and businessman [[David N. Campbell|David Campbell]] after the pair met in Thailand, where they had both gone to work in the aftermath of the [[2004 Sumatran tsunami]] that killed an estimated 230,000 people. Many arriving volunteers found that they were being turned away by established charities, resulting in a group coming together to perform basic tasks, such as clearing debris and building shelters.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardhusock/2013/09/30/not-from-government-here-to-help-3-all-hands-volunteers-cleans-up-superstorm-sandy/ |title=Not From Government, Here to Help (3): All Hands Volunteers Cleans Up Superstorm Sandy |publisher=Forbes |date=2013-09-30 |accessdate=2014-02-13 |first=Howard |last=Husock}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair, along with Pete Kirkwood and Mike Cegielski, two U.S. citizens then living in Thailand, created HandsOnThailand, which brought more than 200 volunteers as well as several hundred thousand dollars to aid in the rebuilding of five [[Phuket]] fishing villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/news/article_153876ce-df12-11e3-b909-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Alfred State holds 103rd commencement|work=Olean Times Herald |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the pair joined with other HandsOn volunteers to establish [[Hands On USA|HandsOnUSA]], setting up an operations center in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]] within days of the storm.&lt;ref name="volunteermatch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org269529.jsp |title=All Hands Volunteers Volunteer Opportunities |publisher=VolunteerMatch |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ns.gmnews.com/news/2005-12-29/Front_page/005.html |title=A Hands On experience with disaster, despair &amp;#124; ns.gmnews.com &amp;#124; North South Brunswick Sentinel |publisher=ns.gmnews.com |date=2005-12-29 |accessdate=2014-02-13 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140314195611/http://ns.gmnews.com/news/2005-12-29/Front_page/005.html |archive-date=2014-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardsmith.net/biloxi/handson.html |title=Biloxi, Mississippi, Katrina Recovery |publisher=Richardsmith.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization signed on 1,500 volunteers, providing an estimated $2.5 million in volunteer time.&lt;ref name="portlandtribune1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=87171 |title=Pamplin Media Group |publisher=Portlandtribune.com |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; HandsOnUSA worked on demolition and construction in the city, as well as clearing away debris and making space for the trailers supplied by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projecthope.org/news-blogs/stories/gabrielles-story.html#sthash.tl0J471x.dpuf |title=Remembering Hurricane Katrina |publisher=Project Hope |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group remained in Biloxi for five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/FinanceProfessorjim_9 |title=Interview with Darius Monsef of HandsonUSA : FinanceProfessor(jim) : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, the group turned the project over to Hands On Network Gulf Coast and changed its name to Hands On Disaster Response (HODR), launching their next recovery project in [[Yogyakarta]], Indonesia in May of the same year, following the [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake]].&lt;ref name="David Campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encore.org/david-campbell |title=David Campbell |publisher=Encore.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.niagara.edu/executive-director-of-hands-on-disaster-response-to-speak-at-nu-border-community-service-event/ |title=Executive Director of Hands On Disaster Response to speak at NU Border Community SERVICE Event &amp;#124; NU News |publisher=News.niagara.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Hands On Disaster Response changed its name to All Hands Volunteers to avoid being confused with other organizations with similar names.&lt;ref name=volunteermatch1 /&gt;

In late 2017 All Hands Volunteers merged with The Happy Hearts Fund, created by [[Petra Němcová]], to become All Hands And Hearts - Smart Response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mysocialgoodnews.com/hands-volunteers-happy-hearts-fund-unite-form-hands-hearts-smart-response-expanding-disaster-relief-efforts-creating-impactful-change-worldwide/|title=All Hands Volunteers and Happy Hearts Fund Unite To Form All Hands and Hearts – Smart Response, Expanding Disaster Relief Efforts and Creating More Impactful Change Worldwide {{!}} My Social Good News|date=2017-11-14|work=My Social Good News|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2018, All Hands And Hearts were ranked #1 on the Classy 100, topping a list of fastest growing NGO's for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/classy-100/2017/all-hands-and-hearts-smart-response|title=Classy.org|website=www.classy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2018, All Hands And Hearts - Smart Response has been given a 4 star rank by Charity Navigator. The organisation is currently one of the highest rated charities on Charity Navigator.

==Volunteer process==

All Hands And Hearts are often amongst the first to respond and the last to leave when co-ordinating relief efforts. When establishing a presence at a new location following a major disaster, the organisation first conducts a thorough assessment to determine the community where they will establish a base, after communicating with local community leadership, following up by inviting a set number of volunteers to join the project base as space and need allows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/wood-market-trends/woodworking-industry-trends-press-releases/All-Hands-Volunteers-Responds-to-Hurricane-Sandy-178994981.html?source=related#sthash.EY7gEjcg.dpuf |title=All Hands Volunteers Responds to Hurricane Sandy |publisher=Woodworkingnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While many large volunteer organizations request that volunteers pay to participate, All Hands Volunteers only requests that volunteers cover their own travel expenses, while the group raises funds to cover the remaining expenses.&lt;ref name="villagesoup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sippican.villagesoup.com/p/mattapoisett-residents-gets-all-hands-on-deck/1099234 |title=Mattapoisett residents gets 'All Hands' on deck - By Georgia Sparling - Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, MA - Sippican Week VillageSoup |publisher=Sippican.villagesoup.com |date=2014-01-19 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers aren't expected to set a minimum set commitment period, staying only as long as they can. In addition, the nature of some of the work volunteers perform (mainly cleanup and demolitions in areas affected by natural disasters) is unskilled labor, meaning that volunteers can immediately take part in recovery efforts with little or no training.&lt;ref name="bsces1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsces.org/index.cfm/page/Hands-On-Disaster-Response:-Project-Sungai-Geringging/cdid/10701/pid/10371 |title=Hands On Disaster Response: Project Sungai Geringging - BSCES - Boston Society of Civil Engineers Section |publisher=BSCES |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is often limited to physical labor, such as clearing debris or demolishing damaged structures, but has also included building of schools in [[Haiti]], permanent homes in the [[Philippines]], rebuild programmes in the United States following [[Hurricane Sandy]] and other powerful storms as well as ongoing school and community rebuild programmes in [[Nepal]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="forbes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bsces1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gmanetwork1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/314057/news/regions/ngo-initiated-c-de-oro-housing-project-for-sendong-victims-nearly-complete|title=NGO-initiated C' de Oro housing project for 'Sendong' victims nearly complete &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online|date=2013-06-22|publisher=Gmanetwork.com|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holidaybenefitconcert.org/About.html|title=Holiday Benefit Concert for Sandy Relief|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, All Hands And Hearts has enabled over 50,000 volunteers from over 45 countries to positively impact and empower over a million people adversely affected by natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allhandsandhearts.org|title=All Hands and Hearts - Smart Response {{!}} Powered by Volunteers|website=All Hands and Hearts|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has engaged volunteers from more than 45 countries, something which is celebrated amongst the volunteer community, lending itself to a positive, welcoming and enriching volunteer experience.&lt;ref name="world1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.edu/tsunami-story-hands-volunteers/ |title=Taking on a Tsunami: The story of All Hands Volunteers |publisher=world.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of projects==

=== 2018 ===
In September 2017, [[Hurricane Maria]] devastated large areas of [[Dominica]]. It was reported that over 90% of structures on the island suffered damage, with widespread loss of electricity and basic facilities. In response, All Hands and Hearts launched a relief programme in April 2018, focused on restoring education to the children of [[Dominica]], in particular the rebuild of the Paix Bouche Primary School. When completed, the school is expected to serve 78 students, with over 200 projected over the next 10 years. The school is also envisioned to provide shelter against future storms, both for students and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/maria-devastates-dominica-heads-puerto-rico-170919083417236.html|title=Maria devastates Dominica, heads to Puerto Rico|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurricanes [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] bombarded the [[British Virgin Islands]] in September 2017. The islands were subjected to some of the strongest winds in recorded history, decimating the beautiful islands and causing extensive damage to homes, schools, community facilities and utilities across the islands. All Hands and Hearts launched a program help impacted children on the island of [[Tortola]]. A number of schools and care facilities were outlined as needing immediate support, with volunteers helping to clear debris and prepare sites for rebuilds. As the program has progressed through 2018, community programs have been started, with several homes cleared of debris and made safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?articleId=28710|title=Volunteers Praised For Post Irma Work|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/bvi-hurricane-response/|title=British Virgin Islands Hurricane Response {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricane Maria]] caused widespread destruction in [[Puerto Rico]] during the fall of 2017. After monitoring the situation over recovery efforts, All Hands and Hearts launched a relief program in January 2018, responding to the immediate lack of sanitation, potable water and power outages that continue to affect the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/puerto-rico-response/|title=Puerto Rico Recovery {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers have worked to clear debris, muck and clear facilities, homes and infrastructure, assist in sanitation work, gutting damaged areas and preparing sites for rebuild and repair projects. To date over 247 individual jobs have been completed with over 24,000 volunteer hours logged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://share.insider.thomsonreuters.com/link?entryId=1_hi36iyfj|title=Volunteers Put Work on Hold and Serve in Puerto Rico|website=Thomson Reuters - Production KMC|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodandwine.com/syndication/why-you-should-go-to-puerto-rico-now|title=Voluntourism in Puerto Rico: How to Help After Hurricane Maria|work=Food &amp; Wine|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, heavy tropical rainfall hit the south [[Texas]] coastline, causing severe flash floods and widespread disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/21/texas-floods-heavy-rains-inundate-areas-hard-hit-hurricane-harvey/721598002/|title=Days of torrential rain lead to Texas' worst flooding since Hurricane Harvey|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Hands and Hearts assessed the ongoing situation and in response set up an immediate response programme in [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo county]].

=== 2017 ===
In March 2017, All Hands and Hearts launched a relief programme in [[Peru]] in response to the widespread and [[2016–17 South America floods|devastating flooding]] which had affected much of the country since late 2016. A programme was launched in the eastern area of Peru, in the district of [[Piura Province]]. Volunteers worked to remove mud and debris from homes and schools, some of which were found to be almost entirely filled with mud. In August 2017, All Hands and Hearts began the next stage of the programme, to rebuild a number of schools, the first of which has since been completed. Further projects are continuing in Yapatera, including school builds, English lessons, community outreach programmes and schemes focused on empowering women in the local area. An estimated 2,000 students have been returned to education, with over 3,000 people impacted as a result of the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/perufloodrecovery/|title=Peru Flood Recovery {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/peru/all-hands-volunteers-launches-peru-flood-response-program|title=All Hands Volunteers Launches Peru Flood Response Program|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Hurricanes Maria and Irma devastated large areas of the [[Caribbean]] including the [[British Virgin Islands|British]] and [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Island]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Dominica]] leading to widespread damage, loss of electricity and basic facilities. All Hands and Hearts continued to monitor the situation during the ongoing hurricane season, launching programs in 2018 to address continuing issues across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Hurricane Maria travels close to Irma's path - CNN Video|url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/weather/2017/09/18/hurricane-maria-weather-update-pedram-javaheri-sot.cnn|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In January 2016, winter storms resulted in several tornadoes and severe flooding affecting [[St. Louis|St Louis, Missouri]]. All Hands and Hearts responded to the urgent need for debris removal, sanitation and clearing of damaged infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/all-hands-vs-goliath/|title=All Hands vs. Goliath {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, [[2016 Louisiana floods|heavy flooding severely affected the state of Louisiana.]] Extremely heavy rainfall resulted in flash flood warnings and the destruction or damage of over 60,000 homes, displacing over 8,000 people. All Hands and Hearts launched a relief programme on August 18th, focusing on clearing debris, assisting in sanitation projects and removing flood damaged structures. Efforts were centred in [[Denham Springs, Louisiana|Denham Springs]] where 90% of homes and business were affected. Volunteer teams also worked in the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/louisiana-flood-response-2/|title=Louisiana Flood Response {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/08/25/louisiana-flood-victims-desperate-volunteers-money/89350386/|title=Louisiana flood victims desperate for volunteers, money|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing earthquake relief programme in [[Nepa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l continued to be heavily active throughout 2016, with a number of school projects being completed in [[Nuwakot District|Nuwako]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t and [[Kathmandu]].

In October 2016, [[Hurricane Matthew]] struck the Caribbean and southern United States with [[North Carolina]], [[Haiti]] and [[Florida]] being worst hit. Widespread flooding and storm damage was reported across much of the region, prompting a relief response to be launched on October 6th, aimed at clearing debris, fallen trees, preparing rebuild sites and environmental cleanups Domestic efforts were centred in [[North Carolina]] and [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/hurricane-matthew-response-copy/|title=Hurricane Matthew Response - USA {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/hurricane-matthewhaiti-update-all-hands-volunteers|title=Hurricane Matthew/Haiti Update from All Hands Volunteers|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 ===
Between February - March 2015, All Hands and Hearts responded to [[January 2015 North American blizzard|heavy winter weather]] which struck across the eastern United States coast. Volunteers in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] assisted residents in clearing snow and co-ordinated with local authorities to facilitate welfare checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hands.org/projects/boston-snow-response/|title=Boston Snow Response {{!}} All Hands|work=All Hands|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after Superstorm Sandy, All Hands opened its third rebuild project in [[Brooklyn]], New York, in January to help those whose homes were damaged by the hurricane. Similar to reconstruction on Staten Island, the work included minor framing, drywall installation, mudding and taping, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/12/volunteers_continue_clean_up_e.html Volunteers continue clean up efforts in Midland Beach | SILive.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, [[Malawi]] experienced heavy flooding and All Hands worked with the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) to track the status and needs of those displaced by the floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iom.int/news/assessment-flood-affected-malawi-highlights-need-recovery-and-transition-support|title=Assessment of Flood-Affected Malawi Highlights Need for Recovery and Transition|last=Chimenya|first=Brenda|date=2015-05-01|publisher=International Organization for Migration|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, All Hands phased into rebuild work and began the digging and bricking of irrigation wells to provide water to crops affected by the floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/malawirebuild/|title=Malawi Flood Rebuild|author=All Hands Volunteers|date=2015-07-25|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
On April 30, 2014, the All Hands Assessment Team arrived in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], two days after a tornado outbreak devastated the Southeast United States. All Hands chose to focus their response efforts in [[Itawamba County, Mississippi|Itawamba County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orgsync.com/56643/news_posts/73062|title=Mississippi Tornado Disaster Relief Information|last=Franks|first=Megan|date=2014-05-02|publisher=Mississippi State University|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of their response, 328 volunteers completed 84 jobs, which included basic debris removal, demolition of homes and barns, and significant salvage work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/itawamba-tornado-response/|title=Itawamba Tornado Response|author=All Hands Volunteers|date=2014-06-28|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months later, a set of tornadoes struck the town of [[Pilger, Nebraska]] destroying 80% of the town and injuring dozens. In our two weeks in Pilger, a total of 2,943 All Hands-coordinated volunteers completed work on 35 sites and removed debris in over three-quarters of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/pilger-tornado-response/|title=Pilger Tornado Response|author=All Hands Volunteers|date=2014-07-05|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August [[Detroit]] experienced severe flooding and the All Hands quickly launched Project Detroit to help those in the area begin to recover from the damaging floods, and by project close had gutted and sanitized over 400 homes in the Detroit metro area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/08/make-a-difference-day-awards-detroit/25434631/|title=Make A Difference Day Awards: Flood Recovery in Detroit|last=Wisely|first=John|date=2015-04-08|accessdate=2015-08-14|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/12/volunteers_from_around_country.html "Four months after heavy rains, volunteers help Detroiters still struggling with flood damage"].

As cleanup after Typhoon Yolanda moved toward completion in the Philippines, All Hands shifted their focus towards long-term recovery, concentrating on building permanent homes in both of the cities of [[Ormoc]] and [[Tacloban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asamnews.com/2014/11/08/typhoon-haiyans-legacy-one-year-later/|title=Being There for the Victims of Typhoon Haiyan: One Year Later|last=Neidermeier|first=Ariel|date=2014-11-08|publisher=Asana News|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this program Project Leyte designed 40 two-story disaster resilient homes in order to focus on building upwards in a community where space for homes is limited. [[2014 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Hagupit|Typhoon Hagupit]] struck the area late in the year, delaying construction activities in Tacloban. The construction team helped both during the preparation and immediate response phases. Immediately following Typhoon Hagupit, the AHV Disaster Assessment Response Team (DART) spent six days on the island of [[Samar]], which bore the brunt of the typhoon assessing the island. All Hands found a village, [[Calampong]], where the organization began a traditional disaster cleanup, clearing fallen trees and debris, and deconstructing ruined homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airlinkflight.org/typhoon-hagupit-response/|title=Typhoon Hagupit Response|publisher=Airlink Flight|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11th, 2011 a magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck off of the coast of Tohoku, Japan, triggering a devastating tsunami which struck the region. In response, The organization launched Project Tohoku, setting up operations in [[Rikuzentakata, Iwate|Rikuzentakata]] city and [[Ofunato]] city, [[Iwate Prefecture]], where approximately 7,200 homes were badly damaged by [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref name="world1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emrojapan.com/emnews/content/420.html|title=ALL HANDS Volunteer Group - Project Tohoku|date=2011-07-22|publisher=Emrojapan.com|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, they worked with hundreds of volunteers to clear debris from homes, canals, and public areas and repaired houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/destin-nation-japan-volun_n_928576.html#s331506title=Iwate_Prefecture|title=Destin-Nation Japan: Voluntourism After The Disaster (PHOTOS)|date=2011-07-06|accessdate=2014-02-13|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dozens of tornados struck Alabama on [[2011 Super Outbreak#April 27|April 27]] in a super outbreak which killed over 200 people. AHV responded to requests by the State and the Alabama branch of VOAD to provide inter-agency coordination services in support of the ongoing recovery efforts. Coordination of needs was enhanced by a strong [[2-1-1]] system. Direct volunteer efforts included tree removal, debris removal, and de-construction. AHV efforts concluded in mid-July.&lt;ref name="urlAL Tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/alabama-tornado-response/|title=Alabama Tornado Response|date=|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While the Alabama recovery was underway, [[Western Massachusetts]] was hit by multiple tornados on June 1. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) asked AHV to provide coordination services for volunteer agencies in the state. At the same time AHV partnered with United Way and using the 2-1-1 system provided field operations support throughout much of Western Massachusetts to match unaffiliated volunteers with agencies to assist in debris clean-up and roof and home repair.&lt;ref name="urlSpringfieldMA Tornado"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/springfield-tornado-response/|title=Springfield Tornado Response|date=|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what would become the organization's longest running project, HODR would remain until 2012 (by which time they would be known as All Hands Volunteers).&lt;ref name="bsces1" /&gt;

HODR also returned to the [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] area in April 2010, to aid in continued rebuilding following the 2008 flood, with the help of a $15,000 donation from the Greater Cedar Rapids Home Builders Association to pay for tools and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thegazette.com/2010/04/09/hands-on-disaster-response-returns-to-help-with-rebuilding/#ixzz2t7uASb25|title=Hands On Disaster Response returns to help with rebuilding|date=|publisher=TheGazette|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group aided with flood recovery coordination for three U.S. incidents, establishing operations in Rhode Island, Tennessee and Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml.edu/News/stories/2010-11/haiti_relief_speaker.aspx|title=Saving the World, One Volunteer at a Time|date=2004-12-26|publisher=Uml.edu|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Rhode Island received up to {{convert|15|in|abbr=on}} of rain in late March and subsequently suffered severe flooding. HODR responded to a request by the state branch of [[VOAD]] and the state's emergency management agency to establish and staff an inter-agency recovery coordination center (RCC). The center continued providing coordination until early May.&lt;ref name="urlRI RCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/rhode-island-flood-coordination/|title=Rhode Island Flood Coordination|date=|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the Rhode Island project concluded, both [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[West Tennessee]] experienced record rainfall and [[2010 Tennessee floods|suffered exceptional flooding]]. Similar to the Rhode Island project, HODR helped optimize an RCC in [[Antioch, Tennessee]] that subsequently handled over a thousand inter-agency requests for assistance.&lt;ref name="urlTN RCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/tennessee-flood-coordination/|title=Tennessee Flood Coordination|date=|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August, the [[Skunk River]] flooded parts of southern Iowa. Especially devastated was the city of [[Colfax, Iowa|Colfax]] in [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper County]]. HODR teams helped with clean-up and recovery activities plus assisting in inter-agency coordination for Colfax and Jasper County.&lt;ref name="urlJasper CountyIA RCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hands.org/projects/jasper-county-flood-coordination/|title=Jasper County Flood Coordination|date=|publisher=All Hands Volunteers|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naval '''Incident of Pacocha''' took place on 29 May 1877 when [[Nicolás de Piérola]] was leading a revolution to overthrow then [[Peru]]vian President [[Mariano Ignacio Prado]]. Piérola's supporters used the Peruvian monitor [[Huáscar (ship)|''Huáscar'']] as a raiding ship. She harassed the shipping especially off [[El Callao]], the main commercial port of Peru. However, after she boarded some British merchant ships, British authorities sent Rear Admiral [[Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey|de Horsey]] to capture the vessel. The Peruvian warship managed to outrun the British squadron after a fierce exchange of fire. ''Huáscar''{{'}}s guns were undermanned, and she fired just 40 rounds. ''Shah''{{'}}s mast was damaged by splinters. On the British side, ''Shah'' fired 237 shots and ''Amethyst'' 190, but none of them carried armour-piercing ammunition. ''Huáscar'' was hit 60 times, but her armour shield defeated all the rounds. There was a last-ditch effort to stop or sink the rebels when two small [[torpedo ram]]s from ''Shah'' attempted to find the ''Huáscar'', but the Peruvian ship managed to escape under the cover of darkness. The rebel crew was forced to surrender their ship to the Peruvian government just two days later.

This battle saw the first use of the newly invented self-propelled [[torpedo]] which, at the time, had just entered limited service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The torpedo was dodged by the rebel monitor.

[[China]] is alleged to have begun a widespread effort to acquire U.S. [[military technology]] and [[classified information]] and the [[trade secret]]s of U.S. companies.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;Finkle, J. Menn, J., Viswanatha, J. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/19/us-cybercrime-usa-china-idUSBREA4I09420140519 ''U.S. accuses China of cyber spying on American companies.''] Reuters, Mon 19 May 2014 6:04pm EDT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;Clayton, M.

China has been accused of using a number of methods to obtain U.S. technology (using U.S. law to avoid prosecution), including [[espionage]], exploitation of commercial entities and a network of scientific, academic and business contacts.&lt;ref&gt;deGraffenreid, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it uses a network of contacts to collect information used to benefit Chinese businesses, each bit of information does not invite scrutiny or prosecution by the U.S. government. Espionage cases include [[Larry Wu-Tai Chin]], [[Katrina Leung]], Gwo-Bao Min, [[Chi Mak]] and Peter Lee.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;Global Security. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/china/mss-ops.htm "Ministry of State Security Operations."] (accessed March 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w6&gt;Wortzel, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional espionage, China partners civilian Chinese companies with American businesses to acquire technology and economic data&lt;ref&gt;Wortzel, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and uses [[cyber spying]] to penetrate the computer networks of U.S. businesses and government agencies; an example is the December 2009 [[Operation Aurora]].&lt;ref&gt;Helft, Miguel and John Markoff, "In Rebuke of China, Focus Falls on Cybersecuirty," ''The New York Times'', January 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law enforcement officials have identified China as the most active foreign power involved in the illegal acquisition of American technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wortzel, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2014, the [[United States Department of Justice]] announced that a Federal [[grand jury]] had indicted five [[People's Liberation Army]] officers for stealing confidential business information and intellectual property from U.S. commercial firms and planting [[malware]] on their computers.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

Partnerships between Chinese and foreign companies have been accused of existing solely to give Chinese defense industries access to advanced technology.&lt;ref name=w4&gt;Wortzel, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulatory and commercial environment in China pressures American and other foreign companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partner companies as part of doing business in their country.&lt;ref name=w4/&gt; Foreign companies provide technology, capital and manufacturing expertise to obtain access to Chinese markets,&lt;ref name=w4/&gt; and high-tech equipment is purchased by Chinese agents operating [[front organization]]s in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=e28/&gt;&lt;ref name=w4/&gt; Some items (computers, semiconductors, software, telecommunications devices, and integrated circuits)&lt;ref name=w4/&gt; may be used for military or civilian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wortzel, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; China also uses state-run firms to purchase American companies with access to the targeted technology.&lt;ref name=e28/&gt;

China also accesses foreign technology through [[industrial espionage]],&lt;ref name=w4/&gt; with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] officials rating China's industrial-espionage and theft operations as the leading threat to U.S. technological security.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''Annual Report to Congress on the Military Power of the People's Republic of China,'' (Washington, DC: July 2007), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Between October 2002 and January 2003 five Chinese businessmen were accused of illegally shipping equipment and trade secrets from California to China,&lt;ref name=p125/&gt; and U.S. officials prevented a Chinese man from shipping a new, high-speed computer used in classified projects (including nuclear-weapons development) from [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref name=p125/&gt;

==Nuclear espionage==
A 1999 [[United States House of Representatives]] Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military and Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China report, known as the [[Cox Report]], warned that China has stolen classified information on every [[thermonuclear warhead]] in the country's [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;deGraffenreid, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Information is collected through espionage, reviews of U.S. technical and academic publications and interaction with U.S. scientists.&lt;ref name=d98&gt;deGraffenreid, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  China tasks a large number of individuals to collect small pieces of information (which are [[Collation|collated]] and analyzed),&lt;ref name=d98/&gt; and individual agents can more easily escape suspicion. U.S. government personnel suspect that China's intelligence-gathering efforts directed towards the development of modern nuclear weapons are focused on the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]], Sandia and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge]] National Laboratories.&lt;ref name=d98/&gt; China is known to have stolen classified information on the W-56 Minuteman II ICBM, the W-62 Minuteman III ICBM, the W-70 Lance short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), the W-76 Trident C-4 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the W-78 Minuteman III Mark 12A ICBM, the W-87 Peacekeeper ICBM and the W-88 Trident D-5 SLBM and weapon-design concepts and features.&lt;ref&gt;deGraffenreid, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Cyber warfare}}Cyberwarfare==
China conducts political and corporate espionage to access the networks of financial, defense and technology companies and research institutions in the United States.&lt;ref name=cha&gt;Cha, Ariana Eunjung and Ellen Nakashima, "Google China cyberattack part of vast espionage campaign, experts say," ''The Washington Post,'' January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Email attachments attempting to enter the networks of U.S. companies and organizations exploit security weaknesses in software.&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; A recipient opens an email attachment, apparently from a familiar source, containing a program which embeds in the recipient's computer. The remotely controlled program allows an attacker to access the recipient's email, send sensitive documents to specific addresses and turns on such instruments as web cameras or microphones.&lt;ref name=cha/&gt;

In January 2010, Google reported "a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google".&lt;ref name=hits&gt;"Google cyberattack hit password system – NY Times," ''Reuters,'' April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to investigators, the Google [[cyber-attack]] targeted the [[Gmail]] accounts of Chinese human-rights activists.&lt;ref name=hits/&gt; At least 34 other companies have been attacked, including Yahoo, Symantec, Adobe, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical.&lt;ref name=cha/&gt;

In January 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that it was the victim of hacking attempts originating from China during the previous four months after it published an article on [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Prime Minister]] [[Wen Jiabao]]. According to the newspaper, the "attacks appear to be part of a broader computer espionage campaign against American news media companies that have reported on Chinese leaders and corporations."&lt;ref name="nytimes20130130"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-new-york-times-computers.html?smid=pl-share | title=Hackers in China Attacked The Times for Last 4 Months | work=The New York Times | date=January 30, 2013 | accessdate=January 31, 2013 | author=Perlroth, Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese [[cyber-attack]]s seem to target strategic industries in which China lags;&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; attacks on defense companies target weapons-systems information, and attacks on technology companies seek source code critical to software applications.&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; Operation Aurora emphasized what senior U.S. government officials have called an increasingly serious cyber threat to critical industries.&lt;ref name=cha/&gt;

[[Amitai Etzioni]] of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies has suggested that cyberspace could be a fruitful realm for the United States and China to implement a policy of mutually assured restraint allowing both states to take measures they deem necessary for self-defense while agreeing to refrain from offensive steps. Such a policy would require oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amitai Etzioni, The Diplomat |url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/09/mar-a-model-for-us-china-relations/ |title=MAR: A Model for US-China Relations |publisher=The Diplomat |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Grady Partin, Sr.''' (February 27, 1924 &amp;ndash; March 11, 1990),&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a business agent of the [[Teamsters Union]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. His testimony in 1964 helped to convict union president [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of [[jury tampering]].&lt;ref name=partin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/13/obituaries/edward-partin-66-union-aide-became-anti-hoffa-witness.html|title=Edward Partin, 66; Union Aide Became Anti-Hoffa Witness|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'', March 12, 1990|accessdate=May 5, 2010 | date=March 13, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Partin was born to Grady Edward Partin (1899–1967) and Bessie M. Partin Foster (1905–2003)&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; in [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]] in [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi|Wilkinson County]], [[Mississippi]], adjacent to the Louisiana border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/news/1999/sep/01/obituaries-for-sept-2-1999/|title=Obituaries for Sept. 2, 199|publisher=''The Natchez Democrat'', [[Natchez, Mississippi]]|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a dishonorably discharged [[United States Marines|Marine]]. His first arrest was for burglary of a house. In 1961, members of Local 5 of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], with which Partin was affiliated for thirty years, charged him with embezzlement of union funds. The 600-pound safe in which union records were stored was found in the bottom of a river. Two who testified against Partin were beaten, and one later was killed by a truck.&lt;ref name=rdt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19700304&amp;id=h58tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U6AFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5983,2252438|title=Ralph de Toledano, "The Partin Case: Justice Bound", March 4, 1970|publisher=google.com|accessdate=May 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 1962, Partin was indicted on twenty-six counts of embezzling union funds and falsifying records, but was released on bond.&lt;ref name=rdt/&gt; On August 14, 1962, Partin was sued for damages for having driven his car off the road and [[hit and run|leaving the scene of an accident]], having injured two persons and killed a third. He was then indicted for first-degree manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident. He was also indicted in another case for aggravated kidnapping. On October 7, 1962, he posted $60,000 in bail in all three cases, embezzlement, manslaughter, and kidnapping, then met with Hoffa to discuss union matters. Thereafter, he emerged as the surprise star witness against Hoffa, having obtained the information on jury tampering from an unexpected stranger in a bar. The Justice Department granted Partin retroactive immunity from prosecution, but Partin denied that he was paid a fee by the government to testify against Hoffa. However, Partin's former wife, the mother of five of his children, received $300 per month, the amount of her alimony, from the Justice Department.&lt;ref name=rdt/&gt; Wade McClanahan, a government witness, said that Partin threatened to have him killed if McClanahan went forward with testimony against the Teamsters business agent.&lt;ref name=rdt/&gt;

==Partin and Hoffa==

Partin claimed that Hoffa, his former associate, offered him $20,000 to fix the jury at Hoffa's trial in 1962 on taking [[political corruption|kickback]]s from a trucking company. [[United States Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]] led the prosecution of Hoffa, but the 1962 trial ended in a hung jury. Hoffa was, however, imprisoned in 1967 on the jury-tampering conviction. James Neal, a prosecutor in the 1962 trial in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], said that when Partin entered the courtroom, Hoffa exclaimed, "My God, it's Partin," hence expressing surprise that Partin would testify against Hoffa."&lt;ref name=partin/&gt; &lt;!--this jumps all over the place--&gt;

According to trutv.com, [[New Orleans]] crime boss [[Carlos Marcello]] in 1960 transferred $500,000 in cash to Hoffa to divert the money to the [[U.S. President|presidential]] campaign of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Richard M. Nixon]], who lost to then [[U.S. Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Early in 1962, Hoffa had disclosed plans to Partin for the murders of President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/marcello/15.html|title=Thomas J.

McKeithen]], arranged a meeting at which Partin was offered first, $25,000 a year for ten years, then $1 million from Marcello to work out a plan to overturn the Hoffa conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Aubrey+Young+of+Baton+Rouge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M3VV7SdM8x&amp;sig=_6UOXTK72JWaItw3mNAaKnwA0JQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q_PYS5-hA4LK8wThxtiaBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwBDgK#|author=Sandy Smith|title=The Fix|work=[[Life Magazine]]|publisher=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/hayride.html|title=Walter Sheridan, Louisiana Hayride|publisher=jfk-online.com|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoffa's allies, among them [[film]] [[actor]] and decorated [[World War II]] veteran [[Audie Murphy]], sought to obtain an [[affidavit]] from Partin recanting the testimony against Hoffa. Such a confession could have reopened the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiemurphy.com/newsclip/dmn_01-25-74.pdf|title=Earl Golz, "Audie Murphy struggled to free Hoffa"|publisher=''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', January 25, 1974|accessdate=May 7, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114081609/http://www.audiemurphy.com/newsclip/dmn_01-25-74.pdf|archivedate=November 14, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edwin Edwards]], who was elected governor of Louisiana in 1972, had expressed concern that the controversial Partin might endorse his candidacy, a development that Edwards, then a [[U.S. representative]] from [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]] feared. "Since Partin was in so much legal trouble, his endorsement would be political poison," Edwards recalled."&lt;ref&gt;Leo Honeycutt, ''Edwin Edwards: Governor of Louisiana'', Lisburn Press, 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==''U.S. v. Partin''==

Thereafter, the post-Robert Kennedy U.S. Justice Department spent eleven years prosecuting Partin on five counts of antitrust and [[extortion]] in connection with labor troubles during the late 1960s in the Baton Rouge area. In March 1979, Partin was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice by hiding witnesses and arranging for [[perjury|perjured]] testimony.&lt;ref name=partin/&gt;

A much earlier Partin trial, which began on June 14, 1971, in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], [[Montana]], ended without a verdict. Twenty-four days later, the judge declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] as a result of a deadlock among jurors. The case was then reassigned to [[U.S. District Judge]] [[James F. Battin]], a Republican former member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], whose court was located in the [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] division. Battin granted a [[change of venue]] to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for the convenience of both witnesses and counsel. Partin's second trial, with Battin still presiding, hence began in Atlanta on January 31, 1972. Judge Battin dismissed one of the five counts, but Partin was convicted after eighteen days of trial and two other days of deliberations of the remaining four counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/493/750/4363/|title=U.S. Court of Appeals: Cases and Opinions|publisher=cases.justia.com|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1980, Partin was finally imprisoned for extortion. While imprisoned in 1984, he pleaded ''[[nolo contendere]]'' to charges of conspiracy, [[racketeering]], and the embezzlement of some $450,000 in union funds stemming from a 1973 indictment. Union members once voted to continue paying Partin's salary while he was in prison, but his tenure as the business agent ended in 1981.&lt;ref name=partin/&gt;&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

U.S. District Judge John Parker subsequently reduced Partin's sentence, and he was released to a halfway house in 1986.&lt;ref name=partin/&gt;&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

==Other issues==

Known for his tough negotiation style with business and government, Partin was involved in many labor disputes. He commonly packed courtrooms with Teamsters to demonstrate union solidarity. He was accused, along with Ted Dunham, Jr., of having attempted to monopolize the Baton Rouge concrete industry during a strike against Bulk Transport.&lt;ref name=egp&gt;"Curt Eysink, "Ex-Teamsters chief Partin dies", ''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'', March 12, 1990, pp. 1, 5A&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Partin organized workers of the Department of Public Works of the Baton Rouge City-Parish government. In 1979, during a teachers' strike in Baton Rouge, Partin placed non-teaching personnel on picket lines in support of the strike. The teachers, however, asked Partin to remove the pickets, and the strike was soon resolved.&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

Partin once spent six months in jail for [[contempt of court]] on the order of U.S. District Judge [[E. Gordon West]] of Baton Rouge. Partin had disobeyed West's order that the Teamsters stop picketing at Delta Concrete.&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

==Death==

On November 27, 1968, in [[Uvalde, Texas|Uvalde]], [[Texas]], Partin, at forty-four, married the 29-year-old former Frances Kay Anselmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.org/tx/uvalde/vitals/marriages/1968/uvaldm68.txt|title=Vital Records - Uvalde County, TX - Marriages 1968|publisher=usgwarchives.org|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a first marriage for Partin. The couple subsequently divorced. 

In his later years, Partin resided in [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]], Mississippi. In January 1990, Partin was admitted to a hospital in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]], because of circulatory problems in his legs. After an unsuccessful operation, he spent a week in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], with a daughter, Janice P. Barlow. He then was admitted to a hospital in [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], Louisiana, and finally to the Guest House nursing home on Florida Boulevard in Baton Rouge. There Partin died at the age of sixty-six of complications from [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

Survivors included his mother, Bessie Foster of [[Baker, Louisiana|Baker]] in [[East Baton Rouge Parish]]; five daughters, Janice Barlow of Tulsa, Glenda Gail Lang of [[Rialto, California|Rialto]], [[California]], Cynthia Mitchen of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]], Teresa P. Gaydos of Baton Rouge, and Brenda P. Canton Kyzar of McComb, Mississippi; two sons, Edward Partin, Jr., then of [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], and later of [[Slaughter, Louisiana|Slaughter]], Louisiana, and Byron Keith Partin of Baker, later of Ethel in [[East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana|East Feliciana Parish]]; two sisters, Hazel E. Chancellor (1926)of [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]], Texas, and Sandra Ann Foster Guy of Baker; two brothers, Donald L. Partin, Sr. (1927–1999),&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; and his wife, Vivian Roberts Partin, of [[Crosby, Mississippi|Crosby]], Mississippi, and Douglas Wesley Partin, Sr. (born c. 1930) of Baton Rouge and later Crosby, Mississippi; fifteen grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barlowgenealogy.com/Louisiana/laobituaries.html|title=Obituaries: Barlow and Related Families|publisher=''Baton Rouge State Times'', March 12, 1990, p. 6-!|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Partin nephew, Prentiss Joe Partin (1949-2011), the son of Donald and Vivian Partin, was a native of [[Centreville, Mississippi|Centreville]], Mississippi, and a teacher, coach, principal and East Baton Rouge Parish school administrator from [[Zachary, Louisiana|Zachary]], Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/theadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=prentiss-joe-partin-coach-partin&amp;pid=149153902|title=Prentiss Joe Partin obituary|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'', March 9, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Honorary pallbearers included former Baton Rouge Mayor-President [[W.W. Dumas|Woodrow Wilson Dumas]] and [[Billy Cannon]], a Baton Rouge dentist and a former star [[American football|football]] player at [[Louisiana State University]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Partin is interred at Resthaven Gardens of Memory in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Douglas Partin had succeeded his brother as business agent for Teamsters Local 5 in Baton Rouge, a post that Ed Partin had occupied for three decades.&lt;ref name=egp/&gt; Doug Partin said of his brother: "We all know that he made mistakes. We all do. So many people either hated him or loved him. There was no in-between. . . . "&lt;ref name=egp/&gt;

The '''European Beer Star''' is a [[Food competition|beer competition]], held in 2013 for the tenth time. Consideration is given to types of [[beer]] which have their origins in Europe. All [[breweries]] can participate: local, regional, national and worldwide operating breweries, not only from Europe but from all countries. 

Prizes are awarded to the beers which best fulfill the respective type criteria, and whose taste and quality impresses the most. In 2012, more than 1,300 beers were tested, an increase of 23% compared with 2011.

== Organizers ==
This award has been initiated by the associations [[Private Brauereien Deutschland]], [[Private Brauereien Bayern]] and SIB - the [[association of small and independent breweries of Europe]].

== Expert tasting ==
The tasting is carried out by an expert jury, of independent beer experts from across the world. The yardstick is not the technical laboratory analysis, but a rating from the consumer's viewpoint of sense and taste. The aim of the [[blind tasting]] is to find the beers which best fulfill the type criteria of each category and whose taste as well as quality are the most convincing.

== Awards ==
In each category, the three best beers are awarded a gold, silver and bronze medal. Less than three prizes will be awarded if there are no three beers which meet the specified quality and category standards.

== Consumers' favourites ==
Visitors to [[Brau Beviale]], a [[trade fair]] for the international beverage industry held in [[Nuremberg]], will have the opportunity to cast their vote which beer they prefer.

The '''extinction risk of global warming''' is the risk of [[species]] becoming [[Extinction|extinct]] due to the [[effects of global warming]]. This may be Earth's [[Mass Extinction|sixth major extinction]], often called the [[Anthropocene]] or [[Holocene extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current projections==
The scientific consensus in the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that {{Quotation|"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."
"There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 °C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 °C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."}}

In one study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas, C.D. |author2=Cameron, A. |author3=Green, R.E. |author4=Bakkenes, M. |author5=Beaumont, L.J. |author6=Collingham, Y.C. |author7=Erasmus, B.F.N. |author8=Siqueira, M.F.D. |author9=Grainger, A. |author10= Hannah, L.  | year = 2004 | title = Extinction risk from climate change | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 427 | issue = 6970 | pages = 145–148 | doi= 10.1038/nature02121 | url = http://www.mnp.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/20040108nature.pdf  |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | pmid = 14712274|bibcode = 2004Natur.427..145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction.

Mechanistic studies are documenting extinctions due to recent [[climate change]]: McLaughlin ''et al.'' documented two populations of [[Bay checkerspot butterfly]] being threatened by [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] change.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McLaughlin |first= John F. |date= 2002-04-30 |title= Climate change hastens population extinctions |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume= 99 |issue= 9 |pages= 6070–6074 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.052131199 |url= http://www.nd.edu/~hellmann/pnas.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |pmc= 122903 |accessdate= 2007-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604183008/http://www.nd.edu/~hellmann/pnas.pdf |archivedate = 2007-06-04 |pmid=11972020 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.6070M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parmesan states, "Few studies have been conducted at a scale that encompasses an entire species"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Permesan |first= Camille |date= 2006-08-24 |title= Ecological and Evolutionary Responses to Recent Climate Change |journal= [[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume= 37 |pages= 637–669 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.37.091305.110100 |url= http://cns.utexas.edu/communications/File/AnnRev_CCimpacts2006.pdf |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-03-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070105021545/http://cns.utexas.edu/communications/File/AnnRev_CCimpacts2006.pdf |archivedate = 2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McLaughlin ''et al.'' agreed "few mechanistic studies have linked extinctions to recent climate change."&lt;ref name="McLaughlin" /&gt;

In 2008, the [[Lemur-like Ringtail Possum|white lemuroid possum]] was reported to be the first known [[mammal]] species to be driven extinct by man-made [[global warming]]. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of [[North Queensland|northern Queensland]] is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16875 Rumours of possum's death were greatly exaggerated] March 31, 2009 [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the January 4, 2012 ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by [[Mark C. Urban]], an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0106/Climate-change-models-flawed-extinction-rate-likely-higher-than-predicted|title=Climate change models flawed, extinction rate likely higher than predicted|date= January 6, 2012 |publisher=[[csmonitor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the [[background extinction rate]], and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don’t belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''February Album Writing Month''' or '''FAWM''' is an annual [[songwriting]] challenge. The challenge is to compose 14 original songs in the 28 days of February.

== History ==

FAWM began in February 2004 as a personal project of singer-songwriter Burr Settles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2005/01/26/0501260768.php madison.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who was inspired after completing a short novel for [[NaNoWriMo]]. He recruited three friends to join him in attempting to compose 14 new songs during the month. Since all four so-called "fawmers" lived in different time zones, they used a blog to track their progress and encourage one another. Each of them met or surpassed the 14-song goal, with 66 songs total.

Due to expressed interest from songwriters who stumbled upon the [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bsettles/fawm2004/ FAWM 2004 archive], the challenge was opened up to the public in February 2005 at [http://www.fawm.org FAWM.ORG], where the challenge has remained. Registered users may post [[demo recordings]] of their new songs to keep track of their progress and elicit feedback. Participation and song output roughly doubled annually up to 2008: 

:  2005 - 513 songs, 25 completed the challenge*
:  2006 - 1,372 songs, 71 completed
:  2007 - 2,706 songs, 128 completed
:  2008 - 5,710 songs, 522 active fawmers, 280 completed
:  2009 - 7,375 songs, 754 active, 339 completed
:  2010 - 10,263 songs, 1,073 active, 487 completed
:  2011 - 10,450 songs, 1,238 active, 497 completed
:  2012 - 11,015 songs, 1,325 active, 465 completed
:  2013 - 9,687 songs&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130302010204/http://fawm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
:  2014 - 9,894 songs&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140304191003/http://fawm.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
:  2015 - 10,936 songs
:  2017 - 11,239 songs, 457 fawmers completed the challenge
:    (*some completed more than the 14 songs)

In 2008, because of a Leap Year (29 Days), the ante was upped to 14½ songs &amp;mdash; the extra half-song being a songwriting collaboration. In the years since, collaborative songwriting has become a staple of the FAWM community.

The project also produces a [[compilation CD]] series, entitled ''14 Songs In 28 Days''. Each album documents the corresponding year's FAWM event, and previous releases have been met with critical praise from indie-music magazines such as [[Wonkavision]] and [[PopMatters]].

Many so-called "fawmers" are professional musicians who have also released FAWM-penned songs on their own albums. A notable example is a three-way collaboration between [http://www.jeffpitcher.com/ Jefferson Pitcher], [http://www.christiankiefer.com/ Christian Kiefer], and Matthew Gerken ([http://www.nicemonstermusic.com/ Nice Monster]), who each wrote songs about 14 U.S. presidencies for FAWM 2006 (for a total of 42, saving the then-current President Bush for a later collaboration). The result, titled '' [[Of Great and Mortal Men: 43 Songs for 43 U.S. Presidencies]] '' was released as a triple-CD set during the 2008 election season&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95509966].&lt;/ref&gt;

FAWMers keep in contact with each other throughout the year at companion website, [http://www.fawmers.com www.fawmers.com]

== Genres ==

Fawmers compose music of all genres and styles, though the most prevalent are [[Folk music|folk]], [[indie rock]], and singer-songwriter. In order to spur creativity and work outside of ruts, fawmers periodically create new "genres" and challenges, such as:
* '''Strangle Disco''' - [[Dance music]] usually involving [[classical music]] samples
* '''Crucio''' - A songwriting game similar to [[Tag (game)|tag]]
* '''Exquisite Corpse''' - A songwriting equivalent of the classic game, wherein one person writes 60 seconds of a song, then passes only the last 10 seconds to the next person, who continues the song, and so on.
* '''Morphing''' - A songwriting equivalent of the classic game Telephone.  Each person in the songwriting chain must write a song based on the previous song, by changing half of it.
* '''Explore the core''' - Recording several highly different versions of the same lyrics and chords.
* '''Feasting''' - Writing and recording lots of songs in one session in a short space of time.
* '''Auntie Sin''' - Someone writes the antithesis of the first song in the chain, then the next person writes a synthesis of the first two songs, then the next person writes the antithesis of the third song, then the next person writes a synthesis of songs three and four, and so on.
* '''Skirmish''' - A title/prompt is announced and songwriters must immediately write a song in the space of the next hour.

The FAWM Challenge is popular among participants in other timed artistic challenges, such as [[NaNoWriMo]], [[Songfight]], 50 Songs in 90 Days, Sounds of the Weak, National Solo Album Month (NaSoAlMo) and Album-a-Day. FAWM was also the model inspiration for the [[RPM Challenge]], which encourages its participants to record a 10-song album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/14712-column-get-that-out-of-your-mouth-23 Pitchfork Feature: Column: Get That Out of Your Mouth #23&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival''' was a four-day festival held in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] between 8–10 December 2010. It screened eight films from around the world that dealt with [[human rights]] issues at a macro as well as at a micro level; from global concerns to indigenous issues. The festival coincided with the [[International Human Rights Day]] on 10 December 2010.

== Program ==
The eight documentaries screened at Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival were part of the Matter of Act program at Movies That Matter film festival 2010 held in March 2010 at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]. The films highlight the work done by [[human rights defenders]] across the world and the dangers they face in their work, which are not always in countries where [[civil liberties]] are honored. Festival director Sridhar Rangayan said, "I saw these films as a jury member at the festival in the Netherlands and was so moved by the films, I was determined to bring them to India to share with audiences here."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-movies-that-tell-a-thousand-words-1477637 | title=Movies that tell a thousand words | date=7 December 2010 | first=Namita | last=Handa | publisher=DNA | accessdate=25 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The films dealt with human rights issues like [[human trafficking]] and [[prostitution of children]]; Violations of [[international laws]] on [[war]] and [[peace]]; Atrocities under [[military regime]]s; [[Religious fundamentalism]] and [[homophobia]]; women's rights and [[honor killings]]; and civil war and the killing of innocents.

Each day of the screenings, panel discussions were held on each topic screened. The panelists included filmmakers Bishakha Datta, Vinta Nanda; rights activist Priti Patkar, advocates [[Colin Gonsalves]], PA Sebastian, Flavia Agnes and Usha Andevar. The panels were moderated by Vinta Nanda, Dalip Daswani and Gargi Sen respectively. Three of the activists portrayed in the documentaries: [[Rebiya Kadeer]], [[Somaly Mam]], and [[Mu Sochua]], have been nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Messages sent by them and some of the film-makers were shared with the audience at the festival. Film director and [[rights activist]] [[Mahesh Bhatt]] inaugurated the festival by asking "how do we as a society... go about igniting change in 'this climate of collective apathy to human suffering'" together with theatre actress and director [[Dolly Thakore]]. Of the festival, she said "This will open up avenues and provide a direction to youngsters".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A wide range of questions and discussions emerged from the audience of social activists, filmmakers, and film buffs, such as whether [[honor killing]]s are different from [[stoning]]s, how different are democracies with [[cartel]]s and autocracies, what the relationship is between violence and families, and how individuals can effect change in the world.

== Organizers ==
The festival was conceived and founded by [[Sridhar Rangayan]], who is also the festival director. Gargi Sen is the co-director. The festival was organized by [[Solaris Pictures]] (Mumbai) along with Magic Lantern Foundation (New Delhi) and Movies That Matter (Netherlands) in association with the [[Alliance française]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaces the [[Forgery Act 1913]], the [[Coinage Offences Act 1936]] and parts of the [[Forgery Act 1861]]. It implements&lt;ref&gt;Hansard (House of Commons), 19 June 1981, col 1292, Norman Miscampbell.&lt;/ref&gt; recommendations made by the Law Commission in their report on forgery and counterfeit currency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]]. Criminal Law: Report on Forgery and Counterfeit Currency. (Law Com 55). 17 July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part I - Forgery and kindred offences==
These offences are the intentional creation and publication of documents which, if not fake, would have legal force. These sections of the law cover all manner of documents, for example [[wills]], [[contracts]], and [[promissory notes]].

Section 1 creates the offence of [[Forgery#England and Wales and Northern Ireland|forgery]].

Section 2 creates the offence of [[copying a false instrument]].

Section 3 creates the offence of [[uttering|using a false instrument]].

Section 4 creates the offence of [[using a copy of a false instrument]].

Section 13 abolished the [[common law offence]] of forgery.

==Part II - Counterfeiting and kindred offences==

Section 27 defines the expressions "currency note" and "protected coin".
This section makes it illegal to forge or counterfeit money. In addition to the money of the United Kingdom it explicitly states that certain foreign coins are ''protected coins'' under this act, and counterfeiting them is just as great an offence as  counterfeiting coins of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=blackstone/&gt;

'''Protected coin'''

Section 27(1) provides that, in Part II of the Act, the expression "protected coin" means any coin which is customarily used as money in any country, or which is specified for the purposes of Part II in an order made by the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]].

The following coins have been specified for the purposes of Part II:
*[[Sovereign (British coin)|Sovereign]]&lt;ref name=PC1981-505&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting (Protected Coins) Order 1981 (S.I. 1981/505), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/1505/article/2/made article 2] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/1505/schedule/made Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Half sovereign]]&lt;ref name=PC1981-505/&gt;
*[[Krugerrand]]&lt;ref name=PC1981-505/&gt;
*Any coin denominated as a fraction of a Krugerrand.&lt;ref name=PC1981-505/&gt;
*[[Maria Theresia thaler]] bearing the date of 1780.&lt;ref name=PC1981-505/&gt;
*Any [[euro coin]] produced in accordance with Council Regulation No. 975/98/EC (OJ No. L139, 11.5.98, p.&amp;nbsp;6.) by or at the instance of a [[Member state of the European Union|member state]] which has adopted the [[Euro|single currency]] in accordance with the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]].&lt;ref&gt;The Forgery and Counterfeiting (Protected Coins) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/2095), [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2095/article/2/made article 2(1)] (as read with article 2(2))&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orders made under this section'''

The power conferred on the Treasury by section 27(1) has been exercised by the following orders:
*The [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1981/1505/contents/made Forgery and Counterfeiting (Protected Coins) Order 1981] (S.I. 1981/505)
*The [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2095/contents/made Forgery and Counterfeiting (Protected Coins) Order 1999] (S.I. 1999/2095)

==Part III - Miscellaneous and general==

'''The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing''' ('''GHC''') is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of women in computing. The celebration, named after computer scientist [[Grace Hopper]], is organized by the [[Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]. The 2018 conference was held in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] on September 26-28.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ghc.anitab.org/2018-attend/location/|title=2018 Location - Grace Hopper Celebration|work=Grace Hopper Celebration|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
In 1994, [[Anita Borg]] and [[Telle Whitney]] founded the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. With the initial idea of creating a conference by and for women computer scientists, Borg and Whitney met over dinner, with a blank sheet of paper, having no idea how to start a conference, and started to plan out their vision. The first Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing was held in Washington, D.C., in June 1994, and brought together 500 technical women.&lt;ref name="biogvid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anita Borg Celebration: Changing the World for Women and Technology|url=https://www.youtube.com/abiwt#p/c/71607DB3B12823E9/2/resEXQgcaJo|work=Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=22 June 2011|date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a dozen conferences have been held from 1994 to the present; the second was held in 1997 and the conference has been held annually since 2006.&lt;ref name="2008ghc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Colborn|first=Kate|title=2008 Grace Hopper Celebration: "We build a better world"|url=http://www.diversitycareers.com/articles/pro/08-decjan/soc_news_grace_hopper.htm|work=Diversity/Careers|publisher=Diversity/Careers|accessdate=29 June 2011|date=December 2008 – January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005121/http://www.diversitycareers.com/articles/pro/08-decjan/soc_news_grace_hopper.htm|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sold-out 2010 conference attracted 2,147 attendees from 29 countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''Hellenotamiai''' ([[Attic Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἑλληνοταμίαι}}&lt;ref&gt;In an Old Attic Greek inscription the word is found as [[Heta|ℎ]]ελλενοταμίασι: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=294479&amp;bookid=172&amp;region=1&amp;subregion=71 SEG 39:21] (archaic spelling, inflected form).&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] term indicating a group of public [[treasurer]]s.&lt;ref name="DGRA"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Hellenotamiae  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]  | volume =   | pages = 590–591  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0597.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Hellenotamiae'' were ten [[magistrate]]s appointed by the [[Athens|Athenians]] (one from each [[phyle#Attic_tribes|tribe]], possibly by election) to receive the contributions of the allied states, and were the [[chief financial officer]]s of the [[Delian League]].&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Gomme  | first = Arnold Wycombe  | author-link = Arnold Wycombe Gomme | contribution = hellenotamiai  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume =   | pages =   | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996  | contribution-url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were first appointed in 477 BC, when [[Classical Athens|Athens]], in consequence of the conduct of the [[Sparta]]n general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]], had obtained the command of the allied states.  The money paid by the different states, which was originally fixed at 460 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]], was deposited in [[Delos]], which was the place of meeting for the discussion of all common interests; and there can be no doubt that the Hellenotamiai not only received, but were also the guardians of these monies, which were called by [[Xenophon]] ''Hellenotamia'' ({{lang|grc|Ἑλληνοταμία}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''de Vectig.'' v. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], i.95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plut"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Aristides]]'' 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andocides]], ''de Pace'' p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

The office was retained after the [[treasury]] was transferred from [[Delos]] to [[Athens]] in 454/453 BC,&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt; on the proposal of the [[Samos|Samians]].&lt;ref name="plut"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], xii. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  From 453 BC they paid the [[First Fruits]] to the treasury of [[Athena]], and disbursed payments on the authority of the assembly, usually to [[strategos|Athenian general]] on campaign, but also for construction (e.g. [[Acropolis]] buildings).  Some time around the oligarchic coup of 411 BC, a board of twenty Hellenotamiae were given authority over the state treasury of Athens, as well as that of the [[Delian League]].&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;

The office was  abolished on the conquest of Athens by the [[Peloponnesian League|Peloponnesians]] in 404 BC.  The Hellenotamiae were not reappointed after the restoration of the democracy; for which reason the [[Philologist|grammarians]] give us little information regarding their responsibilities and duties.  The German classical scholar [[Philipp August Boeckh]], however, concluded from inscriptions that they were probably ten in number, chosen by lot (like the treasurers of the gods) out of the ''[[Pentacosiomedimni]]'', and that they did not enter upon their office at the beginning of the year, but after the [[Panathenaea]] and the first ''Prytaneia''.  With regard to their duties, Böckh supposes that they remained treasurers of the monies collected from the allies, and that payments for certain objects were assigned to them.  In the first place they would of course pay the expenses of wars in the common cause, as the contributions were originally designed for that purpose; but as the Athenians in course of time considered the money as their own property, the Hellenotamiai had to pay the ''[[Theorica]]'' and military expenses not connected with wars on behalf of the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp August Boeckh]], ''The Public Economy of Athens'' p. 176, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Corp. Inscrip.'' No. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hooker Oak''' was an extremely large valley oak tree (''[[Quercus lobata]]'') in [[Chico, California]]. Amateur botanist and local socialite [[Annie Bidwell]], whose husband had founded Chico, named the tree in 1887 after [[England|English]] [[botanist]] and Director of the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanical Gardens]] Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]. It was featured in the 1938 film ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]]. The tree fell in 1977 and portions of the wood was later milled for use by local artisans.

== Discovery ==

Upon first seeing the tree in 1872, Hooker declared the tree to be the largest of its species in the known world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BbYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RUkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1093%2C2774155 | title=Sycamore is largest tree for hardwood | work=The Pittsburgh Press | date=Jan 24, 1916 | accessdate=15 October 2015 | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then other valley oaks have been found of similar size. On January 7, 1958, the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''  reported that in 1921 the Hooker Oak was over {{convert|110|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and estimated that 7,885 people could stand under its canopy assuming {{convert|2|sqft|m2|1|abbr=on}} per person.

== Death ==

When it fell on May 1, 1977, it was nearly a hundred feet tall (30 m) and at {{convert|8|ft|m|spell=in}} from the ground, {{convert|29|ft|m}} in circumference. The largest branch measured {{convert|111|ft|m}} from trunk to tip and the circumference of outside branches was nearly {{convert|500|ft|m|spell=in}}. Its age had been estimated at a thousand years, but on its demise it was found to be two trees, of 325 years each which had long ago grown into one.

=== Disposition ===

[[Image:80s Loggers and Hooker Oak.jpg|left|thumb|Photo of loggers alongside the main trunk of the Hooker Oak.]]
For three years after falling, the tree lay on the ground while city leaders struggled to finally determine its fate. In the spring of 1980, the City of Chico commissioned Cal Oak Lumber Company to remove and reclaim sound portions of the tree at Cal Oak's [[Oroville, California|Oroville]] hardwood plant. They were allowed to retain some of the wood as compensation. After milling the oak, Cal Oak arranged for the lumber to be dried at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]'s Forest Products Laboratory.

Cal Oak set up a program using local artisans as well as the work training centers for the handicapped to produce a limited number of artistically designed items from its share of the tree. Many of these were given to various institutions, which included the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens]] in [[London]], the [[Butte County, California|Butte County]] Historical Society, [[Bidwell Mansion]], Sacramento Valley Museum, [[Butte College]], [[California State University, Chico]], and the University of California at Berkeley. The [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens]] also received acorns from the original tree in 1981 and planted them in their gardens.

=== Characteristics ===

Personnel at both Cal Oak and University of California Berkeley Forestry Lab became intrigued with the lumber. The wood turned out to be as remarkable as was the tree. In order to support its immense crown, the tree grew an abnormal portion of support wood on the upper side of its limbs and stems. This type wood is known as "tension wood" and helped provide the tree with an unbelievable high density: .88 [[specific gravity]], roughly 50% heavier than surrounding oaks. This together with other special characteristics, provided the wood with its unique grain and character, and the tree, apparently with its longevity.

== In popular culture ==

The gavel used at City Council meetings by the mayor of Chico was made from the Hooker Oak. The public benches in the lobby of the Chico City Council Chambers were made out of Hooker Oak wood by local artist Paul Atkins.

The Hooker Oak was featured Warner Brothers Studio's film ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938).  [[Errol Flynn]] as [[Robin Hood]] forms his outlaw band beside the tree (called the "Gallows Oak" in the film).

The location of the tree is registered as a [[California Historical Landmark]]&lt;ref name=CHL&gt;{{cite ohp |id=313  |name=Hooker Oak |accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found in [[Bidwell Park]]. A booklet, "The History of the Hooker Oak" was written by Debra Moon for the City Of Chico Bidwell Park Centennial Hooker Oak Bench Project and printed in July 2005.

'''INTERMAT''' is an international exhibition of equipment, machinery and techniques for the construction and materials industries, which is held every three years in Paris.

== History ==
INTERMAT is a major international event&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfmbusiness.com/toute-linfo-eco/immobilier-patrimoine/bilan-dintermat-un-barom%C3%A8tre-de-la-croissance-rassurant-pour-2&lt;/ref&gt; showing the equipment and techniques used in the international building and civil engineering sectors. It's the world's third largest exhibition in this sector.

First called EXPOMAT, the exhibition was initially held at the [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport]].
The show only became INTERMAT in 1988 when it took place at [[Parc des Expositions de Villepinte]] for the very first time.

This trade exhibition is organised by CISMA and Seimat, French professional trade unions for the equipment industry, together with [[Comexposium]], a French [[trade show]] organiser.

Several manufacturers display their [[construction machinery]] and equipment in a dedicated outdoor demonstration area called INTERMAT Demo, providing the opportunity to highlight machinery and equipment performance in simulated working conditions. The programme includes demonstrations of site machinery: backhoe loaders, mechanical diggers, [[mini-excavators]], [[loader (equipment)|loader]]s and [[graders]].

In the context of the history of the 20th century, the '''interwar period''' was the period between the end of the [[First World War]] in November 1918 and the beginning of the [[Second World War]] in September 1939.

Despite the relatively short period of time, this period represented an era of significant changes worldwide. Petroleum and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the [[Roaring Twenties]] (and the [[Golden Twenties]]), a period of economic prosperity and growth for the [[middle class]] in North America, Europe and many other parts of the world. Automobiles, electric lighting, radio broadcasts and more became commonplace among populations in the developed world. The indulgences of this era subsequently were followed by the [[Great Depression]], an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn which severely damaged many of the world's largest economies.

Politically, this era coincided with the rise of [[communism]], starting in Russia with the [[October Revolution]], at the end of World War I, and ended with the rise of [[fascism]], particularly in [[Germany]] and in [[Italy]]. [[China]] was in the midst of long period of instability and [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] between the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Communist Party of China]]. The Empires of [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French colonial empire|France]] and others faced challenges as [[imperialism]] was increasingly viewed negatively in Europe, and independence movements in [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]] and other regions gained momentum. 

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Germany|German]] empires were dismantled. The [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German colonial empire|German Empire's colonies]] were redistributed among the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. The far western part of the Russian Empire broke away: [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] became independent nation states, while [[Bessarabia]] (the [[Republic of Moldova]]) chose to reunify with [[Romania]]. 

The Communists in Moscow managed to regain control in Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was split]], with the [[Irish Free State|larger part]] being independent of Britain. In the [[Middle East]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] gained independence. During the Great Depression, Latin American countries nationalised many foreign companies (particularly American) in a bid to strengthen their local economies. [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Japanese]], [[Lebensraum|German]], [[Italian irredentism|Italian]] and [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Russian]] territorial ambitions led to expansions of these empires, which set the stage for the subsequent world war.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 is considered the start of [[World War II]] and the end of the interwar period.&lt;ref name=Overy-2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Overy |first=R J |authorlink=Richard Overy |title=The Inter-war Crisis, 1919–1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phthPgAACAAJ |edition=2nd revised |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |location=London, New York |isbn=978-1-1381-379-36 |orig-year=1st pub. 2010:Longman |oclc=949747872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turmoil in Europe==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}
Following the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] that ended World War I, the years 1919–24 were marked by turmoil as affected regions struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilising effects of the loss of four large historic empires: the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There were numerous new nations in Eastern Europe, most of them small in size. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other Allies, the Americans came up with the [[Dawes Plan]] and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known, especially in Germany, as the "[[Golden Twenties]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bärbel Schrader, and Jürgen Schebera. ''The" golden" twenties: art and literature in the Weimar Republic'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==
{{main|International relations (1919–1939)}}
The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues, such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects; the expectations and failures of the [[League of Nations]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan Todd|title=The Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlw30T44PS0C&amp;pg=PA58|year=2001|pages=52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationships of the new countries to the old; the distrustful relations of the [[Soviet Union]] to the capitalist world; peace and disarmament efforts; responses to the [[Great Depression]] starting in 1929; the collapse of world trade; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one; the growth of economic autarky; Japanese aggressiveness toward [[Republic of China|China]], occupying most of China's pacific coastline, as well as border disputes with the Soviet Union and Japanese Empire leading to [[Soviet-Japanese border conflicts|multiple clashes along the Soviet and Japanese occupied manchurian border]]; Fascist diplomacy, including the aggressive moves by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany; the [[Spanish Civil War]]; Italy's [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion and occupation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia)]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the [[appeasement]] of Germany's expansionist moves toward the German-speaking state of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]], the region inhabitanted by ethnic germans called the [[sudetenland]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarization of the Legue of Nations demilitarized zone of the German Rhineland]] region, and the last, desperate stages of rearmament as the second world war increasingly loomed.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rich, ''Great Power Diplomacy since 1914'' (2003) pp. 70–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disarmament was high on the popular agenda. The League of Nations played little role, but the United States and Britain took the lead. U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] sponsored the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921 in fixing how many major ships each major country was allowed.  The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s.  Britain played a leading role in the 1927 [[Geneva Naval Conference]] and the  1930 London Conference that led to the [[London Naval Treaty]]. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia to go along led to the meaningless [[Second London Naval Treaty]] of 1936.  Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. O'Connor, "The" Yardstick" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920's." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' 45.3 (1958): 441-463. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889320 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. J. C. McKercher, "The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s." ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 4#3 (1993): 35-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roaring Twenties==
{{Main|1920s|Roaring Twenties|Golden Twenties|Années folles}}

The "[[Roaring Twenties]]" highlighted novel and highly visible social and cultural trends and innovations. These trends, made possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like New York, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, and London. The [[Jazz Age]] began and [[Art Deco]] peaked.&lt;ref&gt;Jody Blake, ''Le Tumulte Noir: modernist art and popular entertainment in jazz-age Paris, 1900–1930'' (Penn State Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Duncan, ''Art Deco Complete: the definitive guide to the decorative arts of the 1920s and 1930s'' (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; For women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did bobbed hair with a [[Finger wave|marcel wave]]. The young women who pioneered these trends were called "[[flappers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=S|title=What made the twenties roar?|year=1999|volume=131|issue=10|pages=3–18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all was new: [[Return to normalcy|“normalcy” returned]] to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional wartime passions in the United States, France, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Maier, ''Recasting bourgeois Europe: stabilization in France, Germany, and Italy in the decade after World War I'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The leftist revolutions in Finland, Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Spain were defeated by conservatives, but succeeded in Russia, which became the base for Soviet Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Martel, ed.|title=A Companion to Europe 1900–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZglcJuJWrYC&amp;pg=PT449|year=2011|pages=449–50|isbn=9781444391671}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the fascists came to power under Mussolini after threatening a [[March on Rome]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamish Macdonald|title=Mussolini and Italian Fascism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=221W9vKkWrcC&amp;pg=PT20|year=1998|publisher=Nelson Thornes|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most independent countries enacted [[women's suffrage]] in the interwar era, including Canada in 1917 (though Quebec held out longer), Britain in 1918, and the United States in 1920. There were a few major countries that held out until after the Second World War (such as France, Switzerland and Portugal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Garrick Bailey|author2=James Peoples|title=Essentials of Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VcWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=208|isbn=1285415558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Hume argues:
: The women's contribution to the war effort combined with failures of the previous systems' of Government made it more difficult than hitherto to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Hume|title=The National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies 1897–1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1TlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT281|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=281|isbn=9781317213260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, according to Derek Aldcroft and Steven Morewood, "Nearly all countries registered some economic progress in the 1920s and most of them managed to regain or surpass their pre-war income and production levels by the end of the decade." The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Greece did especially well, while Eastern Europe did poorly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Derek Howard Aldcroft|author2=Steven Morewood|title=The European Economy Since 1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3tlP_6nKCcC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=44, 46|isbn=9780415438896}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advanced economies the prosperity reached middle class households and many in the working class. with radio, automobiles, telephones, and electric lighting and appliances. There was unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media began to focus on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars. Major cities built large sports stadiums for the fans, in addition to palatial [[Movie theater|cinemas]]. The mechanization of agriculture continued apace, producing on expansion of output that lowered prices, and made many farm workers redundant. Often they moved to nearby industrial towns and cities.

==Great Depression==
The [[Great Depression]] was a severe worldwide [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] that took place after 1929. The timing varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Garraty, ''The Great Depression'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Charles Duhigg, "Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets", ''The New York Times'', March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The depression originated in the United States and became worldwide news with the [[stock market crash]] of October 29, 1929 (known as [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide GDP fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lowenstein, "History Repeating," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-hall-of-mirrors-by-barry-eichengreen-1421192283?autologin=y ''Wall Street Journal'' Jan 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, ''Great Depression'' (1986) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both [[developed country|rich]] and [[developing country|poor]]. Personal income, tax revenue, profits, and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%.&lt;ref name="Frank_Bernanke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Robert H.|last2=Bernanke|first2=Ben S.|title= Principles of Macroeconomics|publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin|year=2007|edition=3rd|page=98|isbn= 0-07-319397-6|volume=|url=|accessdate=|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices fell sharply, especially for mining and agricultural commodities. Business profits fell sharply as well, with a sharp reduction in new business starts.

[[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries.

The [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany gave way to two episodes of political and economic turmoil, the first culminated in the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation of 1923]] and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. The second convulsion, brought on by the worldwide depression, resulted in the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism]]. In Asia, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] became an ever more assertive power, especially with regard to [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]].&lt;ref&gt;[[C. L. Mowat]], ed.

===Fascism displaces democracy ===
Democracy and prosperity largely went together in the 1920s. Economic disaster led to a distrust in the effectiveness of democracy and its collapse in most of Europe, including the Baltic and Balkan countries, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. Powerful expansionary dictatorships emerged in Italy, Japan, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee, ''European Dictatorships 1918–1945'' (Routledge, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

While communism was tightly contained in the isolated Soviet Union, fascism took control of Italy in 1922; as the depression worsened, it took over Germany, and played a major role in numerous countries in Europe, and several in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 ''(1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Fascist parties sprang up, attuned to local right-wing traditions, but also possessing common features that typically included extreme militaristic nationalism, economic self-containment, threats and aggression toward neighboring countries, oppression of minorities, ridicule of democracy while using its techniques to mobilize an angry lower middle class base, and disgust with cultural liberalism. Fascists believed in power, violence, male superiority, and a natural hierarchy, often led by dictators such as [[Benito Mussolini]] or [[Adolf Hitler]]. Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Soucy, "Fascism" [https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism/Common-characteristics-of-fascist-movements ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish Civil War (1936–39)===
{{main|Spanish Civil War}}
Spain had never had a stable history in centuries, and in 1936-39 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century. The real importance comes from outside countries. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalists, led by General [[Francisco Franco]]. The Republican (or "Loyalist") government, which had been elected in a democratic election in 1935, was on the defensive, but it received significant help from the Soviet Union, and from international volunteers. Led by Great Britain and France, and including the United States, most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side. The fear was that this localized conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that was strongly opposed by the vast majority of Europeans and Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp 262-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (2nd ed. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the Nationalists won in 1939. The military intervention was decisive, as the Spanish army sided with the Nationalists, and together with Italian infantry and German air force and armored units overwhelmed the government forces. The Soviet Union provided armaments  but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the  "International Brigades" of outside far-left volunteers. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics, conservatives and fascists.  Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Carr, ''The Comintern and the Spanish Civil War'' (1984) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Whealey, ''Hitler and Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Brown and Wm Roger Louis, eds., ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume IV: The Twentieth Century'' (1999) pp. 1–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British pride, its finance, and its trade-oriented economy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lee ''Aspects of British political history, 1914–1995'' (1996) p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Roger Louis, ''Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez and Decolonization'' (2006) pp. 294–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

India strongly supported the Empire in the First World War. It expected a reward, but failed to get home rule as the [[British Raj|Raj]] kept control in British hands and feared another rebellion like that of 1857. The [[Government of India Act 1919]] failed to satisfy demand for independence. Mounting tension, particularly in the [[Punjab region]], culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]] in 1919. Nationalism surged and centered in the Congress Party led by [[Mohandas Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Anthony Low and Rajat Kanta Ray, ''Congress and the Raj: facets of the Indian struggle, 1917–47'' (Oxford UP, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Sayer, "British reaction to the Amritsar massacre 1919–1920."

Egypt had been under de facto British control since the 1880s, despite its nominal ownership by the Ottoman Empire.

Egypt joined the League of Nations.

In [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The [[1917 Balfour Declaration]], which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|revolted in 1936]]. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Jewish insurgency]].&lt;ref&gt;Mowat 12:269–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland) were self-governing and gained semi-independence in the World War. Britain still controlled foreign policy and defence. The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy was recognised in 1923 and formalised by the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]]. Ireland effectively broke all ties with London in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Mowat, 12:373–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Interwar France|French colonial empire}}
French census statistics from 1931 show an imperial population, outside of France itself, of 64.3 million people living on 11.9 million square kilometers. Of the total population, 39.1 million lived in Africa and 24.5 million lived in Asia; 700,000 lived in the Caribbean area or islands in the South Pacific. The largest colonies were Indochina with 21.5 million (in five separate colonies), Algeria with 6.6 million, Morocco, with 5.4 million, and West Africa with 14.6 million in nine colonies. The total includes 1.9 million Europeans, and 350,000 "assimilated" natives.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Ingram Priestley, ''France overseas: a study of modern imperialism'' (1938) pp. 440–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt in North Africa Against Spain and France===

The Berber independence leader [[Abd el-Krim]] (1882-1963) organized armed resistance against the Spanish and French for control of Morocco. The Spanish had faced unrest off and on from the 1890s, but in 1921 Spanish forces were massacred at the [[Battle of Annual]] El-Krim founded an independent [[Rif Republic]]  that operated until 1926 but had no international recognition. Paris and Madrid agreed to collaborate to destroy it. They sent in 200,000 soldiers, forcing el-Krim to surrender in 1926; he was exiled in the Pacific until 1947.  Morocco became quiet, and in 1936 became the base from which [[Francisco Franco]] launched his revolt against Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Mikaberidze|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjQfo3a1eVMC&amp;pg=PA15|date= 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{Main|Weimar Republic|History of Germany}}

===Weimar Republic===
The humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies, of Alsace and Lorraine, and of predominantly Polish districts. The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland, and Germany was not allowed to have a real army, navy, or air force. Reparations were demanded, especially by France, involving shipments of raw materials, as well as annual payments.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw, ''Weimar: Why did German Democracy Fail?''&lt;/ref&gt;

When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The German government printed vast quantities of paper money, causing hyperinflation, which also damaged the French economy.  The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved. Weimar added new internal enemies every year, as anti-democratic Nazis, Nationalists, and Communists battled each other in the streets. See [[1920s German inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric D. Weitz, ''Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy, and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Elz, "Foreign policy" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009)  pp. 50–77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi era, 1933–39===
{{main|Nazi Germany|Causes of World War II}}
Hitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe.  He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies.  Until August 1939, the Nazis denounced Communists and the Soviet Union as the greatest enemy, along with the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' (2005) and Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1938 Naka yoshi sangoku.jpg|upright=0.65|thumb|A Japanese poster promoting the [[Axis Powers|Axis cooperation]] in 1938.]]
Hitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]], and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance ("axis") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and [[World War II]] began&amp;nbsp;– somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''Hitler's foreign policy 1933–1939: The road to World War II.'' (2013), Originally published in two volumes.&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing the "Rome-Berlin axis" with [[Benito Mussolini]], and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Japan&amp;nbsp;– which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937&amp;nbsp;– Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&amp;nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cameron Watt, ''How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938–1939'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Overy, ''The Origins of the Second World War'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]], and French Prime Minister [[Édouard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaipėda Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of [[appeasement]] towards Hitler had failed.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cameron Watt, ''How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938–1939'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J.

[[File:Impero italiano.svg|thumb|right|Maximum extent of Imperial Italy]]

In 1922, the leader of the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascist]] movement, [[Benito Mussolini]], became [[Prime Minister of Italy]] after the [[March on Rome]]. Mussolini resolved the question of sovereignty over the [[Dodecanese]] at the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which formalized Italian administration of both Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, in return for a payment to [[Turkey]], the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, though he failed in an attempt to extract a mandate of a portion of Iraq from Britain.

The month following the ratification of the Lausanne treaty, Mussolini ordered the invasion of the Greek island of [[Corfu]] after the [[Corfu incident]]. The Italian press supported the move, noting that Corfu had been a [[Venetian Ionian Islands|Venetian possession]] for four hundred years. The matter was taken by [[Greece]] to the [[League of Nations]], where Mussolini was convinced by Britain to evacuate Italian troops, in return for reparations from Greece. The confrontation led Britain and Italy to resolve the question of Jubaland in 1924, which was merged into [[Italian Somaliland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, pp. 191–199&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1920s, imperial expansion became an increasingly favoured theme in Mussolini's speeches.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Dennis Mack (1981). ''Mussolini'', p. 170. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst Mussolini's aims were that Italy had to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean that would be able to challenge France or Britain, as well as attain access to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; Mussolini alleged that Italy required uncontested access to the world's oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="salerno"&gt;Salerno, Reynolds Mathewson (2002).

[[Cornell University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was elaborated on in a document he later drew up in 1939 called "The March to the Oceans", and included in the official records of a meeting of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]].&lt;ref name="salerno"/&gt; This text asserted that maritime position determined a nation's independence: countries with free access to the high seas were independent; while those who lacked this, were not. Italy, which only had access to an inland sea without French and British acquiescence, was only a "semi-independent nation", and alleged to be a "prisoner in the Mediterranean":&lt;ref name="salerno"/&gt;

Italy's stance towards [[Spain]] shifted between the 1920s and the 1930s. The Fascist regime in the 1920s held deep antagonism towards Spain due to [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s pro-French foreign policy.

==Regional patterns==
===East Asia: Japanese dominance===
The Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced European models. They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. the most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminum, 85 percent of the iron ore, and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies. it was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States Britain and the Netherlands, which supply the oil and iron.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Fairbank, Edwin O. Reischauer, and Albert M. Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 501-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains. Together with the British Empire it divided up Germany's territories scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the [[Twenty-One Demands]] of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference. at the end of the war, Japan frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its demands for racial parity, and an increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922  because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system, and favored internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 563–612, 666.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy. Japan's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japan's prime minister and the military took more power, leading to the rapid decline in democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul W.

====Japan seizes Manchuria====
In September 1931, the Japanese Army—acting on its own without government approval—seized control of Manchuria, an anarchic area that China had not controlled in decades. It set up a puppet government of [[Manchukuo]]. Britain and France effectively control the League of Nations, which issued the [[Lytton Report]] in 1932, saying that Japan had genuine grievances, but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province. Japan quit the League, Britain took no action.  The US Secretary of State announces that it would not recognize Japan's conquest as legitimate. Germany welcomed Japan's actions.&lt;ref&gt;David Wen-wei Chang, "The Western Powers and Japan's Aggression in China: The League of Nations and 'The Lytton Report'." ''American Journal of Chinese Studies'' (2003): 43-63.

====Toward conquest of China====
The civilian government in Tokyo tried to minimize the Army's aggression in Manchuria, and announced it was withdrawing. On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. The new Prime Minister [[Inukai Tsuyoshi]] tried to negotiate with China, but was assassinated in the [[May 15 Incident]] in 1932, which Ushered in an era of  ultranationalism led by the Army and supported by patriotic societies. It ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James L. Huffman|title=Modern Japan: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWLhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|year=2013|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Army, however, was itself divided into cliques and factions with different strategic viewpoints. One faction saw The Soviet Union is the main enemy, the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalized. Large-scale warfare, known as the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape.  By 1939 military lines had stabilized, with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, Reischauer, and Craig. ''East Asia: The modern transformation'' (1965) pp 589-613&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., government and public opinion—even including those who were isolationist regarding Europe—was resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China.  Meanwhile, the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with Soviet forces in Mongolia at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in summer 1939.  The USSR was too powerful. Tokyo and Moscow [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941]], as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently needed oil fields.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Feis, ''The Road to Pearl Harbor: The Coming of the War Between the United States and Japan'' (1960) pp 8-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward [[import substitution industrialization]]. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] (1933–1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a [[Good Neighbor policy]] and allowed the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] nationalized American oil companies, out of which he created [[Pemex]]. Cárdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together, with Argentina the main hold out.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Bulmer-Thomas, ''The Economic History of Latin America since Independence'' (2nd ed. 2003) pp. 189–231.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
Sports became increasingly popular, drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadia.&lt;ref&gt;David M.K. Sheinin, ed., ''Sports Culture in Latin American History'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee (IOC) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation.  Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In Brazil, however, sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought for control of international sport. The [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris and the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] games in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Cesar R. Torres, "The Latin American 'Olympic Explosion’ of the 1920s: causes and consequences." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 23.7 (2006): 1088–111.&lt;/ref&gt;   

English and Scottish engineers had brought futebol (soccer) to Brazil in the late 19th century. The International Committee of the YMCA of North America and the Playground Association of America played major roles in training coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Guedes, "‘Changing the cultural landscape’: English engineers, American missionaries, and the YMCA bring sports to Brazil–the 1870s to the 1930s." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 28.17 (2011): 2594–608.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the globe after 1912, the [[Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) played the chief role in the transformation of association football into a global game, working with national and regional organizations, and setting up the rules and customs, and establishing championships such as the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dietschy,  "Making football global? FIFA, Europe, and the non-European football world, 1912–74." ''Journal of Global History'' 8.2 (2013): 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Christian Monk with his junior student (Petros) discuss the actual reference of the names "Ilia", "Shebr" and "Shobair" mentioned in the holy book in a remote, worn-out church outside Levant where the [[Caravan (travellers)|Caravan]] of [[Captives of Karbala]] along with Kufa army commander and soldiers reached the church. The soldiers discovers an ancient slate in the church that mentions the name of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]] and damned his murderers and think that the Christian Monk and his student are connected to [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]] somehow and get ready to kill them.

'''La Princesse''' is a 15-metre (50-foot) mechanical [[spider]] designed and operated by French [[performance art]] company [[La Machine (production company)|La Machine]]. The spider was showcased in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], as part of the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] celebrations, travelling around the city between 3-7 September.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4666717.ece|title= Huge mechanical spider to attack Liverpool|publisher=The Times Online|accessdate=2008-09-05 | location=London | first=Jenny | last=Booth | date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was on display in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], as part of Yokohama's 150th anniversary of its port opening.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fa20090424a1.html|title=La Machine invades Yokohama!|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts reviewer Lyn Gardner wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "There were times when it seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|pied piper]]."&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/08/theatre.europeancapitalofculture2008|title=La Machine Liverpool City Centre|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Laprincesseperformer.JPG|thumb|right|A performer on leg of La Princesse in Lord Street, Liverpool]]

The spider was designed by La Machine's [[François Delarozière]], who also designed the mechanical elephant and the giant girl for [[Royal de Luxe]]'s performance of [[The Sultan's Elephant]] which visited London in May 2006.&lt;ref name=L08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|title=La Machine|publisher=Liverpool European Capital of Culture|accessdate=2008-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107125503/http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PHF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|title=Paul Hamlyn Foundation Artichoke Trust L'araignée by La Machine £50,000|publisher=Paul Hamlyn Foundation|accessdate=2008-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912215720/http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|archivedate=2008-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Both projects were brought to the UK by the company and charitable trust [[Artichoke (creative company)|Artichoke]].&lt;ref name=Arti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm|title= Liverpool 2008|publisher=Artichoke|accessdate=2008-09-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081814/http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spider was built in [[Nantes]] in France, using steel and [[Populus|poplar]] wood and complex [[hydraulics]], and took an entire year to construct.

==Performance and narrative==

[[File:La Princesse on move1 2.jpg|thumb|La Princesse moving through the streets of Liverpool|alt=]]

The performance artists of La Machine created a story about the spider with one member of the company playing scientist Joseph Browning who gave interviews to the press. The spider was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of [[Forklift|fortlift trucks]] and [[Aerial work platform|cherry pickers]]. The musicians played specially composed music by [[Dominique Malan]], the special effects were designed by [[Thierry Loridant]] and the costumes were designed by [[Gaelle Choveau]].&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/|title=La Machine Home Introduction|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First appearance ===
On Wednesday 3 September the spider appeared for the first time on the side of [[Concourse House]], a derelict tower block in Lime Street, which had been designed by architect [[Richard Seifert]] and was scheduled for demolition.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/dailynews/2008/09/giant_spider_arrives_in_liverpool.html|title=Giant spider arrives in Liverpool|publisher=Architects Journal|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'The journey begins' ===
On the morning of Friday 5 September, the spider moved to the [[Albert Dock]], and it became active at lunchtime, moving in a small area and spraying the public with water. In the evening the spider travelled from the Albert Dock to the [[Cunard Building]], via [[Salthouse Dock]]. A huge crowd turned out despite the heavy rain. The performance move around the [[The Royal Albert Dock Liverpool|Albert Dock]] and proceeded onto The Strand. The moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the crowd. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and interacted with members of the public. It then turned off the Strand and back into the Albert Dock. Here it paused and was lifted from its traction body by a huge crane and into Salthouse Dock, where it was sprayed (along with the crowd) by huge water cannons. After its 'bath' it returned to its traction body and walked along The Strand to its resting place for the night next to the [[Royal Liver Building|Royal]] [[Royal Liver Building|Liver Building]]. 

=== 'City centre rampage' ===
On Saturday 6 September the spider was due to travel through the streets of Liverpool, 'walking' from the [[Cunard Building]] via Water Street, Castle St, Lord St, Parker St and Ranelagh Place back up to Concourse House. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm the Performance started with the spider ‘awakening’ and starting to walk up [[Water Street, Liverpool|Water Street]] towards the city centre. Liverpool was crowded with its usual Saturday afternoon shopping crowd and the tens of thousands who had turned out to see the spider. The spider ‘walked’ through the middle of the Saturday shopping crowd, up through the city centre's streets, and right into the heart of the city's shopping district. The crowd was dispersed by the moving cordon around the spider. Local media reported that the scene was more representative of a victory parade of a football team or the crowds attracted by the Beatles to the city centre in their heyday.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} One bride could not get through the crowds to her wedding at the Town Hall and had to be helped through the crowd on foot by the police. The spider's musicians played an impromptu wedding march as they fought through the crowd.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Various set pieces took place along the spider's route, involving smoke, fireworks and water cannon. The spider worked its way towards the main shopping area, passing [[Liverpool One]]. When the spider reached the centre of [[Lord Street, Liverpool|Lord Street]], it was covered by a snow shower from above to make it go to sleep. It came to a rest at around 5&amp;nbsp;pm, taking a break before its further exploits that evening.

=== 'The city fights back' ===
The next chapter of the story continued the same day and involved the city ‘fighting back’ and attempting to halt the path of the invading spider. At 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm the spider ‘awoke’ and continued to move up the main shopping street, Church Street. When it reached the top of the street it was met by a barrage of flame cannons. These consisted of long copper pipes, fired with high pressure gas. The heat and noise produced by this halted the spider in its tracks, while a mechanical digger moved in to attempt to fell the beast. The spider then changed its path to escape this and moved upwards towards [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]]. Upon reaching Lime Street the spider was met by huge fans, which blew air to attempted to hold it back. The performance continued onwards towards Lime Street Station and the empty Concourse Tower, where it had first been sighted on Wednesday. A further barrage of flames stopped the spider from moving on any further and it turned towards the station. Cranes then moved in to lift it from its traction body and, with operators still on board, it started to moved into a vertical position. The spider then moved from one crane to another and amazingly attached itself to the side of the tower. A snow shower then engulfed the spider and it went to sleep for the evening.

=== 'The creature departs' ===
On Sunday 7 September a large crowd of spectators went to the Concourse House to see it climb back down the building. The spider then crawled down the streets of Liverpool city centre, spraying the crowd with water. The spider then moved across St Georges Plateau amongst a huge crowd and down towards the [[Queensway Tunnel]]. Fireworks erupted from surrounding buildings as it passed. Watched by tens of thousands of people, it investigated the area outside the Queensway Tunnel's entrance, setting off huge water cannons and flames around the area, followed by hundreds of fireworks which detonated above the spider and the public. The spider then turned to face the crowd and moved backwards as it disappeared in a cloud of smoke into the tunnel entrance.
==Cost==

[[File:La Princesse on move2.jpg|thumb|Showing the puppeteers: three ride on top of the spider and nine under her body, one to operate each leg and one for other operations|alt=]]

The project, which was free to the public, cost between £1.8 and £1.9 million to stage, of which £1.5 million came from the Liverpool Culture Company (in turn funded by the city, the Arts Council and the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]]).&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2008/09/08/farewell-to-1-8m-la-machine-show-as-spider-crawls-away-100252-21702105/2/|title= Farewell to £1.8m La Machine show as spider crawls away|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the project has been defended by [[Phil Redmond]], who is responsible for the performance as Liverpool Culture Company's artistic director.  He said "At £1.5m I think it's actually cheaper than (booking) Macca ([[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]) and it has got us on the front of the [[South China Morning Post]]. So it's good value for money."&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7599960.stm|title= Thousands watch spider 'wake up' |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-09-05 | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the project has come in for criticism in some quarters: the UK mental health charity [[Anxiety (mental health charity)|Anxiety]] has highlighted the potentially traumatic effect of the production upon those suffering with [[arachnophobia]],"&lt;ref name=LDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/09/05/la-machine-nightmare-for-all-arachnophobics-64375-21679200/|title= La Machine: Nightmare for all arachnophobics|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[TaxPayers' Alliance]] has called the artwork an "outrageous waste of taxpayers' money".&lt;ref name=MOS/&gt; The vast majority of the public response was positive, however, with most of the belief that "The Liverpool Princesse's" performance was the highlight of the city's Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. On 8 September, ''[[BBC North West Tonight]]'', a regional news programme, revealed that plans were afoot to secure La Princesse to stay permanently in Liverpool, and talks had already been held with La Machine. 

Although the event was free to the public, there has been a shortfall of between £300,000 and £400,000 in funding for the project, exacerbated by the falling exchange rate with the [[Euro]], the currency in which the French participants are paid. Artichoke has appealed for donations to help fund the project.&lt;ref name=LE/&gt;&lt;ref name=LM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/index.php/help/|title= Help|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com/artichoketrust|title= Artichoke Trust|publisher=Just Giving|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leskovac Grill Festival''' ({{lang-sr|Роштиљијада / Roštiljijada}}, also translated as "barbecue week") is a yearly grilled-meat festival organised in [[Leskovac]], [[Serbia]] at the beginning of September. During the event, the main boulevard is closed for traffic, night and day for five days, and all its way there are grill-stands constructed, to create many temporary restaurants. Many visitors from all over Serbia and many tourists from abroad come to Leskovac to enjoy a grill and entertainment. The organisers hold competitions, such as in making the World Biggest Burger - the [[Pljeskavica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Počela leskovačka Roštiljada|url=http://www.b92.net/video/videos.php?nav_category=905&amp;yyyy=2013&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=746814|publisher=B92|accessdate=5 October 2013|quote=najavljeno je i pravljenje najveće pljeskavice na svetu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival is the highlight of the season in Leskovac.

'''Liquicity''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[liquid drum and bass]] [[record label]], [[YouTube]] channel and events promotor, run by Maris Goudzwaard and Mark van der Schoot (better known by his stage name [[Maduk (musician)|Maduk]]) since 2011.&lt;ref name="Meadow"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.youredm.com/2014/11/11/liquicity-founders-detail-how-to-make-it-as-a-youtube-label/ |title=Liquicity: How to Make it as a YouTube Label |author=Matthew Meadow |work=Your EDM |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Netsky at Liquicity Festival 2015.webm|left|thumb|[[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]] playing a liquid remix of "[[Waves (Mr Probz song)|Waves]]" at Liquicity Festival 2015.]]
Maris Goudzwaard created his ''Liquicity'' YouTube channel in 2008, with the idea of starting an entirely new subculture within Drum &amp; Bass. He curated a particular type of drum and bass music that had previously not been labeled, and by doing so gave shape to a worldwide music community. The channel quickly attracted fans –who would become known as "Liquicitizens"– with the same musical taste, and artists from the same genre featured on the channel gradually formed a close group.&lt;ref name="Meadow"/&gt;

In the summer of 2011, Goudzwaard heard Maduk's first track, "Avalon", and contacted him to promote it on the Liquicity channel, with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://drumandbass.nl/dit-is-maduk/ |title=Dit is: Maduk |author=Marc |work=DrumAndBass.nl |date=16 June 2012 |accessdate=3 June 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperation between the two evolved into a team, and Liquicity Records was established as a label a few months later.&lt;ref name="Meadow"/&gt;

In January 2013, they founded a new company for Liquicity events and label matters.&lt;ref name="3voor12"/&gt; Through the combination of music promotion, record label and events, the duo's hobby grew out to a full-time job.&lt;ref name="Meadow"/&gt;

== Events ==
In March 2013, the first small Liquicity event was held in [[Ruigoord]] near [[Amsterdam]]. Attracting liquid fans from across Europe, the sold-out event was a success.&lt;ref name="3voor12"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/amsterdam/artikelen/artikel/rubriek/in-bed/2013/marckus.html |title=Marckus a.k.a.

|‘Umar ibn Sa'ad, the head of Kufan army, sent a messenger to Husayn to inquire about the purpose of his coming to Iraq. Husayn answered again that he had responded to the invitation of the people of Kufa but was ready to leave if they now disliked his presence. When Umar ibn Sa'ad, the head of Kufan army, reported it back to ibn Ziyad, the governor instructed him to offer Ḥusayn and his supporters the opportunity to swear allegiance to Yazid. He also ordered Umar to cut off Husayn and his followers from access to the water of the Euphrates.[8] On the next morning, as ʿOmar b. Saʿd arranged the Kufan army in battle order, Al-Hurr ibn Yazid al Tamimi challenged him and went over to Al-Ḥusayn. He addressed the Kufans in vain, rebuking them for their treachery to the grandson of Muhammad, and was killed in the battle

'''''Live at The Gaslight 1962''''' is a live album including ten songs from early [[Bob Dylan]] performances on October 15th, 1962 at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. Released in 2005 by [[Columbia Records]], it was originally distributed through an exclusive 18-month deal with [[Starbucks]], after which it was released to the general retail market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobdylan.com/date/1962-10-15-gaslight-café/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' was recorded early in Dylan's career, when he was still virtually unknown outside Greenwich Village. Thanks to the cooperation of various club owners, and the management skills of [[Dave Van Ronk]]'s wife, Terri Thal, Dylan was able to record a number of performances during that time on a reel-to-reel tape recorder patched into the house PA system. It is believed that ''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' was culled from tapes recorded with this arrangement. But in 2016, during a video interview promoting the release of Dylan's Live 1966 box, sound engineer Richard Alderson, who had built the Gaslight's sound system and would later handle the sound for Dylan's 1966 tour, claimed he was the one who recorded the Gaslight performances at the request of the Gaslight's owners during an after hours show.

These Gaslight recordings have circulated among Dylan collectors for many years. They made their first appearance on [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] [[LP (format)|LPs]] no later than 1973, and have appeared, in various forms, on several bootleg LPs and CDs and on many Dylan fan CDR projects. The full set of recordings, including 17 tracks, is usually referred to by Dylan collectors as the "Second Gaslight Tape", but some refer to the recordings as a compilation of the "Second" and "Third Gaslight Tape", believing them to be compiled from two different sets at The Gaslight. The source recording is not continuous, and its exact provenance has not been firmly established. 
 
Two tracks from these recordings were previously released on official Dylan albums: "No More Auction Block" appeared on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991]]'' in 1991 and "Handsome Molly" appeared on the [[Japan]]ese release ''[[Live 1961–2000: Thirty-Nine Years of Great Concert Performances]]''. A third track, "[[The Cuckoo (song)|The Cuckoo (Is a Pretty Bird)]]", was included on a promotional CD distributed in U.S. retail markets in association with the official release of ''Chronicles, Vol. 1''.

The Gaslight recordings had been warmly received by critics and collectors alike ever since [[Greil Marcus]] wrote about them in the late 1960s. When this CD was officially released, the critical consensus remained positive, with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s David Browne giving it an A- grade. "Although [Dylan] was too young to pull off the burnout elegy 'Moonshiner,'" wrote Browne, "''Gaslight'' is a spellbinding reminder that Dylan was never a typical folkie (or typical anything, for that matter)."

==HMV Canada dispute==
During an 18-month deal whereby [[Starbucks]] had exclusive rights to sell the album, [[HMV]] Canada pulled all Bob Dylan products off their shelves in protest. Similar joint ventures in the past also brought protest from HMV, affecting sales of [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Alanis Morissette]]. HMV began stocking their shelves with Dylan's albums (albeit sparingly) in December 2005 in order to capitalize on the Christmas season. HMV fully restored Dylan's discography to their shelves in the spring of 2006. Afterwards, in order to appease frustrated HMV customers, Columbia offered the ''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' CD as a free giveaway with any Bob Dylan purchase at HMV stores.

==Songs==
''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' captures early performances of three different Dylan compositions: "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" (often referred to as "Hard Rain"), "[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]", and "John Brown". Both "Hard Rain" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" would eventually appear on Dylan's second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''. "John Brown" would later be published and issued on ''Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1'' in February 1963, but it would not be released on any of Dylan's subsequent studio albums (the song only re-appeared as a live performance on Dylan's 1995 ''[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' album.)

The remaining songs on ''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' are considered traditional folk songs; essays on a number of ballads performed by Dylan during his October residency at the Gaslight Cafe can be found in an anthology published in 2004 entitled ''The Rose &amp; the Briar: Death, Love and Liberty in the American Ballad''.

"Rocks and Gravel" is Dylan's own adaptation of [[Brownie McGhee]]'s "Solid Road" and [[Leroy Carr]]'s "Alabama Woman", an arrangement that fuses both songs into one. It was originally slated to appear on Dylan's second album (and later appeared on test pressings made for a preliminary version of the LP), but when Dylan reconfigured ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'', he omitted "Rocks And Gravel" from the final album sequence.

"The Cuckoo" was originally recorded in the 1920s by Western North Carolina banjo musician Clarence Ashley. According to Thomas Goldsmith of ''[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]'', "The Cuckoo" is reportedly descended from an old folk ballad; it's an interior monologue where the singer "relates his desires—to gamble, to win, to regain love's affection."&lt;ref name="cuckoo"&gt;{{cite news|title=The beauty and mystery of ballads|last=Goldsmith|page=G5|first=Thomas|date=February 6, 2005 |work=[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by critic Dave Marsh as "the most widespread folk song in the English language", "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]" dates as far back as the 17th century, when Samuel Pepys wrote about the song in a diary entry dated January 2, 1665. Similar but different versions of the ballad have been traced to English and Scottish folk traditions, and when "Barbara Allen" was brought to North America by early European settlers, no particular version of "Barbara Allen" was dominant or considered definitive. Over the years, countless variations of "Barbara Allen" have been found throughout the United States, with roughly 100 variations in [[Virginia]] alone, but the version Dylan sings on ''Live at The Gaslight 1962'' is one rooted in the English folk tradition.

In the story of "Barbara Allen", the title character rejects a suitor (his name varies in different versions of the songs, ranging from Sweet William to John Graeme). On his death bed, he calls Barbara Allen to his side, swearing his love for her. However, in some versions of "Barbara Allen" (particularly older variations), he discovers Barbara Allen's complaint that he once neglected her in a local tavern. When she sees him on his death bed, she offers a cold observation, "Young man, I think you're dying."

The story then takes a strange twist: when Barbara Allen walks home, she hears the church bells tolling for her true love. She then dies, mysteriously, and the two are buried in an old churchyard, where a love knot then comes to twine, made from a rose growing out of her lover's heart and a brier from Barbara Allen's.

Towards the end of his essay on "Barbara Allen", Dave Marsh focuses on the outcome of the song, the intertwined rose and briar emerging from the graves of the spurned lover, and Barbara Allen's rejection of her true love. "What’s amazing is our ability to ignore the lesson that 'Barbara Allen' has to teach," writes Marsh, "which is the peril of denying the complicated mysteries that throb within our hardened hearts and the equal peril of horsing around instead of acknowledging our love for one another. This is not a lesson you can squeeze onto a tombstone, or, for that matter, our current conception of a curriculum, but it is one to carry through this life."

'''''lonelygirl15''''' is a [[web series]] that ran from June 16, 2006 to August 1, 2008. Initially pretending to be an authentic [[YouTube]] video diary or [[vlog]], the show gained wide media attention when it was outed as [[fiction]]al in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/lonelygirl15-one-of-youtubes-first-ever-viral-stars-returns-after-eight-years-in-eerie-video-a7097411.html|title=Lonelygirl15 is back with a very eerie video|date=2016-06-23|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Launched in the early days of YouTube, just 16 months after the video platform went online, ''lonelygirl15'' focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Bree – played by the then 19-year-old actress [[Jessica Lee Rose|Jessica Rose]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2006/09/the_identity_of.php|title= SVW Exclusive: The identity of LonelyGirl15|accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – whose [[YouTube]] username is the [[eponym]]ous "lonelygirl15". After the fictional status of the show was revealed in September 2006, it gradually evolved into a multi-character series including both character [[vlog|videoblogs]] and action sequences, with a complex story [[fictional universe|universe]] involving "trait positive girls" who are sought by an evil organization called "The Order".

The three creators of ''lonelygirl15'' were [[Mesh Flinders]], a screenwriter and filmmaker from [[Marin County, California]], Miles Beckett, a surgical residency dropout turned filmmaker, and Greg Goodfried, a former attorney with Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, LLP.&lt;ref name = NYTimes&gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/technology/12cnd-lonely.html?hp&amp;ex=1158120000&amp;en=a56f0e777a707f56&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage | title = 'Lonely Girl' (and Friends) Just Wanted Movie Deal | publisher = The New York Times | author = [[Virginia Heffernan|Heffernan, Virginia]] and Zeller, Tom | date = 2006-09-12 | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was developed under the working title ''The Children of Anchor Cove''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNjcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY5OTI4MTEmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3|title=She fooled fans ... and is now famous|last=Gentile|first=Gary|date=September 17, 2006|publisher=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=20 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116222301/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjczN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkxNjcmZmdiZWw3Zjd2cWVlRUV5eTY5OTI4MTEmeXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3|archivedate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; New videos appeared, eventually at the rate of four to five clips a week, first on YouTube and ''lg15.com'', and later on [[MySpace]]. As of July 2008, the series had more than 110 million combined views.

''lonelygirl15'' has generated a number of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] shows. Its first, the British-based ''[[KateModern]]'', ran from July 2007 through June 2008 on [[Bebo]], and took place in the same fictional universe.

Along with Amanda Goodfried, an attorney who worked with Creative Arts Agency (CAA), the creators of ''lonelygirl15'' created LG15 Studios to produce original interactive content online.  LG15 Studios became [[EQAL]] in April 2008, with receipt of $5 million in venture capital to expand their offerings.

The ''lonelygirl15'' finale took place on August 1, 2008, and included a teaser for [[EQAL]]'s next spinoff, [[LG15: The Resistance]], which ran through December 2008.

Since 2009, [[EQAL]] has aired two more spinoff series which are produced by contest winners, including ''LG15: The Last'', which started airing in January 2009, and ''LG15: Outbreak'', which began in January 2010.

On June 16, 2016, the tenth anniversary of the first video on the account, a new video on the account with Jessica Lee Rose returning as Bree Avery was uploaded, with a message that the series was restarting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwklfIbSAgA&lt;/ref&gt; This revival appears to have been aborted, as no further videos (which were posted on Danielbeast's channel) have appeared since late 2016.

==Cast and characters==

*[[Jessica Lee Rose]] as Bree Avery (a.k.a. ''lonelygirl15''), a bubbly teenage girl whose trait positive blood makes her the target of a dangerous cult called the Order. She gained a large following on YouTube due to her quirky video blogs.
*[[Yousef Abu-Taleb]] as Daniel Barlow &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lg15.com/lgpedia/index.php?title=Daniel_reappears&lt;/ref&gt; (a.k.a. ''Danielbeast''), Bree's best friend, who only wishes to protect her, but is often distracted by romantic engagements. He can often jump to conclusions, and battles with an alcohol addiction along with his parents.
*[[Jackson Davis]] as Jonas Wharton (a.k.a. ''jonastko''), a boy who meets Bree online and discovers that his family has more ties to the Order than he realizes. He can be too willing to trust others, which often leads the TAAG (Teen Angst Adventure Group) into unfortunate situations.
*[[Alexandra Dreyfus]] as Sarah Genatiempo (a.k.a. ''theskyisempty99''), a misunderstood 19-year-old who develops a crush on Daniel and travels with TAAG. While she struggles to figure out what to do with her life, she harbors a dark and dangerous secret.
*Becki Kregoski as Taylor Genatiempo (a.k.a. ''soccerstar4ever''), Sarah's younger sister who has impressive computer hacking skills. A passionate soccer player, she has more social skills than the rest of her family and is often upset by their actions.
*Maxwell Glick as Spencer Gilman (a.k.a. ''LAlabrat''), an employee at [[Neutrogena]] with connections to the Order's science division. Chosen as a good role model for Bree, he sets out to help engineer a Trait Negative Serum.
*Katherine Pawlak as Emma Wharton, Jonas's trait positive younger sister. She grows up significantly during her battle for her life against the Order, and goes out of her way to try to protect her friends.
*[[Melanie Merkosky]] as Jennie, a former Lullaby Project employee who becomes friends with Sarah. She begins a romantic affair with Jonas and gives the TAAG an insight on how the Order's structure works.
*Crystal Young as Gina Hart, Bree's trait positive older sister who was taken from her at birth and used as a lab rat most of her life. She is quiet and reserved, and feels more comfortable with art supplies than with other people.
*Raegan Payne as Sonja, A member of the Hymn of One who tried to recruit Bree and eventually left the Hymn after she was badly beaten.  One of the last videos in the Lonelygirl15 series suggested that Sonja had returned to the Hymn of One.

==History==
Before the vlog was revealed as fake, the title character dealt with mundane teenage problems such as being grounded; ''lonelygirl15'' posted video replies to, and [[name-drop|dropped the names]] of popular YouTubers.  To further the initial illusion that Bree was a real girl, a MySpace page was set up for her and she seemingly began corresponding with many of her fans.

Later the show moved to a bizarre narrative that portrayed her dealings with secret occult practices within her family, and included the mysterious disappearance of her parents after she refused to attend a "secret" ceremony prescribed by the leaders of the family's cult.

===Hoax accusations===
At first discussion regarding why they thought ''lonelygirl15'' might be a fake went on in her video comments. In early August 2006, a fan began a discussion at the previously stagnant www.lonelygirl15.com message boards and raised an investigation into who or what was behind ''lonelygirl15''. Soon the message board became full of discussion about even the tiniest details in each of her videos, everything from the quality of the lighting to the flora seen in her outdoor videos. Fans used the forum to collect, organize and share their findings, and pointed to small inconsistencies within the videos as evidence that the story might not be genuine, wondering if Bree's posts were part of a teaser campaign for a television show or an upcoming movie&lt;ref name = NYmag&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/19376/index.html | title = Hey There, Lonelygirl | first = Adam | last = Sternbergh | publisher = [[New York Magazine]] | date = 2006-08-28 | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to the [[viral marketing]] used to promote ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' or ''[[Cloverfield]]''). Others thought that the blog might be part of an [[alternate reality game]].&lt;ref name=ARG&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.argn.com/archive/000454lonelygirl15_is_she_or_isnt_she.php |title=LonelyGirl15 | first = Lee | last = Cook | work = Alternate Reality Gaming Network | date = 2006-09-29 | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lonelygirl15 bree pmonkey.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bree as lonelygirl15 in a video blog]]
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporter Richard Rushfield was the first to provide proof of a hoax, when he wrote of Shaina Wedmedyk, Chris Patterson, and an [[anonymous blogger]] law student, who set up a [[sting operation|sting]] on MySpace to reveal that the [[Creative Artists Agency]] was behind the videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Eventually it was revealed that 16-year-old "Bree" was played by 19-year-old actress [[Jessica Rose]].&lt;ref name="Flemming"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.slumdance.com/blogs/brian_flemming/archives/002277.html |title= Lonelygirl15 jumps the shark | author = Flemming, Brian | date = 2006-08-21 | accessdate = 2006-09-13 |authorlink = Brian Flemming}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1I1/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.gov.uspto.tow.actions.DetailViewAction/.c/6_0_CH/.ce/7_0_1JJ/.p/5_0_1CH Trademark Application]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media sources seized upon the story, covering both the search process and the eventual "[[outing]]" as a fictional series.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MysteryFuels"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mystery Fuels Huge Popularity of Web's Lonelygirl15 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2006-09-08 |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-lonelygirl8sep08,0,5310001.story |author=Rushfield, Richard and [[Claire Hoffman|Hoffman, Claire]] |accessdate=2006-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016095426/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-lonelygirl8sep08%2C0%2C5310001.story |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TopoftheTube"&gt;{{Cite web| title = lonelygirl15 revealed : jessica rose aspiring actress | url = http://topoftube.blogspot.com/2006/09/lonelygirl15-revealed-jessica-rose.html | work = Top of the Tube | date = 2006-09-12 | accessdate = 2006-09-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061107152229/http://topoftube.blogspot.com/2006/09/lonelygirl15-revealed-jessica-rose.html |archivedate = November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU8iYeAzL1U | title = Lonelygirl15 a.k.a.

''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporter [[Virginia Heffernan]] expanded on the series of revelations on September 12 by publishing an article which confirmed Jessica Rose's identity, and revealed the identities of her "co-conspirators", Ramesh Flinders, a screenwriter and filmmaker from [[Marin County, California]], and Miles Beckett, a doctor-turned-filmmaker. Software engineer Grant Steinfeld was also involved in this project, as a photographer. Amanda Solomon Goodfried assisted in their efforts to hide their identities as well as posed as "Bree"'s online alter-ego. Goodfried's father-in-law, Kenneth Goodfried, handled various legal matters. The personnel involved worked under a [[non-disclosure agreement]], according to Grant Steinfeld. Steinfeld has verified most of this information to the ''Times'', and provided photographs he took of Rose on set as proof.&lt;ref name = NYTimes/&gt;  Also on September 12, the three main creators gave an interview to the ''Los Angeles Times'' revealing the third major partner as Greg Goodfried.&lt;ref name = Brainchild/&gt;

After the fictional nature of ''lonelygirl15'' was revealed, the storyline continued to develop via new videos posted to both YouTube and [[Revver]]. However, after YouTube partnered with Myspace, videos stopped being posted on ''lonelygirl15's'' Revver account, and only became viewable via YouTube and MyspaceTV.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===After the discovery of the hoax===
Jessica Rose participated in a [[United Nations]] campaign in 2006, to fight poverty through an online anti-poverty video.&lt;ref name = AntipovertyPitch &gt;{{Cite news| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116035279914686330 | title = U.N. Enlists Internet Star for Antipoverty Pitch | publisher = Wall Street Journal – online | date = 2006-10-09 | accessdate = 2006-10-09 | work = charity| author = Suzanne Vranica }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose portrayed the ''lonelygirl15'' character as she sat by herself in her bedroom talking to the camera. The subject matter in the video focused on poverty relief, which broke from the regular subject matter of the show. The video was posted on an alternate account, separate from the main channel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2ETsRObMQI Stand Up Lonelygirl15] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2006, lonelygirl15.com announced that the spin-off OpAphid was the official [[alternate reality game]] of ''lonelygirl15''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelygirl15.com/forum/index.php?c=11 lonelygirl15.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629141213/http://www.lonelygirl15.com/forum/index.php?c=11 |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OpAphid began in late September with what many speculated was a well-produced fan effort, and this announcement merged its characters OpAphid, Tachyon, and 10033/Brother, into the series storyline and continuity. In early February 2007, it was revealed that [[Glenn Rubenstein]] was the original [[Puppet Master (gaming)|puppetmaster]] behind the OpAphid alternate reality game and also the creator of its characters, OpAphid, Tachyon, and Brother. Due to internal issues between the Creators and Glenn, OpAphid was no longer the official ARG.

A 2006 episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' was based on the ''lonelygirl15'' phenomenon. The episode "[[Weeping Willow (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Weeping Willow]]" featured a blogger named weepingwillow17, played by [[Michelle Trachtenberg]]. Willow and her boyfriend were kidnapped by [[Men in Black]] who demanded her fans donate money to a website to save their lives. The investigators did not know if Willow was real or fake. Various other video bloggers were also seen decrying weepingwillow as a fake, just like many did on YouTube. The site on the episode was named ''YouLenz''.

==Awards and recognition==
The ''lonelygirl15'' blog won Biggest Web Hit Award on [[VH1]]'s Big in '06 Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/shows/events/big_in/2006/index.jhtml Vh1.com: Big in 06 Awards – It doesn't get any bigger than this!] ''VH1.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Best Series" category of the inaugural YouTube Video awards in March 2007, the ''lonelygirl15'' series finished fourth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/03/26/youtube.awards.ap/index.html cnn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407162337/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/03/26/youtube.awards.ap/index.html |date=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times attributed Lonelygirl's finish to the YouTube community's ill will towards the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/arts/27tube.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login|title=SCREENS; YouTube Awards the Top of Its Heap|last=Heffernan|first=Virginia|date=27 March 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2007, Season One of ''lonelygirl15'' celebrated its finale with an exclusive on MySpaceTV known as "12 in 12" where 12 videos were uploaded over the course of 12 hours from 8 am PST to 7 pm PST, culminating in the highest one-day viewership ever for the series. A "summary" video from the first season was offered as a part of the event, and it logged in over a million views on its own.

* In the last episode of the Season One finale, Bree's character is killed off by the order during the ceremony in the season finale and her trait positive blood was transfused into one of the order's elders. The reason for her character's death was attributed to Rose not renewing her contract for Season Two.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973370.html?categoryid=1009&amp;cs=1 |title=LonelyGirl15 |first=Daniel |last=Frankel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2007-10-04 |accessdate=2008-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
''lonelygirl15'' was the first Internet series to introduce product integration&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/hotsites/2007-08-03-lonelygirl15-finale_N.htm|author=Gentile, Gary | title = Web drama wraps groundbreaking first 'season' | publisher = [[USA Today]] ([[Associated Press]]) | date = August 3, 2007 | accessdate = 2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the episode [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBu5dL4QCnY "Truckstop Reunion"] featured the characters eating and displaying Hershey's Icebreaker's Sours Gum.

In another example of a product integration first, ''lonelygirl15'' landed on the front page of ''Variety'' for the integration of a character from [[Neutrogena]] in the storyline over the period of more than two months. Dr. Spencer Gilman became such a popular character that Neutrogena made him "Employee of the Month" and gave him his own e-mail account on the company's corporate website.

'''Lucy Lightfoot''' is the name of a fictional girl who supposedly disappeared mysteriously from the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1831. The whole incident was made up by the vicar of St. Olaves in the 1960s, which he subsequently admitted.&lt;ref name="JonesMason2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Jones|author2=John Mason|title=Myths and Legends of Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UM4LUoSbyegC&amp;pg=PA28|date=November 2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84537-594-2|pages=28–29|chapter=St. Olaves Church : The Legend Of Lucy Lightfoot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character bio==
Lucy was born at a farm near [[Bowcombe]]. She was last seen around 10:30 on the morning of 13 June 1831. There was a near total eclipse of the sun that day, lasting about half an hour. A violent thunder storm also struck the island, causing flooding and crop damage. After the storm had abated, her horse was found tied to the gate at [[St. Olave's Church, Gatcombe|St. Olave's Church]] in [[Gatcombe]]. Lucy was nowhere to be found. Her parents offered a large award for her return, but moved away after two years searching turned up nothing.

Also of note is the detail that a steel [[Misericorde (weapon)|misericord]] attached to a wooden effigy of Edward Estur was found shattered after her disappearance. A valuable [[chrysoberyl]] set in [[lodestone]] on the hilt was found to be missing.

==Explanations==
The most prominent explanations involved a possible [[time travel|time slip]]. Supposedly research by the Rev Samuel Trelawney in 1865 unearthed a manuscript by [[Phillip de Mezieres|Phillip de Mezières]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Philippe de Mézières, 1327-1405, et la Croisade au xive siècle'' by N. Jorga|author=C. L. Kingsford|journal=The English Historical Review|volume= 13|number= 49|date=Jan 1898|pages= 159–161|publisher= Oxford University Press|jstor= 547723}}&lt;/ref&gt; chancellor of Peter I, listing the names of the English knights recruited by [[Peter I of Cyprus]] in 1363. One Sir [[Edward Estur]] was listed as being accompanied by a girl with the same name as Lucy, from [[Carisbrooke Castle]].

However, it was discovered that the whole incident was made up by the vicar of St. Olaves in the 1960s, which he subsequently admitted.&lt;ref name="JonesMason2006"/&gt;

The '''Mad War''' ({{lang-fr|la Guerre folle}}), also known as the '''War of the Public Weal''', was a late Medieval conflict between a coalition of feudal lords and the French monarchy. It occurred during the regency of [[Anne of Beaujeu]] in the period after the death of [[Louis XI]] and before the majority of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]. The war began in 1485 and ended in 1488.

The principal lords involved were [[Louis XII of France|Louis II of Orléans]], the cousin of the king (and future Louis XII of France); [[Francis II of Brittany]]; [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]]; [[Alain d'Albret]]; [[John IV of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Châlon, Prince of Orange]]; and [[Charles, Count of Angoulême]]. Other leading lords supported the revolt, including [[Philippe de Commines]] and Odet d’Aydie, count of Commines and governor of Guyenne.

As a revolt against French royal authority it was supported by the foreign enemies of the King of France: England, Spain and Austria. Its principal outcome was the absorption of Brittany into the French kingdom.

==Name and extent==

The derogatory expression "Mad War" to designate this struggle of major feudal lords against central royal power was coined by Paul Emile in his ''Histoire des faicts, gestes et conquestes des roys de France'', published in 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Fur. Anne of Brittany. Bookshop Guénégaud Edition: Paris, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some dispute about the extent to which the events can be defined as a single war. It followed a long succession of conflicts between royalty and the great lords of the kingdom in the second half of the 15th century, subsequent to the formation of the [[League of the Public Weal]]. As part of these power struggles, in 1484-1485, Louis II of Orléans, supported by Francis II of Brittany and a certain number of lords, attempted to depose the regent, Anne de Beaujeu. Mostly by a mixture of diplomacy and shows of force, Anne succeeded in breaking the revolt without a major battle. On 2 November 1485, the Peace of Bourges suspended the hostilities.

According to some historians, this ended the first phase of the "Mad War." The second phase of the conflict, from June 1486 to November 1488, is sometimes called the ''War of Brittany''. Other commentators, mainly [[Breton nationalism|Breton nationalists]], distinguish this second phase from the first, making it into a Franco-Breton war, or even a Breton war of independence, sometimes by connecting it to the earlier [[Breton War of Succession]].

==Development==
[[Image:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|left|200px|The pattern of royal lands, duchies and lordly domains in 1477, shortly before the ''Guerre folle'']]
At the beginning of the reign of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], Louis II of Orléans tried to seize the regency, but was rejected by the States General of [[Tours]] (15 January to 11 March 1484). In April, Louis of Orléans left for Brittany to join Duke Francis II. He also sent a request to the pope to annul his marriage, so that he would be free to marry [[Anne of Brittany]], Francis' heir. On 23 November he signed a treaty which envisaged his marriage with Anne. Returning to the royal court, Louis of Orléans tried to take the king into his custody, but Anne de Beaujeu prevented him by force. She stopped some lords of the royal guard, and placed the Duke of Orléans under house arrest at Gien.

Having escaped from Gien on 17 January 1485, Louis tried to invest Paris, but failed. He managed to escape on 3 February to Alençon, and made [[amende honorable]] on 12 March. Royal troops placed around Évreux prevented him from joining Brittany, and he was locked up in Orléans. At the same time, the roused Breton nobility was brought back to order by the royal troops.

On 30 August, Louis of Orléans launched a proclamation against the regency. The royal army went to Orléans, but Louis escaped to Beaugency, from where he was dislodged by the young [[Louis II de La Trémoille]] in September. On 9 August, Francis II of Brittany also agreed to a truce. The truce was agreed for one year, and is known as the ''Peace of Bourges'', signed on 2 November 1485.

==Renewed hostilities==
[[File:Ludvig XII av Frankrike på målning från 1500-talet.jpg|thumb|left|Louis II of Orléans]][[File:Francis II of Brittany tomb Nantes.jpg|thumb|left|Francis II of Brittany]]

With the end of the truce, the rebellion again erupted. Already in June 1486, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Austria]] had invaded the north of France, but then retreated; in November, the rebel François de Dunois seized the castle of [[Parthenay]]. On 11 January 1487, Louis of Orléans escaped from the castle of Blois and, pursued by royal archers, took refuge again in Brittany. The royal army left from Tours at the beginning of February and began its offensive in the southwest. At Bordeaux on 7 March, Odet d’Aydie, the pro-rebel governor of Guyenne, was deposed and replaced by Pierre de Beaujeu. As the royal army suppressed the rebels in Guyenne, Count Charles d'Angoulême surrendered on 19 March 1487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beck|first=Sanderson|title=France in the Renaissance 1453-1517|url=http://www.san.beck.org/8-7-France1453.html#a3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The royal army set out from Bordeaux on the 15th, to take Parthenay on the 30th, Dunois managing to join Louis of Orléans in [[Nantes]]. The royal army then proceeded towards Brittany. With the Treaty of Chateaubriant, most of the Breton nobility came to an accommodation with the king. Royal forces agreed that the Duke would not be threatened by the army, which would leave Brittany as soon as the two rebels (Orléans and Dunois) were captured.

Meanwhile, in the north, the [[Marshal de Esquerdes]] successfully pushed back Maximilian I of Austria, who shortly will be elected King of the Romans prior to becoming [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the south, the Lord de Candale beat Alain d'Albret, a leading rebel, at the Battle of [[Nontron]]. d'Albret had intended to join the rebels in the North, but was forced to give up hostages. In Brittany, the allies of the royal party directed by the Viscount de Rohan held the north of the duchy, and took [[Ploërmel]].

In April 1487, Duke Francis II's attempt to mobilize Breton military forces (nobility and urban militia) failed due to widespread resentment of the corruption of his government. At the same time, the royal army advanced into Brittany. It was accommodated favorably in Châteaubriant, Vitré, Ancenis and Clisson. It besieged Nantes, but Cornish allies of Brittany, helped by foreign mercenaries, broke the siege. At the same time, Norman [[Privateer|corsairs]] blockaded the Breton coast to stop further pro-Breton forces arriving from Britain and elsewhere.

On 20 January 1488, the Dukes of Orléans and Brittany were both declared rebels at the [[Parlement of Paris]]. They and their associates were no longer regarded as vassals, but rather as subjects, and thus guilty of [[lèse-majesté]]. In the spring, the Duke of Orléans renewed the struggle for his ally, taking Vannes, Auray and Ploërmel, and forcing the Viscount of Rohan to capitulate.

On 24 April 1488, a judgment of confiscation was declared against all the goods of Louis of Orléans. Meanwhile, Alain d'Albret had obtained a subsidy from the court of Spain, and thereupon joined the Duke of Brittany with 5000 men. Maximilian I of Austria sent 1500 men to him, and the English leader [[Lord Scales]] successfully landed with additional reinforcements. Despite this concentration of forces the Breton alliance was still outnumbered. It was further weakened because Maximilian I was diverted by a [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria#Second revolt|rebellion in Flanders]], which was being supported by the Marshal de Esquerdes. The various lords supporting the Duke of Brittany were also in dispute with each other for the hand of [[Anne of Brittany]]: Louis of Orléans, Alain d'Albret and Maximilian I all being candidates.

The French royal general Louis II de la Trémoille gathered his forces on the border of the duchy, preparing to attack. On 12 July, royal forces captured [[Fougères]] and then [[Dinan]]. On 28 July 1488, the main Breton and French armies met at the [[Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488)|Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier]]. The Breton forces, led by [[Marshal de Rieux]], were decisively beaten by the French. The defeat put an end to the war. The Duke of Orléans was captured and Duke Francis II was forced to accept a punitive treaty.

==Treaty and aftermath==
On 20 August 1488, the [[Treaty of Sablé]], also known as the "Treaty of le Verger" or "Treaty of the Orchard", was signed between [[Francis II of Brittany]] and King [[Charles VIII of France]]. Francis acknowledged himself as a vassal of the king, promised to remove foreign troops from duchy and to no longer summon such troops, and to pledge the territories conquered by France to remain under their control.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. L. Fisher|Fisher, H.A.L.]] ''The History of England, from the Accession of Henry VII, to the Death of Henry VIII, 1485-1547'' (Volume V). Longmans, Green, and Co., 1906, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craik, G.L. and MacFarlane,C. ''The Pictorial History of England: Being a History of the People, as Well as a History of the Kingdom''. Charles Knight and Company, 1841, p.295. (Original from the New York Public Library).&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, Charles removed his forces from Brittany except in the town garrisons of the territories pledged by Francis. The most interesting stipulation of the pact was that it required the agreement of the French king to any marriage of the daughters of Francis II. Amnesty was granted to d’Aydie, Dunois, and the majority of the combatants. Louis of Orléans was imprisoned in a fortress, but when Charles VIII reached his majority three years later and assumed the regency, he pardoned Louis.

Francis II wanted his daughter Anne to marry [[Maximilian I of Austria]] as a means to (hopefully) ensure the sovereignty of Brittany. Francis II died on 9 September 1488, and Anne was enthroned as duchess in January of the following year. Francis' loyal supporters facilitated the union with Maximilian for Anne in a marriage by proxy held 19 December 1490. Unfortunately, this violated the Treaty of Sablé as the king of France did not consent to this marriage, and it also placed the rule of Brittany in the hands of an enemy of France. As a result, France resumed its armed conflict with Brittany. The spring of 1491 brought new successes by the French general [[Louis II de la Trémoille|La Trémoille]], and Charles VIII of France came to lay siege to Rennes. Maximilian failed to come to his bride's assistance, and Rennes fell. Anne became engaged to Charles and traveled to [[Château de Langeais|Langeais]] to be married. Although Austria made diplomatic protests, Anne was wed to Charles VIII on 6 December 1491. The marriage was subsequently validated by [[Pope Innocent VIII]] on 15 February 1492.

Based on Düsseldorf's long history of trade fairs, the Trade Fair Organisation (Messe) was founded in 1947 as Nordwestdeutsche Ausstellungsgesellschaft mbH (NOWEA), and is now Messe Düsseldorf [[GmbH]] (German form of Ltd.). In 1971, the company moved to the newly built exhibition centre in [[Stockum]], next to the [[Düsseldorf Airport]]. In 1993, it hosted the finals of the [[1993 Davis Cup|Davis Cup]] in one its halls.

'''Michael Ralph Paine''' (June 25, 1928 – March 1, 2018) was an engineer. He became notable after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], because he was an acquaintance of the President's assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. His wife, Ruth Hyde Paine, housed Lee's estranged wife, [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina Oswald]], in her home for several months before the assassination until the day after it.

==Early life==
Paine was born in [[New York, New York]]. His father was [[Lyman Paine]], an architect and activist. His mother was [[Ruth Forbes Young]], financial backer of [[International Peace Academy]] and daughter of Elise Cabot Forbes, a scion of the [[Cabot family]]. He had one sibling: Cameron Paine.&lt;ref name=painetestimony/&gt;

Paine graduated from high school in New York in 1947. He attended [[Harvard University]] for two years in 1947-1949 and [[Swarthmore College]] for a year, but did not graduate.&lt;ref name=painetestimony&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/paine_m1.htm|first=|last=|title=Testimony Of Michael R. Paine|publisher=[[Marquette University]], reproduced from [[Warren Commission]]|date=|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving in the [[U.S. Army]], Paine worked a few months for [[Griswold Manufacturing Co.]] After that, Paine worked at Bartol Research Foundation in [[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]] for about a year. He then worked for his mother's third husband [[Arthur M. Young]], making helicopter models in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=painetestimony/&gt;

In 1958, Paine became employed at [[Bell Helicopter]]&lt;ref name=painetestimony/&gt; through Young, his stepfather and designer of the first commercial helicopter, [[Bell 47]].

==Personal life==
In 1957, he married [[Ruth Paine|Ruth Avery Hyde]] in Pennsylvania. They had two children:&lt;ref name=painetestimony/&gt; Lynn (b. 1959) and Christopher (b. 1961).&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/garage.htm|first=Thomas|last=Mallon|title=Marina and Ruth: The Assassin's Wife and the Quaker Who Took Her In|publisher=[[Marquette University]], reproduced from [[The New Yorker]]|date=December 3, 2001|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, they relocated to 2525 West Fifth Street in [[Irving, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].&lt;ref name=newyorker/&gt; when Paine began work at a Bell Helicopter facility in [[Fort Worth]].  One issue is whether the Minox camera found in the Paine garage belonged to Lee Oswald or to Michael Paine.  Another issue is what activities Lee Oswald and Michael Paine had in common, given Michael Paine's statement to Frontline (Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?, PBS) that he and Lee Oswald shared unspecified interests.

In late September 1962, Paine and his wife Ruth separated, Ruth asked him to have his personal belongings moved out of the house by the time she got back home from traveling around the United States that summer. According to Michael, it was not he, but Ruth who pushed to legally end their marriage. As their divorce made its way through the legal system until it ended in 1970, the Paines continued to see films at the theater together, and their Madrigal singing as a couple continued. Michael kept his own apartment in [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Arington, Texas]], while Ruth remained with Lynn and Christopher in the Irving home. In the end, the divorce was amicable, and Michael kept a very favorable view of Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mrs. Paine's Garage and the Murder of President John F.

On February 22, 1963, Ruth Paine attended a party held at the home of her fellow madrigal singer, Everett Glover, who knew Ruth spoke Russian and thought she would be interested in meeting a couple he knew, [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]] and [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mrs. Paine's Garage and the Murder of John F.

Michael met the Oswalds for the first time on April 2, 1963. when he picked up Lee, Marina, and their baby daughter, June at their apartment at 214 West Neely Street in Dallas so that they could join with him in the small meet and greet dinner Mrs. Paine had cooked for them. From the start, Michael took an immediate dislike toward Lee when he picked the couple and June up. Oswald's demeaning words directed at his wife, Marina, whom Michael told author Thomas Mallon, was "having to take these whiplashes meekly and quietly and obediently," deeply offended him. Over the next seven months, Paine was upset by the fact that he refused to let Marina learn to read, speak, or write in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mrs. Paine's Garage and the Murder of President John F. Kennedy|last=Mallon|first=Thomas|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=2002|isbn=978-0-375-42117-4|location=New York, New York|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Harvey Oswald rented a room in Dallas but stored some of his possessions in [[Ruth Paine Home|Paine's garage]], including a supposed rifle wrapped in a blanket which Paine thought to be camping equipment.&lt;ref name="painetestimony" /&gt; Paine's wife helped Oswald get a job at the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Paine's testimony would later become a central feature of the [[Warren Commission]]'s investigation of the assassination, particularly in regard to the presence of the purported [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|assassination rifle]] in the garage of his family home.

Paine and his wife were portrayed in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' as characters called "Bill and Janet Williams," presumably to avoid legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/jfk100paines.html|first=David|last=Reitzes|title=The JFK 100: "Bill and Janet Williams"|publisher=jfk-online.com|date=2001|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Paine testified that he was a member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref name=painetestimony/&gt;

The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported that Paine died March 1, 2018, in Sebastopol, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Chris|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/8118362-181/michael-paine-debated-politics-with|title=Michael Paine, debated politics with JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, dies at 89|newspaper=Santa Rosa Press Democrat|location=Santa Rosa, California|date=March 15, 2018|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ostalgie''' ({{IPA-de|ˌʔɔstalˈɡiː|lang}}) is a [[German language|German]] term referring to [[nostalgia]] for aspects of life in [[East Germany]]. It is a portmanteau of the German words ''[[wikt:Nostalgie#German|Nostalgie]]'' (nostalgia) and ''[[wikt:Ost#German|Ost]]'' (east). Its [[anglicisation#Anglicisation of non-English-language vocabulary and names|anglicised]] equivalent, '''ostalgia''' (rhyming with "nostalgia"), is also sometimes used.

The term (along with the phrase "Soviet chic") is also occasionally used to refer to nostalgia for life under the Communist system in other former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, such as [[Slovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]]. As with [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union]], there are various motivations, whether ideology, nationalism, wistfulness for a lost sense of social status or stability, or even aesthetics or irony.

==History==
Ostalgie is a complex term that should not be described as a simple emotion of nostalgia. As Ostalgie relates back to the history of the [[Cold War]], it is better to examine this term in the context of history and current influence in Western society; in doing so, the meaning of this term becomes clearer.

The most noticeable differences would be the ruling political parties of East and West Germany. Policy differences of the two parties established the strategies for the process of "restoration" following [[World War II]]. In the West, a capitalist economic system was adopted under the [[Marshall Plan]]. On the other hand, the authority of East Germany was under massive pressure from the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted a more radical economic system that placed more intensive requirements on the individual. Divergence between the two states first appears in their difference in economic system choices. The structure of the two German societies and their people were inevitably distinct from each other under the broad background of the Cold War. Although both East and West Germans share the same language and history, their identities were changed in the dimension of having completely different social lives. Differences between West Germany and East Germany are evident before reunification.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Fulbrook, Ossis and Wessis: the creation of two German societies, German History since 1800 (p.411-431), John Breuilly, Arnold, London&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and the [[German reunification]] that followed a year later, many of the symbols of the ''German Democratic Republic'' were swept away. Almost all ''GDR'' brands (''DDR'' in [[German language|German]]) of products disappeared from the stores and were replaced by Western products. However, after some time many Eastern Germans began to miss more or less aspects of their former lives (like culture or the known brand marks). ''Ostalgie'' particularly refers to the nostalgia for aspects of regular daily life and culture in the former GDR, which disappeared after reunification.&lt;ref&gt;Berdahl, Daphne (1999),  [http://diasporiclivesofobjects2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/east-german-objects-nostaligia.pdf ''Ostalgie for the Present: Memory, Longing and East German Things'', in Ethnos] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by the East German cabaret artist {{Interlanguage link multi|Uwe Steimle|de}} in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Kultur/Buecher/Ostalgiker-Uwe-Steimle-bezeichnet-sich-als-Kleinbuerger|title=Ostalgiker Uwe Steimle bezeichnet sich als Kleinbürger|date=12 October 2012|work=[[Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=de|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:D-Ampelmaennchen-gehen-o.jpg|thumb|An Ost-[[Ampelmännchen]] crosswalk light]]
[[File:Žuti trabant 1,1.jpg|thumb|Old [[trabant]]s still can be found on streets (2014 in [[Hungary]])]]
Many businesses in [[Germany]] cater to those who feel ''Ostalgie'' and have begun providing them with artifacts that remind them of life under the GDR; artifacts that imitate the old ones. Available again are brands of East German food, old state television programmes on [[video]] tape and [[DVD]], and the previously widespread [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]] and [[Trabant]] cars. Life in the GDR has also been the subject of several films, including [[Leander Haußmann]]'s ''[[Sonnenallee]]'' (1999), [[Wolfgang Becker]]'s internationally successful ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' (2003), [[Carsten Fiebeler]]'s ''[[Kleinruppin forever]]'' (2004).

Those seeking the preservation of East German culture banded together to save the "Eastern Crosswalk Man" (Ost-[[Ampelmännchen]]), an illuminated depiction of a man wearing a "perky", "cheerful" and potentially "[[petit bourgeois]]" hat (inspired by a summer photo of [[Erich Honecker]] in a straw hat)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Germany's iconic traffic man turns 50 |url=http://www.thelocal.de/20111013/38197 |publisher=The Local |accessdate=18 May 2014|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in crosswalk lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/28/news/mn-31889 |title=Quaint Crosswalk Symbol Starts a German Movement
|quote=He's dorky and thought a bit sexist, but 'Ossie' endures as a sign that not all things East should go kaput. |date=April 28, 1999 |first=Carol J. |last=Williams |journal=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many German cities in and near the former East German border, including [[Berlin]], [[Lübeck]] and [[Erfurt]], still retain the use of the ''Ampelmännchen'' at all or some pedestrian crossings due to its cultural relevance, and many souvenirs sold in East Germany and in Berlin make use of the icon.

Another example of commercially memorialising East Germany would be the musealization of [[Halle-Neustadt]]. Halle-Neustadt, a city constructed by the East German Government, is now a kind of living museum for East German memory. But more than the meaning of living museum, tourism in Halle-Neustadt is evidence of commercialisation of Ostalgie. In this case, musealization of Ostalgie is somehow connected with a consumerist attitude. Ostalgie in this sense is not a realistic or pragmatic term. It is the artifacts, rather than the social life of East Germany that plays the main role in this commercialization. If the social life of East Germany is more complex than artifacts and symbols, it would be fair to say that musealization of Ostalgie in Halle-Neustadt creates a stereotype of East German life. That is to say, reflection of Ostalgie in Halle-Neustadt should not be considered as an accurate representation of East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyneth Cliver, Ostalgie Revisited: The Musealization of Halle-Neustadt, German Studies Review (p.615-636), The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014, All rights of this source reserved to German Studies Review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
There is no doubt Ostalgie exists in current Germany through commodities and products. Influence of Ostalgie in market is realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, More than "Ostalgie"-East German-era Goods Also a Hit in the West, German Business Review, Transatlantic Euro-American Multimedia LLC, Aug 2007, Portsmouth&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, ostalgie could be inspired by the longing of the ''Ossis'' (German for "Easterners", a term for former GDR citizens) for the social system and the sense of community of the GDR. When the renowned West-German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' asked former GDR-inhabitants whether the GDR "had more good sides than bad sides", 57% of them answered yes. To the statement of the interviewing journalist that "GDR inhabitants did not have the freedom to travel wherever they wanted", Germans replied that "present-day low-wage workers do not have that freedom either".&lt;ref&gt;Julia Bonstein, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/homesick-for-a-dictatorship-majority-of-eastern-germans-feel-life-better-under-communism-a-634122.html "Homesick for a Dictatorship"], in: Der Spiegel, 27/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are also arguments for the actual meaning of this term. The question is if Ostalgie is the expression of nostalgia of former residents of East Germany, or a fantasy created by West Germans? Some might argue that popularity of East German brands and products is a phenomenon resulting from former East German's yearning for getting lost things back. In this discourse, former East Germans are thought be kidding themselves by believing a sort of Utopia in the past.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, Business: Ostalgie; East German products, The Economist, The Economist Intelligence Unit N.A., Incorporated, Sep 13 2003, London&lt;/ref&gt; And on the other hand from Boyer's perspective, Ostalgie is more like a fantasy created by West Germans; a Westalgie. He argues against the common accepted idea of Ostalgie through analysis of multiple dimensions of public culture and discussion of German history.

'''Boyer's Argument of Ostalgie as "West-algie"'''

First, he argues that the idea of [[Nostalgia]] is not new; it is developed as a symptom reflecting disorder of body for centuries. But what is interesting for Boyer about the idea of nostalgia is that nostalgia is found somehow connected with the notion of nation. That is to say, nostalgia is somehow related with nationalism. In this context, miss for the homeland generates love for everything in home country and then transformed to exclusion against foreign stuffs with desire of performing patriotism. But as it has been emphasized by Boyer, the usage of nostalgia is not as serious as it used to be. While in past time, nostalgia is realistic and strengthened by limitation of technology, people's feeling for this word now is relatively lighter due to advancement of society. After demonstration of heaviness of the word nostalgia, Boyer goes on further to conclude that nostalgia in some levels is justified as the physical state of nationalism. And relates this point to discussion of Ostalgie, it is just theoretically impossible to think Ostalgie to be East German's nostalgia. Since nostalgia is connected with the combination of nationalism and departure from nation, it would be very hard to think the cheerful event of reunification become a source of it.

Second, Boyer discusses nostalgia in context of [[World War II|Second World War]], which is a huge historic event in Germany and creates the predicament of ''Vergangenheitsbelastung'' (the past). According to Boyer, the imposed division between West Germany and East Germany is not merely a geopolitical fact that punishes German war crime. More than that, German people also use this geopolitical fact as a deferred confrontation against ethnology during Holocaust. History of Third Reich, which makes German postwar generation shameful and anxious about the past, is clearly a historical burden. And to overcome this burden, one strategy that both Germanys adopt is to claim the other side of Germany is more "German", that the other side is fascism and should be more responsible for war crime during World War II. Boyer goes on further to explain that identification of each state is actually dependent on each other. West Germany needs the existence of East Germany to reflect its own contextual identity, and so does East Germany. The situation has changed since the reunification; the previous "two German States" exist no more, and now East Germany is no longer a valid imagined enemy. But the strategy of constructing a "West German-ness" has not totally vanished. Reunification has not changed the social structure of West Germany significantly, most institutions in West Germany are preserved. So, the strategy of treating East Germany as a perceived enemy could also be preserved after reunification. That is to say, Ostalgie as an idea created in this context could also possibly be used by the West Germans to construct an imaginary image of East Germany, even though East Germany no longer exists in the modern world geography.

Third, Boyer examines current West-East relationship, and what he finds is that West German opinion is dominant in discourse of the West-East relationship and refuses to treat input and opinions from former East German members seriously. Boyer admits that it is possible for former East Germans to fantasize some aspects of the GDR but, he also argues, none of them would fantasize actually returning to the historic GDR. Boyer argues the current construction of Ostalgie has created a "no-place" of East Germany. East Germany in this discourse is only "realistic" from a West German perspective. The East German perspective (despite its individual history, policy, structure, way of life, and outlook), is somehow invalid and thus unable to challenge the imagined "western" image of East Germany. Since the differences between West and East are realistic and profound at both the social and political level, the construction of a "no-place" East Germany is just a utopia (or indeed dystopia) of West German creation.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Boyer, Ostalgie and the Politics of the Future in Eastern Germany, (p361-381)Duke University Press, NC&amp;IL, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also authors, such as Enns Anthony, who suggest that understanding the Ostalgie phenomenon should go "beyond the simple question of whose representation of the GDR is more valid or authentic". Moreover, what matters is the observation of the ''actual'' situation of the former residents of the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;Enns Anthony, The politics of Ostalgie: post-socialist nostalgia in recent German film, (p.475-491) Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partnership for Transparency''', officially named '''Partnership for Transparency Fund''' is a [[not-for-profit]] [[anti-corruption]] organization that tackles small scale [[corruption]] around the world. Founded in 2000, the organization is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], with affiliates in the [[Philippines]], [[India]], [[South Africa]] and [[Germany]].

The organization provides technical assistance and mobilizes resources to aid partner civil society organizations (CSOs) that engage citizens in actions to improve governance, increase transparency and reduce corruption in developing countries. The stated mission is to advance innovative citizen-led approaches to improve governance, increase transparency, promote the rule of law and reduce corruption in developing and emerging countries. In one part of India, an investment of under $300,000 over three years saw corruption reduced in the public distribution system, helping over 48,000 families.

An independent review by the [[Department for International Development]] found Partnership for Transparency (PTF) to be effective and encouraged donors to support them. Since its inception, PTF has supported 162 civil society organizations in 66 countries completing over 260 projects. PTF's model relies on the support of volunteer professionals who provide pro-bono assistance.

==Early life and education==
Rychagov was born on 2 January 1911 in the village of Nizhnie Likhobory, which forms part of present-day Moscow. In 1928, he joined the [[Red Army]], trained at the Leningrad Military College of the Air Forces, from which he graduated in 1930. In 1931, he enrolled for further training at the 2nd Military College for Pilots.&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

==Military career==

===Fighter pilot===
For five years, Rychagov was an ordinary fighter pilot, building up skills before becoming commander of an aviation squadron in [[Kiev]] Military District. In 1936, he was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] for exemplary service; he was also amongst the first Soviet volunteers to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

The most intense part of Rychagov's career as a fighter pilot came in the Spanish Civil War. On 28 October 1936, Rychagov, leading a group of 15 Soviet pilots flying 25 [[Polikarpov I-15]] aircraft, landed in [[Cartagena, Spain]]. A few days later, a further group of 10 pilots and 15 aircraft arrived in [[Bilbao]].&lt;ref name="Maslov"&gt;Maslov, Mikhail A. ''Polikarpov I-15, I-16 and I-153''. Oxford, UK: Osprey  Publishing, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-84603-981-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rychagov's fighter group saw their first action on 4 November. On that day, they shot down two [[Junkers Ju 52]]s and  two [[Fiat CR.32]]s over [[Madrid]], while no losses were reported among the Soviet pilots. During the next two days, Rychagov's pilots claimed 12 more victories, at the cost of two aircraft lost.&lt;ref name="Maslov"/&gt;

However, on 16 November, Rychagov was shot down over Madrid by Fiat CR.32s,&lt;ref name="Maslov" /&gt; and four days later the number of combat-ready Soviet aircraft in the area had dropped to 15. Seven had been lost in combat, two had been forced to land, and one was undergoing repair.&lt;ref name="Maslov"/&gt; Rychagov, however, stayed on to fight into the spring of 1937. In December 1936 and January 1937 two more shipments of 30 Polikarpovs I-15s arrived in Spain, allowing the formation of a complete combat unit of four I-15 squadrons.&lt;ref name="Maslov"/&gt; By the end of the war, Rychagov's fighter group claimed 40 victories overall.&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

He returned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1937 for a short time, where he was promoted to Brigadier General at the young age of 26. In 1938, he led another group of volunteers to [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]], where he participated in several skirmishes with the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

===Commander===
In December 1939, he was promoted to the rank of Major General; he was also appointed Commander of the 9th Air Force Army. He directed operations in the [[Winter War]] against [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

In May 1940, a third [[Order of the Red Banner]] was presented to Rychagov. He was promoted to Lieutenant General several months later.&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

By 1940, Rychagov was a member of the top administration of the Air Force. He was appointed Head of Red Army Air Force Administration and became a member of the Red Army Chief Military Council, a predecessor of the [[Stavka#Stavka of the RKKA during World War II|Stavka]]. Eventually, he was appointed Commander of the VVS on 28 August 1940, succeeding [[Yakov Smushkevich]].&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hooton 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parrish" /&gt;

==Death==
Shortly before [[Operation Barbarossa]], Rychagov was removed from the position of Commander of the VVS as part of the [[purge of the Red Army in 1941]], to be replaced by [[Pavel Zhigarev]].&lt;ref name="Hooton 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="parrish" /&gt; This was the result of a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] inquiry into the high accident rate in the Air Force. Furthermore, in May 1941, a German [[Junkers Ju 52]] landed in Moscow, undetected by the ADF beforehand, leading to massive arrests among the Air Force leadership.&lt;ref name="lib.ru"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lib.ru/POLITOLOG/SUDOPLATOW/specoperacii.txt | script-title=ru:Павел Судоплатов.

On 24 June, two days after the German invasion began, Rychagov was arrested.&lt;ref name="parrish" /&gt; Some other high-profile arrests made by the [[NKVD]] in 1941 included:&lt;ref name="parrish" /&gt;

* 30 May: People's Commissar of Ammunition Ivan Sergeyev and Major General [[Ernst Schacht]]
* 31 May: Lieutenant General Pyotr Pumpur
* 7 June: People's Commissar of Armaments [[Boris Vannikov]] and Colonel General [[Grigory Shtern]]
* 8 June: Lieutenant General [[Yakov Smushkevich]]
* 18 June: Lieutenant General Pavel Alekseyev
* 19 June: Colonel General [[Alexander Loktionov]]
* 24 June: General [[Kirill Meretskov]]
* 27 June: Lieutenant General Ivan Proskurov

Rychagov was tortured and executed on 28 October 1941 along with his wife.&lt;ref name="executedtoday" /&gt; Others who were executed that day included 20 other Soviet officers (including Rychagov's predecessors in the VVS, [[Yakov Smushkevich]] and [[Aleksandr Loktionov]]),&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book | title=World War II Soviet Armed Forces (1): 1939–41 | publisher=Osprey Publishing | author=Thomas, Nigel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rychagov was exonerated posthumously in 1954.&lt;ref name="surfcity" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2727">[[Image:Picrous.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of the Picrous day story "Piskies in the cellar"]]
'''Picrous Day''' was a festival celebrated by the tin miners of [[Cornwall]] on the 1st Thursday before [[Christmas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cornishculture.co.uk/portfolio/picrous-day/&lt;/ref&gt;  This is believed to be the feast of the discovery of [[tin]] by a man named Picrous whom [[miner]]s in the East of Cornwall celebrated as the founder of their industry instead of [[St Piran]]. 

[[Robert Hunt (scientist)|Robert Hunt]] in his ''Popular Romances of the West of England'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The second Thursday before Christmas-day is a festival observed by the tinners of the district of Blackmore, and known as Picrous day. It is not at present marked by any distinctive ceremonies, but it is the occasion of a supper and much merry-making. The owner of the tin-stream contributes a shilling a man towards it. This is said to be the feast of the discovery of tin by a man named Picrous. My first impression was that the day took its name from the circumstance of a pie forming the pièce de résistance of the supper; but this explanation is not allowed by tinners, nor sanctioned by the usages of the feast. What truth there may be in the tradition of the first tinner, Picrous, it is now too late to discover, but the notion is worth recording. It has occurred to me whether, from some similarity between the names (not a close one, I admit it), the honours of Picrous may not have been transferred to [[St Piran]], who is generally said to be the patron saint of tinners. [[St Piran]] is not known in Blackmore, and his festival is on the 5th of March. The tinners also have a festival to commemorate the discovery of smelting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Robert|title=Popular Romances of the West of England|date=1865|publisher=John Camden Hotten|location=London|page=311|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DaFSG2WHXPgC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=Picrous+Day&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTgavbqIfYAhVGDsAKHXRGBKIQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Picrous%20Day&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Picrous day is believed to have been especially popular in [[Luxulyan]] where celebrations were held at the Rising Sun Inn.

'''''Pipes''''' is a [[television advertisement]] in the United Kingdom for [[Tango (drink)|Tango Orange]], which first aired in October 2004.

The advertisement was in the "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" campaign for the drink, which was revived in 2002. The thirty second clip shows a man wrapped in a carpet filled with oranges, balanced on top of five concrete pipes, with both the carpet and pipes attached to a string, which at the other end was attached to a sheet of grass. 

A goat is shown eating the grass, to a point where the grass sheet moves, thus the string is broken and the carpet and pipes roll down a hill, until they hit a tree, with the man still inside, followed by the five concrete pipes quickly running into the carpet. The man crawls out the carpet as the "commentator" describes the event as "the hit of the whole fruit".

On 11 November 2004, [[Remembrance Day]], the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] Watchdog banned the advertisement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4004867.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Watchdog bans Tango advertisement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The watchdog took the rare step of acting before a formal decision was reached on whether the advert, for Tango, had breached industry rules. The watchdog, which received four complaints, feared children could copy the commercial and harm themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; This meant that considered re runs of the adverts in the beginning of 2005 were cancelled.

Despite the immediate ban, the [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre]] said it "strongly disagreed" that it could lead to accidents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4037135.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Row over Tango advertisement ban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement came less than a month after the ASA took control for regulating broadcast advertising where previously it covered non-broadcast only. The BACC said it was "surreal" by its nature because it featured a man wrapped in a carpet filled with oranges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
They went on to state&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; {{Quote|text="The advert was not set on a building site or in any realistic setting that would suggest that the stunt was able to be copied or would normalise or condone the behaviour"}}

[[Britvic]], which makes Tango, apologised for any offence caused by the advert and promised not to show it again.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In July 2013, Womborse ranked the advert at #5 in their list "Banned: 7 of the Most Controversial Ads",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wombrose.co.uk/banned-7-of-the-most-controversial-tv-ads/ Banned: 7 of the Most Controversial TV Ads - Wombrose&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst in February 2014, ''[[The Mirror (United Kingdom)|The Mirror]]'' included it in their unordered list of "The 10 Most Controversial Commercials".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/save-children-advert-10-most-3184308 Save the Children advert and the 10 most controversial TV commercials - video - Mirror Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Iraq War (2014–present)}}

On 13 May 2016, a group of militants armed with [[AK-47]]s attacked a cafe in [[Balad, Iraq]], frequented by supporters of the Spanish football club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-kill-16-real-madrid-7962654|title=ISIS massacre 16 Real Madrid fans at supporters club|first=Stephen|last=Jones|date=13 May 2016|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36290195|title=IS militants attack Iraq cafe used by Real Madrid fans - BBC News|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 16 people were killed and at least 30 were wounded.

On 29 May 2016, ISIL gunmen and a suicide bomber attacked another Real Madrid fan club in the same area, killing at least 12 people and injuring around 15. They were attacked while watching the [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3615485/ISIS-gunmen-kill-12-Real-Madrid-fans-watch-Champions-League-Final-fresh-attack-club-s-supporters-Iraq.html|title=ISIS gunmen kill 12 Real Madrid fans as they watch Champions League|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
During the first attack on May 13, around 50 fans of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] were gathered in a café in [[Balad, Iraq|Balad]], to discuss their arrangements for their favorite team's upcoming football match, when six armed men stormed into the café and started to shoot at the young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/real-madrid-mourns-soccer-fans-killed-attack-cafe-iraq-n574026|title=Real Madrid Mourns Soccer Fans Killed in Attack on Cafe in Iraq|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports claim that grenades were also used to attack those gathered to watch the match. Several attackers reportedly fled the cafe and then detonated themselves, one was captured but then burned to death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/13/isil-massacres-16-real-madrid-supporters-in-baghdad-caf/|title=Isil massacres 16 Real Madrid supporters in Iraq café|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-05-13|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least 14 people were killed outright and two more died of their wounds later on. More than 30 people were injured.&lt;ref name="cbssports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/real-madrid-players-pay-tribute-to-iraq-fan-club-members-killed-by-isis/|title=Real Madrid players pay tribute to Iraq fan club members killed by ISIS|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
Survivors of the attack blamed the attack on May 13 on ISIL and its opposition to football.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In its claim of responsibility, ISIL said the attack had targeted [[Shia]] militiamen, making no mention of any connection to Real Madrid.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Some believe that the claim stems from the extremist groups ideology against football, as they believe it is a product of western society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/in-iraq-town-real-madrid-fans-gather-in-defiance-of-isil-1.192956|title=In Iraq town, Real Madrid fans gather in defiance of ISIL|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The attack was condemned by soccer fans around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://np.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/4j6lun/isis_kill_14_real_madrid_fans/|title=ISIS kill 14 Real Madrid fans. • /r/soccer|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Javier Tebas|Javier Tebas Medrano]] the President of Spain's [[La Liga]] responded to the attack with the statement "Terrorism has attacked football.

On May 28, 2016 family and friends of victims gathered at the cafe to watch the game, surrounded by armed police, frisking those who attempted to enter the cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/football/1222615/real-madrid-fans-where-16-were-killed-by-gunmen-in-isis-massacre-break-down-in-tears-after-champions-league-win/|title=Real Madrid fans where 16 were killed by gunmen in ISIS massacre break down in tears after win|date=2016-05-29|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Repatriation''' is the process of returning an asset, an item of symbolic value or a person{{snd}}voluntarily or forcibly{{snd}}to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship. The term may refer to non-human entities, such as converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country, as well as to the process of returning [[military personnel]] to their place of origin following a [[war]]. It also applies to diplomatic envoys, international officials as well as [[expatriates]] and [[Human migration|migrants]] in time of international crisis. For [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|illegal migrants]], repatriation can mean either [[voluntary return]] or [[deportation]].

==Repatriation of humans==

===Overview and clarification of terms===

====Voluntary return vs. forced return====
[[Voluntary return]] is the return of eligible persons, such as refugees, to their [[country of origin]] or citizenship on the basis of freely expressed willingness to such return. Voluntary return, unlike expulsion and deportation, which are actions of sovereign states, is defined as a personal right under specific conditions described in various international instruments, such as the [[OAU Convention]], along with customary international law.

Some countries offer financial support to refugees and immigrants in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. Examples of 21st century voluntary return include the Danish government, which began in 2009, offering £12,000 each to immigrants to return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/6533845/Denmark-offers-immigrants-12000-to-return-home.html "Denmark offers immigrants £12,000 to return home"], The Telegraph. November 10, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland offering around 6,500 Francs, targeted for business startups upon returning home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigeriaworld.com/feature/publication/ubochi/112809.html "Switzerland and Nigerians Abroad"], Temple Chima Ubochi. ''Nigeria World''. November 28, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/ireland-pay-immigrants-go-home "Irish government to pay immigrants to go home"], Henry McDonald. ''The Guardian''. November 14, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Germany in 2016 allocated €150 million over three years for migrants willing to return,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-to-pay-for-migrants-to-go-home-gerd-muller/ "Germany to pay for migrants to go home"], Cynthia Kroet. Politico EU. December 9, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish government began offering £3,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2016/08/29/thousands-of-migrants-paid-by-swedish-govt-to-leave "Thousands of migrants paid by Swedish gov't to leave"], Michael F. Haverluck. One News Now. August 29, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 544 Nigerians returned home from Switzerland in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/returning-asylum-seekers_a-fresh-start-in-nigeria--brought-to-you-by-switzerland/38687662 "A fresh start in Nigeria, brought to you by Switzerland"], Veronica DeVore. Swiss Info. June 6, 2014. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This financial support may also be considered as residency buyouts.

Two countries may have a re-admission agreement, which establishes procedures, on a reciprocal basis, for one state to return irregular non-nationals to their country of origin or a country through which they have transited.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt; [[Illegal immigrant]]s are frequently repatriated as a matter of government policy. Repatriation measures of [[voluntary return]], with financial assistance, as well as measures of [[deportation]] are used in many countries.

As repatriation can be voluntary or forced the term is also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to their country of origin under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from [[refoulement]] and given, if possible, temporary or permanent [[Political asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"&gt;Perruchoud, Richard and Jillyanne Redpath-Cross (eds.), Glossary on Migration, Second Edition, International Organisation for Migration, International Migration Law, No. 25, Geneva, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as [[refoulement]], which is against international law.

====Repatriation vs. return====
While repatriation necessarily brings an individual to his or her territory of origin or citizenship, a return potentially includes bringing the person back to the point of departure. This could be to a third country, including a country of transit, which is a country the person has traveled through to get to the country of destination. A return could also be within the territorial boundaries of a country, as in the case of returning [[internally displaced persons]] and demobilized combatants.

===Types of human repatriation===

====Medical repatriation====
Repatriation is linked with health care due to the costs and resources associated with providing medical treatment to travelers and immigrants pursuing citizenship. For example, if someone is in the United States with a visa and becomes ill, the insurance that the visa holder has in his or her native country may not apply in the United States, especially if it is a country with universal health care coverage. This scenario forces hospitals to choose one of three options:  
* Limit their services to emergency care only (as per the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]])  
* Offer charity care free of charge or at a reduced rate  
* Repatriate the patient back to his or her native country where he or she will be covered according to that country's policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wack|first=Kevin J.|author2=Toby Schonfeld |title=Patient Autonomy and the  Unfortunate Choice between Repatriation and Suboptimal Treatment|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=6–7|doi=10.1080/15265161.2012.692444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Determining which option is the most ethical is often very challenging for hospital administrators.

In some cases, a traveler's personal insurance company is required to repatriate the patient for medical treatment. The method of repatriation could be via regular flight, by ground, or by air ambulance. Medical repatriation is different from the act of [[medical evacuation]].

====Post–World War II====
In the 20th century, following all European wars, several repatriation commissions were created to supervise the return of war refugees, [[displaced person]]s, and [[prisoners of war]] to their country of origin. Repatriation [[hospital]]s were established in some countries to care for the ongoing medical and health requirements of returned military personnel. In the [[Soviet Union]], the refugees seen as traitors for surrendering were often killed or sent to [[Siberia]]n concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Paul|title=Ostarbeiters|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html|website=Coffee Lounge|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues surrounding repatriation have been some of the most heatedly debated political topics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Many [[Operation Keelhaul|forced back to the Soviet Union by Allied forces]] in [[World War II]] still hold this forced migration against the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The term ''repatriation'' was often used by Communist governments to describe the large-scale state-sponsored [[ethnic cleansing]] actions and [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of national groups. [[Poland|Poles]] born in territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union,  although deported to the State of Poland, were settled in the annexed former [[Germany|German]] territories (referred to in Polish as the [[Regained Territories]]). In the process they were told that they had returned to their Motherland.

====Battlefield casualties====
The [[Korean War]] marked the first time that the United States or any nation began returning the bodies of battlefield casualties as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Sledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |orig-year=First published 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |pages=78–80 |oclc= 60527603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Glory]], which followed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], thousands of remains were exchanged by both sides.&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all remains from the Korean War were returned to the home countries. Some 2,300 casualties are buried at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of immediately recovering casualties continued for United States during the [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;

===Repatriation laws===
{{See also|Right of Return}}
Repatriation laws give non-citizen foreigners who are part of the titular [[Ethnic majority|majority group]] the opportunity to immigrate and receive [[citizenship]]. Repatriation of their titular diaspora is practiced by most [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] states. Repatriation laws have been created in many countries to enable [[diaspora]]s to immigrate ("return") to their "kin-state". This is sometimes known as the exercise of the [[right of return]]. Repatriation laws give members of the diaspora the right to immigrate to their kin-state and they serve to maintain close ties between the state and its diaspora and gives preferential treatment to diaspora immigrants.

Most countries in central and eastern Europe as well as [[Armenia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Turkey]] have longstanding repatriation legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|title=Democratic Norms, Diasporas, and Israel’s Law of Return|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Amnon|authorlink2=Amnon Rubinstein|format=PDF|first1=Alexander|last1=Yakobson|authorlink1=Alexander Yakobson|work=ajc.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126182841/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]] also have repatriation laws for their diaspora populations. The number of countries with repatriation laws has mushroomed since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of Soviet communism]] and most independent nations that were [[Post-Soviet states|once part of the communist domain]] in [[Europe]] have since legislated repatriation laws. Many other countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Sweden]] have (or have had) generous immigration policies with regard to the nation's [[diaspora]] without having formally enacted repatriation laws. Such states can be described as practicing ''common law repatriation''.

In comparison, one of the central tenets of the [[Rastafari movement]] is the desirability of the repatriation of [[black people]] from the [[Americas]] and elsewhere back to [[Africa]]. While [[Ethiopia]] specifically has land available in [[Shashamane]] to encourage this project, black people who are citizens of countries outside Africa do not have the [[right of return]] to Africa, although as individuals they are free to try to [[emigration|emigrate]].

===Psychological aspects===
Repatriation is often the "forgotten" phase of the [[expatriation]] cycle; the emphasis for support is mostly on the actual period abroad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, many repatriates report experiencing difficulties on return: one is no longer special, practical problems arise, new knowledge gained is no longer useful, etc. These difficulties are highly influenced by a number of factors including [[Personal development|self-management]], [[Marriage|spouse's]] adjustment, time spent abroad and skill utilisation. What is crucial is that every individual perceives these factors in a different way. Reintegration is a process of re-inclusion or re-incorporation of a person into a group or a process, and may contribute to overcoming repatriation.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt;

Direct managers and [[Human resources|HR]] staff often notice the difficulties a repatriate experiences, but they are not always able to act on it. Budget shortcomings and time constraints are frequently cited as reasons why it fails to be an agenda priority. Solutions for repatriation difficulties do not have to be expensive and can lead to great benefits for the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Basic support can consist, for example, of good communication in advance, during and after the international assignment, or a mentor program to assist the repatriate. The expatriate and his/her family should feel understood by his or her company. Support can increase job satisfaction, thereby protecting the investment made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;Ripmeester, N. “Handle with care”, ''Graduate Recruiter'', Issue 22 (February) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repatriation of non-human entities==

===Human remains===
[[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|Return of human remains]] to their nation of origin. In the United States, Native Americans' human remains are uncovered and removed from their burial sites in the construction/land development process or as part of archaeological excavations. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) of 1990 established the process whereby federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can request that federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds return culturally affiliated human remains.  The NAGPRA also sets forth provisions that allow for the disposition of Native American human remains found on federal lands to the affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.  NAGPRA does not apply to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which is covered under the repatriation provisions of the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989. In previous eras it was common for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony|colonial]] authorities to collect heads and other body parts of indigenous peoples such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] for display in British museums. The repatriation of these body parts is currently ongoing.  For an example of a successful body part repatriation, see [[Yagan]]. Another example can be seen through the dedicated work of the Karanga Aotearoa Repatriation Programme, established in partnership between Māori and the New Zealand government in 2003.  This programme is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and since 2003 has repatriated over 350 Māori and Moriori ancestral remains to Aotearoa New Zealand. Article 12 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to repatriate their human remains. The declaration was passed in September 2007 with the support of 143 countries. The four opposing countries—Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States—subsequently endorsed the declaration.

=== Cultural artifacts===
Cultural or [[art repatriation]] is the return of cultural objects or works of art to their country of origin (usually referring to ancient art), or (for looted material) its former owners (or their heirs).

=== Economic repatriation===
Economic repatriation refers to economic measures taken by a country to reduce foreign capital investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Repatriation of currency===
Repatriation of currency is when foreign currency is converted back to the currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the payment of a dividend by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently hundreds of billions of dollars of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings. (See Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Economic Accounts, Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States, available at the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/ni_FedBeaSna/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&amp;FirstYear=1999&amp;LastYear=2006&amp;Freq=Year|title=U.S. Department of Commerce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9504">[[File:Seriously McDonalds.jpg|thumb|right|The hoax picture circulated via email and [[Twitter]], suggesting McDonald's had introduced racist policies.]]
"'''Seriously McDonalds'''" is the name under which a [[viral email|viral]] photograph was spread in June 2011. The photograph shows a sign, which is in fact a [[internet hoax|hoax]], claiming that [[McDonald's]] has implemented a new policy charging African-Americans more, as "an insurance measure". Despite having existed for some time, the picture was spread around the Internet, especially on [[Twitter]], in June 2011, by people who were offended or amused by the photograph. McDonald's acted quickly to deny the legitimacy of the sign, but it continued to [[trending topics|trend]] on Twitter under the [[hashtag]] "'''#SeriouslyMcDonalds'''" and "'''#seriouslymcdonalds'''" for a few days. The company's response to the hoax has received praise from journalists and public relations professionals.

==Photograph==
The photograph shows a sign stuck on what is apparently the window of a McDonald's restaurant with tape.&lt;ref name="News.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |title= Maccas in damage control over Seriously McDonald's picture hoax|url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/maccas-in-damage-control-over-seriously-mcdonalds-picture-hoax/story-e6frfro0-1226074651664|publisher= [[News.com.au]]|date= 14 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign reads:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''PLEASE NOTE:'''

As an insurance measure due in part to a recent&lt;br/&gt; string of robberies, '''African-American''' customers&lt;br/&gt; are now required to pay an '''''additional''''' fee of&lt;br/&gt; '''$1.50''' per transaction.

Thank you for your cooperation.
|}

The sign has a footer which says "McDonald's Corporation" and features the McDonald's logo and a helpline number. However, the helpline number actually connects to the [[KFC]] Customer Satisfaction Hotline.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; The picture is a [[internet hoax|hoax]]; McDonald's has never had any such policy.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;

==History==
===Prior to viral status===
The picture had existed for three years on [[4chan]],&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; and McDonald's had been aware of the image for around a year. The McDonald's social media team were not concerned about the photograph, assigning it a low "impact level", as it made claims that the team thought were too outrageous to be believed.&lt;ref name="vdh"&gt;{{cite book|author= van den Hurk, Ann Marie|title= Social Media Crisis Communications: Preparing for, Preventing, and Surviving a Public Relations #FAIL|publisher= [[Que Publishing]]|date= 2013|isbn= 9780133353891|pages=47–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauri Apple, writing for gossip website [[Gawker]], reported, attributing the claim to "various sources on the Twitter", that the image was a [[Internet meme|meme]] that first surfaced on [[4chan]] some time before it went viral;&lt;ref name="Gawker"&gt;{{cite news |title= ‘Seriously McDonalds’ Hoax-Pic Angers Internet, McDonald’s|author= Apple, Lauri|url= http://gawker.com/5811193/seriously-mcdonalds-hoax+pic-angers-internet-mcdonalds|publisher= [[Gawker]]|date= 12 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; writers for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that it had been in use on 4chan since 2008.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; Apple also linked to a post showing the picture on McServed.com, a blog which mocks both McDonald's and its customers, dated 17 June 2010.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news |title= McDonald's racist Twitter message was hoax

===Viral===
It surfaced in June 2011,&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; having been picked up by influential Twitter users,&lt;ref name="vdh"/&gt; and went [[Viral email|viral]]. The photograph was spread around the Internet by email and on [[social networking]] sites, especially [[Twitter]], under the title "Seriously McDonalds".&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; The title is meant as an expression of incredulity at the restaurant chain.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; The picture was passed on both by those who were amused and those who were offended, with abuse aimed at McDonald's sometimes accompanying the image.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite news |title= McDonald's issues Twitter denial after hoax poster saying blacks will be charged extra goes viral|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002998/McDonalds-Twitter-denial-blacks-charged-extra-hoax-poster-goes-viral.html|newspaper= [[Daily Mail]]|date= 13 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kate Linendoll, technology expert for ''[[The Early Show]]'', hypothesised that the picture spread from the blog to Twitter, and that Twitter's "immediacy" allowed the image to go viral "so fast it got out of control".&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

===Response from McDonald's===
McDonald's responded to the hoax on 11 June by tweeting "That pic is a senseless &amp; ignorant hoax. McD's values ALL our customers. Diversity runs deep in our culture on both sides of the counter."&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; Further, McDonald's director of social media, Rick Wion, released a statement saying

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sign is obviously a hoax. As a company and a brand we have a long and proud history of diversity inclusion across our system on both sides of the counter&amp;nbsp;... From our management crew, franchisees&amp;nbsp;– across the board, we’re very proud of our record of diversity. This is unfortunately an example of how rumors can outspeed the truth&amp;nbsp;... Over the last 48 hours we’ve been tweeting and striving to clarify that this is a hoax.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite McDonald's denial, the speed at which the picture spread was increased.&lt;ref name="News.com.au"/&gt; McDonald's reiterated their earlier message, tweeting "That Seriously McDonalds picture is a hoax".&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news |title= Maccas, JK Rowling, lesbian bloggers: hoaxers take over the world wide web|author= Moses, Asher|url= http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/maccas-jk-rowling-lesbian-bloggers-hoaxers-take-over-the-world-wide-web-20110614-1g127.html|newspaper= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date= 14 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph became the most highly [[trending topic]] over the weekend of the 11–12 June, being spread under the [[hashtag]]s "#SeriouslyMcDonalds" and "#seriouslymcdonalds". The tag was reportedly used some 20 times a second over the course of the weekend.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news |title= Fake racist McDonald's twitpic enrages Tweeps|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/fake-racist-mcdonalds-twitpic-enrages-tweeps-2297169.html|newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 14 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was eventually removed from [[Twitpic]],&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"/&gt; and the speed at which it was spreading declined.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt;

Little damage was done by the hoax, which, in addition to McDonald's response, was revealed through Twitter users' own investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= Newman, Nic|date= 2011|title= Mainstream media and the distribution of news in the age of social discovery|url= http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/documents/Publications/Working_Papers/Mainstream_media_and_the_distribution_of_news_.pdf|publisher= [[Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism]]|page= 37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is no longer well known or remembered, due, according to public relations professional Ann Marie van den Hurk, to McDonald's effective response to the image.&lt;ref name="vdh"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Linendoll praised the response from McDonald's, saying that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you're a big corporation and something viral ... happens against you, you have to formulate a plan and respond quickly ... In this case, McDonald's handled it correctly; they used the medium Twitter they were accused on. Time is of the essence. We're not going to the press in the morning. We're going to the press in real time, when it comes to social networking. You have to respond and respond quickly. Well-handled.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christopher Barger of ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' described McDonald's response as "a textbook statement on how to respond to a rumor in 140 characters", although he felt they could have personalised responses and used other social networks.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Six Steps To Fighting Internet Rumors|author= Barger, Christopher|url= https://blogs.forbes.com/christopherbarger/2011/06/17/six-steps-to-fighting-internet-rumors/|newspaper= [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date= 17 June 2011|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van den Hurk also presented the response from McDonald's as an example of how organisations can best deal with social media crises.&lt;ref name=vdh/&gt;

The '''Siege of Germanicia''' or '''Marash''' was led by Muslim forces of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during their campaigns in [[Anatolia]] in 638. The city surrendered without much bloodshed. This expedition is important because it marks the end of the military career of the legendary Arab Muslim general [[Khalid ibn Walid]], who was dismissed from the army a few months after his return from the expedition.

==Background==
The Muslims won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] fought in August 636, thus the attempt made by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] to roll back Roman Syria failed. Further, unable to send more imperial troops to Syria, [[Heraclius]] made yet another attempt to re-conquer Syria by the aid of his [[Christian Arab]] allies of [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]]. The army of the Christian Arabs laid siege to [[Emesa]] in mid-summer of 638. The Muslims avoided a battle in the open and instead opted for a defensive strategy which led to the Battle at Emesa. All the regiments from outposts in northern Syria were called to Emesa. The Christian Arab Army was forced to withdraw their siege when, by the orders of Caliph [[Umar]], the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]] from [[Iraq]] attacked Jazira. At this point, the rear elements of the sieging army were attacked by a [[Mobile guard]] led by [[Khalid ibn Walid]], which in effect left the Byzantine forces devastated. Caliph Umar then launched a full-scale invasion of Jazira which was completed without much resistance in just a few months. As soon as the western part of Jazira was occupied, [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] wrote to Umar and asked for Ayadh bin Ghanam, who was operating in western Jazira, to be put under his command so that he could use him in raids across the northern border. Umar agreed to this request, and Ayadh moved to Emesa with a part of the Muslim forces sent from Iraq to Jazira.

==The siege==

In the Autumn of 638, Abu Ubaidah launched several columns, including two commanded by [[Khalid ibn Walid]] and Ayadh, to raid [[Byzantine]] territory in [[Anatolia]] as far west as [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Akram, The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns, Nat. Publishing. House, Rawalpindi (1970) {{ISBN|0-7101-0104-X}}. chapter no:36&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid's objective was [[Germanicia]] (Arabic: Marash), the city which lies on a plain at the foot of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. The region is best known for its production of [[salep]], a flour made from dried [[orchid]] tubers. In late 638, the [[Rashidun army|Muslim army]] laid the siege to the city which contained a [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]]. Expecting no help from their Emperor, the Byzantine garrison surrendered the city on the usual terms of [[Jizya]] offered by the [[Rashidun army]], which included terms stating that the garrison and the populace be spared. As for material wealth, the Muslims could take all they wished.

==Aftermath==
It is narrated that Khalid returned to [[Qinnasrin]] laden with spoils of war that had seldom been seen before. Many [[List of Muslim historians|Muslim historians]] commented that ''Just the spoils of Marash were sufficient to make the soldiers of this expedition rich for life''. Khalid ibn Walid, who was at the peak of his military career was unfortunately dismissed by Caliph Umar because of his immense popularity which was a result of his very successful military career. It was a general view that Umar had dismissed Khalid because he was angry with Khalid, though it was clarified later by Caliph Umar that:

{{cquote|''I have not dismissed Khalid because of my anger or because of any dishonesty on his part, but because people glorified him and were misled. I feared that people would rely on him, rather than God, for victory.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari: Vol. 3, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; I want them to know that it is God who does all things; and there should be no mischief in the land.''}}
Khalid was urged by many of his companions to retaliate against Umar for this.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari: Vol. 3, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid did not, although he was powerful enough to launch a [[coup d'état]] against Umar and in effect seize the power of the [[Rashidun Empire]]. He instead chose to stay away from politics and died four years later in 642 in [[Emesa]]. Caliph Umar was said to have felt embarrassed for his conduct against Khalid and was reported to have said at his death that 'he would have appointed Khalid as his successor if he was still alive.'

'''''Slings &amp; Arrows''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] TV series set at the fictional New Burbage Festival, a Shakespearean festival similar to the real-world [[Stratford Festival]]. The program stars [[Paul Gross]], [[Stephen Ouimette]] and [[Martha Burns]].

The darkly comic series first aired on Canada's [[Movie Central]] and [[The Movie Network]] channels in 2003, and received acclaim in the United States when it was shown on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]] two years later. Three seasons of six episodes each were filmed in total, with the final season airing in Canada in the summer of 2006 and in the United States in early 2007.

''Slings &amp; Arrows'' was created and written by former ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' member [[Mark McKinney]], playwright and actress [[Susan Coyne]], and comedian [[Bob Martin (comedian)|Bob Martin]]. All three appear in the series as well. The entire series was directed by [[Peter Wellington (director)|Peter Wellington]].

==Overview==
[[Rhombus Media]] decided to make a television series after the pattern of their 2005 documentary ''Five Days in September: The Rebirth of an Orchestra'', which chronicled the backstage activities of the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]]. They hired [[Bob Martin (comedian)|Bob Martin]], [[Susan Coyne]], and [[Mark McKinney]] to create the series.&lt;ref name=wing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantheatrewing.org/downstagecenter/detail/bob_martin|title=Bob Martin|date=June 2, 2006|publisher=American Theatre Wing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional New Burbage Festival in ''Slings &amp; Arrows'' is loosely based on the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] with some events being an amalgamation of Bob Martin's experiences in the production of his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'' and [[The Second City]].&lt;ref name=wing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Enjoy the delightful (and moving) backstage antics of 'Slings &amp; Arrows'|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/slings_and_arrows/|accessdate=February 8, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 1: ''Hamlet''===
The show's central characters are actor/director Geoffrey Tennant ([[Paul Gross]]), New Burbage artistic director Oliver Welles ([[Stephen Ouimette]]), and actress Ellen Fanshaw ([[Martha Burns]]), who seven years previously collaborated on a legendary production of ''[[Hamlet]]''. Midway through one of the performances, Geoffrey suffered a nervous breakdown, jumped into Ophelia's grave and then ran screaming from the stage. After that, he was committed to a psychiatric institution.

When the series begins, Geoffrey is in Toronto, running a small company, "Théâtre Sans Argent" (French for "Theatre Without Money"), on the verge of being evicted. Oliver and Ellen have stayed at New Burbage, where Oliver has gradually been commercializing his productions and the festival. On the opening night of the New Burbage's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Oliver sees Geoffrey on the news, chained to his theatre. Heavily drunk, Oliver calls Geoffrey from a payphone and they argue about the past. Oliver then passes out in the street and is run over and killed by a truck bearing the slogan "Canada's Best Hams".

Geoffrey's blistering eulogy at Oliver's funeral about the state of the festival leads to him being asked to take over Oliver's job on a temporary basis. After clashing with an old rival, Darren Nichols ([[Don McKellar]]), Geoffrey is reluctantly forced to take over directing the festival's latest production of ''[[Hamlet]]''. Making this difficult are Jack Crew ([[Luke Kirby (actor)|Luke Kirby]]), the insecure American film star cast as Hamlet; Geoffrey's former lover Ellen, who is playing Gertrude and dating a much younger man; and Oliver, now haunting both Geoffrey and the festival as a ghost. Also in the play is apprentice actress Kate ([[Rachel McAdams]]), who finds herself falling for Jack.

On the business side of the festival, New Burbage manager Richard Smith-Jones ([[Mark McKinney]]) is seduced by one of his sponsors, American executive Holly Day ([[Jennifer Irwin]]) who wants to remake New Burbage into a shallow, commercialized "Shakespeareville".

===Season 2: ''Macbeth''===
The second season follows the New Burbage production of ''[[Macbeth]]''.

Richard is desperate for money to keep the company going, and Geoffrey, frustrated over what he sees as a lack of commitment from his actors, suggests downsizing the company. A new actor, Henry Breedlove ([[Geraint Wyn Davies]]), arrives to star in a production of ''Macbeth'', which Geoffrey is reluctant to direct because of its supposed difficulty (though he doesn't believe in the curse of "[[The Scottish Play]]").

Richard finds funding in the form of a government grant that comes with a catch—it may be used only for "rebranding". So, Richard hires an avant-garde advertising agency, Froghammer, to promote and rebrand the festival. Sanjay ([[Colm Feore]]), the head of Froghammer, launches a series of shock advertisements and manipulates Richard into accepting them.

Elsewhere at the festival, Darren has returned from an artistic rebirth in Germany to direct a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in which the actors don't touch or even look at each other, much to the chagrin of the couple playing the lead roles. The festival's administrator, Anna Conroy ([[Susan Coyne]]), copes with an influx of interns and begins a romance with playwright Lionel Train ([[Jonathan Crombie]]) who is doing a reading at the festival.

Ellen undergoes a tax audit, in preparation for which she is able to explain the "business purpose" of such theatrical necessities as lipstick and a push-up bra.

Meanwhile, Geoffrey obsesses over directing ''Macbeth'', antagonizes his cast and crew, and starts seeing Oliver's ghost again, all of which make Ellen fear for his sanity.

===Season 3: ''King Lear''===
The third season follows the New Burbage production of ''[[King Lear]]''.

The cast of ''Macbeth'' returns home after a successful run of the production on Broadway, where an old friend of Ellen's ([[Janet Bailey]]) tells her to think about moving beyond New Burbage. As Richard tries to cope with being a success, Anna must deal with a group of stranded musicians and Darren is back in town, this time to direct a new musical, ''East Hastings''.

Geoffrey, meanwhile, has cast an aging theatre legend, Charles Kingman ([[William Hutt (actor)|William Hutt]]) as Lear, despite everyone's fears that the role will kill him. As rehearsals continue, Charles terrorizes Sophie ([[Sarah Polley]]), the actress playing Cordelia. Sophie is also involved in the rivalry between the young actors in ''Lear'' and the young actors in the musical, whose success soon overshadows the troubled Shakespeare production.

As things spiral out of control, Oliver returns to haunt and help, and Geoffrey seeks therapy from an unlikely source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7580">During the [[first English Civil War]], [[Tarvin]], a village in [[Cheshire]] England was garrisoned by both sides and was attacked by both sides, because its proximity to [[Chester]] which was a major Royalist ([[Cavalier]]) port city, made it strategically important. Tarvin changed hands several times; initially it was garrisoned by Parliament and troops of both sides at different times were quartered in and around the village, which was not fortified.  In September 1644 the Parliamentarians ([[Roundhead]]s) fortified the village and garrisoned the place with sufficient troops to withstand a large attack and it remained in their hands until the end of the war.{{sfn|Hanshall|1817|p=456}}{{sfn|Lysons|1810|p=749}}

==History==
On Sunday 12 November 1643, Royalists sallied out of Chester towards Tarvin — which was garrisoned by Parliament under the command of Captain Gerard — but the Royalists were intercepted at [[Stamford Bridge, Cheshire|Stamford Bridge]] and prevented from crossing it. The two sides skirmished all the afternoon but then Parliamentary reinforcements from [[Cholmondeley, Cheshire|Cholmondeley]] arrived to assist Gerard and they drove the Royalists back, following them to [[Boughton, Cheshire]] and into [[Gorse Stacks]] on the outskirts of Chester, where they killed some of them.  The Parliamentarians' only casualty was one man wounded.{{sfn|Malbon|1657}}{{sfn|Burghall|1778|p=[https://archive.org/stream/historycheshire01webbgoog#page/n515/mode/1up 923]}}

In late January 1644, some Parliamentary forces billeted in and about Tarvin were taken by surprise in an attack by the Chester Royalists.  Some were wounded, and others were taken prisoner but as the Royalists returned to Chester with their captives, they were overtaken by a company of Parliamentary [[dragoon]]s. In the [[melee]] that followed a Royalist captain and some of his men were killed, while others were wounded. The dragoons freed the prisoners and took eight of their own, all of whom were sent to [[Nantwich]].{{sfn|Burghall|1778|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historycheshire01webbgoog#page/n522/mode/1up 931]–932}}

On Sunday 18 August 1644, Colonel Marrow marched from Chester with a detachment of foot (infantry) and horse (cavalry) towards Northwich, and on the way they took cattle without paying for them.  When Morrow's scouts approached [[Hartford Green]], a party of soldiers from the garrison sallied out to chase them off, but the Parliamentary soldiers got too close to the main body.  A skirmish ensued at [[Sandyway]].  The Royalists won the day taking fifteen prisoners, but Colonel Marrow was mortally wounded and died the next day in Chester.  After the skirmish it seems that the Royalist detachment made for Tarvin, because two days later (Tuesday 20 August) a party of Parliamentarians from Nantwich with the assistance of Sir [[William Brereton, 2nd Baron Brereton|William Brereton]]'s horse and reinforcements from [[Halton Castle]] attacked the Royalists quartered at Tarvin and for the fifteen prisoners they lost two days earlier taking between 200 and 300 horses, capturing 45 prisoners and killing 15, all for the loss of only one man.{{sfn|Malbon|1657}}{{sfn|Burghall|1778|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historycheshire01webbgoog#page/n527/mode/1up 936]–937}}

On Friday 30 August 1644,{{sfn|Malbon|1657}} all the Parliamentary garrison of Nantwich, except Major Croxton's and the Town's trained bands, marched to [[Middlewich]] where they encamped for the night. The next day they proceeded to [[Northwich]] and [[Great Budworth]], and then to Tarvin, which they fortified with strong earth works and garrisoned it, declaring it to be a market town. They also garrisoned Huxley Hall and Oulton Hall near [[Little Budworth]].{{sfn|Malbon|1657}}&lt;ref&gt;Burghall states that the expedition left Nantwich on 5 September {{harv|Burghall|1778|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historycheshire01webbgoog#page/n528/mode/1up 937]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fortifications and the garrison must have been stronger than those of other garrisons because Tarvin appears to have been the only garrison in Cheshire, except Nantwich, which was not abandoned on the reported approach of the King, in May 1645.{{sfn|Burghall|1778|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/historycheshire01webbgoog#page/n533/mode/1up 942 ]}} {{harvnb|Hanshall|1817|p=456}}{{sfn|Lysons|1810|p=749}}

{{anchor|Battle of Eaton and Rushton}} On Monday, 9 June 1645, three companies of horse and six of Royalist foot sallied out of Chester and captured the Parliamentary Captain Glegge and his troop of horse before they could escape from their quarters. They were quickly rescued in a counterattack mounted by the Tarvin garrison. The Royalists retreated to the parish of Eaton and Rushton, where near the forest of Delamere they turned to give battle. The Parliamentarians killed ten and captured two captains, some more junior officers and about two hundred and ten soldiers with many bags of powder and some about 300 fire arms. The Parliamentarians' casualties were three killed and taken prisoner. The following day the Royalist prisoners were sent from Tarvin to Nantwich. On 11 June 1645 fourteen or fifteen of the prisoners were tried under a council of war. Three were judged to be Irish and were hanged under the provisions of the [[Ordinance of no quarter to the Irish]].{{sfn|Malbon|1657}}

On 19 September 1645 large pieces of ordinance which were within the fortifications at Tarvin were moved to Chester to help to batter the city into submission.{{sfn|Malbon|1657}} Within a few hours the artillery pieces had done their work making a breach four men wide in the city wall to the left of the Newgate. At eight that night the city was assaulted through the breach and captured.{{sfn|Malbon|1657}}

The church at Tarvin shows signs of its part in the battles. There are cannonball and musket ball holes in the wall of St Andrews church tower next to the west door. It has been said that prisoners were shot against this wall, which explains some of the bullet holes. The church was also used as a refuge by soldiers and the tower was probably used as a lookout post.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

'''The Barricades''' ({{lang-lv|Barikādes}}) were a series of confrontations between the [[Latvia|Republic of Latvia]] and the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] in January 1991 which took place mainly in [[Riga]]. The events are named for the popular effort of building and protecting [[barricades]] from 13 January until about 27 January. Latvia, which had [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|declared restoration of independence]] from the [[Soviet Union]] a year earlier, anticipated that Soviet Union might attempt to regain control over the country by force. After attacks by the Soviet [[OMON]] on Riga in early January, the government called on people to build barricades for protection of possible targets (mainly in the capital city of [[Riga]] and nearby [[Ulbroka]], as well as [[Kuldīga]] and [[Liepāja]]). Six people were killed in further attacks, several were wounded in shootings or beaten by OMON. Most victims were shot during the Soviet attack on the Latvian Ministry of the Interior on January 20. One other person died in a building accident reinforcing the barricades. Casualties among Soviet loyalists are considered likely, but the exact number remains unknown. A total of 15,611 people have registered as having been participants of the Barricades,{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} but other data suggests that more than 32,000 Latvians took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepbaltic.com/2016/03/08/latvias-barricades-of-freedom-what-is-their-meaning-25-years-on/|title=Latvia’s Barricades of Freedom – What Do They Mean 25 Years On?|last=Zaltāns|first=Kaspars|date=March 8, 2016|website=Deep Baltic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)}}
During [[World War II]] Latvia had been occupied by USSR. In 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] policies, hoping to salvage the failing Soviet economy. The reforms also lessened restrictions on [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]] in the Soviet Union. This led to [[unintended consequence]]s as problems within the Soviet Union and crimes of the Soviet regime, previously kept secret and denied by the government, were exposed, causing public dissatisfaction, further deepened by the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989)|war in Afghanistan]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Another unintended consequence of Glasnost for the Soviet central authorities was the long-suppressed nationalist sentiments that were released in the [[Soviet Republics|republics of the Soviet Union]].

Massive demonstrations against the Soviet regime began. In Latvia an [[Latvian independence movement|independence movement]] started. The supporters of independence - the [[Popular Front of Latvia]], the [[Latvian Green Party]] and the [[Latvian National Independence Movement]] - won elections to the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Latvian SSR]], on 18 March 1990 and formed the Popular Front of Latvia faction, leaving the pro-Soviet [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] faction in opposition.

On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Soviet, which afterwards became known as the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]], [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|declared the restoration of independence of Latvia]] and began secession from the Soviet Union. The USSR did not recognize these actions and considered them contrary to the Soviet federal and republican constitutions. Consequently, tension in relations between Latvia and the Soviet Union and between the independence movement and pro-Soviet forces, such as the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia]] (Interfront) and the [[Communist Party of Latvia]], along with its All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee, grew.

==Soviet military crackdown threat==
The pro-Soviet forces tried to provoke violence and seize power in Latvia. A series of bombings occurred in December 1990, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Dmitry Yazov]] admitted that the military was responsible for the first four bombings, perpetrators of the other bombings remain unknown, the pro-Communist press of the time blamed Latvian nationalists.

The government of the Soviet Union and other pro-Soviet groups threatened that a [[state of emergency]] would be established which would grant unlimited authority in Latvia to President Gorbachev and military force would be used to "implement order in the [[Baltic Republics]]". At the time Soviet troops, OMON units and [[KGB]] forces were stationed in Latvia. On 23 December 1990 a large combat group of KGB was exposed in [[Jūrmala]]. It was rumored at the time that there would be a coup and a dictatorship would be established. [[List of Russian foreign ministers|Foreign minister of the Soviet Union]] [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] seemingly confirmed this when he resigned on 20 December 1990, stating that a dictatorship was coming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 1990, the Popular Front released an announcement stating that there was no need for a climate of fear and hysteria in what was dubbed hour X - the unlimited authority of the president - would come and every person should be ready to consider what they would do if that happened. The Popular Front also made suggestions regarding what should be done until the hour X and afterwards, if Soviet forces were successful. These plans called for acts to show support for independence and attract the attention of international society, joining volunteer guard units, reasoning with [[Russians in Latvia]] explaining to them, especially military officers, that the ideas of the Popular Front are similar to those of Russian democrats. It also called for effort to protect the economy and ensure information circulation should also be made.&lt;ref name="x hour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barikades.lv/en/3_1.php |title=The Popular Front of Latvia announcement to all supporters of independence |accessdate=2007-08-17 |author=Popular Front of Latvia |authorlink=Popular Front of Latvia |date= 11 December 1990}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of Soviet control being successfully established, this plan called for a campaign of civil disobedience - ignoring any orders and requests of the Soviet authorities, as well as any Soviet elections and referendums, undermining the Soviet economy by going on strike and by [[Work to rule|following the absurdly elaborate Soviet manufacturing instructions to the letter in order to paralyze production]], helping the independence movement to continue its work illegally and helping its supporters to get involved in the work of the Soviet institutions. Finally, carefully documenting any crimes Soviet forces might commit during the state of emergency.&lt;ref name="x hour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barikades.lv/en/3_1.php |title=The Popular Front of Latvia announcement to all supporters of independence |accessdate=2007-08-17 |author=Popular Front of Latvia |authorlink=Popular Front of Latvia |date= 11 December 1990}}

==Attacks in early January ==

On 2 January 1991 the [[OMON]] seized the Preses Nams ({{Lang-en|Press House}}), the national printing house of Latvia and attacked Criminal police officers who were documenting the event.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme council held session in which it was reported that the manager of the Preses Nams was being held hostage, while other workers, although physically and verbally abused, were apparently allowed to leave the printing house. The Supreme council officially recognized the taking of the printing house as an illegal act on the part of the [[Communist Party of Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;

On 4 January the OMON seized the telephone exchange in [[Vecmīlgrāvis]], it is speculated that it was because the telephone lines the OMON were using were cut off. Thereafter, the OMON seized the Ministry of Internal Affairs but the phone wasn't cut off for fear that the OMON would attack the international [[telephone exchange]].&lt;ref name="tele"&gt;{{cite web

Meanwhile, the Soviet military was on the move - that same day an intelligence unit arrived in Riga.

Then on 7 January, following the orders of Mikhail Gorbachev, [[Dmitriy Yazov]] sent [[commando]] units into several [[Republics of the Soviet Union]] including Latvia.

On 11 January, the Military Council of the [[Baltic Military District]] was held. It decided to arm Soviet officers and cadets with machine guns. Open movement of Soviet troops and armored vehicles were seen in the streets of Riga.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Several meetings by both pro-independence and pro-Soviet movements were held on 10 January. Interfront held a meeting calling on the government of Latvia to resign. Some 50,000 people participated and tried to break into the Cabinet of Ministers building after being asked to do so by military personnel.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

==Construction of the Barricades==
[[Image:Andris-Slapins-memorial.jpg|250 px|thumb|The memorial marking the spot where Andris Slapiņš, a cameraman, was killed during the attack on the Latvian Interior Ministry on 20 January.]]
On 11 January, the Soviet military launched an [[January Events|attack]] on Latvia's neighbour, [[Lithuania]].

On 12 January, the Popular Front announced nationwide demonstrations to be held on 13 January in support of Latvia's lawfully elected government and the guarding of strategic objectives. The Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] called on the Soviet government to withdraw its military forces from the Baltic States. Leaders of the Latvian government met with Gorbachev who gave assurances that force would not be used. That night the Popular Front, after learning that Soviet forces in Lithuania had attacked the [[Vilnius TV Tower]] and killed 13 civilians, called on people to gather for the defense of strategic objectives.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Due to a united effort of the Baltic states to regain their independence in the previous years of the [[singing revolution]], an attack on one of them was perceived as an attack on all of them.&lt;ref&gt;

At 4:45 on 13 January, an announcement from the Popular Front was broadcast by Latvian radio calling people to gather in [[Riga Cathedral]] square. At 12:00 noon the Supreme Council session on defense issues was held. At 14.00 the Popular Front's demonstration began, around 700,000 people had gathered, Soviet helicopters dropped [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|leaflets]] with warnings over the crowd at this point. The Popular Front called on people to build barricades. The Supreme council held another session after the demonstration, the MPs were asked to stay at the Supreme council overnight. The evening session issued a call for Soviet soldiers asking them to disobey orders concerning the use of force against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;

|language = Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As night came, following orders from the government, agricultural and construction machines and trucks full of logs arrived in Riga to build barricades. [[Truck]]s, [[engineering vehicle]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] were brought into the city to block streets.
People had already been gathering during the day. Part of this crowd gathered in Riga Cathedral Square as the Popular Front had asked in its morning announcement. Others gathered after the midday demonstration. They included colleagues and students. Some were organised by their employers and alma maters. Many families arrived, including women, the elderly and children. By that time most were already morally prepared that something could happen. People had arrived from all over the country. Barricades were largely perceived as a form of [[nonviolent resistance]], people being ready to form a [[human shield]]. However, many people did arm themselves, using whatever was available, ranging from pieces of metal to specially crafted shields and civil defence supplies. Some had also prepared [[Molotov cocktail]]s, but these were confiscated to ensure fire safety. The Latvian militia was armed with sub-machine guns and handguns.

The Latvian government was later criticized for not providing weapons. These they had, as was evidenced after the OMON seized the Ministry of Interior and removed a considerable number of weapons (it was asserted that there were 200 firearms in the ministry)

Trucks were loaded with [[construction and demolition waste]], logs and other cargo. Large [[concrete]] blocks, walls, [[wire obstacle]]s and other materials were also used. The building work begun on the evening of 13 January and took about three hours. The main objects of strategic interest were the [[House of the Livonian Noble Corporation|Supreme Council buildings]] ([[Vecrīga|Old town]] near [[St. James's Cathedral, Riga|St. James's Cathedral]]), the Council of Ministers (City center near the [[Nativity Cathedral, Riga|Nativity of Christ Cathedral]]), [[Latvijas Televīzija|Latvian Television]] (on [[Zaķusala]]), [[Latvijas Radio|Latvian Radio]] ([[Vecrīga|Old town]] near [[Riga Cathedral]]), the International [[Telephone exchange]] offices (City center), [[Ulbroka]] radio and bridges. Barricades were also built in other parts of country, including in [[Liepāja]] and [[Kuldīga]].
[[File:Riga barricade 1991.jpg|thumb|230px|Barricade in Jēkaba Street, July 1991]]

Care was taken to record the events, not only for accounting purposes and personal keepsakes, but also to show the world what was happening. About 300 foreign journalists worked in Riga at the time.&lt;ref name="apollo"/&gt; The Latvian government ensured that the foreign press was provided with constant updates.

Many strategic objects were important mainly for the transfer of information. This would ensure that if the Soviets did launch an attack, the Latvian forces could hold these locations long enough to inform the rest of the world. The international telephone exchange was important to maintain connections with both foreign countries and other parts of the USSR. An often noted example is Lithuania. It was partly cut off from the rest of the world after the Soviet attack. Foreign calls to Lithuania were transferred through Riga. Latvian radio and television worked day and night to broadcast throughout the time of the barricades.

Radio played an important part in life on the barricades. It was used to organize eating and sleeping arrangements, calling people together (e.g. students from the same university), for the various meetings. Artists were invited to entertain people. Foresters were asked to provide firewood for the bonfires that were widely used by the people manning the barricades. Food and drink was provided by a number of public institutions. Many well-wishers provided knit socks and gloves as well as refreshments. Places to sleep were often hard to find - schools were used where possible. Many people either slept at the barricades or went home. Some people experienced exacerbation of their health problems which was not helped by the winter climate, exhaustion and stress.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

First Aid points were set up with additional medical supplies and equipment, some were based on existing locations. Beds were installed in a number and had teams composed of doctors from local hospitals. Shifts were formed by daily routine - people who went to their job, studies or home were replaced by people who returned to the barricades after their daily duties. Most workers who had been on the barricades later received their usual salary regardless of if they had or had not been to work. Prime minister Ivars Godmanis regularly held meetings with commanders of individual barricades, the Popular Front also participated to discuss tactics. It was decided to enforce protection of the most important objectives by assigning militia to their defense. The supplies for the barricades were coordinated by the Popular Front. The individual barricades were organised by regions. Thus, people from Vidzeme were assigned to barricades overseen by the Vidzeme suburb chapter of the Popular Front. The pro-Soviet forces tried to infiltrate barricades for sabotage. Rumors were spread that attacks were planned.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

== Fighting ==
On 14 January, the Soviet military demanded that Latvian laws be repealed. The OMON attacked Brasa and Vecmilgrāvis bridges. 17 cars were burned during the day. On the night of 15 January the OMON twice attacked the Riga branch of the Minsk Militia Academy. Later that day 10,000 people gathered for an Interfront meeting, where an All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee declared that it was taking over power in Latvia. This announcement was broadcast in the Soviet media.

On 16 January, the supreme council organised MPs to stay overnight at the supreme council building to ensure a quorum in case of need. At 4:45 pm, in another attack on Vecmilgrāvis bridge, a driver for the Latvian Ministry of Transport, Roberts Mūrnieks was killed - becoming the first fatality at the barricades. Two other people were also injured. At 6:30 pm the OMON attacked Brasa bridge, injuring one person. Another bombing took place at 8:45 pm.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

On 17 January, the alarm was sounded at the Barricades, the strike committee of the Communist Party of Latvia declared that fascism was being reborn in Latvia. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR visited Riga. Upon its return to Moscow, the delegation reported that Latvia was in favour of the establishment of unlimited authority of the USSR president.

On 18 January the Supreme Soviet decided to form a national self-defense committee. The Popular Front withdrew its call to protect the barricades. 
[[File:Roberts Mūrnieks' funeral.jpg|thumb|250px|Roberts Mūrnieks' funeral]]
On 19 January, the funeral of Roberts Mūrnieks turned into a demonstration. That night the OMON arrested and beat up five members of a volunteer guard unit.

On 20 January, about 100,000 people gathered in Moscow to show their support for the Baltic states, calling on Soviet officials to resign in connection with the events in Vilnius. That evening turned out to be the deadliest at the Barricades after the OMON and other unidentified combat groups attacked the [[List of Ministers of the Interior of Latvia|Latvian Interior Ministry]]. Two policemen (Vladimirs Gomanovičs and Sergejs Konoņenko), a schoolboy (Edijs Riekstiņš), and a cameraman (a colleague of director [[Juris Podnieks]], Andris Slapiņš) were killed. Another cameraman, Gvido Zvaigzne, died later of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balticsww.com/keep_filming.htm Latvian Film Podnieks/Slapins&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Four Bauska policemen were injured, as were five participants of the barricades, a Hungarian journalist, and a Russian journalist. It was noted that the attackers also suffered casualties. After the battle, the OMON moved into the Latvian communist party building. By the 20 January, the government also urged the transfer of control of the barricades to government forces. This was seen by some as disaffection with the whole idea. This opinion was enforced when part of the barricades were demolished after the government took control of them.

On 21 January, the Supreme council called on youths to apply for a job in the [[Law enforcement in Latvia|Interior ministry system]]. Gorbunov left for Moscow to meet with Gorbachev to discuss the situation in Latvia. On 22 January, Pugo denied that he had ordered an attack on the interior ministry. Another person was killed on the barricades.

On 24 January, the Council of ministers established a public safety department to guard the barricades.

On 25 January, after the funeral of the 20 January victims, most defenders of the barricades went home.

== Aftermath and further developments==
The actual barricades remained on the streets of Riga for a long time; for example, those at the Supreme Council were removed only in the autumn of 1992.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt; In March partially in response to January events and partially because of upcoming [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|Soviet referendum on preservation of federation]], which Latvia intended to boycott, a  [[Latvian independence and democracy poll, 1991|poll on independence]] was held with 3/4 of participants voting in favor of independence. Latvia faced further attacks of Pro-Soviet forces later in 1991 - on 23 May, when OMON launched attack on five Latvian border posts and during the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]], when several strategic objectives guarded during the barricades were seized, with one civilian (driver Raimonds Salmiņš) killed by Soviet forces. The attempted coup prompted Latvian government, which originally had intended gradual secession from Soviet Union to declare full independence, which was recognized by Soviet Union on 6 September. The Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991.

== Responsibility ==
Major attacks were carried out by the OMON of Riga, however another combat unit was seen during the attack on the Ministry of Interior Affairs. It has been speculated that this unit was [[Alpha Group]] which had been seen in action during the attack on Vilnius.&lt;ref name="apollo"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with film director [[Juris Podnieks]], an OMON officer stated that originally it was planned to attack Riga, not Vilnius. At the last moment, a week before the attack on Vilnius, the plan was suddenly changed. He also claimed that the OMON of Rīga was so well prepared that there was no need for the Soviet military, which was present in Rīga at the time, to engage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

The OMON did not act on their own - after the Preses Nams was seized the OMON claimed that high officials of the Soviet government - [[Boris Pugo]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] knew about the attack, however both denied their involvement and the Supreme Council blamed the [[Communist Party of Latvia]]. In December before the events, the Popular Front, in its instructions for X hour, asserted that a coup was planned by the "[[Soyuz (faction)|Soyuz]]" group of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] MPs.&lt;ref name="x hour"/&gt;

[[Dimitry Yuzhkov]] admitted that the Soviet military was responsible for the first bombings, however no one claimed responsibility for the rest of the bombings, which the communist press blamed on Latvian nationalists.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; On the basis of these and subsequent events, several OMON officers were tried, although many of them were not convicted, the Communist Party of Latvia, Interfront, the All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee and a few related organizations were banned by parliament for the attempted coup d'état, and two leaders of CPL and ALPRC were tried for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Viktor Alksnis]] transplanted a large number of the Baltic OMON forces to the [[Transnistria]]n territory of Moldova in support of the separatist regime there, where [[Vladimir Antyufeyev]], commander of the Riga OMON forces, took on the role of Minister of Security initially under an assumed name (Vladimir Shevstov), a post he held until 2012.

'''Vasateatern''' or ''"Vasan"'' (in [[English language|English]]: ''The Vasa Theatre'') is a private [[theatre]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It is located at [[Vasagatan, Stockholm|Vasagatan]] 19–21 in central Stockholm.

It was built in 1886 and has for many years been [[Stockholm]]'s (and [[Sweden]]'s) main private theatre for [[comedy|comedies]] and [[farce]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In this genre it has a proud history: it was for many years (1895–1928) run by the legendary Swedish theatre manager [[Albert Ranft]] who in the early 20th century staged a large number of [[France|French]] and [[UK|British]] comedy plays. He had personal contact with many of the most popular European comedy playwrights at the time, including [[George Bernard Shaw]], and successfully had a great number of contemporary comedy plays translated and staged in Sweden at "Vasan". Plays such as [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]] (Mr Ernst)'', Shaw's ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]] (Man kan aldrig veta)'' and ''[[Major Barbara (play)|Major Barbara]]'', and ''[[Jack Straw (play)|Jack Straw]]'' by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]. Popular [[France|French]] playwrights at the theatre included [[Georges Feydeau]], [[Georges Berr]] and [[Nancy Rieux|Nancy]] &amp; [[Jean Rieux]]. Strindberg was also produced at the Vasateatern.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Michael. Editor. ''An International Annotated Bibliography of Strindberg Studies 1870–2005: The plays''.  MHRA (2008) {{ISBN|9780947623821}} (page 954)&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years it has produced most of the classic farces and comedies. Historic long-runners from the 1950s to the 1980s include ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'', the stage version of ''[[Cactus Flower (play)|Cactus Flower]]'' and ''[[The Spanish Fly (play)|The Spanish Fly]] (Die spanische Fliege)'', the popular 1914 German farce by [[Franz Arnold]] and [[Ernst Bach]].

Legendary [[Sweden|Swedish]] thespian [[Gösta Ekman (senior)]] is said to haunt the theatre at nights.&lt;ref&gt;http://shelf3d.com/i/G%C3%B6sta%20Ekman%20(senior)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre closed in 2009 in connection with an extensive renovation in the neighbourhood that was transformed into Scandic Grand Central Hotel. Large parts of the interior of the theatre was taken down while the auditorium was used as a dump during the construction. Parts of the theatre's former premises have been occupied by the hotel business. For example, the theatre cafe integrated with the hotel and converted into the bistro. After the property is sold by the developer Diligentia to Norwegian KLP Eiendom the plans for the theatre are unclear and the theatre operations remained dormant. Because of monument protection the location must be preserved. The beautiful auditorium is preserved, but as of 2012 there were no theatre shows in production.

[[Krister Henriksson]], the Swedish actor used to be the co-owner and Theatre Director.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Vasateatern]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fokus.se/2008/05/krister-henriksson-teaterdirektor/ |title=Krister Henriksson, teaterdirektör - Fokus |publisher=Fokus.se |date= |accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordstjernan.com/news/people/4475/ |title=People |publisher=Nordstjernan |date= |accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4519">The '''World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems''' (commonly known as the ITS World Congress) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Live technology showcase planned for 2017 World Congress | date = January 4, 2017 | url = http://www.its-ukreview.org/live-technology-showcase-planned-for-2017-world-congress/  | accessdate = March 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual conference and trade show to promote ITS technologies. [[ERTICO]] (ITS Europe), [[ITS America]], [[ITS AsiaPacific]] and [[ITS Japan]] are its sponsors. Each year the event takes place in a different region (Europe, Americas or Asia-Pacific). The 2017 World Congress will be held in Montreal, Canada from October 29 to November 2.

[[Intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) are advanced applications which, without embodying intelligence as such, aim to provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic management and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and 'smarter' use of transport networks. They are considered a part of the [[Internet of things]].

The '''World Sportscar Championship''' was the world series run for [[sports car racing]] by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] from 1953 to 1992.

The championship evolved from a small collection of the most important sportscar, [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]], and [[road racing]] events in Europe and North America with dozens of gentleman drivers at the grid, to a professional racing series where the world's largest automakers spent millions of dollars per year. The official name of the series changed throughout the years, however it has generally been known as the World Sportscar Championship from its inception in 1953.  The '''World Sportscar Championship''' was, with the Formula One World Championship, one of the two major world championships in circuit motor racing.

In 2012 the World Sportscar Championship was revived and renamed as the [[FIA World Endurance Championship|World Endurance Championship]].

==History==

=== 1953 to 1961 ===
In the early years, now legendary races such as the [[Mille Miglia]], [[Carrera Panamericana]] and [[Targa Florio]] were part of the calendar, alongside the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], the Tourist Trophy and Nurburgring 1000&amp;nbsp;km. Manufacturers such as [[Ferrari]], [[Maserati]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche]], and [[Aston Martin]] fielded entries, often featuring professional racing drivers with experience in [[Formula One]], but the majority of the fields were made up of gentleman drivers ([[Privateer (motorsport)|privateer]]s) in the likes of [[Nardi (carmaker)|Nardi]]s and [[Bandini Automobili|Bandini]]s. Cars were split into Sports Car and GT (production car) categories and were further divided into [[engine displacement]] classes. The Ferrari and Maserati works teams were fierce competitors throughout much of the decade, but although Maserati cars won many races the make never managed to clinch the World title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl|last=Ludvigsen|authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen|title=Red Hot Rivals: Epic Clashes for Supremacy|publisher=Haynes Publishing|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mercedes-Benz work team pulled out of the championship after 1955 due to their [[1955 Le Mans disaster|crash at Le Mans]], while the small Aston Martin factory team struggled to find success in 1957 and 1958 until it managed to win the championship in 1959. Notably absent from the overall results were the [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] works team, who did not enter any events other than Le Mans, despite the potential of the [[Jaguar C-Type|C-]] and [[Jaguar D-Type|D-Type]]s.

===1962 to 1965===

In 1962, the calendar was expanded to include smaller races, while the FIA shifted the focus to production based GT cars. The World Sportscar Championship title was discontinued, being replaced by the '''International Championship for GT Manufacturers'''. They group cars into three categories with specific engine sizes; less than one litre, less than two litres, and over two litres. [[Hillclimbing|Hillclimbs]], sprint races and smaller races expanded the championship, which now had about 15 races per season. The famous races like Le Mans still counted towards the prototype championship, however, the points valuation wasn't very tabular so the FIA returned to the original form of the championship with about 6 to 10 races.&lt;ref name=Krejci1&gt;{{cite web | title = World Sportscar Championship | work = World Sports Racing Prototypes | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc.html | first = Martin | last = Krejci |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221222225/http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc.html|archivedate=February 21, 2015|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1963 the three engine capacity classes remained but a prototype category was added. For 1965 the engine classes became for cars under 1300&amp;nbsp;cc (Class I), under 2000&amp;nbsp;cc (Class II), and over 2000&amp;nbsp;cc (Class III). Class III was designed to attract more American manufacturers, with no upper limit on engine displacement.&lt;ref name=Rogliatti&gt;{{citation | ref = AU66 | journal = Auto-Universum 1966 (English edition) | title = The G.T. manufacturers championship | last = Rogliatti | first = Gianni | editor-first = Arthur | editor-last = Logoz | date = 1965 | publisher = Verlag International Automobile Parade | location = Zürich, Switzerland | volume = IX | page = 45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1966 to 1981 ===
{{See also|European Sportscar Championship}}

[[File:Ferrari 330 P4 1967.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ferrari 330 P4 at "1000 km di Monza", 1967]]

The period between 1966 and 1971 was possibly the most successful era of the World Championship, with S (5 L sports cars ) and P (3 L prototypes) classes, and cars such as the [[Ferrari 512|Ferrari 512S]], [[Ferrari P|Ferrari 330 P4]], [[Ford GT40]], [[Lola T70]], [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]], [[Alfa Romeo Tipo 33|Alfa Romeo 33]], and [[Porsche]]'s [[Porsche 908|908]] and the [[Porsche 917|917]] battled for supremacy on classic circuits such as [[Sebring Raceway|Sebring]], [[Nürburgring]], [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]], [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], [[Targa Florio]], and [[Le Mans]], in what is now considered the Golden Age of sports car racing.

In 1972 the  [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] Prototype and  [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5]] Sports Car classes were both replaced by a new Group 5 Sports Car class. These cars were limited to 3.0&amp;nbsp;L engines by the FIA, and manufacturers gradually lost interest. The new Group 5 Sports Cars, together with Group 4 Grand Touring Cars, would contest the FIA's newly renamed '''World Championship for Makes''' from 1972 to 1975. From 1976 to 1981 the World Championship for Makes was open to [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5 Special Production Cars]] and other production based categories including [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4 Grand Touring cars]] and it was during this period that the nearly-invincible [[Porsche 935]] dominated the championship. Prototypes returned in 1976 as [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] cars with their own series, the '''World Championship for Sports Cars''', but this was to last only for two seasons (1976-1977). In 1981, the FIA instituted a drivers championship.

=== 1982 to 1992 ===
{{See also|European Endurance Championship}}
In 1982, the FIA attempted to counter a worrying climb in engine output of the Group 5 Special Production Cars by introducing [[Group C]], a new category for closed sports-prototypes (purpose built racing cars) that limited fuel consumption (the theory being that by limiting fuel consumption, engine regulations could be more relaxed).  While this change was unwelcome amongst some of the private teams, manufacturer support for the new regulations was immense. Several of the 'old guard' manufacturers returned to the WSC within the next two years, with each marque adding to the diversity of the series.  Under the new rules, it was theoretically possible for [[normally aspirated engine]]s to compete with the (expensive to maintain) [[forced induction]] engines that had dominated the series in the '70s and early '80s. In addition, most races ran for either 500 or 1000&amp;nbsp;km, usually going over three and six hours, respectively, so it was possible to emphasize the "endurance" aspect of the competition as well. [[Group B]] cars, which was a GT class, were also allowed to race, but entries in this class were sparse, and [[Group B]] cars disappeared from the series, with [[sports-prototype]]s dominating the championship.

[[File:956 Rothmans 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A works '''Rothmans Porsche 956''' at Silverstone]]

Porsche was the first constructor to join the series, with the [[Porsche 956|956]], but soon several other makes joined the series, including [[Jaguar Cars]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]], [[Mazda]] and [[Aston Martin]].  As costs increased, a C2 class (originally named C Junior) was created for privateer teams and small manufacturers, with greater limits to fuel consumption. In this lower class, most cars used either the [[BMW M1]] engine or the new [[Cosworth DFV#DFL|Cosworth DFL]], but, like in the main class, a variety of solutions were employed by each individual manufacturer. [[Alba Cars|Alba]], [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga]], [[Spice Engineering|Spice]] and [[Ecurie Ecosse]] were among the most competitive in this class.  While the Group C formula had brought manufacturers back to the sport, it was again Porsche - with its 956 &amp; 962 Group C line - that continued their domination of the sport.

For 1986, the World Endurance Championship became the '''World Sports-Prototype Championship'''.

Although the Group C formula was a success, with regular crowds of 50,000 to 70,000 at WSC events (a modern Grand Prix in Europe will have similar crowds), and upwards of 350,000 at the 24 hours of Le Mans,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} the [[FIA]] introduced new rules for 1991 at the behest of FIA vice president Bernie Ecclestone;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} 750&amp;nbsp;kg machines with contemporary normally aspirated engines, which were purpose-built 3500cc  racing units.  The new classification, known as '''Group C Category 1''', was designed to mandate Formula One engines. Although power was generally less than existing Group C cars (around 650 bhp compared to around 750 bhp upwards) the new cars are considered to be among the quickest sportscars ever. However, the take up of these new regulations was slow and only a handful of Category 1 cars were ready for the 1991 season. Consequently, the FIA also allowed cars complying with pre-1991 Group C rules to contest the championship (as '''Group C Category 2''' cars) during the one transitional year. They were however seriously handicapped in terms of weight, fuel allocation and grid positions. For 1991 the championship took on yet another new name, the '''FIA Sportscar World Championship''' and the new 3.5 litre rules took full effect for the 1992 championship with the old Group C cars no longer included.

===1993 demise===
The new generation of WSC racing engines, with the stated intent of cost reduction and improved competition, quickly proved highly suspect. Costs rose massively as works teams developed cars capable of qualifying around halfway up a Formula 1 grid, despite weighing some 200&amp;nbsp;kg more. Manufacturers again abandoned the sportscar series, realising they now had an engine suitable for F1. In particular, Mercedes and [[Peugeot]] elected to either concentrate on or move solely to F1. The more exotic engines were unaffordable for teams like Spice and [[ADA Engineering|ADA]], thus after the manufacturers left the top class of sportscar racing, the series essentially collapsed. A lack of entries meant the 1993 season was cancelled before the first race.

In 1994, the World Sportscar title would return, this time in the hands of the [[International Motor Sports Association]] in North America for use in the [[IMSA GT]] series.  The name would be used for the series' top class of prototypes until 1998 when the series ended.

In addition, 1994 also signaled the return of an international GT series after an absence of over a decade with the introduction of the [[BPR Global GT Series]]. The success of the series lead to a friendly takeover by the FIA in 1997, becoming the [[FIA GT Championship]]. Prototypes were mainly absent from European tracks (Le Mans being the sole notable exception) until 1997, which saw with the creation of the International Sports Racing Series which evolved into the short-lived [[FIA Sportscar Championship]] in 2001 until 2003.  Sports prototypes then came exclusively under the control of the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) and their sanctioned series, the [[American Le Mans Series]] in North America and the [[Le Mans Series]] in Europe.  The FIA's championship for GTs was eventually promoted to [[world championship]] status in [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship|2010]], while the ACO launched their own international championship, the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], the same year.

===2012 return===
{{main|FIA World Endurance Championship}}
Following the success of the ACO's [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] (ILMC), the FIA reached an agreement with the ACO to create a new [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] for 2012.  The series shares many elements of the ILMC, including the use of the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] as part of the series schedule.  The series continues to utilize the ACO's two primary classes, [[Le Mans Prototype]]s and [[Grand Tourer|GT Endurance]].  Championship titles are awarded for constructors and drivers in prototypes, while a constructors cup are awarded in the GTE categories.&lt;ref name="FIA WEC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | title = 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063434/http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/fiasport/2011/Pages/fia-wec.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIA WMSC"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | title = World Motor Sport Council | publisher = [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] | work = fia.com | date = 2011-06-03 | accessdate = 2011-06-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063414/http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2011/Pages/wmsc-030611.aspx | archivedate = 2011-06-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
